He grinned genially and waved his hand at them . He gave notice that they might expect something within a few minutes . Presently he appeared to beckon the reporters in . The cherubic-faced butler ground his teeth as he swung back the huge metal doors , but young Mr. Mizner appeared to be in a wonderfully good humor , although he had never seemed to be worried by the alleged repudiation of his marriage that came ant of the Fifth Avenue House by way of Chicago . " Boys , " he said , as he led them into an elaborately furnished little Japanese room to the right of the main hallway , " boys , I am afraid that Mrs. Yerkes-er  --  Mrs. Mizner  --  will not make any long formal statement about our marriage , but now that It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she or I could do . why , she wants to settle any doubts about the matter and stop further contradictory talking .

" Now , Mrs. Mizner has n't been entirely well for a couple of days , so that she is not dressed for receiving . But she will talk to you from the balcony overlooking this court . " The bridegroom then led the reporters out into the glass-inclosed court and made a little cuckoo call . Mrs. Mizner appeared on the little balcony dressed in a lavender kimono . She did n't look ill ; n fact , she appeared to be very well and ' . tery happy . Having excused herself for rot being more fitly dressed for a rscep lion , she called down : " Well , now , what must I say ? " " Help us straighten out this misunderstanding . " " Misunderstanding ? " repeated Mrs. Mizner . " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see any need for a formal statement . I was married , just as Mizner has told you  --  that 's all there is to it . And happily married , too . " Site smiled more broadly than ever at this , and , excusing herself . disappeared . Mrs. Mizner made her first talk on the balcony to reporters for the afternoon newspapers . Later , at the request of her husband , she made practically the same statement to others who appeared at the Fifth Avenue house to ask about the marriage . She said that she had hoped to keep the matter a secret a while , and that when some one asked her about it she denied it , believing that her denial would instantly settle the question , not knowing that it simply added more fuel to the fire , Speaking through her husband . she said that she was sorry she had made the denial , seeing that it had no chance of accomplishing what she had desired .

" Oh , but there is a perfect crowd of them , " objected the butler . " Show ' em in , " roared Mr. Mizner . They were shown in . Mr. Mizner took a great deal of pleasure viewing the rich picture galleries in the Yerkes house , and stopped to point out the masterpieces he thought best . Standing with the reporters before a huge oil painting showing a group of pages playing at dice , he said , laughingly , referring to the title : " We 'd say ' newsboys shootin ' crap , ' would n't we ? " Speaking laughingly of the final confirmation of his marriage , he stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : " Well , it 's all over , boys , except the cheering . " With regard to a dispatch from Denver raying that Miss Edith Carter of a wellknown Denver family of that name was about to bring breach-of-promise proceedings against him , Mr. Mizner answered seriously : " There is not a word of truth in the story . I will give $20.000 for a signed and I substantiated statement from any woman that I ever broke a promise to marry her . I do n't know who started this story . It was evidently started to hurt me . If I can find out who did put the malicious falsehood in motion I 'll bring suit against aim for damages immediately . The story does n't hurt me ; it may hurt Miss Carter , 1 with whom I am acquainted and whom I know to be a fine girl , " Mr. Mizner was asked yesterday after-1 noon what his wife 's plans concerning the Yerkes hospital were . " Oh , I do n't know . " he said . " Whatever plans there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The matter will remain in statu quo . " " Are you expecting an early visit from Louis S. Owsleyand Clarence E.

Mr. Owsley was formerly financial agent and secretary to Mr. Yerkes . Clarence E. Knight was his attorney , and is now interested in the execution of his will .
