The Ohio campaign has been opened in the good old-fashioned style . Voters of that State are to be asked to vote for a Republican candidate for Governor and for a Republican Legislature which will return Senator Hanna to the United States Senate , principally on the ground that by so doing they will " uphold the hands of President Roosevelt " and " sound the bugle call " for the Presidential campaign of 1904 . Few persons in Ohio , so far as we are aware , will venture to reply that the Governorship has nothing to do with national affairs , and that Senator Hanna 's attitude toward Mr. Roosevelt has not always been such as to render the reelection of the former an enthusiastic endorsement of the latter . Unfortunately , the Democrats of Ohio are in poor position to take advantage of their opponents ' choice of national rather than State issues in a State campaign . The Democratic convention did not consider its work complete until it adopted a resolution inviting Bryan to stump the State . " Tom " Johnson 's path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His friends assure us that his convention methods were honest and aboveboard , despite the popular belief to the contrary . But Mr. John L. Zimmer-man 's followers do not think so . They declare that Johnson threw out Zimmerman delegations regardless of all rules and precedents , and they feel so badly that they are not willing to aid the candidate in his campaign . Conservative Gold Democrats can not he got to support Mr. Johnson , either , and are preparing to take to the woods on election day  --  to their bitter regret , for they would gladly help to defeat Hanna 's hopes of a return to the Senate . Despite the visit of demagogue Bryan , the Ohio free silverites are not particularly happy because of the endorsement of a Gold Democrat for Senator . If Johnson is likely to make gains in the cities , there is , on the other hand , rising opposition to him among the farmers because of his single-tax views . Still , many Democrats and Republicans long for an end of Hanna 's domination . Speculation has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Clarkson as possibilities for the Chairmanship of the Republican National Committee . This , of course , on the supposition that Senator Hanna will retire . Either Quay or Clarkson would complishments in this line make Clarkson and even Quay seem like mere amateurs ? Edward J. Addicks of Delaware Addicks is under deep obligations to the Republican national organization , for Hanna and Quay have been his good friends ; he is an energetic campaigner ; he is the embodiment of those qualities that distinguish national chairmen . a heart of iron , a face of brass , and a hand full of gold . If Quay or Clarkson , why not Addicks ? President Roosevelt 's admirable declaration that he will not use his position to influence in any way any municipal election will have a good effect , not only upon the coming contest in New York , but upon municipal politics throughout the country . Publicists are generally agreed that one of the most potent causes of corruption in our city governments is the maintenance of party lines in purely local elections . If thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were forwarding the Democratic principles of tariff reform and abolition of class legislation , the complete destruction of Tammany would be a comparatively simple task . But in spite of Lewis Nixon 's warning that a voter may support Fusion this year and cast his ballot for a DemocraticPresident next year , hidebound Democrats cling to the theory that Murphy , Sullivan . Grady , and Finn are the precious vessels in which the saving truths of Democracy are preserved . President Roosevelt has done all in his power to commit the Republicans to the idea of non-partisanship in city elections We hope for an equally explicit and stimulating utterance from Gov . Odell . He can help the cause of Fusion in New York in no way so much as by making it plain that the fortunes of the State Republican machine are not bound up with Mayor Low 's reelection ; by avoiding not only interference , but even the appearance of meddling . President Roosevelt should in consistency take one more step  --  withdraw the McClelland appointment . He has unwarrantably thrust his hand into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platt there by nominating Senator McClelland for the Board of General Appraisers . If Capt . Mahan or George Haven Putnam should be nominated for Alderman Columbia University and Professor Seligman of the same institution . With such men to choose from , the friends of good government can not go wrong . This is a case where each of the gentlemen named would prefer that another than himself should be chosen for the office  --  a case where the office seeks the man , not the man the office . The city of Chicago has led the way to a high sense of duty in the choice of a city legislature , and she is now reaping her reward in the feeling of absolute security and trust in her Board of Aldermen . It was supposed , or rather hoped , that New York had achieved a similar blessing two years ago , but when the Pennsylvania tunnel project came before the Aldermen she found reason to doubt . That enterprise , although sanctioned by all the higher city authorities and by public opinion , was " held up " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How these objections were overcome has never been revealed , but the fact that they existed at all , and that they blocked the way of a needed public improvement , was a disagreeable surprise . Chi- cago has no " hold-ups " of this kind , and no " let-goes " that can not be satisfactorily explained . The indictment of a State Senator on the serious charge of bribery and conspiracy must bring with it a sense of humiliation and shame to every citizen of the State . Fifty men make up the higher branch of a Legislature which is law-giver to more than 7,000,000 persons . Senator Green , who was arrested on a Federal warrant on Saturday , is not only one of the fifty ; he is also a member of the majority party in that body , and a person of influence , closely associated with the Chairman of the Republican State Committee , Col. Dunn . In other words , one of the leading officials and most influential Republicans of the State has been charged with bribery and conspiracy by a Federal grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recording Company . As such , he is alleged to have paid bribes to George W. Beavers , the Post-Office Department official who is under indictment . The two men are also charged with conspiracy in the sale of time recorders to Government officials . Mr. Green ' has given out a statement in which he denies the charges . He very properly announces his ' retirement from the chairmanship of his part5Y organization in Broome County . We can , of course , make no comment on the probable outcome of the proceedings . Chicago " hustle " has already invited Mr. Chamberlain to address the Illinois manufacturers on the crippling of their trade through his retaliatory duties ; and doubtless , such is the artless enthusiasm of our nation , many other organizations from Tammany Hall to the Epworth League , will hasten not to get left by Chicago . But Mr. Chamberlain really can not be turned over to Major Pond 's successor until the secret of the fiscal scheme is out . That duty he owes to his countrymen Revelation would not now embarrass the Ministry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what duties he desires Parliament to impose , and precisely the preferential tariffs which he means to advocate as between the mother country and the colonies . The period of inquiry is finished , and he can not go before the country on a vague principle of Imperial solidarity . A blind taxation pool , such as Mr. Chamberlain has been promoting since last - May , can not long retain its allurements for the sturdy British voter But , most of all , Mr. Chamberlain owes a full and complete explanation of the fiscal plan to Mr. Balfour . The author of ' Philosophic Doubt ' should not be allowed to break his political shins over the Chamberlain stumbling-block without at least having the opportunity of examining the obstacle philosophically . The Washington Central Labor Union has requested all central unions throughout the country to petition the ' President for the removal of W. A. Miller , the Government Printing-Office foreman . Their solemn resolutions reveal once more the megalomania from which trades unions everywhere are suffering , for they liken themselves and their cause to the thirteen original States which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be truly thankful that they do not openly insist upon that superiority to the Federal Government which the oath of the typographical union indicates . The Washington union is trying to make Mr. Roosevelt understand that he is its servant , and that he must take its view of the Miller case under threat of political punishment . His just treatment of the foreman they dub an " unfriendly act , " and they call upon him to discharge Miller forthwith . The test which the President may thus have to face is a severe one , but one which your true statesman and your strong servant of the people can not flinch from , whatever the cost . Mr. Roosevelt understands so clearly and has expounded so frequently the baneful influence of the craven and the weakling among us that he must welcome this chance to practise what he preaches . Having done what is right , we have no more fear that he will allow himself to be terrorized by the labor vote than that he will be moved to do injustice to the negro by the criticisms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union has written itself down for Samuel J. Parks . The conservative members who tried to rescue it last week were soundly defeated by the followers of Parks , and have given up the fight . As a result , the local delegation has gone to the Kansas City Convention backing Parks for the international presidency . The plain meaning of the incident is that there are not enough honest men in the union to make a successful stand for decency , Parks , the blackmailer , has captured the union bag and baggage . If it were possible for the union still to have a standing among sober and responsible employers of labor after Parks 's career of extortion , that possibility has been destroyed . It is difficult to conceive of any basis upon which a building contractor can now deal with this organization of the house-smiths and bridgemen ; he can not trust the word of - the accredited leader , he knows that the rank and file have no honor to lose by violation of agreements The union can not expect public or private consideration when it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monk Eastman gang " that terrorized the East Side of the city on Tuesday week . The relations between capital and organized labor in the hat-making industry at Danbury , Conn. , which have attracted attention from all parts , of the Country since the strike of 1893 , have lately entered a new stage . It appears that the members of the Hatters ' Union , which has been persecuting the firm of D. E Loewe &; Co with a boycott since last March , have been very much disturbed by the bringing of lawsuits against them and the levying of attachments on their property at the instance of the boycotted firm . D. E. Loewe &; Co. had refused to discharge non-union men from their employ . The union had accordingly sent notices to all dealers in hats directing them not to buy those manufactured by Loewe &; Co , under penalty of being themselves boycotted , and had in other ways curtailed the firm 's sales - and injured their trade . Many members of the union in Danbury own the houses in which they live . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work more than two or three days in the week . They are enjoying a well-earned rest . Their condition is such as all Americans must contemplate with pride and satisfaction . Naturally , they do not bother their heads much with ' the doings of the union . The leaders , the business men , the walking delegates , conduct their operations mostly in secret . Their plans are not divulged even to their followers , and the latter do not desire that . they should be . So long as the results are satisfactory they do not concern themselves with methods . This is human nature . The stockholders of the New York Central Railroad do the same . These men have been startled by attachments levied upon their property at the instance of Loewe &; Co , who have sued them under the State law for damage to their property and business resulting from the boycott , which they affirmis a  --  unlawful conspiracy . Action has also been brought against the same parties under the Sherman Anti-Trust act  --  the same under which an action was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a disagreeable surprise to the property-holding members of the Hatters ' Union . It operates as a cloud upon their titles , which nobody likes to have . Even if they have considerable confidence that it will lie eventually cleaied off , it causes uneasiness . Nobody knows what view of the subject the court of last resort may take The police courts are daily furnishing us with examples of what labor-union tyranny may mean to the worker who has not had a share of the " graft . " For the second or third time within ten days there was a case on Thursday of a man beihg brought before a Magistrate charged with larceny committed in order to keep his wife and children from starving . Thomas Gowan was the offender  --  a well-recommended driver employed by a firm of coal-dealers The union ordered him to strike on Labor Day because the firm would not give its men a holiday Unable to obtain work , he went to his home to find his wife and children suffering for want of food . In his despair he stole a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When ordered to strike he had but $4.12 . The heartless union forced him to spend $4 of this for a cap , a belt , and a cane , With which to parade on Labor Day . We are informed that there is a great amount of similar destitution in this city  --  but not among the Parkses , the walking delegates , and the leaders . Truly there is no crime which may not be committed and no suffering among innocent women and children which may not be caused in the name of Labor . An exhibit that attracted much attention at the National Irrigation Congress held last week at Ogden , Utah , was a model irrigated farm of twenty acres A praiseworthy desire to illustrate practically the methods of irrigation , and to show the results of a wise use of ditches , led the State to set aside a tract of land used by one of its institutions , and on this model farm a complete system of canals and laterals has been contracted . All the modern machinery for measuring water and controlling it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on irrigated land are growing there , as well as most kinds of early fall fruit Practical irrigators piloted delegates and visitors over the model farm , explaining in detail the processes of ditching and the proper application of water . This was an admirable experiment for bringing to the visitor whose knowledge of the subject was vague and theoretical a vivid illustration of what irrigation means to the arid West . Upon this point one need not fully accept Mr. Roosevelt 's enthusiastic view , as expressed to the Congress last week , that the passage of the National Irrigation bill was one of the greatest steps forward in the " progress of all mankind , " to realize what great possibilities the movement holds in store The President wisely called attention to the fact that forestry and irrigation should go hand in hand . It would be well if the delegates could also have ' an object lesson at hand to convince them visually as to the pressing truth of this statement . Mr. Justice Brewer 's suggestion that the right of appeal be abolished in clam , inal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the country , as well as of the public in general . IL has , nevertheless , performed an excellent service in sharply calling attention to the evils of undue delays in the execution of criminal judgments , caused by merely dilatory appeals . This subject is discussed in an article in a current number of the New York Law Jourual , especially in its relation to outbreaks of mob violence . Two excellent reforms are suggested in this article : First , that by every legitimate means the possibility of delaying the execution of criminal judgments by means of frivolous appeals be curtailed , and , second , that the special favoritism toward criminal defendants , traditional in American procedure , be discontinued . The writer cites a number of cases in which the Court of Appeals of this State has exhibited an inclination to further both of these ends . Power to override mere technical exceptions , and to sustain a verdict clearly based on sufficient evidence , though legal errors of an immaterial nature occurred at the trial , is granted in the Code of Civil Procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conklin , the Court of Appeals , in a unanimous decision , administered the policy of that statute against the defendant . The decision of the Philippines Government to collect duties on military supplies sent thither by the United States Government may be correct in point of law . Almost anything may be done an , der the decision of the Supreme Court in. the Insular Cases , which decision , Mr. Dooley said , " was rendered by Mr. Justice Brown , eight judges dissenting . " It may be defensible in other aspects also , although it seems odd that Uncle Sam should incur heavy expense to maintain his army and navy in the Philippines and then pay duties on the articles he buys for their support However that may he , we trust that the Bureau of Statistics , in its future statements of the growth of our commerce with the islands , will separate the military and naval supplies from our other exports to them . It will be easy to do so after the practice of paying duties begins , since that will be an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a separate item The reason assigned for levying the duties is the familiar one based upon protection to home industry The Manila merchants can not sell their goods to our soldiers and sailors if they ha4e to compete with free importations by the Government . That is an argument which the American Protective Tariff League will be prepared to maintain before any tribunal here or elsewhere . At a manufacturers ' convention at Toronto on Thursday , Mr. Birge , the presiding officer , affirmed that - American manufacturers not only sold their goods 10 to 40 per cent , cheaper to Canadians than to their - own people , but that they shipped goods partly or wholly finished to Canada , by way of England , in order to take advantage of the preferential duties which Canada grants the mother country . As to the former charge , - we presume that nobody on our side of the line would take pains to deny it . Such things are done all the time . The process is called " dumping . " We fix our tariff so high that the foreigner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we have more of any particular goods than the home market can take , we use any dumping ground that we cau see . As Canada is the nearest , we use that in preference to any other . It is quite likely , too , that some American goods reach Canada by way of England in order to take advantage of the lower duties ; but what reason has Mr. Birge for imputing that heinous offence exclusively to us ? Does not the English merchant also perceive that source of gain ? What is to prevent him from coming into our market and buying any goods that are ready for dumping , and then sending them to Canada via England ? If it is worth while for the American to do this , it is worth while for the Englishman , and is equally lawful , defensible , and proper . Mr. Birge suggested a higher tariff in Canada to meet both of the evils mentioned . He had not then heard of the grand crash of Mr. Chamberlain 's scheme for preferential duties in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferential duties altogether . The news that the Macedonian revolt has really spread to Melnik is of very considerable significance , since the scene of the new outbreak , which was rumored two weeks ago , is directly on the main line of communication from Sofia into Macedonia . Apparently , the Turks have dispersed the insurgent bands in the Monastir region , and the refugees have succeeded in starting a fresh revolt beyond the Struma River . Here , in the Rhodope mountains , the insurgents have the best kind of country in which to keep up their guerrilla warfare , and are near enough to Bulgaria to draw supplies and to keep in close touch with their Bulgarian sympathizers . Whether the London Times 's estimate of 10,000 fighting men in Melnik and Demir-Hissar is correct or not , there can be no doubt of the seriousness of this new turn which the uprising has taken With fighting going on so close at hand , it will be more difficult than ever to hold back the Bulgarians and their rulers . The transfer of base seems , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation at the very moment when Bulgaria must come to a decision . If the plunge into war is to be taken , this is the hour .
