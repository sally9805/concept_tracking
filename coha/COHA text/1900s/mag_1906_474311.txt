AS a devout lover of Charles Dickens and all his works I was extreme-ly gratified during the past sum-mer in being able to take many long journeys by foot and coach in Switzer-land over roads and passes that he knew so well and so delightfully described in certain private letters at the time , which have never been printed , and which T now have the privilege of making public . Charles Dickens loved Switzerland . It was his refuge in his hunt for happiness and health ; it was his haven when he had the printers after him for " copy . " In Geneva , Lausanne , Vevey , and else-where along the RhOne Valley in many of the pretty Swiss villages , in the comfort of one of the characteristic inns for a night , he did some of his most effective writing . It was in Switzerland that he wrote The Battle of Life and Dombey and Son , and much of David Copper/geld and Bleak House , and thought of much more that subsequently entered into his immortal work . If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dedloek , for it was there that he formulated her character through suggestive conditions . It was there that Dickens had the beginnings of many corollaries in the friendships that controlled much of his future life . The villa Rosemont was his summer residence first in 184fi . The room in which he did his writing occupied the two centre windows of the balcony , and as he sat there and wrote , his eyes often rested in a transport of admiration on the wonderful hues of Lake Geneva and the mountains of Savoy . It was there he first met the Hon. Richard and Mrs. Watson of Rockingham Castle , England , and M. de Cerjat , with whom he corresponded during the rest of their mutual lives , and also Mr. Haldimand . It was to Mr. and Mrs. Watson that he dedicated his own favorite book , David Copperfield , and it is with his copious flow of letters to them that I have now to do ? a correspondence full of the utmost human feeling in its most triumphant moods . These priceless documents of unaffected genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever read , were confided to me by the Baroness von Roeder , the daughter of Mrs. Watson , and whose birth and youth were objects of much solicitude to Dickens . I felt it indeed a privilege to be permitted the acquaintance of this charming woman at her summer home in Interlaken , and to hear from her lips the interesting details concerning his every-day life . " It was a most remarkable friendship that sprang up between Mr. Dickens and my father and mother , " said the Baroness , " and these letters show but a small part of it . It was wonderful that he had the time and the patience to attend to the private correspondence that he did , and he filled it so full of passing detail and serious observation that one wonders that he could have afforded the expenditure of so Vot. our ? No. 671. -9 9 much valuable material . He appeared to be much broken by my father 's death , hut after it he kept up his letter-writing with my mother with the same bubbling-over thoughts and rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the time of his death , but I have a splendid memory of the man ? of his combination of tenderness and ruggedness , and his af-fectionate nature , that showed itself in his communication with men and women alike . In his family he was companionable . He loved to write books and letters and to read before an audience and to act on the stage , as every one knows , but few could comprehend how much of a passion all this amounted to . Yet his ideas of home life were full of extraordinary sentiment ; he had the most happy thoughts of the coziness of the fireside ? he I i ked to contemplate it and meditate before it , and in pleasant mental arraignment of his friends it was always in the glamour of a fireside circle . He was moderate in his eating and drinking , but to hear him speak of plum pudding or of a glass of mulled wine was enough to make one 's mouth water ? you remember the famous ' Plum Pudding ' edition of his books ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly twenty years , beginning after the Lausanne summer in 1846 , the first communication from Dickens being a recipe for a summer drink which he christened " Moonbeams , " and I give space to it here as a valuable addition to a book of recipes entirely made up front the devices of famous men , to be headed by Thackeray 's " Bouillabaisse . " TO MAKE MOONBEAMS , FOR SUMMER DRINKING . Pour into a jug in this proportion : Two wine glasses of Madeira Two thirds of a wine glass of brandy Four wine glasses of water . Add the peel of a small lemon , cut very thin sweeten to taste ? plunge into the whole a brown toast grate a little nutmeg over the surface ? tie a cloth over the jug ? and stand it in a cool place , or in cold water until you are ready to drink the contents . C. I ) . I have written it in the shape that Dickens wrote it ? arrangement of the lines and ptuictuations and dashes . In 1849 , December 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in speaking of a recent visit to Rockingham Castle : We had a most delightful time at Watson 's ( for both of them we have preserved and strengthened a real affection ) , and were the gayest of the gay . There was a Miss Boyle staying in the house , who is an excellent amateur actress , and she and I got up some scenes from the School for Scandal " and from " Nickleby with immense success . We played in the old hall , with the audience filled up and overrunning with servants . The entertainments concluded with feats of legerdemain for the performance of which I have a pretty good apparatus collected at divers limes and in divers places ) , and we then fell to country dances of a most frantic description , and danced all night . Watson and I have some fifty times registered a vow ( like O'Connel ) to conic to Lausanne together , and have even settled in what month and week . Something or other has always interposed to prevent us ; but I hope , please God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors Copperfieldian shall have terminated . On July 3 , 1850 , Dickens wrote from Devonshire Terrace to the Watsons : I am in a very despondent state of mind over Peel 's death . He was a man of mark , who Ns o uid be ill-spared from the great Dust Heap down at Westminster . When I think of the joy of the D'Israelis , Richmond and other Imposters ; and Humbugs I think of flying to Australia and taking to the bush . What do you think of entering into the scheme , asking Haldimand to join us , and founding a settlement to be called the Paradox ? Every bne is cheering David on , and I hope to make your book a good one . like it very much myself ? thoroughly believe it all and go to the work every month with an energy of the finest description . " James . No doubt a much lower art will serve for the handling of such a subject in fiction , than for a launch on the sea of imagination without such a powerful hark ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . There is a certain St. Clair , a New Orleans gentleman , who seems to me to be conceived with great power and originality . If he had not a Grecian outline of face , which I began to be a little tired of in him in earliest infancy , I should think him unexceptionable . He has a sister too , a maiden lady from New England , in whose person the besetting weakness and prejudices of the Abolitionists themselves , on the subject of the blacks , are set forth in the liveliest and truest colors and with the greatest boldness . She I mean Mrs. Stowe ) is a leetle unscrupulous in the appropriatin ' way . I seem to see a writer with whom I am very intimate and whom nobody can possibly admire more than myself ) peeping very often through the thinness of the paper . Further I descry the ghost of Mary Barton , and the very palpable mirage of a scene in the children of the mist ; but in spite of this I consider the book a fine one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its reputation . In 1853 Dickens was very hard at work on Blqak , Rowe . The subject of it had entered his mind during that summer in Lausanne , and Mrs. Watson was the original of Lady Dedlock in outward drawing , as was her home , Rockingham Castle , the original of Chesney Wold . He wrote to her from the Villa do Moulineaux , Boulogne , on August 27 , on the subject , saying : " Lowestoft I know , by walking over there from Yarmouth , when I went down on an exploring expedition , previous to Copperfield . ' It is a fine place . I saw the Dame Blunderstone ' on a direction-post between it and Yarmouth , and took it from the said direction-post for the book . In some of the descriptions of Chesney Wold , I have taken many bits , chiefly about trees and shadows , from observations made at Rockingham . I wonder whether you have ever thought so ! " Now as to the " Skimpole " talk of the time . It is well known in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quondam friend Leigh Hunt in that character . I will not say hero that I have discovered in the Watson letters any verification of that . On September 25 , 1853 , Dickens wrote to Mrs. Watson from Boulogne : Skimpole . I must riot forget Skimpoleof whom I will proceed to speak as if had only read him and not written him . I suppose he is the most exact portrait that was ever painted in words ! I have very seldom , if ever , done such a thing . But the likeness is astonishing . I do n't think it could possibly he more like himself . It is so awfully true that I make a bargain with myself Saturday Twenty-Sixth October 1E350 . My Dear Mrs. Watson . As Copperfield is your book , you know , it has occurred to ma that you might possibly like to see the end of it before the rest of the world does . Being in town to-day , I send you the sheets of the conclusion . Will you and Watson ( to whom my love ) kindly keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have several verbal errors in them , I dare say . We return to town on Monday evening for good . I am going to meet Kate and Ceorgina at Tunbridge Wells this afternoon , on my way home . Believe me , dear Mrs. Watson , Very faithfully yours Charles Dickens . " never to do so any more . " There is not an atom of exaggeration or suppression . It is an absolute reproduction of a real man . Of course l have been careful to keep the outward figure away from the fact ; but in all else it is the life itself . The summer of 1853 was spent in Boulogne , as I have said , at an old ch ? teau that he had heard of , and leased from its Switzerland owner . He described it as " a queer old French place , but extremely well supplied with all table and other conveniences . . . standing in the middle of a great garden surrounded by flowers . " It was on the Rue Beaurepaire , on a green hillside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and successive summers at Boulogne that he worked on Bleak House and Little Dorrii . In a letter to Mrs. Watson from Folkestone he tells her that the name first proposed for the latter story was " Nobody 's Fault . " In 1854 Mr. Dickens left the old ch ? teau in Boulogne and rented the Villa du Camp de Droite of the same landlord . M. Beau-court . It was on the top of a still higher hill , and it was there that he began Hard Times . In the summer of 1856 , however , Dickens returned to the Villa Moulineaux . Tn the letter , of which the first page is printed here in facsimile , the large flourish to the signature was carefully preserved as it really was up to the time of his death . He frequently joked about it in his letters . On one occasion he wrote to Mrs. Watson : " P. S. - -I am in such an incapable state , that after executing the foregoing usual flourish I swooned , and remained for some time insensible . Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consciousness ! ! ! " At another time : " P. 5. - 11 find I am not equal to the flourish . " In much of his correspondence with the Watsons I find frequent and insistent reference to Switzerland ? especially to Lausanne and take Lehman . Of the latter he wrote : " It runs with a spring tide , that will always flow and never ebb , through my memory ; and nothing less than the waters of Lethe shall confuse the music of its running until it loses itself in that great sea , for which all the currents of our life are desperately bent . " He painted it in many of his books ; if not so as every dog could read it , there were many indications of the Alpine atmosphere perfectly apparent to his friends . He loved it greatly in retrospection ? Mont Blanc , St. Bernard , the Wetterhor n , J n ngfra u , M6nch , and Eiger ; and above all , the Matterhorn in its lonely majesty theatrical almost in its impassiveness and dramatically significant in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quiet rest of their valleys , that he said often daunted him compared to the reality of a stirring life .
