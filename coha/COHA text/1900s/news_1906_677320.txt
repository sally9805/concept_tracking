txt J. Ogden Armour , head of the Chicago Packing firm , accompanied by Mrs. Armour and their daughter Lolita , who has been under the care of Prof. Lorenz in Vienna , arrived here yesterday afternoon on the Kronprinz Wilhelm , hastening back to Chicago . " If what has been said of our business were true , " said Mr. Armour when asked about the Fackingtown. exposures , " we would have beaten Barnum for forty years past . I doubt that I or my colleagues have the ability to fool the American public as long as that " Mr. Armour-said at the pier that the packers would welcome " any good inspection law . " In fact , they had tried every year to improve their facilities and make improvements ... Then he expressed surprise at the heavy fines inflicted on packers for rebating . Charges All " Sensational . " From the pier the Armours went to the St. Regis Hotel , and there last evening Mr. Armour gave out a formal typewritten statement embodying his views on the meat situation , and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared himself in favor of inspection , " as provided for by the bill now in Congress so far as it is feasible . " He went on to say that the European countries are wondering why the United States Government is Impugning one of its principal industries . He characterized the agitation over conditions in Packingtown as " ridiculous sensationalism , " the Neill-Reynolds report as " unfair , " and Upton Sinclair 's book , " The Jungle , " as the product of " an idea in the brain ' of some person who wanted to write a sensational book . " " I am In favor of inspection within reasonable bounds , " Mr. Armour said . " Do not mistake my meaning . There is danger that the inspection would involve so much red tape , which somebody would have to pay for , as to be useless . I would not have this inspection . But I favor reasonable inspection . It is to the interests of the packers to do so . It Is for our good to sell the best goods we possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has hurt our industry at home , but not as much as is generally supposed . Abroad It has done us much harm . European countries are wondering why our Government is thus crippling its meat industry . and foreign packers have not been slow in telling their people not to purchase American goods . The harm that can be done in a minute may take a long time to correct . " Or Else " Ridiculous . " Mr. Armour was asked what he thought of " The Jungle " and some of the charges contained in it , particularly as to the " speeding-up " system , whereby highly skilled workmen were employed to set the pace for underpaid workmen , with the result that when the workers have had all their vitality sapped up they are cast away like squeezed lemons . " I do not care to discuss the book , " he said " Yes , I have read ite-that is , partly . That charge about speeding workers is ridiculous . " He was asked if the Neill-Reynolds report was also ridiculous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unfair . It does not deal with facts . The charges brought against the packers in i , . are not true . It is not fair to assume that because a man can steal he is going to steal , and it Is not fair to assume that the packing louses are not in good condition because a ridiculous agitator says so . " Referring to the cost of inspection , Mr. Armour said : " There is no reason why the Government should saddle upon the meat industry the cost of inspection , any more than it would upon any other industry . The cost should be maintained by the General Government . " Here is his prepared statement : Mr. Armour 's Formal Statement . " On summing up what has been sale about ' the packers and what has been done to the packing industry , one naturally inquires : What has become of our boasted American fair play ? One of the largest American industries has been attacked . and attacked without reason , in a way that has discredited American goods of all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boycott on American products . " The entire export trade of this country has been badly damaged . To estimate the total loss now- would be merely guesswork . It may run into hundreds of millions . When American industries are slandered by persons who pretnd to speak as Americans it is to be expected that foreign competitors will take advantage of it . " But the American meat industry can not be destroyed by Socialist agitators , political revolutionists , stump speeches , er sensational journalism running amuck . It has exited for forty years . Its products have made their way into every quarter of the earth on - merit , They speak for themselves . They are as good to-day as they were yesterday . If they can be improved . they will be better tomorrow . Slander may retard but it can not stop good merchandise from finding a market . Ignorance or Malice . " The public has been Ignorantly or maliciously misinformed on two of the most Important phases of the whole question , namely , the character of meat inspection , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packers toward proposed legislation . " The inspection now in force in all the larger packing houses makes the sale of diseased meats from such houses impossible . The Government , which is responsible for the inspection , has failed to state the facts about it . The large packers believe in Government inspection . They asked for it in the first place . They want it continued and improved , if it can be improved . " Armour &; Co. will give any meat inspection law that may be passed our heartiest co-operation and support . Armour &; Co. have not at any time opposed legislation to improve meat inspection or ! to extend it . I believe this can be said , too , of all the other large packing concerns . I have taken this position from the first . My representatives in Chicago have known this and have acted accordingly . Certain minor features of the proposed legislation , as first presented , were objectionable . They were apparently put into the bill by persons who had no knowledge of or regard for the practical side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe , all the large packers , are heartily in favor of the purposes which the pending bill is intended to accomplish , namely : " Thorough inspection of all animals before slaughter . " Thorough inspection of all animals after slaughter . " Thorough inspection of the sanitary condition of packing houses . " Thorough inspection of the products that go to the consumer in forms other than in bulk . Every Pound Is Inspected . " We are able to say with exact truth that every pound of meat in our plants , for local use as well as for export , is inspected and passed in accordance with the full regulations of the Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Animal Industry . Unprejudiced meth and scientists who have exact knowledge will agree that these regulations are the strictest in the world . Every day carcasses and meats that would be passed for food in Germany and other foreign countries are condemned in our houses and converted into grease and fertilizer . " I have seen it stated that these ccandalous attacks upon the ' American meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to proposed legislation . That is not true and could not be true . My information is and the newspaper files will bear me out , that the flood of slander was well started before a suggestion of legislation was heard . We never heard of the so-called Beveridge amendment until it was introduced . Everything provided for in the proposed legislation could have been accomplished without any of the damaging sensationalism we have had if the co-operation of the packers had been desired or had been accepted when proffered . As the report to the National Association of Manufacturers which I have just read well puts it , the purpose of the ' reformers ' seems to have been to kill the industry first and then reform it . Our Excellent Canned Meats .. " There is some satisfaction in the way users of Chicago meats , especially canned meats , are now testifying to their quality in the face of what has been said . San Francisco would have starved to death after the earthquake and fire if Chicago canned meats were not at hand , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's history . English army commissary officers and inspectors are giving similar testimony . It is gratifying that developments are proving the unfair character of the NeillReynolds report . " I am personally much gratified by the way these subsequent developments bear on Armour &; Co . The comment of the Mohler-Steddom committee , of United States Agricultural Department experts , and the report by the Chicago Health Department show that our plant , as a whole , is clean and , sanitary . It ought to be . We have always tried to keep it so . We were doing it before this agitation was dreamed of . For five years or more we have spent an average of more than $700,009 a year on new buildings and improvements in our Chicago plant alone . " A dirty kitchen is always an extravagant kitchen . Considerations of economy alone would have made us keep clean . The business of Armour &; Co. , and the other large packing concerns never could have been built on the poor business meth-ods and bad practices now attributed to us . I am. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business world . It is especially gratifying , therefore , that sober inquiry is demonstrating that our methods and our products are worthy of the name .
