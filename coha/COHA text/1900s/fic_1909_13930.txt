A large old-fashioned room in MATTHEW BEELER 'S farm-house , near a small town in the Middle West . The room is used for dining and for general living purposes . It suggests , in architecture and furnishings , a past of considerable prosperity , which has now given place to more humble living . The house is , in fact , the ancestral home of MR . BEELER 'S wife , MARY , born Beardsley , a family of the local farming aristocracy , now decayed . At the rear is a large double window , set in a broad alcove . To the right of the window is the entrance door , which opens upon the side yard , showing bushes , trees , and farm buildings In the right wall of the room a door and covered stairway lead to the upper story . Farther forward is a wall cupboard , and a door leading into the kitchen . Opposite this cupboard in the left-hand wall of the room , is a mantel-piece and grate ; farther back a double door , leading to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen ) , one belonging to MR. and MRS . BEELER , the other to RHODA WILLIAMS , a niece of MRS . BEELER , child of her dead sister . The room contains , among other articles of furniture , a dining table ( with detachable leaves to reduce its bulk when not in use for eating purposes ) , an invalid 's wheel-chair , a low sofa of generous size , and a book-shelf , upon which are arranged the scientific books which MR . BEELER takes a somewhat untutored but genuine delight in . Tacked upon the wall near by are portraits of scientific men , Darwin and Spencer conspicuous among them , cut from periodicals . Other pictures , including family daguerreotypes and photographs , are variously distributed about the walls . Over the mantel shelf hangs a large map of the United States and Mexico , faded and fly-specked . As the curtain rises , the room is dark , except for a dull fire in the grate . The ticking of the clock is heard ; it strikes six . MARTHA BEELER , a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted lamp . She wears a shawl over her shoulders , a print dress , and a kitchen apron . She places the lamp on the table , which is set for breakfast , and puts coal on the grate , which soon flames more brightly . She goes into the hall and is heard knocking and calling . MARTHA Rhody ! Rhody ! ( MATTHEW BEELER , a man of fifty , enters . He is not quite dressed , but finishes as he comes in . MARTHA follows him . ) Where 's that niece of yours got to now ? p. 3 MATTHEW She 's helping Mary dress . MARTHA What in time 's Mary gettin ' up for ? She 's only in the way till the work 's done . MATTHEW She 's restless . MARTHA ( Significantly . ) I should n't wonder . ( Pause . ) I hope you know why Mary did n't sleep . MATTHEW ( Evasively . ) She 's always been a light sleeper , since she got her stroke . MARTHA Look here , Mat Beeler ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! You know why your wife did n't sleep last night . MATTHEW May be I do , Sis . ( Points to the ceiling . ) Is he up yet ? MARTHA Up ! I do n't believe he 's been abed . ( They listen , as to the tread of some one on the floor above . ) Back and forth , like a tiger in a cage ! MATTHEW ( Shrugs . ) Queer customer . MARTHA Yes . ( Imitates him . ) " Queer customer , " that 's you . But come to doin ' anything about it ! MATTHEW Give me time , Sis , give me time ! p. 4 MARTHA How much time do you want ? He 's been in this house since Wednesday night , and this is Saturday morning . MATTHEW Well , he 's payin ' his board , ai n't he ? ( At window , rolls up curtain . ) Goin ' to have just such another day as yesterday . Never seen such a fog . MARTHA Never seen such a fog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you happen to notice how long that fog has been hangin ' over this house ? MATTHEW How long ? Why , since Thursday . MARTHA No , sir , since Wednesday night . MATTHEW ( Looking at her , astonished . ) Martha Beeler ! You do n't mean to say  --  he brought the fog ? ( She flounces out without answering . He lights lantern , with dubious head-shaking , and holds it up before the print portraits . ) Mornin ' , Mr. Darwin . Same to you , Mr. Spencer . Still keepin ' things straight ? ( Grunts as he turns down his lantern , which is smoking . ) I guess not very . ( The hall door again opens , and RHODA WILLIAMS , a girl of twenty , enters , with ANNIE BEELER , a child of ten . RHODA is running , with ANNIE in laughing pursuit. ) p. 5 WILLIAMS ( Taking refuge behind the table . ) King 's X ! ANNIE ( Catching her . ) You did n't have your fingers crossed . WILLIAMS ( Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long slip . ) And you did n't have your dress buttoned . ANNIE That does n't count . WILLIAMS Yes , it does , before breakfast ! MATTHEW ( At the outer door . ) How does your aunt strike you this morning ? WILLIAMS ( Sobered . ) She seems wonderfully better . MATTHEW Better ! WILLIAMS I do n't mean her poor body . She 's got past caring for that . MATTHEW ( With sarcasm . ) You mean in her mind , eh ? WILLIAMS Yes , I mean better in her mind . MATTHEW Because of what this fellow has been sayin ' to her , I suppose . WILLIAMS Yes , because of that . MATTHEW ( As he puts on an old fur cap . ) An out-and-out fakir ! p. 6 WILLIAMS You do n't know him . MATTHEW I suppose you do , after fortyeight hours . What in the name of nonsense is he , anyway ? And this deaf and dumb Indian boy he drags around with him . What 's his part in the show ? WILLIAMS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Mr. Michaelis is not  --  what you say . MATTHEW Well , he 's a crank at the best of it . He 's worked your aunt up now so 's she ca n't sleep . You brought him here , and you 've got to get rid of him . ( Exit by outer door , with inarticulate grumblings , among which can be distinguished . ) Hump ! Ulrich Michaelis ! There 's a name for you . ANNIE What 's a fakir ? ( RHODA does not answer . ) Cousin Rho , what 's a fakir ? WILLIAMS ( Humoring her . ) A man , way off on the other side of the world , in India , who does strange things . ANNIE What kind of things ? WILLIAMS Well , for instance , he throws a rope up in the air , right up in the empty air , with nothing for it to catch on , and then  --  he  --  climbs  --  up  --  the  --  rope ! ANNIE Do n't he fall ? ( RHODA shakes her head in portentous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child fidgets nervously. ) p. 7 ANNIE Listen ! He 's coming down ! WILLIAMS Yes , he 's coming down , right out of the blue sky . ANNIE ( In a panic . ) Let me go . ( She breaks away and retreats to the hall door , watching the stair door open , and ULRICH MICHAELIS enter . Thereupon , with a glance of frightened curiosity , she flees . MI-CHAELIS is a man of twenty-eight or thirty , and his dark , emaciated face , wrinkled by sun and wind , looks older . His abundant hair is worn longer than common . His frame , though slight , is powerful , and his way of handling himself has the freedom and largeness which come from much open-air life . There is nevertheless something nervous and restless in his movements . He has a trick of handling things , putting them down only to take them up again immediately , before renouncing them for good . His face shows the effect of sleeplessness , and his gray flannel shirt and dark , coarse clothing are rumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Good morning . MICHAELIS ( Watching ANNIE 'S retreat . ) Is  --  is that child afraid of me ? WILLIAMS ( As she adds the finishing touches to the breakfast table . ) Oh , Annie 's a queer little body . She has her mother 's nerves . And then she sees no one , living here on the back road . If this dreadful fog ever lifts , you 'll see that , though we 're quite near town , it 's almost as if we were in the wilderness . ( The stair door opens , and an Indian boy , about sixteen years old , enters . He is dressed in ordinary clothes ; his dark skin , longish hair , and the noiseless tread of his moccasined feet , are the only suggestions of his race . He bows to RHODA , who returns his salutation ; then , with a glance at MICHAELIS , he goes out doors . RHODA nods toward the closing door . ) It 's really him Annie 's afraid of . He 's like a creature from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her in an odd , startled way . ) Another world ? WILLIAMS Oh , you 're used to his people . Your father was a missionary to the Indians , you told me . MICHAELIS Yes . WILLIAMS Where ? MICHAELIS At Acoma . WILLIAMS Where is that ? MICHAELIS ( Standing near the wall map , touches it . ) In New Mexico , by the map . WILLIAMS ( Comes nearer . ) What is it like ? MICHAELIS It 's  --  as you say  --  another world . WILLIAMS Describe it to me . MICHAELIS I could n't make you see it . It 's  --  centuries and centuries from our time .  --  And since I came here , since I entered this house , it has seemed centuries away from my own life . WILLIAMS My life has seemed far off , too  --  my old life  --  MICHAELIS What do you mean by your old life ? WILLIAMS ( She breaks out impulsively . ) I mean  --  I mean  --  . Three days ago I was like one dead ! I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered sometimes why people did n't see that I was dead , and scream at me. p. 9 MICHAELIS It was three days ago that I first saw you . WILLIAMS Yes . MICHAELIS Three nights ago , out there in the moonlit country . WILLIAMS Yes . MICHAELIS You were unhappy , then ? WILLIAMS The dead are not unhappy , and I was as one dead . MICHAELIS Why was that ? WILLIAMS I think we die more than once when things are too hard and too bitter . MICHAELIS Have things here been hard and bitter ? WILLIAMS No . All was before I came here ! But it had left me feeling  --  . The other night , as I walked through the streets of the town , the people seemed like ghosts to me , and I myself like a ghost . MICHAELIS I can not think of you as anything but glad and free . WILLIAMS When you met me on the road , and walked home with me , and said those few words , it was as if , all of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began once more to live . ( Bell rings . ) That is Aunt Mary 's bell ( RHODA goes out by the hall door , wheeling the invalid chair . MARTHA enters from the kitchen , carrying a steaming coffee-pot and a platter of smoking meat , which she places on the table . MICHAELIS bows to her. ) p. 10 MARTHA ( Snappishly . ) Hope you slept well ! ( She goes to the outer door , rings the breakfast bell loudly , and exit to kitchen . RHODA enters , wheeling MRS . BEELER in an invalid chair . MRS . BEELER is a woman of forty , slight of body , with hair just beginning to silver . Her face has the curious refinement which physical suffering sometimes brings . ANNIE lingers at the door , looking timidly at MICHAELIS , as he approaches MRS . BEELER and takes her hand from the arm of the chair . ) MICHAELIS You are better ? MARY BEELER ( Speaks with low intensity . ) Much , much better . ( He puts her hand gently back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pours out coffee , putting a cup at each plate . MR . BEELER has entered from the kitchen , and the boy from outside . BEELER , with a glance of annoyance at his wife and MICHAELIS , sits down at the head of the table . RHODA pushes MRS . BEELER 'S chair to the foot of the table and stands feeding her , eating her own breakfast mean while . ( MICHAELIS sits at MRS . BEELER 'S right , MARTHA opposite . At MR . BEELER 'S right is the Indian boy , at his left ANNIE 'S vacant chair . MARTHA beckons to ANNIE to come to the table , but the child , eyeing the strangers , refuses , taking a chair behind her mother by the mantel-piece . MRS . BEELER speaks after the meal has progressed for some time in silence. ) p. 11 MARY BEELER Mat , you have n't said good morning to our guest . MATTHEW ( Gruffly . ) How are you ? ( He helps himself to meat and passes it to the others ; the plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANNIE tugs at RHODA 'S skirt , and asks in dumb show to have her breakfast given her . RHODA fills the child 's plate , with which she retreats to her place by the mantel . ) MARY BEELER Why does n't Annie come to the table ? ( She tries to look around . RHODA whispers to MRS . BEELER , who looks at her , puzzled . ) Why does n't Annie come ? WILLIAMS She 's afraid . MARY BEELER Afraid ! What is she afraid of ? WILLIAMS You know how shy she is , before strangers . MARY BEELER Annie , please come here ! Annie ! ( The child refuses , pouting , and gazing at MICHAELIS . ) WILLIAMS I would n't urge her . She does n't want to come . MARTHA ( Trenchantly . ) Do n't blame her ! MARY BEELER ( Gently reproving . ) Martha ! p. 12 MICHAELIS ( Holding out his hand to ANNIE . ) Wo n't you come here , my child ? ( ANNIE approaches slowly , as if hypnotized . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANNIE ( Shyly . ) Not if you wo n't climb up the rope . MICHAELIS ( Puzzled . ) Climb up what rope ? WILLIAMS It 's a story I was foolish enough to tell her .  --  Do eat something , Auntie . MARY BEELER I 'll drink a little more tea . ( RHODA raises the cup to MRS . BEELER 'S lips . ) MATTHEW You ca n't live on tea , Mary . MARTHA I guess she can live on tea better than on some things ! ( With a re-sentful glance at MICHAELIS . ) Some things that some folks seem to live on , and expect other folks to live on . ( MICHAELIS looks up from ANNIE , who has been whispering in. his ear . BEELER nods at MARTHA in covert approval , as she takes up dishes and goes into the kitchen . ) MARY BEELER ( Leans forward across the table to MICHAELIS . ) Do n't mind my sister-in-law , Mr. Michaelis . It 's her way . She means nothing by it p. 13 MATTHEW ( Between gulps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't know as you 've got any call to speak for Martha . She generally means what she says , and I guess she means it now . And what 's more , I guess I do , too ! MARY BEELER ( Beseechingly . ) Mat ! MATTHEW ( Throws down his napkin and rises . ) Very well . It 's none of my business , I reckon , as long as it keeps within reason . ( He puts on his cap and goes out through the kitchen . ) ANNIE ( To MICHAELIS , continuing the whispered conversation . ) And if you do climb up the rope , do you promise to come down ? MICHAELIS Yes , I promise to come down . MARY BEELER ( Leans over her plate.The others bow their heads . ) Bless this food to our use , and this day to our strength and our salvation . WILLIAMS ( As they lift their heads . ) Perhaps it will be light enough now without the lamp . ( MICHAELIS , holding ANNIE 'S hand , rises , goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while RHODA extin-guishes the lamp . The fog is still thick , and the light which enters is dull . RHODA unpins the napkin from her aunt 's breast , and wheels her back from the table . The boy crouches down by the grate , Indian fashion . ANNIE looks at him with shy , half-frightened interest. ) p. 14 MARY BEELER ( Gazing out , from where she sits reclining . ) The blessed sun ! I never thought to see it rise again so beautiful . WILLIAMS ( Looks at her aunt , puzzled and alarmed . ) But , Auntie , there is n't any sun ! It ' s  --  ( She breaks off , seeing MICHAELIS place his fingers on his lips as a signal for her to be silent . MRS . BEELER turns to RHODA , puzzled . ) MARY BEELER There is n't any sun ? Why  --  ( RHODA pretends not to hear . MRS . BEELER turns to MICHAELIS . ) What does she mean by saying there is no sun ? MICHAELIS She means she does n't see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see it , do n't you ? MICHAELIS I see the same sun that you see . MARY BEELER ( Looks again at RHODA , then dismisses her wonderment , and looks out at the window dreamily . ) Another day  --  and to-morrow the best of all the days of the year . ANNIE What day is to-morrow ? ( She leaves MICHAELIS and comes to her mother 's side . ) What day is to-morrow ? p. 15 MARY BEELER ( With exultation in her voice . ) My child , to-morrow is the most wonderful and the most beautiful day of all the year . The day when  --  all over the whole world  --  there is singing in the air , and everything rises into new life and happiness . ANNIE ( Fretfully . ) Mamma , I do n't understand ! What day is to-morrow ? MARY BEELER To-morrow is Easter . ANNIE ( With sudden interest . ) Easter ! Can I have some eggs to color ? MARY BEELER Ask Aunt Martha . ANNIE ( Singsong , as she skips out . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile fetched a large tray from the cupboard and has been piling the dishes noiselessly upon it . ) WILLIAMS Shall I wheel you in , Aunt Mary ? MARY BEELER Yes , please . ( RHODA wheels the chair toward the hall door , which MICHAELIS opens . MRS . BEELER gazes at him as she passes . ) Will you come in soon , and sit with me ? There is so much that I want to hear . MICHAELIS Whenever you are ready . p. 16 MARY BEELER I will ring my bell . ( As they go out , MARTHA bustles in , gathers up the dish tray and is about to depart , with a vindictive look . At the door she turns , and jerks her head toward the boy . ) MARTHA Is it against the law to work where he comes from ? MICHAELIS ( Abstractedly . ) What ?  --  No . MARTHA Then he might as well do me some chores . Not but right , payin ' only half board . MICHAELIS ( To the boy . ) Do whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MICHAELIS stands by the window in thought . As RHODA renters , he looks up . He speaks significantly , with suppressed excitement . ) She saw the sun ! WILLIAMS Poor dear Auntie ! MICHAELIS You pity her ? WILLIAMS ( After an instant 's silence , during which she ponders her reply . ) I think I envy her . ( She removes the cloth from the table , and begins deftly to put the room in order . MICHAELIS watches her with a kind of vague intentness . ) MICHAELIS How long did you say she had been sick ? p. 17 WILLIAMS More than four years  --  nearly five . MICHAELIS She has never walked in that time ? WILLIAMS ( Shakes her head . ) Nor used her right hand , either . MICHAELIS ( With intensity . ) Are you certain ? WILLIAMS ( Surprised at his tone . ) Yes  --  I have n't lived here long , but I am certain . MICHAELIS She has tried medicine , doctors ? WILLIAMS Uncle has spent everything he could earn on them . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Virginia . MICHAELIS But never as far as Bethesda ? WILLIAMS Bethesda ? Where is that ? MICHAELIS The pool , which is called Bethesda , having five porches . WILLIAMS Oh , yes . The pool in the Bible , where once a year an angel troubled the waters , and the sick and the lame and the blind gathered , hoping to be healed . MICHAELIS And whoever first , after the troubling of the waters , stepped in , he was made whole of whatsoever disease he had . p. 18 WILLIAMS If anybody could find the way there again , it would be Aunt Mary . ( Pause . ) And if anybody could show her the way it would be  --  you . ( She goes on in a different tone , as if to escape from the embarrassment of her last speech . ) Her saying just now she saw the sun . She often says things like that . Have you noticed ? MICHAELIS Yes . WILLIAMS ( With hesitation . ) Her brother Seth  --  the one who died  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAMS What she thinks happens  --  since  --  he died ? ( MICHAELIS nods assent . ) And yet in most other ways her mind is perfectly clear . MICHAELIS Perhaps in this way it is clearer still . WILLIAMS ( Startled . ) You mean  --  that maybe she really does  --  see her brother ? MICHAELIS It may be . WILLIAMS It would make the world a very different  --  a very strange place , if that were true . MICHAELIS The world is a very strange place . ( Pause. ) p. 19 WILLIAMS Tell me a little about your life . That seems to have been very strange . MICHAELIS ( Vaguely , as he seats himself by the table . ) I do n't know . I can hardly remember what my life was . WILLIAMS Why is that ? MICHAELIS ( Gazing at her . ) Because , since I came into this house , I have seen the vision of another life . WILLIAMS ( With hesitation . ) What  --  other life ? MICHAELIS Since my boyhood I have been  --  ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fugitive  --  . And I never knew it , till now  --  I never knew it till  --  I looked into your face ! WILLIAMS ( Avoiding his gaze . ) How should that make you know ? MICHAELIS ( Leans nearer . ) All my life long I have walked in the light of something to come , some labor , some mission , I have scarcely known what  --  but I have risen with it and lain down with it , and nothing else has existed for me.  --  Nothing , until  --  I lifted my eyes and you stood there . The stars looked down from their places , the earth wheeled on among the stars . Everything was as it had been , and nothing was as it had been ; nor ever , ever can it be the same again . p. 20 WILLIAMS ( In a low and agitated voice . ) You must not say these things to me . You are  --  I am not  --  . You must not think of me so . MICHAELIS I must think of you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter tone , as if to relieve the tension of their last words . ) WILLIAMS Tell me a little of your boyhood .  --  What was it like  --  that place where you lived ? MICHAELIS ( Becomes absorbed in his own mental pictures as he speaks . ) A great table of stone , rising five hundred feet out of the endless waste of sand . A little adobe house , halfway up the mesa , with the desert far below and the Indian village far above . A few peach trees , and a spring  --  a sacred spring , which the Indians worshipped in secret . A little chapel , which my father had built with his own hands . He often spent the night there , praying . And there , one night , he died . I found him in the morning , lying as if in quiet prayer before the altar . WILLIAMS ( After a moment 's hush . ) What did you do after your father died ? MICHAELIS I went away south , into the mountains , and got work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . p. 21 WILLIAMS And since then ? MICHAELIS ( Hesitates . ) Since then I have  --  wandered about , working here and there to earn enough to live on . WILLIAMS I understand well why men take up that life . I should love it myself . MICHAELIS I did n't do it because I loved it . WILLIAMS Why , then ? MICHAELIS I was waiting my time . WILLIAMS ( In a low tone . ) Your time  --  for what ? MICHAELIS To fulfil my life  --  my real life . WILLIAMS Your  --  real life ? ( He sits absorbed in thought without answering . RHODA continues , after a long pause . ) There in the mountains , when you were a shepherd  --  that was not your real life ? MICHAELIS It was the beginning of it . WILLIAMS ( With hesitation . ) Wo n't you tell me a little about that time ? MICHAELIS In the fall I would drive the sheep south , through the great basin which sloped down into Mexico , and in the spring back again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ? MICHAELIS There were a few men on the ranges , but they were no more to me than the sheep  --  not so much . WILLIAMS Where n't you dreadfully lonely ? MICHAELIS No . WILLIAMS You had n't even any books to read ? MICHAELIS ( Takes a book from his coat pocket . ) I had this pocket Bible , that had been my father 's . I read that sometimes . But always in a dream , without understanding , without remembering . ( His excitement increases . ) Yet there came a time when whole chapters started up in my mind , as plain as if the printed page were before me , and I understood it all , both the outer meaning and the inner . WILLIAMS And you did n't know what made the difference ? MICHAELIS Yes . WILLIAMS What was it ? MICHAELIS I ca n't tell you that . WILLIAMS Oh , yes ! MICHAELIS There are no words to tell of it . WILLIAMS Yet tell me . I need to know . Believe me , I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words . ) It was one morning in the fourth spring . We were back in the mountains again . It was lambing time , and I had been up all night . Just before sunrise , I sat down on a rock to rest . Then  --  it came . WILLIAMS What came ? ( He does not answer . ) You saw something ? ( He nods for yes . ) What was it ? MICHAELIS ( Rises , lifting his arms , a prey to uncontrollable excitement . ) The living Christ !  --  Standing before me on the mountain , amid the grazing sheep .  --  With these eyes and in this flesh , I saw Him . ( Long pause . ) WILLIAMS ( In a low tone . ) You had fallen asleep . It was a dream . MICHAELIS ( Shakes his head in negation . ) That was n't all . ( He turns away . She follows him , and speaks after a silence . ) WILLIAMS Tell me the rest . What happened to you , after  --  after what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Begins to talk slowly and reluctantly . ) I lived straight ahead , with the sheep for two years . p. 24 WILLIAMS ( Hesitating . ) Did you ever see anything again ? MICHAELIS No.  --  But twice  --  I heard a voice . WILLIAMS What kind of a voice ? MICHAELIS The first time it came at night . I was walking on the top of the mountain , in a stony place . It  --  it was like a wind among the stones . WILLIAMS What did it say ? MICHAELIS It said , " Prepare ! Prepare ! " WILLIAMS And the second time ? MICHAELIS In the same place , at dawn . The voice said , " Go forth , it is finished ! " I looked round me and saw nothing . Then it came again , like a wind among the stones , " Go forth , it is begun ! " WILLIAMS And you obeyed ? MICHAELIS I found a man to take my place , and started north . Three days after , I climbed the mesa toward my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the sound of tom-toms and wailing squaws . They told me that the young son of the chief lay dead in my father 's chapel . I sat beside him all day and all night . Just before daylight  --  ( He breaks off abruptly . ) WILLIAMS Go on ! p. 25 MICHAELIS Just before daylight , when the other watchers were asleep , the power of the spirit came strong upon me . I bowed myself upon the boy 's body , and prayed . My heart burned within me , for I felt his heart begin to beat ! His eyes opened . I told him to arise , and he arose . He that was dead arose and was alive again ! ( Pause . MRS . BEELER 'S bell rings . MICHAELIS starts , looks about him as if awakened from a dream , then slowly goes toward the hall door . RHODA follows and detains him . ) WILLIAMS ( In a low tone . ) How long had he lain  --  for dead ? MICHAELIS Three days . WILLIAMS ( With hesitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that in a trance , breathing so lightly that it could not be told , except by holding a glass before the face . MICHAELIS ( Startled . ) Is that true ? WILLIAMS I have read so . MICHAELIS I wonder  --  I wonder . ( He stands in deep thought . ) But I have had other signs . WILLIAMS What other signs ? MICHAELIS Many , many . Up and down the land ! ( Pause . ) I wonder .  --  I  --  I almost wish it were so ! ( With bent head he goes out . RHODA stands looking after him until the inner door closes , then sits before the fire in revery . BEELER comes in from the barn . He wears his old fur cap , and holds in one hand a bulky Sunday newspaper , in the other some battered harness , an awl , twine , and wax , which he deposits on the window seat . He lays the paper on the table , and unfolds from it a large colored print , which he holds up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers do get up fine supplements . I would n't take money for that picture . WILLIAMS ( Looks at it absently . ) What does it mean ? MATTHEW ( Reads . ) " Pan and the Pilgrim . " Guess you never heard of Pan , did you ? WILLIAMS Yes . One of the old heathen gods . MATTHEW Call him heathen if you like ! The folks that worshipped him thought he was orthodox , I guess . ( He pins up the print , which , represents a palmer of crusading times surprised in the midst of a forest by the god Pan . ) WILLIAMS What does the picture mean ? MATTHEW Well , Pan there , he was a kind of a nature god . The old Romans thought him out , to stand for a lot of things . WILLIAMS What kind of things ? MATTHEW Natural things , with plenty of sap and mischief in ' em . Growin ' plants , and frisky animals , and young folks in love . ( He points to the figure of Pan , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sits playin ' Jenny-come-kiss-me on his dod-gasted mouth-organ , when along comes one of them fellows out of a monastery , with religion on the brain . Pikin ' for Jerusalem , to get a saint 's toenail and a splinter of the true cross . ( MARTHA enters from the kitchen and potters about the room " redding up . " ) Look at him ! Do you think he 'll ever get to Jerusalem ? Not this trip ! He hears the pipes o ' Pan . He hears women callin ' and fiddles squeakin ' love-tunes in the woods . It 'll take more than a monk 's robe on his back and a shaved head on his shoulders to keep him straight , I reckon . He 'll call to mind that young fellows had blood in their veins when Adam was a farmer , and whoop-la ! he 'll be off to the county fair , to dance ring-around-a-rosy with Matildy Jane ! ( Pause , as he takes off his cap and lights his pipe . ) Like to see our friend Michaelis meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked cross-eyed at a girl . ( He examines RHODA quizzically . ) You would n't make up bad as Matildy Jane yourself , Rho , but sufferin ' Job , he ca n't tell the difference between crow 's feet and dimples ! p. 27 MARTHA Do n't you be so sure ! MATTHEW Hello ! Dan'el come to judgment ! Never seen an old maid yet that could n't squeeze a love story out of a flat-iron . MARTHA I may be an old maid , and you may be an old wind-bag , but I 've got eyes in my head . ( To RHODA . ) Where did you meet up with him , anyway ? ( RHODA , plunged in thought , does not answer . ) MATTHEW Wake up , Rhody ! Marthy asked you where you met up with our new boarder . WILLIAMS On the road , coming home from the village . MATTHEW What made you bring him here ? WILLIAMS He wanted a quiet place to stay , and this was the best I knew . MARTHA Guess it was ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hall door . ) ( RHODA rises , takes the lamp off the mantel , and during the following cleans and refills it . ) MATTHEW ( As he takes off his coat , and hangs it up . ) Rhody , ai n't this religious business rather a new thing with you ? Up there in St. Louis , did n't go in for it much up there , did you ? p. 28 WILLIAMS ( Looks at him quickly . ) Why do you ask that ? MATTHEW Oh , I gathered , from things I heard , that you cared more about dancin ' than about prayin ' , up there . ( She turns away . ) That young fellow that was so sweet on you in St. Louis year before last , he wa ' n't much in the psalm-singin ' line , was he ? WILLIAMS ( Startled and pale . ) Who told you about him ? MATTHEW Oh , Mary 's friends , the Higginses , used to write us about your affairs . We thought it would be a hitch-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor , was n't he ? WILLIAMS Uncle , please never speak to me about him again ! MATTHEW All right , all right , my girl . I 've been young myself , and I know youth is touchy as a gum-boil when it comes to love affairs . So it 's all off , is it ? WILLIAMS Yes . MATTHEW ( Sits down to mend the harness . ) If you 're partial to the pill trade , we 've got a brand new doctor in town now . Took old Doctor Martin 's place . He 'll be up here to see Mary in a day or two , and you can look him over . WILLIAMS What is his name ? p. 29 MATTHEW ( Tries in vain to recall it . ) Blamed if I can remember . Only seen him once . But I tell you , he 's smart as tacks . Chuck full of Jamaica ginger . The very kind I 'd have swore you 'd take to , a while back , before you lost your fun and your spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm out in Kansas , you was as wild a little gypsy as I ever set eyes on .

( MARTHA comes in from the hall and fusses about , dusting , etc . She points in the direction of MRS . BEELER 'S room . ) MARTHA They 're prayer-meetin ' it again . And Mary lyin ' there as if she saw the pearly gates openin' ' before her eyes . MATTHEW ( Half to himself as he works . ) Poor Mary !  --  Mary 's a strange woman . MARTHA ( To RHODA . ) Your mother was the same way , Rhody . The whole Beardsley tribe for that matter . But Mary was the worst . It begun with Mary as soon as her brother Seth got drowned . MATTHEW ( Looks up , angry . ) None of that , Sis ! MARTHA I guess my tongue 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I wo n't have any more of that talk around me , do you hear ? I put my foot down a year ago . MARTHA ( Points to his foot derisively . ) It 's big enough and ugly enough , Heaven knows , but you can put it down as hard as you like , it wo n't keep a man 's spirit in his grave  --  not when he 's a mind to come out ! MATTHEW ( Astonished . ) Martha Beeler ! MARTHA That 's my name . ( She flounces out into the kitchen , covering her retreat with her last speech . ) MATTHEW ( Looking after her . ) My kingdom ! Martha ! I thought she had some horse sense left . WILLIAMS ( Slowly , as she finishes with the lamp . ) Uncle , it 's hard to live side by side with Aunt Mary and not  --  MATTHEW ( In angry challenge . ) And not what ? WILLIAMS And not believe there 's something more in these matters than " horse sense " will account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been touched upon . ) There 's nothing more than science will account for . ( He points to a shelf of books . ) You can read it up any day you like . Read that book yonder , chapter called Hallucinations . Pathological , that 's what it is , pathological. p. 31 WILLIAMS What does that mean ? ( BEELER taps his forehead significantly . ) Uncle , you know that 's not true ! MATTHEW ( Growls to himself . ) Pathological , up and down . ( RHODA replaces the lamp on the mantel . MARTHA opens the kitchen door and calls in . ) MARTHA Here 's Uncle Abe ! MATTHEW Uncle Abe ? Thought he was a goner . ( UNCLE ABE enters . He is an old negro , with gray hair and thin , gray beard . He is somewhat bowed , and carries a stick , but he is not decrepit . His clothes are spattered with mud . MARTHA enters with him ; she is stirring something in a bowl , and during the following continues to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MATTHEW Hello , Uncle Abe . UNCLE ABE Good-mawnin ' , Mista . Beeler . MATTHEW Where 've you been all winter ? Thought you 'd gone up Salt River .

( UNCLE ABE bows. ) p. 32 WILLIAMS ( Pushing forward a chair . ) Sit down , Uncle . I do n't see how you found your way in this dreadful fog . UNCLE ABE Fawg don ' matta ' nothin ' to me , honey . Don ' mean nothin ' ' tall . ( He speaks with exaltation and restrained excitement . ) Yo ' ol ' Uncle keeps on tellin ' ' em , dis hyah fawg an ' darkness don ' mean nothin ' ' tall ! ( RHODA and MARTHA look at him puzzled . BEELER , busy over his harness , has not been struck by the old negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year ? UNCLE ABE They ain ' no mo ' gimsing !

What kind of a healer ? UNCLE ABE ( With mounting indignation at BEELER 'S tone . ) De Bible kin ' , dat 's what kin ' !

She bends over and kisses the child 's head , then stretches out her other hand to her husband . ) MARY BEELER Mat , I 'm cured ! The Lord has heard our prayers , for His saint 's sake . MATTHEW Why , Mary , I ca n't believe this  --  it 's too  --  it 's not possible ! MARY BEELER ( Looking at MICHAELIS . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a grain of mustard seed  --  . I have had faith .

He stands rigid , listening to the hymn to the end of the verse , when other voices join in the chorus . The fog has partially cleared . p. 38 MICHAELIS ( Turning slowly to RHODA . ) Who are they ? WILLIAMS Sick people . MICHAELIS How did they find out I was here ? WILLIAMS It was known you were somewhere near .  --  They have been gathering for days .  --  They saw the boy , just now , in the village . MARY BEELER ( Comes a step or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

BEELER , then for a long time at RHODA . He gathers himself together , and gazes steadfastly before him , as at some unseen presence. ) @x It is late afternoon of the same day . MRS . BEELER sits in a low chair near the window . She has ceased reading the Testament , which lies open in her lap . UNCLE ABE sits on the floor with ANNIE . They are playing with building blocks , piling up and tearing down various ambitious structures .

UNCLE ABE I 's awake an ' a-watchin ' , honey ! ( He turns again to the child , shaking his head as at some unspoken thought , while RHODA arranges the flowers in a vase . ) MARY BEELER Rhoda ! WILLIAMS Yes , Aunt Mary ? MARY BEELER Come here . ( RHODA approaches . MRS . BEELER speaks low , with suppressed excitement . ) What is the news , outside ? WILLIAMS You must n't excite yourself . You must keep your strength . p. 40 MARY BEELER I shall be strong enough .  --  Are the people still gathering from the town ? WILLIAMS Yes , and they keep coming in from other places .

I ca n't hardly breathe the way people are in this house . MARY BEELER You will understand , some day , what wonderful things your childish eyes looked on . ( ANNIE retreats to UNCLE ABE , who bends over the child and whispers in her ear . She grows amused , and begins to sway as to a tune , then chants . ANNIE .

MARY BEELER ( Touching her breast . ) Only here , Uncle Abe . ( The old negro stares at her and RHODA , and goes into the kitchen , feeling his own breast and shaking his head dubiously . MRS . BEELER looks at the picture . ) Do you think your Uncle Mat would mind if we took that picture down ? ( RHODA upins the picture from the wall , rools it up , and lays it on the bookshelf . Her a aunt goes on , hesitatingly . ) Do you know , Rohda , I have sometimes thought  --  You wo n't be hurt ? WILLIAMS No. p. 45 MARY BEELER I  --  I know what that old negro says is all foolishness , but  --  there is something the matter with Mr. Michaelis . Have you noticed ?

MARY BEELER So as not to  --  hinder him . MARY BEELER ( Caressing her . ) There , you have taken what I said too seriously . It was only a sick woman 's imagination . p. 46 WILLIAMS No , it was the truth . You see it , though you try not to . Even Uncle Abe sees it . Just it when Mr. Michaelis most needs his strength , weakness has come upon him . MARY BEELER You mean  --  ? ( She hesitates . ) You mean  --  because of you ?  --  Rhoda , look at me .

Shall I bring him in here ? MARY BEELER No . I think I will rest awhile . He can come to my room . ( She walks unsteadily . The others try to help her , but she motions them back . ) No . It 's so good to feel that I can walk alone ! MARTHA It does beat all ! MARY BEELER I 'll just lie down on the couch . I want to go out , before dark , and speak to the people . ( MR .

MARTHA , as she lowers the lid of the window-seat , points derisively at the heap . ) MARTHA That 's a good riddance of bad rubbish !

Not unless you want to lay her flat on her back again ! ( As she flounces out , ANNIE enters from the hall .

ANNIE You know , mamma 's doctor .  --  Oh , he 's never come since you 've been here . p. 50 WILLIAMS ( In a changed voice , as she takes the child by the shoulders . ) What does he look like ? ANNIE Do n't , you 're hurting me !  --  He 's too red in the face , and looks kind of  --  insulting  --  and he wears the most beautiful neekties , and  --  ( Exhausted by her efforts at description . ) Oh , I do n't know !

BEELER 'S room . He speaks back to BEELER on the threshold . ) LITTLEFIELD Do n't bother ! I 'll find it . ( Looking for something , he approaches RHODA , who has her back turned . ) Beg pardon . Have you seen a pocket thermometer I left here ? ( She faces him . He starts back in surprise . ) Bless my soul and body ! Rhoda Williams !

The world is small .  --  Been here long ? p. 51 WILLIAMS Only a month . LITTLEFIELD And before that ? WILLIAMS It 's a long story . Besides , you would n't understand . LITTLEFIELD You might let me try . What in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAMS I have been searching for some-thing . LITTLEFIELD What was it ? WILLIAMS My own lost self . My own  --  lost soul . LITTLEFIELD ( Amused at her solemnity . ) You 're a queer bundle of goods . Always were . Head full of solemn notions about life , and at the same time , when it came to a lark ,  --  Oh , I 'm no grandmother , but when you got on your high horse  --  well ! ( He waves his hands expressively . ) WILLIAMS ( Bursts out . ) The great town , the people , the noise , and the lights  --  after seventeen years of life on a dead prairie , where I 'd hardly heard a laugh or seen a happy face !  --  All the same , the prairie had me still . LITTLEFIELD You do n't mean you went back to the farm ? WILLIAMS I mean that the years I 'd spent out there in that endless stretch of earth and sky  --  . ( She breaks off , with a weary gesture . ) There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . p. 52 LITTLEFIELD No , I walk on simple shoe leather and eat mere vietuals.  --  Just the same , it was n't square of you to clear out that way  --  vanish into air without a word or a sign . WILLIAMS ( Looking at him steadily . ) You know very well why I went . LITTLEFIELD ( Returning her gave , unabashed , chants with meaning and relish . ) " Hey diddle , diddle , The eat and the fiddle.The cow jumped over the moon . " ( RHODA takes up the basket and goes toward the outer door . He intercepts her . ) WILLIAMS Let me pass . LITTLEFIELD You 're not taking part in this camp-meeting enthusiasm , are you ? WILLIAMS Yes . ( As he stares at her , his astonishment changes to amusement ; he chuckles to himself , then bursts out laughing , as in humorous reminiscence . ) LITTLEFIELD Bless my soul ! And to think that only a couple of little years ago  --  Oh , bless my soul !

I came down for a glass of water . ( RHODA goes to the kitchen door , where she turns . The doctor puts on a pair of nose-glasses and scans MICHAELIS with interest . He holds out his hand , which MICHAELIS takes . ) LITTLEFIELD We ought to know each other . We 're colleagues , in a way . MICHAELIS Colleagues ? LITTLEFIELD In a way , yes . I 'm a practising physician . ( Exit RHODA . ) You seem to have the call on us professionals , to judge by the number of your clients out yonder .

She and I happen to be old acquaintances . p. 54 MATTHEW You do n't say ?  --  Would you mind coming in here for a minute ? LITTLEFIELD ( Following him out . ) What 's up ? MATTHEW My wife 's got it in her head that she 's called upon to  --  ( Door closes . MICHAELIS , who has followed LITTLEFIELD with his eyes , sets down the glass , and turns slowly to RHODA . ) MICHAELIS Who is that ? WILLIAMS My aunt 's doctor . MICHAELIS You know him well ? WILLIAMS Yes .  --  No . MICHAELIS What does that mean ? WILLIAMS I have n't seen him for nearly two years .  --  I ca n't remember much about the person I was , two years ago . MICHAELIS Yes ! Yes ! I understand . ( He turns away , lifting his hands , speak- ing half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be poured like a jelly , from one mould into another , until God Himself can not remember what they were two years ago , or two hours ago ! WILLIAMS Why do you say that ? ( He does not answer , but walks nervously about . RHODA , watching him , speaks , after a silence . ) Last month  --  out West  --  were there many people there ? p. 55 MICHAELIS No.  --  Two or three . WILLIAMS The papers said  --  MICHAELIS When the crowd began to gather , I  --  went away . WILLIAMS Why ? MICHAELIS My time had not come . ( He has stopped before the map and stands gazing at it . ) WILLIAMS Has it come now ? ( She comes closer. )  --  Has your time come now ? MICHAELIS Yes . WILLIAMS How do you know ? MICHAELIS ( Points at the map . ) It is written there ! WILLIAMS How do you mean , written there ? MICHAELIS Ca n't you see it ? WILLIAMS I see the map , nothing more . MICHAELIS ( Points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be written in fire . WILLIAMS What seems written ? MICHAELIS What I have been doing , all these five years . WILLIAMS Since your work began ? p. 56 MICHAELIS It has never began . Many times I have thought , " Now , " and some man or woman has risen up healed , and looked at me with eyes of propheey . But a Voice would cry , " On , on ! " and I would go forward , driven by a force and a will not my own .  --  I did n't know what it all meant , but I know now . ( He points at the map , his manner transformed with excitement and exaltation . ) It is written there . It is written in letters of fire . My eyes are opened , and I see ! WILLIAMS ( Following his gaze , then looking at him again , awed and bewildered . ) What is it that you see ? MICHAELIS The cross ! WILLIAMS I  --  I do n't understand . MICHAELIS All those places where the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into me  --  ( He places his finger at various points on the map ; these points lie in two transverse lines , between the Mississippi and the Pacific ; one line runs roughly north and south , the other east and west . ) Look ! There was such a place , and there another , and there , and there , and there . And there was one , and there , and there .  --  Do you see ? WILLIAMS I see .  --  It makes a kind of cross . MICHAELIS You see it , too ! And do you see what it means  --  this sign that my feet have marked across the length and breadth of a continent ? ( He begins again to pace the room. )  --  And that crowd of stricken souls out yonder , raised up as by miracle , their broken bodies crying to be healed ,  --  do you see what they mean ? p. 57 WILLIAMS ( In a steady voice . ) They mean what my aunt said this morning . They mean that your great hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He comes nearer , and speaks in a quieter tone . ) I knew a young Indian once , a Hopi boy , who made songs and sang them to his people . One evening we sat on the roof of the chief 's house and asked him to sing . He shook his head , and went away in the starlight . The next morning , I found him among the rocks under the mesa , with an empty bottle by his side .  --  He never sang again ! Drunkenuess had taken him . He never sang again , or made another verse . WILLIAMS What has that to do with you ? It 's not  --  ? You do n't mean that you  --  ? MICHAELIS No . There is a stronger drink for such as I am ! WILLIAMS ( Forcing herself to go on . ) What  --  " stronger drink " ? MICHAELIS ( Wildly . ) The wine of this world ! The wine-bowl that crowns the feasting table of the children of this world . WILLIAMS What do you mean by  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Every woman knows . ( He points out of the window , at the sky flushed with sunset color . ) Out there , at this moment , in city and country , thousand open thousand of souls , are dashing in pieces the cup that holds the wine of heaven , the wine of God 's shed blood , and lifting the cups of passion and of love , that crown the feasting table of the children of this earth ! Look ! The very sky is blood-red with the lifted cups . And we two are in the midst of them . Listen what I sing there , on the hills of light in the sunset : " Oh , how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of my beloved ! " ( A song rises outside , loud and near at hand  --  MICHAELIS listens , his expression gradually changing from passionate excitement to brooding distress . Vaguely , as the music grows fainter and dies away . ) I  --  we were saying  --  . ( He grasps her arm in nervous apprehension . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people  --  waiting  --  out there ? p. 58 WILLIAMS Hundreds , if not thousands . MICHAELIS ( Walks about . ) Thousands .  --  Thousands of thousands !  --  ( He stops beside her . ) You wo n't leave me alone ? WILLIAMS ( Hesitates , then speaks with decision . ) No . MICHAELIS ( Continuing his walk . ) Thousands of thousands ! ( The hall door opens , DR . LITTLEFIELD and a Clergyman , the REV . JOHN CULPEPPER , enter . The latter stares inquiringly from MICHAELIS to the DOCTOR , who nods affirmatively , and adjusts his glasses . ) CULPEPPER ( Mutters to LITTLEFIELD . ) Nonsense ! Sacrilegious nonsense ! LITTLEFIELD ( Same tone . ) I 've done my best . ( Behind them comes MRS . BEELER , susported by her Husband . At the same moment MARTHA enters from the kitchen , with tea ; UNCLE ABE and ANNIE follow . ) MATTHEW ( On the threshold . ) Mary , take another minute to consider . ( MRS . BEELER , as if without hearing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with a gesture of the arms which causes her supporter to loosen his hold , though he follows slightly behind , to render aid if necessary. ) p. 59 MARY BEELER ( ToMICHAELIS . ) Tell me that I may go out , and stand before them for a testimony ! LITTLEFIELD As a physician , I must formally protest . CULPEPPER And I as a minister of the Gospel . MARY BEELER ( To MICHAELIS , with a nervous , despairing gesture . ) Speak to them ! Explain to them ! I am too weak . ( There is a sound of excited voices outside , near at hand , then a sudden trample of footsteps at the entrance door . As BEELER goes hurriedly to the door it bursts open and a young woman with a baby in her arms crowds past him , and stands looking wildly about the room . ) MATTHEW ( As the forces the others back . ) You ca n't come in here , my friends ! Stand back ! ( The woman gazes from one to another of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , holding out the child . ) THE YOUNG MOTHER Do n't let my baby die ! For Christ 's sake , do n't let him die ! ( He examines the child 's face , touches the mother 's head tenderly , and signs to RHODA to take them into the inner room . ) MICHAELIS Take her with you , I will come . p. 60 WILLIAMS ( With gentle urgency , to the woman . ) Come with me . ( She leads the woman out through the hall door . ) MICHAELIS ( To MRS . BEELER , as he points outside . ) Tell them to wait until to-morrow at sunrise . ( MR. and MRS . BEELER move toward the entrance door ; some of the others start after , some linger , curious to know what will happen to the child . MICHAELIS turns upon them with a commanding gesture . ) Go , all of you ! ( The room is cleared except for LITTLEFIELD , who goes last , stops in the doorway , closes the door , and approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) LITTLEFIELD You 're on the wrong track , my friend . MICHAELIS I asked you to go . LITTLEFIELD I heard you . I want to say a word or two first . For your own sake and for that woman 's sake , you 'd better listen . You ca n't do anything for her baby . MICHAELIS Is that for you to say ? LITTLEFIELD Yes , sir ! It is most decidedly for me to say . MICHAELIS By what authority ? p. 61 LITTLEFIELD By the authority of medical knowledge .  --  You are a very remarkable man , with a very remarkable gift . In your own field , I take off my hat to you . If you knew yourself as science knows you , you might make the greatest doctor living . Your handling of Mrs. Beeler 's case was masterly . But-come right down to it  --  you did n't work the cure . MICHAELIS I know that . LITTLEFIELD Who do you think did ? MICHAELIS ( Raising his hands . ) He whom I serve , and whom you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve , and whom you blasphme-Nature . Or rather , Mrs. Beeler did it herself . MICHAELIS Herself ? LITTLEFIELD You gave her a jog , so to speak , here , or here , ( Touches his brain and heart. ) and she did the rest . But you ca n't do the same to everybody . Above all , you ca n't do it to a baby in arms . There 's nothing either here or here , ( Touches brain and heart. ) to get hold of . I 'm a modest man , and as I say , in your own field you 're a wonder . But in a case like this one --  ( He points to the hall door . ) I 'm worth a million of you . MICHAELIS ( Moves as if to give place to him , with a challenging gesture toward the door . ) Try ! p. 62 LITTLEFIELD ( Shrugs . ) Not much ! The woman would n't listen to me . And if she did , and I failed-oh , I 'm no miracle worker ! - they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He points out and adds significantly . ) They 're in no mood for failures , out there . ( MICHAELIS'Sgaze , as if in spite of himself , goes to the window . He rests his hand on table , to stop its **25;2620;TOOLONG on , watching him with interest . ) Nervously speaking , you are a high power machine . The dynamo . that runs you is what is called " faith , " " religious inspiration , " or what-not . It 's a dynamo which nowadays easily gets out of order . Well , my friend , as a doctor , I warn you that your little dynamo is out of order. - In other words , you 've lost your grip . You 're in a funk . ( RHODA opens the hall door and looks anxiously at the two . MICHAELES approaches her with averted eyes . As he is about to pass out , she speaks timidly . ) WILLIAMS Do you want me ? MICHAELIS ( In a toneless voice . ) No . ( She watches him until the inner door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment across the width of the width of the room . ) WILLIAMS ( Forcing herself to speak calmly . ) Please go . p. 63 LITTLEFIELD ( Drops his professional tone for one of cynical badinage . ) You make up well as one of the Wise Virgins , whose lamps are trimmed and burning for the bridegroom to pass by . I hope that personage wo n't disappoint you , nor the several hundred others , out yonder , whose lamps are trimmed and burning . ( The outer door opens . MRS . BEELER enters , supported by her husband , and accompanied by MARTHA and the REV . CULPEPPER , With UNCLE ABE following in the rear . RHODA hastens to her aunt 's side . ) MARY BEELER Ah , Rhoda , I wish you had been out there with me . Such beautiful human faces ! Such poor , suffering , believing human faces , lit up by such a wonderful new hope ! ( She turns to the minister . ) Was n't it a wonderful thing to see ? CULPEPPER It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , very painful . MARY BEELER To-morrow you will see how right these poor souls are to lift their trust so high.  --  ( To RHODA . ) Where is he now ? ( RHODA points in the direction of her own room . ) How happy that young mother 's heart will be to-night ! UNCLE ABE ( Solemnly . ) Amen ! p. 64 CULPEPPER ( In a dry tone . ) We will hope so . ( They move to the hall door , where BEELERresigns his wife toRHODA . The two pass out . ( CULPEPPER , LITTLEFIELD , and BEELER remain . During the following conversation , MARTHA lights the lamp , after direting UNCLE ABE , by a gesture , to take the provision basket into the kitchen . He does so . ) LITTLEFIELD ( Pointing throught the window . ) They 're just laying siege to you , ai n't they ? I guess they wo n't let your man give them the slip , this time - even though you do let him run loose . MATTHEW ( With severity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in five years . LITTLEFIELD I beg your pardon . I understand how you feel about it . ( MARTHA goes out into the kitchen . ) And even if it proves to be only temporary- MATTHEW Temporary ! LITTLEFIELD Permanent , let us hope . Anyway , it 's a very remarkable case . Astonishing . I 've only known one just like it-personally , I mean . MATTHEW ( Astounded . ) Just like it ? LITTLEFIELD Well , pretty much . Happened in Chicago when I was an interne at St. Luke's. p. 65 MATTHEW . Then it 's not -- there 's nothing peculiar about it ? LITTLEFIELD Yes , sir-ree ! Mighty peculiar ! MATTHEW I mean nothing , as you might say , outside nature ? LITTLEFIELD O , bless you , you ca n't get outside nature nowadays ! ( Moves his hands in a wide circle . ) Tight as a durm , no air-holes. - Devilish queer , though-pardon me , Mr. Culpepper  --  really amazing , the power of the mind over the body . CULPEPPER Would you be good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LITTLEFIELD ( Lights a cigarette , as he leans on the edge of the table . ) Do n't have to go to professional medicine for cases . They 're lying around loose . Why , when I was at Ann Arbor-in a fraternity initiation-we bared a chap 's shoulders , showed him a white-hot poker , blindfolded him , told him to stand steady , and-touched him with a piece of ice . A piece of ice , I tell you ! What happened ? Damned if it-pardon me , Mr. Culpepper-blessed if it did n't burn him-carries the sears to this day . Then there was that case in Denver . Ever hear about that ? A young girl , nervous patient . Nails dreven through the palms of her hands , - tenpenny nails , - under the hypnotic suggestion that she was n't being hurt . Did n't leave a cicatrice as big as a bee sting ! Fact ! p. 66 MATTHEW You think my wife 's case is like these ? LITTLEFIELD Precisely ; with religious excitement to help out . ( He points outside . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yonder , dear Dr. Culpepper . MATTHEW They 're worked up enough , if that 's all that 's needed . LITTLEFIELD Worked up ! Elijah in a chariot of fire , distributing cure-alls as he mounts to glory . They 've got their ascension robes on , especially the niggers . CULPEPPER ( With severity . ) I take it you are the late Dr. Martin 's suceessor . LITTLEFIELD I have the honor . CULPEPPER Old Dr. Martin would never have taken a flippant tone in such a crisis . LITTLEFIELD Flippant ? By no menas ! A little light-headed . My profession is attacked . At its very roots , sir .  --  ( With relish . ) As far as that goes , I 'm afraid yours is , too . CULPEPPER ( To BEELER , ignoring the gibe . ) Am I to understand that you countenance these proceedings ? MATTHEW . ( Pointing to the invalid chair . ) If your wife had spent five years helpless in that chair , I guess you 'd countenance any proceedings that set her on her feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife is the woman she was , she would rather sit helpless forever beside the Rock of Ages , than dance and flaunt herself in the house of idols ! MATTHEW ( With depreciating humor . ) O , I guess she ai n't doin ' much flauntin ' of herself in any house of idols.  --  You 've heard Doctor here say it 's all natural enough . Maybe this kind of cure is the coming thing . LITTLEFIELD The Brother would drive us doctors into the poorhouse , if he could keep up the pace . And you preachers , too , as far as that goes . If he could keep up the pace ! Well- ( Sucks at his cigarette deliberately. ) lucky for us , he ca n't keep it up . MATTHEW Why ca n't he keep it up ? LITTLEFIELD Ca n't stand the strain. - Oh , I have n't seen him operate , but I 'm willing to bet his miracles take it out of him ! CULPEPPER ( Takes his hat and goes toward the outer door . ) Miracles , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Doctor ; we 've both in the same boat ! MATTHEW Hope you gentlemen will come back again to-night , and soon , too . Do n't know what 'll happen if things go wrong in there . ( Points towards the hall. ) p. 68 LITTLEFIELD All right-you can count on me- MATTHEW ( To CULPEPPER . ) And you ? CULPEPPER I seldom shirk my duty . ( BEELER closes the door after them . ) ( MARTHA enters from the kitchen , with a pan of dough , which she sets before the fire to raise . ) MATTHEW You keepin ' an eye out , Marthy ? MARTHA Guess your barn ' d ' a ' been afire , if I had n't been keepin ' an eye out . MATTHEW I warned ' em about fire ! MARTHA Haymow ketched . If I had n't been there to put it out , we 'd ' a ' been without a roof by now . MATTHEW Guess I better go keep an eye out myself . MARTHA Guess you had ! ( BEELER goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of setting things to rights  --  gathering up ANNIE 'S toys and arranging the furniture in more precise order . Meanwhile , RHODA enters from the hall with the mother of the sick child , a frail young woman of nervous type . She clings to RHODA feverishly . ) THE YOUNG MOTHER Do n't leave me ! p. 69 WILLIAMS You must n't worry . Your baby will get well . ( RHODA sinks in a low easy chair before the fire , and the woman kneels beside her , her face hidden on the chair arm . ) You must keep up your courage and your trust . That will help more than anything . THE YOUNG MOTHER I 'm afraid ! WILLIAMS Think of those others out there , who are waiting too , without the glimpse of comfort you 've had . THE YOUNG MOTHER ( Bursts out . ) I ai n't had no comfort ! When I heard him pray for my child , I  --  I do n't know  --  I kept sayin ' to myself  --  " O God , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not him . Do n't punish me for his cold words ! " ( MARTHA , who has been listening , shakes her head significantly . ) WILLIAMS Cold words ! THE YOUNG MOTHER Yes , I know it 's wrong I 'll try to feel different . It 's because I ai n't had nothin ' to do with religion for so long  --  If my baby gets well , I 'll make up for it . I 'll make up for everything . ( The woman rises . RHODA kisses her . ) WILLIAMS I shall be here if you want me . And I shall  --  pray for you . ( The mother goes out . Distant singing is heard . MARTHA comes to the mantelpiece with matches , which she arranges in the match tray . She looks at RHODA , who sits with closed eyes. ) p. 70 MARTHA Guess you 're about dead beat . WILLIAMS I think I never was so tired in my life . MARTHA Worry does it , more'n work . Better try and doze off , Rhody . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to MARTHA , and clings nervously to her skirts . ) ANNIE Aunt Martha ! I want to stay with you . You 're the only person in this house that ai n't different . What 's the matter with Mamma ? MARTHA She 's cured , I reckon . ANNIE How did she get cured ? MARTHA You can search me ! ANNIE Did that man cure her ? MARTHA That 's what she says , and I do n't hear him denyin ' it . ANNIE ( Whining . ) I do n't want her to be cured ! MARTHA Annie Beeler ! Do n't want your mother to be cured ? ANNIE No , I do n't . I want her to be like she always has been . She do n't seem like my Mamma at all this way . What 's the matter with all those people out there ? Why do n't we have any supper ? ( She bursts out crying and clings feverishly to MARTHA . ) Oh , what 's going to happen to us ? p. 71 MARTHA There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RHODA , throws a cover over her knees , and draws ANNIE away , speaking low . ) Come out in the kitchen , and I 'll give you your supper . ( Exeunt . The singing grows louder and nearer . MICHAELIS enters from the hall . His hair is dishevelled , his collar open , his manner feverish and distraught . He looks closely at RHODA , sees she is sleeping , then paces the floor nervously , gazing out of the window in the direction of the singing . At length he comes to RHODA again , and bends over her , studying her face . She starts up , confused and terror-stricken , from her doze . ) WILLIAMS What  --  what is the matter ? Oh , you frightened me so ! ( MICHAELIS turns away without answering . ) What has happened ? Why are you here ? MICHAELIS You had dropped asleep . You are weary . WILLIAMS ( Collecting her thoughts with difficulty . ) I was dreaming  --  such a strange dream . MICHAELIS What did you dream ? WILLIAMS I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and you were out there , in the midst of the crowd . MICHAELIS ( Excitedly . ) Go on ! What happened ? p. 72 WILLIAMS I  --  I ca n't remember the rest . MICHAELIS ( Grasps her arm , speaks low . ) You must remember ! Did I  --  succeed ? WILLIAMS ( Helplessly . ) I  --  it 's all a blur ill my mind . MICHAELIS ( Darkly . ) You do n't want me to know that , in your dream , I failed . WILLIAMS No , no . That is not so . ( Pause . She speaks with hesitation . ) Perhaps this is not the time . Perhaps you are not ready . MICHAELIS What does that matter ? He is ready . ( He points at the map . ) WILLIAMS ( Gazing at the map , with mystic conviction . ) You will succeed ! You must succeed ! ( He paces the room . She stops him , pointing toward the hall door . ) How is the child ? ( He hesitates . She repeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He shakes his head gloomily for answer . ) It will get well , I am sure . MICHAELIS If it does not , I am judged . WILLIAMS Oh , do n't say that or think it ! p. 73 MICHAELIS I am weighed in the balance and found wanting ! WILLIAMS You can not hang the whole issue and meaning of your life upon so slight a thread . MICHAELIS The whole issue and meaning of the world hang on threads as slight . If this one is slight . To the mother it is not slight , nor to the God who put into her eyes , as she looked at me , all the doubt and question of the suffering earth . WILLIAMS You must remember that it is only a little child . Its mind is not open . You can not influence it  --  can you ? MICHAELIS Once that little life in my hand would have been as clay in the hands of the potter . If I can not help now , it is because my ministry has been taken from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am weak , and faitful where I am unfaithful . ( Another song rises outside , distant . ) WILLIAMS ( Comes closer to him . ) Tell me this . Speak plainly to me . Is it because of me that your weakness and unfaith have come upon you ? Is it because of me ? MICHAELIS ( Looking at her steadily . ) Yes .  --  ( He comes nearer . ) Before creation , beyond time , God not yet risen from His sleep , you stand and call to me , and I listen in a dream that I dreamed before Eden . p. 74 WILLIAMS ( Shrinking from him . ) You must not say such things to me.  --  You must not think of me so .  --  You must not ! ( He follows her , his passion mounting . ) MICHAELIS All my life long I have known you , and fled from you . I have heard you singing on the hills of sleep and have fled from you into the waking day . I have seen you in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snare me ; on moonlit mountains , laughing and calling ; in the streets of crowded cities , beckoning and disappearing in the crowd  --  and everywhere I have fled from you , holding above my head the sign of God 's power in me , my gift and my mission .  --  What use ? What use ? It has crumbled , and I do not care ! WILLIAMS Oh , do n't speak such words , I beseech you . Let me go . This must not , shall not be ! ( She makes another attempt to escape . He presses upon her until she stands at bay . ) MICHAELIS You are all that I have feared and shunned and missed on earth , and now I have you , the rest is as nothing . ( He takes her , feebly resisting , into his arms . ) I know a place out there , high in the great mountains . Heaven-piercing walls of stone , a valley of trees and sweet water in the midst  --  grass and flowers , such flowers as you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our happiness . A year  --  a month  --  a day  --  what matter ? We will make a life-time of each hour ! p. 75 WILLIAMS ( Yielding to his embrace , whispers . ) Do n't talk . Do n't think . Only  --  love me . A little while . A little while . ( The deep hush of their embrace is broken by a cry from within . The young mother opens the hall door in a distraction of terror and grief . ) THE YOUNG MOTHER Come here ! Come quick ! ( MICHAELIS and RHODA draw apart . He stares at the woman , as if not remembering who she is . ) I ca n't rouse him ! My baby 's gone . Oh , my God , he 's dead ! ( She disappears . RHODA follows , drawing MICHAELIS , dazed and half resisting , with her . The room remains vacant for a short time , the stage held by distant singing . BEELER enters from the kitchen . There is a knock at the outer door , which he opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) LITTLEFIELD Your man has n't vamoosed , has he ? Uncle Abe here says he saw the Indian boy slipping by in the fog .

Right plum ' frough ' im whar he lives . CULPEPPER Mediaeval ! Absolutely mediaeval ! LITTLEFIELD Not a bit of it . It 's up to date , and a little more , too .

BEELER enters , alone , from the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her husband hastens to help her . ) MARY BEELER What is it ? What is the matter ? I thought I heard  --  ( She breaks off , as a murmur of voices rises outside . There is a sound of stumbling and crowiding on the outer steps , and violent knocking . The outer door is forced open , and a crowd of excited people is about to pour into the room . BEELER , the Doctor , and the Preacher are able to force the crowd back only after several have made an entrance . ) MATTHEW Keep back ! You ca n't come in here . ( As he pushes them roughly back , excited voices speak together. ) p. 77 VOICES IN THE CROWD Where is he ?  --  They say he 's gone away . We seen his boy makin ' for the woods .  --  Oh , it 's not true ! Make him come out . MATTHEW Curse you , keep back , I say ! ( RHODA has entered from the hall , and MARTHA from the kitchen .

Here he comes now . ( MICHAELIS appears in the hall door . There is a low murmur of excitement , expectation , and awe among the people crowded in the entrance . BEELER crosses to help his wife , and the other men step to one side , leaving MICHAELIS to confront the crowd alone . Confused , half-whispered exclamations : ) VOICES IN THE CROWD Hallelujah ! Emmanuel ! NEGRO Praise de Lamb . WOMAN ( Above the murmuring voices . ) " He hath risen , and His enemics are seattered . " MICHAELIS Who said that ? ( A woman , obscurely seen in the crowd , lifts her hands and cries again , this time in a voice ecstatic and piercing. ) p. 78 WOMAN " The Lord hath risen , and His enemies are seattered !

( At the news of the child 's death , MRS . BEELER has sunk with a low moan into a chair , where she lies white and motionless . MICHAELIS turns to her . ) And here lies one who rose at my call , and was as one risen ; but now  --  ( He breaks off , raises his hand to her , and speaks in a voice of pleading . ) Arise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left hand . ) Rise up once more , I beseech you !

With side glances at it , he speaks , taking advantage of the lull in conversation which follows BEELER 'S outburst . ) UNCLE ABE Mistah Beelah , ' scuse me troublin ' you , but  --  ' scuse me troublin ' you . MATTHEW What is it , Abe ? UNCLE ABE It 's purty brash o ' me to be askin ' , but  --  Mista Beelah , fur de Lawd 's sake give me that thar devil  --  pictuh ! MATTHEW What do you want with it ? UNCLE ABE Want to hang it up in my ole cabin . ( His tone rises to one of eager pleading . ) Mars Beelah , you give it to me ! For Gawd 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang up in his ole cabin . MATTHEW Well , if you feel as strong as that about it , Abe , take it along . p. 83 UNCLE ABE ( As he unpins it with feverish eagerness . ) Thank ye , Mistah Beelah , thank ye . I 'll wo'k fur ye and I 'll slave fur ye , long as the worl ' stan 's . Maybe it ai n't goin ' to stan ' much longer aftah all . Maybe de chariots comin ' down in de fiery clouds ' fo ' great while . An ' what ' ll yo ' ole Uncle Abe be doin ' ? He ' ll be on his knees ' fo ' a big roarin ' fire , singing hallelujah , an ' a-jammin ' red-hot needles right plum ' frough dis heah back devil 's breas ' bone ! I'se got him now ! I 'll fix 'm . ( Shakes his fist at the print , as he goes toward the kitchen . ) Put yo ' black spell on the Lawd 's chosen , would ye ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus , my ransom , " right out'n yo ' ugly black mouf ! ( Exit . ) MATTHEW There 's a purty exhibition for this present year o ' grace ! Thinks our friend Pan there has bewitched the healer . MARTHA Maybe he has ! MATTHEW Thought you said Rhody done it . MARTHA Same thing , I reckon , by all that you tell about that Panjandrum and his goin 's on ! MATTHEW Nonsense ! MARTHA If you 're so wise , why do you think Michaelis petered out ? MATTHEW Could n't stand the strain . Bit off more ' n he could chaw , in the healin ' line .  --  Never looked at Rhody. p. 84 MARTHA Looked at her till he could n't see nothin ' else , in heaven or earth or the other place . MATTHEW You 're dead wrong . I tell you he never looked cross-eyed at Rhody , nor Rhody at him . Doctor 's more in her line .  --  By the way , did you give the Doctor a snack to stay his stomach ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seems to be mighty exhaustin ' work to tend a sick baby . MATTHEW Does he think it 'll live ? MARTHA Not likely . But he thinks he will , if fed reg'lar.  --  What do you call that trance the baby 's in ? MATTHEW Doctor calls it comy . Spelled it out for me : c-o-m-a , comy . ( BEELER goes out on the porch and disappears . MARTHA continues her task of tidying up the room . MICHAELIS enters from the stair , carrying his hat and a foot-traveller 's knapsack . MARTHA regards him with curiosity , tempered now by feminine sympathy with the defeated . ) MARTHA Good morning , sir . MICHAELIS ( Tonelessly . ) Good morning . MARTHA ( Pointing at his hat and knapsack . ) Hope you ai n't off . Do n't mind sayin ' the way you acted was human decent , sendin ' for Doctor when you found the baby wa' n't dead , an ' you wa' n't no healer any more . p. 85 MICHAELIS Is it any better ? ( MARTHA makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hope . MICHAELIS turns away with bent head . ANNIE enters from the kitchen . MICHAELIS holds out his hand to her , and she takes it with shy hesitation . ) MARTHA Guess you 'd like to know where Rhody is , would n't you ? She 's where she 's been all night ,  --  out yonder with the sick folks . MICHAELIS What is she doing there ? MARTHA Feedin ' ' em , first off , an ' then heart'nin ' of ' em up . That 's a purty hard job , I reckon ; but it 's the way o ' women when they feel like she does . ( MICHAELIS sinks in a chair , drawing ANNIE to him . MRS . BEELER 'S bell rings ; MARTHA goes out by the hall door . ANNIE watches his bent head in silence for a moment . ) ANNIE Are you ever going up again , on the rope ? MICHAELIS ( Not remembering . ) On the rope ? ANNIE You know the magic rope .  --  Ai n't you ever going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Never again , Annie . Never again . p. 86 ANNIE Have you got the rope still ? MICHAELIS No , I have lost it . ANNIE Wo n't you ever find it ? MICHAELIS It can only be found by some one who will know how to use it better than I did . ANNIE How better ? MICHAELIS By some one who can climb up , toward the sun and the stars , and yet never leave the earth , the cities , and the people . ANNIE Then he 'll have to take them up with him . ( MICHAELIS nods for yes . ) Gracious ! ( She runs to the porch door to meet RHODA , who appears outside . ) Cousin Rhoda ! What do you think he says about the magic rope ? WILLIAMS What , Annie ? ANNIE He says that first thing you know , everything will be going up in the air , towns and people and everything . WILLIAMS Does he ? ANNIE ( Runs out into the hall , balancing her arms above her head and gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very tippy ! ( RHODA enters . ) MICHAELIS You are here ! The fear came over me , just now  --  p. 87 WILLIAMS I could not go until I had told you the truth  --  about myself  --  about us . MICHAELIS You will tell me the whole truth , and I will tell you the same . But that will be for later . Come ! Come away with me , into the new life . WILLIAMS A life rooted in the failure of all that life has meant to you from the beginning ! MICHAELIS Until yesterday I did not know what my life was . WILLIAMS You do not know that , even yet . You know it now less than ever  --  what your life is , what it means to you , what it means to the world . MICHAELIS To the world it can mean nothing . That is ended . But to us it can mean happiness . Let us make haste to gather it . Come ! WILLIAMS Where do you want me to go ? MICHAELIS Anywhere  --  to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains . WILLIAMS I was there last night . MICHAELIS In your thoughts ? WILLIAMS I was there , and saw all the beauty of it , all the peace . But one thing was not there , and for lack of it , in a little while the beauty faded and the peace was gone . p. 88 MICHAELIS What was not there ? WILLIAMS The work you have to do . MICHAELIS That was a dream I could not realize . I have striven , and I have failed . WILLIAMS Do you know why you have failed ? MICHAELIS Yes . WILLIAMS Tell me why . MICHAELIS Because I have loved you more than the visions that came to me in desert places , more than the powers that fell upon me at the bedside of the sick , more than the spirit hands and spirit voices that have guided me on my way . WILLIAMS What of the sick and suffering out younder , who are waiting and hoping against hope ? What of them ? MICHAELIS I can not help them . WILLIAMS Once you dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WILLIAMS And who is to blame that that great dream is over ? MICHAELIS No one is to blame . It has happened so . WILLIAMS Does n't it seem strange that the love of a woman entering into your heart should take away such a dream as that ? p. 89 MICHAELIS I do not question . It is so . WILLIAMS But if your love had fallen , by some sad chance , upon a woman who was not worthy of love ? MICHAELIS What are you saying ? WILLIAMS You know less than nothing of me . You have not asked me a single question about my life . MICHAELIS There was no need . WILLIAMS There was need ! There was need ! MICHAELIS Be careful what you say . Go on ! WILLIAMS In the first hour of our meeting , and all the hours of the next day , you swept me along and lifted me above myself , like a strong wind . I did n't know what you were . I did n't know why I was happy and exalted . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had never been as happy as that , or anything like it . Then , yesterday morning , came the revelation of what you were , like a blinding light out of the sky ! And while I stood dazed , trembling , I saw something descend upon you like a shadow . You loved me , and that love was dreadful to you . You thought it was so because I was a woman and stole your spirit 's strength away . But it was not that . It was because I was a wicked woman . MICHAELIS Why do you call yourself a wicked woman ? p. 90 WILLIAMS Because I am so . MICHAELIS I can not believe it . WILLIAMS It is true . MICHAELIS Is that why you wanted to go away ? WILLIAMS Yes , I tried to go away . You would n't let me go . Then I tried to tell you the truth . I knew why I took your strength away , and I had nerved myself to tell you why . But you began to speak  --  those wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in your arms ; and all the power of your soul went from you , and your life went crashing down in darkness . ( Long pause . ) MICHAELIS Wicked ? A wicked woman ? WILLIAMS I was young then , wild-hearted , pitifully ignorant . I thought that love had come to me . Girls are so eager for love . They snatch at the shadow of it .  --  That is what I did .  --  I am not trying to plead for myself .  --  Some things are not to be forgiven .  --  Somewhere in my nature there was a taint  --  a plague-spot.  --  If life is given me , I shall find it and root it out . I only ask for time to do that . But meanwhile I have done what I could . I have told you the truth . I have set you free . I have given you back your mission . ( DR . LITTLEFIELD enters , carrying his hat and medicine case . He looks sharply at RHODA , then turns to MICHAELIS . His manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of covert passion , modified by his habituat cynicism and satire. ) p. 91 LITTLEFIELD ( To RHODA . ) Good morning . ( To MICHAELIS . ) Good morning , my friend . I understood that you sent for me , last night . MICHAELIS I did . LITTLEFIELD Glad to accommodate a fellow practitioner , even if he is in a side line . Some folks think your way of business is a little shady , but Lord , if they knew the secrets of our eharnel-house ! MICHAELIS How did you leave the child ? LITTLEFIELD Done for . I said I was worth a million of you in a case like this , but I did n't realize how far things had gone . The next time , call me in a little sooner . ( He writes on his note pad , tears out a leaf , and lays it on the table . ) Mrs. Beeler will continue the old prescription , alternating with this . ( He puts the note pad in this pocket , and turns to RHODA . He speaks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request . ) Will you walk a ways with me , Miss Williams ? WILLIAMS ( Pale and trembling . ) No . LITTLEFIELD Pardon ! I must have a short talk . It is important . WILLIAMS I can not go with you . p. 92 LITTLEFIELD I think you had better reconsider . MICHAELIS ( Astonished at his tone . ) You have heard that she does not wish to go . LITTLEFIELD ( Ignoring MICHAELIS . ) I have no time to waste , and I shall not stop to mince my words . You are coming with me , and you are coming now . MICHAELIS ( To RHODA . ) Who is this man ? LITTLEFIELD ( Wheeling upon him angrily . ) ' Pon my honor ! " Who is this man ? " " Remove the worm ! " Decidely tart , from a miracle-monger in a state of bankruptey . MICHAELIS ( To RHODA . ) Is this the man you told me of ? WILLIAMS ( Steadily . ) Yes . LITTLEFIELD ( To RHODA , as he eyes MICHAELIS with dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? ( To MICHAELIS . ) Well , since the lady ca n't keep her secrets to herself , this is the man . Very painful , no doubt , but these little things will happen . ( To RHODA . ) I should have chosen a more secluded nook to say this in , but you 're skittish , as I have learned to my cost , and likely to bolt . What I want to say is , do n't bolt . It wo n't do you any good .  --  I 've found you once , and I 'll find you again , no matter what rabbit 's hole you dodge into . ( To MICHAELIS . ) This ai n't George Littlefield , M. D. , talking now . It 's the caveman of Borneo . He 's got arms as long as rakes , and teeth that are a caution .  --  Look out for him ! p. 93 MICHAELIS ( Holding himself in stern restraint . ) Your arms and teeth are long enough , and eager enough to do damage , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other keeping , and I dare to say , better . LITTLEFIELD In other keeping , eh ? Yours , I suppose . MICHAELIS Yes , mine . LITTLEFIELD Bless my soul ! ( He turns to RHODA , pointedly ingnoring MICHAELIS . ) Look here , Rho , be sensible . I 'm tired of this hole of a town already . We 'll go west and renew our youth . Country 's big , and nobody to meddle . You 'll flourish like a green bay tree . ( RHODA turns distractedly , as to escape ; he intercepts her . ) Confound it , if you 're set on it , I 'll marry you ! Say yes , and let John the Baptist here give us his blessing . Speak up . Is it a go ?  --  Till death us do part . MICHAELIS Death has already parted you and her . LITTLEFIELD So ? I feel like a reasonably healthy corpse . MICHAELIS There is no health in you . Every word you speak gives off corruption . LITTLEFIELD Indeed ! My advice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A parecel of loeoed Indians are about right for a busted prophet . p. 94 MICHAELIS What I am is no matter . What this girl is , though you lived a thousand years , you would never have the grace to imagine . She gave you her young love , in childish blindness , not knowing what she did , and you killed it idly , wantonly , as a beast tortures its frail victim , for sport . You find her again , still weak and bleeding from her wounds and you fling her marriage , in words whose every syllable is an insult . Marriage ! When every fibre of her nature must cry out against you , if she is woman . Take your words and your looks from her , and that instantly , or you will curse the day you ever brought your evil presence into her life . ( He advances upon him threateningly . ) Instantly , I say , or by the wrath of God your wretched soul , if you have one , shall go this hour to its account ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping his brazen tone . ) All right .  --  I 'm off .  --  Caveman for caveman , you 've got the reach ! ( To RHODA . ) But remember , my lady , we 're not quits by a jug-full . You 'll hear from me yet . MICHAELIS She shall never hear from you , nor of you . LITTLEFIELD ( In the door . ) Last call , old girl !  --  Women ! ( He goes out , slamming the door behind him . Long pause. ) p. 95 MICHAELIS Poor child ! Poor child ! WILLIAMS I am sorry that you have had to suffer this . MICHAELIS It is you who have suffered . ( MARATHA enters from the hall , wheeling MRS . BEELER in the invalid chair . She lies lower than in the first act , her manner is weaker and more dejected . RHODA , whose back is turned , goes on as the two women enter . ) WILLIAMS I deserve to suffer , but it will always be sweet to me that in my need you defenued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MICHAELIS goes to MRS . BEELER ; she gives him her left hand as at first . ) MARY BEELER My poor friend ! ( MARATHA , resigning the chair to RHODA , goes out . MRS . BEELER looks up at RHODA anxiously . ) What were you saying when I came in ? ( As RHODA does not answer , she turns to MICHAELIS . ) Something about your defending her .  --  Against what ? MICHAELIS Nothing . Her nature is its own defence . MARY BEELER ( Caressing her . ) Ah , no ! She needs help . She can not bear it that this disaster has come , through her . It has made her morbid . She says things about herself , that make me tremble . Has she spoken to you  --  about herself ? p. 96 MICHAELIS She has laid her heart bare to me . MARY BEELER That is good . Young people , when they are generous , always lay disaster at their own door . ( She kisses RHODA . The girl goes into the porch , where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinks back in her chair again , overtaken by despondency . ) Is n't it strange that I should be lying here again , and all those poor people waking up into a new day that is no new day at all , but the old weary day they have known so long ? Is n't it strange , and sad ? MICHAELIS I ask you not to lose hope . MARY BEELER ( Rousing from her dejection into vague excitement . ) You ask me that ?  --  Is there  --  any hope ? Oh , do n't deceive me  --  now ! I could n't bear it now !  --  Is there any hope ? MICHAELIS A half-hour ago I thought there was none . But now I say , have hope . MARY BEELER ( Eagerly . ) Do you ? Do you ? Oh , I wonder  --  I wonder if that could be the meaning  --  ? MICHAELIS The meaning  --  ? MARY BEELER Of something I felt , just now , as I sat there in my room by the open window . p. 97 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how to describe it .  --  It was like a new sweetness in the air . ( She looks out at the open window , where the spring breeze lightly wafts the curtains . ) MICHAELIS The lilacs have opened during the night . MARY BEELER It was not the lilacs.  --  I get it now again , in this room . ( She looks toward the lilies and shakes her head . ) No , it is not the lilies either . If it were anyone else , I should be ashamed to say what I think . ( She draws him down and speaks mysteriously . ) It is not real flowers at all ! ( Song rises outside-faint and distant . ) MICHAELIS What is it to you ? MARY BEELER It is like  --  it is like somekindness in the air , some new-born happiness  --  or a new hope rising . Now you will think I am  --  not quite right in my mind , as Mat does , and Martha ! MICHAELIS Mrs. Beeler , there is such a perfume about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses which suffering and a pure soul have made fine beyond the measure of woman . There is a kindness in the air , new-born happiness , and new-risen hope . p. 98 MARY BEELER From whose heart does it rise ? MICHAELIS From mine , from Rhoda 's heart , though she knows it not , from yours , and soon , by God 's mercy , from the heart of this waiting multitude . ( The song , though still distant , grows louder . MRS . BEELER turns to MICHAELIS and gazes intently into his face . ) MARY BEELER The light has come into your face again ! You are  --  you are  --  Oh , my brother , what has come to you ? MICHAELIS I have shaken off my burden . Do you shake off yours . What is pain but a kind of selfishness ? What is dis- ease but a kind of sin ? Lay your suffering and your sickness from you as an out-worn garment . Rise up ! It is Easter morning . One comes , needing you . Rise up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to meet RHODA , entering from the porch . ) WILLIAMS Aunt Mary ! You are walking again ! MARY BEELER He told me to arise , and once more my dead limbs heard . WILLIAMS God in His mercy be thanked ! MARY BEELER I rose without knowing what I did . It was as if a wind lifted me . WILLIAMS Yes , yes . For good , this time ! p. 99 MARY BEELER So different from yesterday . I was still weak then , and my limbs were heavy . Now I feel as if wings were on my shoulders . ( She looks toward the outer door , and listens to the singing , now risen to a more joyful strain . ) I must go out to them . ( She turns to MICHAELIS . ) Say that I may go out , and give them the good tidings of great joy . MICHAELIS May the Lord be with you as you go ! ( To RHODA , who starts to help her aunt . ) Alone ! MARY BEELER Yes , alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lily from the vase , and lifting it above her head , goes out through the porch , which is now flooded with sunshine . As she goes out she says : ) The Easter sun has risen , with healing in its wings ! ( She crosses the porch and disappears . ) WILLIAMS I felt something dragging me back . It was Aunt Mary 's spirit . MICHAELIS No , it was mine . WILLIAMS Yours ? MICHAELIS My spirit , crying to you that I was delivered . WILLIAMS I delivered you . That is enough happiness for one life . MICHAELIS You delivered me , yes . But not as you dream . Yesterday when the multitude began to gather , the thing I had been waiting for all my life was there , and I  --  because of you  --  I was not ready . In that blind hour my life sank in ruin .  --  I had thought love denied to such as had my work to do , and in the darkness of that thought disaster overwhelmed me.  --  I have come to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , but gives it as a beautiful and simple gift to them all .  --  Upon each head be the use that is made of it ! p. 100 WILLIAMS It is not I  --  who  --  harm you ? MICHAELIS It is you who bless me , and give me back the strength that I had lost . WILLIAMS I ? MICHAELIS A little while ago you told me your life 's bitter story . I tasted your struggle , went down with you into the depths of your anguish , and in those depths ,  --  the miracle ! Behold , once more the stars looked down upon me from their places , and I stood wondering as a child wonders . Out of those depths arose new-born happiness and new-risen hope . For in those star-lit depths of pain and grief , I had found at last true love . You needed me . You needed all the powers I had thrown away for your sake . You needed what the whole world needs  --  healing , healing , and as I rose to meet that need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my soul . WILLIAMS Oh , if I thought that could be ! MICHAELIS By the mystery that is man , and the mercy that is God , I say it is so .  --  ( Puts his hand on her head , and gazes into her face . ) I looked into your eyes once , and they were terrible as an army with banners . I look again now , and I see they are only a girl 's eyes , very weak , very pitiful . I told you of a place , high in the great mountains . I tell you now of another place higher yet , in more mysterious mountains . Let us go there together , step by step , from faith to faith , and from strength to strength , for I see depths of life open and heights of love come out , which I never dreamed of till now ! ( A song rises outside , nearer and louder than before. ) p. 101 WILLIAMS Against your own words they trust you still . MICHAELIS It was you who held them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them now . MICHAELIS ( As he kisses her . ) Until the victory ! ( The song rises to a great hymn , of martial and joyous rhythm . They go together to the threshold . They look at each other in silence . RHODA speaks , with suppressed meaning . ) WILLIAMS Shall it be  --  on earth ? MICHAELIS On the good human earth , which I never possessed till now ! WILLIAMS But now  --  these waiting souls , prisoned in their pain  --  MICHAELIS By faith all prisoned souls shall be delivered . WILLIAMS By faith . MICHAELIS By faith which makes all things possible , which brings all things to pass . ( He disappears . RHODA stands looking after him . The young mother hurries in . ) THE YOUNG MOTHER ( Ecstatic , breathless . ) Come here  --  My baby ! I believe  --  I do believe  --  ( She disappears. ) p. 102 WILLIAMS ( Following her . ) I believe . I do believe !
