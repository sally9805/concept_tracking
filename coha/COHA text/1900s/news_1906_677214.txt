txt In an interview to-day on the decision of the Missouri Supreme Court , Attorney General Hadley said : " The decision , as I understand , is all that I have asked for . I shall now ask Henry - Wollnrn to present the decision to Justice Gildersleeve and ask for an order requiring H. H. Rogers to answer the questions I put to him . Those questions/ referred to the stock ownership , and since the Missouri Supreme Court has decided that , Justice Gildersleeve will doubtless order Rogers to answer , not all , perhaps , but the most important of my questions . " Frank Hagerman , Missouri attorney for the Standard Oil Company , said : " That decision suits everybody except the Standard Oil Company . " Henry Wellman , New York counsel for Attorney General Hadley , received a telegram from his client yesterday , which informed him that the Supreme Court of Missouri had rendered a favorable decision in the matter of compelling recalcitrant witnesses to answer material questions propounded to them in the action taken by Missouri to bar the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of the State . When the details of the decision , as received by THE NEW Yoxa TIMES , were shown him , Mr. Wellman was overjoyed . He said : " It not only means that H. H. Rogers will be compelled to reply to the questions which he ' declined to answer on advice of counsel ' during the New York hearing , but that failure on the part of the foreign oil companies against whom the action is instituted to produce any witness wanted by the court will have the effect of canceling their right to do business in Missouri . " On the face of it , this would include John D. Rockefeller and every other witness who has fled from the process of the law . I do not know whether Mr. Rockefeller is an officer of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana , which is one of the respondents in the suit instituted by Missouri , but he is an officer of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey , which owns the stock of the former corporation . William Rockefeller is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser lights who are fugitives front our process servers . " The effect of the decision will be sweeping , as , indeed , it should . It is an outrage that men like John D. Rockefeller should evade the service of legal papers when it is only by the protection of the law that they enjoy their property . " At any rate , Mr. Rogers and other Standard Oil officials who dodged questions before Special Commissioner Sanborn will have to tell what they know . I shall make application before Justice Gildersleeve ' to-morrow for an order compelling Mr. Rogers to answer the questions . When we get through with him we will turn our attention to the other witnesses . " Just as soon as I can secure the necessary order Attorney General Hadley will come to New York and the hearing will be recommenced in earnest . There are several witnesses under subpoena , including William G. Rockefeller , son of William and nephew of John D. , ' who are still to be put on the stand . John D.

Fire in the four-story house , 89 West Thirty-fifth Street , occupied by Dr. George Franklin Shiels and his family , caused much excitement in Broadway about 8 o'clock last evening and alarmed some of the patrons of the big apartment hotels near by . The Collingswood Hotel is one door west of the Shies home and the Gregorian is directly across the street . A hundred yards further is the Garrick Theatre . The flames started on the fourth floor of the house , which is owned by Dr. W. T. Bull , and soon burned through the roof , rising high in the air . Occupants of the Collingswood looked down from their windows into the heart of the blaze . The management notified everybody in the hotel that there was a fire near by and many patrons left their rooms , carrying their valuables . There was less alarm at the Gregorian . Persons bound for the Garrick satisfied their curiosity and then went in and took their seats .
