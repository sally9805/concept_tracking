The sympathetic pencil of Howard Pyle lends great harmony to the new illustrated edition of Dr. Weir Mitchell 's ' Hugh Wynne , Free Quaker ' ( The Century Company ) .

A new octavo edition of St Augustine 's ' Confessions , ' limited to 150 copies for the United States , comes from the Chiswick press through the J. B. Lippincott Co .

There is one mark of carelessness : why should the headline on page 3 represent the work as " In Thirteen Books , " when , as the title-page sets forth , but ten are given ? The traditional last three books , of course , form no part of the ' Confessions , ' but are a commentary on Genesis , and as such are properly omitted from later editions . ' " Beautiful Thoughts " from Robert and Elizabeth Browning ' ( James Pott &; Co ) is arranged as a book of days , but quite without regard to season  --  as must needs generally be the case The selections might be shuffled and redated at random , and no one would be the wiser .

It is a relief , therefore , on taking up a volume on African animals to find it to be not exactly of this character . The volume in hand has more about the animals than about the author ; it is founded on personal observations which are of such quality as to induce regret at the smallness of their number .

It is an excellent piece of work , and though the scale on which it is drawn does not , of course , permit much in the way of indicating individual holdings , save the greater and more compact estates , nearly everything else is to be found here , ecclesiastical divisions , foundations , and centres , as well as political divisions , franchises , and municipal arrangements .

Sociology and anthropology especially should be studied in the interest of mankind , and as leading up to a positive system of ethics . Sciences should not be distinguished according to their logical or . chronological order , but with a new to their relations to human needs and the attainment of a moral end Anthropology is " the Philosophy of human life " This is rather lofty ground to start from , and questions difficult of solution are propounded . In the course of the work , a number of dicta are enunciated and the activities of human life are generally classified and pigeon-holed . The treatment is largely psychological , and shows much reading and thought ; but it can not be said that we are yet advanced beyond the clear-cut system of Herbert Spencer . The present volume labors under the difficulties attendant upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact which perhaps indicates that the time for successful classification of the youthful social sciences is not yet What is needed in those departments of science is , not so much ingenious classification according to some a-priori norm , as careful and painstaking research and patient analysis of data . When this has been done , classification will appear in sound and enduring form Galveston is the principal subject of the National Geographic Magazine ( Washington ) for October . Mr. W. J. McGee treats of its geologic conditions , asserting that the sandbank or " storm-record " on which it is built is half-a-mile in depth , the worst existing foundation for a city , and that the subsidence of the Gulf Coast is not less than a foot per century . From these data he believes that another disaster will follow the rebuilding of the city on its former site . Prof E. B.

The southern part of the kingdom , however , is Wholly undeveloped , though admirably suited for both agriculture and grazing . Capt WelIby 's route over the unexplored region between Lake Rudolf and the Sobat will probably be adopted for the transcontinental telegraph and railway , as it avoids the swamps of the White Nile , and passes through an easily traversed country of extraordinary fertility , but sparsely inhabited . Among his fols lowers were several Abyssinians , the first to leave their country , on an expedition of this kind . Although not picked men , they served well and honestly throughout the journey to Cairo .

Indolence , neglect , decay have set their mark on everything . Roads have degenerated into tracks , and these are being abandoned for the riverbeds on some great thoroughfares . The old French plantations are overgrown with jungle ; a comparatively small tract near the capital , which once had an annual revenue of four million dollars , does not produce now as many thousands . The people in the interior live , as in Central Africa , on wild fruits , go almost naked , and spend their time in dancing , cock-fighting , and the loathsome rites of Vaudoux , or snake-worship . Considering all this and the natural resources of the republic , its rich soil , mahogany forests , and great mineral wealth , the saying is no doubt true that Hayti is at once the richest and poorest country foo its size in the world .

Dr. Sievers contributes to number six an historical review of the progress of exploration in South America during the past century , with a map for each decade . The last shows that the still unknown regions are in central Brazil . in the province of MaLto Grosso , and the northern part of the Gran Chaco . Number seven contains a description of some of the numerous volcanoes of Guatemala and Salvador , by Dr C Sapper , and the geological results of Baron Toll 's explorations in northern Asia and the New Siberia Islands .

This is followed by Prof. M. Weber 's account of the recent voyage of the Netherland ship Saoga for the investigation of the marine fauna and flora of the Indian Archipelago . ? The Atlantic for October contains an interesting article on " John Ruskin as an Art Critic , " by Prof. Charles H. Moore , which has the merit of being more judicial and discriminating in tone than most of the " appreciations " which have appeared since his death . On one point not technical , what Mr. Moore has to say is interesting , if not new . Ruskin dwelt continually upon the influence upon art of moral conditions and the reaction of art itself upon moral character . Mr. Moore holds with him to the extent of insisting that " the works of man inevitably reflect his character , moral or immoral as the case may be , " and that consequently , wherever great art exists , " there must have been fine moral fibre somewhere back of it , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessors . " And , vice versa , if the race decays morally , art will decay too . The Greeks developed a noble art , but " the relaxed moral restraints and the coarser sentiments of the later Greek civilization are mirrored in the later art of Greece . " As to the counter influence of art on moral character , he thinks that when there is a predisposition to virtue , art will quicken A. This is a very moderate confirmation of the Ruskinianview , and will hardly be accepted byRuslcimans ; but can any one go further  --  except to point out , perhaps , what some of the antiRuskinians neglect to observe , that if art is not produced by morality , neither is t produced by immorality ? If it were , a high general level of art would have been secured long ago .

Now one fashionable hobby in modern intellectual education is to find out the strong predilection of the student and to cultivate that . Another is - to make all study attractive and agreeable both in kind and in method . The student comes to the leader " with a bill of rights in his hands , " and says , " Mind , you must not be , dull , or I will go to sleep , you must attract me , or I shall not get on an inch ; you must rivet my attention , or my thoughts will wander " Education was formerly too ascetic and disciplinary , and we have gone to the opposite extreme .

Harper 's leading article is a paper on Wei-Hai-Wei , by Poulteney Bigelow . There is also another Chinese article ( the magazines this month provide a number of them ) , by H. H. Lowry , on " The Chinese Resentment . " Mr. Bigelow , who has a keen interest in military questions , discusses the much-mooted point as to the possibility of making soldiers of the Chinese , and inclines to the affirmative He quotes Capt Barnes , who was sent out last year to drill Chinese recruits at Wei-Hai-Wei , as saying that they are marvellously quick at learning the drill , and easily disciplined Gordon made an " ever-victorious " army out of them , at least against other Chinese , and there is no reason to suppose they are any less brave than other races . What Mr. Bigelow 's reflections suggest , though he does not actually say so , is that the real difficulty lies in what produces so many ether difficulties for China  --  its self-satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still has one , on paper , but it is easy to see how , with isolation once established  --  as it was until very recently ? the army would first cease to become important and finally degenerate into an untrained mob . The antipathy to foreigners ( a corollary of isolation ) would inevitably tend to prevent any modernizing of the army , and its gradual degradation would tend to just that contempt for the soldier and his calling which all foreigners have noticed . Isolation is at an end , and selfsatisfaction probably can not survive it for ever ; and there will soon be , among European nations , a great competition for the privilege of drilling Chinese soldiers . Mr. Lowry , like most of the other writers of this month 's essays on the Chinese crisis , pleads for sympathy with the Chinese in their resentment against foreigners . They have certainly had provocation " May we not believe , " says - WM Lowry quaintly , " that the highest type of civilization posSE sses no inherent right to oppress and exterminate weaker nations with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , oh brothhr , with reference to China , but not as to the Philippines Mr. Lowry would have the Powers first insist on the public execution of the leaders in the recent outrages , then " at once and for ever abandon the thought of dismemberment , " and then leave the missionaries to go on with their good work of converting the Chinese . But if his general view of the subject is correct , the " foreign devils " who have fomented the policy of dismemberment , and forced on " leases " and " spheres of influence , " and the missionaries , who have protected native Chinese rascals against their own Government , on the plea that they were Christians , are almost as responsible for what has happened as Prince Tuan or the Empress Dowager ? The Century has the best collection of Chinese articles , beginning with Ernst von Hesse-Wartegg 's account of the country of Confucius , " China 's Holy Land " ? a visit to the tomb of Confucius Wu Ting Fang , the Minister at Washington , contributes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheridan P Read , formerly United States Consul at Tientsin , a paper on " The Chinese as Business Men , " full of valuable information This number contains the last instalment of John Morley 's sumptuously illustrated Life of Cromwell . and contains the author 's somewhat hazily expressed estimate of the Protector 's character . He shares , it seems , the opinion of Guizot that Cromwell , William III , and Washington must be looked upon " as chief and representative of sovereign crises that have settled the destinies of nations " ; but if we go on , and ask what was Cromwell 's " special share in a mission so supreme , " we find that his dominant power lay in " his military genius , " which was certainly not the case with either William III . or Washington It was Cromwell 's " armed right hand " that " crushed the absolutist pretensions alike of crown and mitre , " and struck blows for race , state , and liberty which " forced the three kingdoms into a ? single state " " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies on this occasion or the other , after we have scanned all the secondary features of his rule , this is still what , in a single sentence , defines the true place of Cromwell in our history . " But his work died with him , at least for the time , and he left England so impoverished that Richard Cromwell had to beg Mazarin to lend him fifty thousand pounds ; and the Stuarts came back with the Act of Uniformity , the Test Act , the Conventicle Act , the Five-Mile Act , and " the rest of the apparatus of Church privilege and proscription " in their train . These facts lie en the surface , It is significant that Crom well 's latest Liberal biographer emphasizes them Mr. Morley suggests that Cromwell was a man of the end of the Middle Ages , rather than a leader of the modern movement , though this too does not satisfy us , for the Middle Ages were not Puritanic Perhaps the descendants of the Puritans in this country , at any rate such as have not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can hardly be accident that has turned him into one of the idols of the school who hold , shyly as yet in England , but nakedly in Germany , that might is a token of right , and that the strength and power of the state is an end that tests and justifies all means " The Cavaliers , on coming in again , unanimously voted that it was necessary to teach the Puritans a salutary lesson . They accordingly dug up Cromwell 's , Ireton 's , and Bradshaw 's carcasses , decapitated them , buried their bodies under the gallows , and stuck their heads on poles set up on the spot where Charles I. had been condemned . The same thing is done in China to-day . With neither Puritan nor Cavalier does Mr. Morley really sympathize Nor do most of us ? In Scribner 's , Henry Norman begins a series of papers on the " Russia of To-day , " the first instalment of which deals with " The ' Pam Capitals , " and is accompanied by illustrations " from the author 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not set off fireworks or cut capers , is an instructive reporter . In the present instance , after the first page , he practises much self-restraint . He points out that in order to understand the Russia of to-day , we must not overlook the fact that the Russians have ceased to be a mimetic nation ; though they do import American engimes , they no longer copy Western civilization . To be Russian to-day is to be patriotic , to be Muscovite  --  not to follow the mode of the outside world , but to wait confidently " till the outside world shall learn that the Russian mode is better , and shall lay aside its heathenism , its parliamentarianism , its socialism , the license it calls liberty , and all its other wickednesses , and walk in the only path of religious truth and social security . " In other words , " Russianism " is cultivated by modern Russians just as what the French call " PanBrrtainism " is cultivated m England . The same movement is going on in every leading country in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young thinkers hold that , whatever it may mean , the great object in life is to be " American . " The strange part of it is , that no nation thinks well of the movement in any other . The new patriotism has behind it quite a different sentiment from the old " nationality " feeling of fifty years ago , which helped on , for instance , the creation of modern Italy . The old nationality movement was humanitarian , liberal , and sympathetic . We in. the United States sympathized with it in Hungary , in Poland , in Italy , in Ireland . One of its latest manifestations ( in recrudescence , perhaps ) is the sympathy felt in the United States for the Boers But the new nationality movement , whether in Russia , China , or " Pan-Britain , " is essentially local , exclusive , selfish , reactionary , and often oppressive . Mr. Norman confirms the impression which most foreign observers have given , that the germs of modern civilization hardly yet exist in Russia . Not only ss it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces occasional summariness , although the volume contains nine hundred pages ; and yet ; in spite of this , no group , no single of notice has been slurred over . A very noteworthy feature consists in the introduction of chapters on the contempo ' rary press ( M. Leo Claretie ) ) and scientific literature ( Id . Brunhes ) , both of which indicate a wider view of the literary field than is - common in academic treatises . Readers of the chapter on4emoires will doubtless be disconcerted on that several of Marbot 's most telling lassages are here shown to have been put together de chic ; while all students realize with still greater regret the termination of a scholarly career in M. Joseph Texte 's last utterances on the literary relations of France with other countries , M. Brunet 's contribution on Linguistics shows equal fulness and detail with his earlier work , and holds , in the matter of purity , the via media between conservative classicism and the more modern tendency towards uncritical innovation . A brief conclusion by the editor , though somewhat gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthily completes this monument , which remains as the joint product of perhaps the most carefully selected literary association of our time .
