txt Mrs. Paul E. Roy , known to London , Paris , and New York as Glacia whose brother , George Carkins , was recently killed by her husband at her home near Portsmouth , N. H. , got out some of the newspaper clippings referring to her history and the killing of her brother , yesterday , and told a . TIMES reporter as much as she said she could remember of the story of her life . The story was quite mild in comparison with some of the published accounts with which Miss Calla disagrees . ' " I see that one enterprising young newspaper person , " said she , " has fished out of the New Hampshire records what he apparently thinks is the certificate of my birth , and after more or leas careful figuring has learned that I am about thirty-nine years old . That is really amusing when you know that nowhere on this earth is there a record of that important event . As for my being nearly forty years old , that is ridiculous . I am not twenty-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore you can guess that I am somewhere in between those two points . - Then there has been so much guesswork about the name Glacia Calla , by which I am best known . I have always been known by that name , but where it came from I must confess I do not know myself . At any rate . I have been told that de Calla ' might be more exactly correct , and I have also been told by a lawyer that the name may possibly be my very own by every right . " My childhood was not very different from that of any other girl . I went to the same kind of schools and had the same kinds of fun , and when I was about sixteen I was sent to the Franklin School in Boston . " It was while a schoolgirl In Boston that I met the man Southern , whom I married soon afterward . I think he was a millinery Irummer then . One of my schoolgirl friends introduced him to me , and , being more easily impressed then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment for him , and I was just sixteen years old when I promised to marry him . I can see the minister that married us now . I told him I was eighteen years old , and he looked at me with what I thought was a sort of doubtful gleam In his otherwise quite solemn eyes . They Soon Separated . " Southern and I did not agree , and after two months we separated . There was a short reconciliation , and then he dropped out of my life . I do not know where he is now . It is untrue any children were born of that marriage , as has been printed . " I dropped out of sight after the Southern Incident , and in course of time I went to Parts , where , as a young woman just out of my teens I began my musical studies under Mme. Marches ! . A schoolmate of mine at Marcheers was Miss Ellen Beach Yaw , the American singer , who is to appear at the Metropolitan Opera House next week . " There I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I was introduced by Miss Yaw . It was at a concert that we met . In two weeks we were fast friends , and I never had occasion to regret that friendship . Some of the stories about the Baroness have been cruel in the extreme . About that time I met the French painter , Jobert , for whom I sat for a picture that was shown at the Salon of 1903 . He was a charming man , with a charming wife , and the stories about theincident at my home in Paris , where he is said to have kissed all the women present and done other things as ridiculous , is as untrue as most of the other things that have been said about me . " At that dinner were some of the bestknown people in Paris , among them being the Marquise de Frayseix , Mr. Atlee , the British Consul General , and his wife ; Holman Black : the well-known American ; the Samuel Newhouses. and the Count and Countess de Thoury . The dinner did not-end in a riot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported . ? It was soon after this , I think , that I met the Count de Beynac , not Peynac , as some of the American papers have spelled it . He was a fine man , and I thought a great deal of him and had fully made up my mind to marry him . He was so anxious to marry me that he said I could dispose of every bit of property that I had , so as to give him a chance to prove he was not marrying me for my money . Oh , yes ! Prince Helie de Sagan also was an acquaintance . She Was a Near-Countess . " I even had my cards engraved as the Countess de Beynac. so certain was I that I was to marry de Beynac . Then came the change in our plans , and in 1905 I met the man who was to be the cause of the great sorrow of my life . I refer to Paul , Roy . This was about three years ago . I wanted a pair of horses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know why , but I took a fancy to the man , and was seen with him a great deal , so much in fact that I realized that my reputation might suffer If I did not marry him . " He followed me across the ocean , and last October I met him in Boston and married him , and he went back to our Xarm near Portsmouth with me . He simply would not work  --  just lived there , with me footing all the bills . I gave him money to pay the accounts , and now I find all the bills coming in again . " He kept all the money , allowing me to think he was paying the debts , as he told me he was doing . He never liked my brother , but I never thought he would go so far as to shoot him . I only/ hope they will send him back , so that twelve Americans will have a chance to pass on the case . " I Miss Calla was asked if it was true that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money from an Italian nobleman . " Yes , it is true , " she replied . " My lawyer said I had ' every right to the money . " How about the Shah of Persia ; was he as good a friend to you as has been said ? " " Let 's not worry about the poor old Shah . He is dead now . But he was very nice to me . " And King George of Greece ; what about him ? ' " Like the Shah , he was very nice . He went back to Greece , and I came home to America . I hope he retains as pleasant an impression of me as he seemed to have at that time . " As for my New York friends , " added Mrs. Roy , " there are many , and among them are some , of the best-known people in this city , some of whom have enterItained me . But what 's the use of bringIng them into - the story ; some of them might be unkind enough to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
