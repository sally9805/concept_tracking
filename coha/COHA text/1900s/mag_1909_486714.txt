Cris &met; quo nonquam amatut , quique antavit eras amet Houghton Mifflin Co has issued the first part of the work ( s. e . Walton 's part ) as one of their special Riverside editions , on handmade paper , with wood-blocks engraved by M Lamont Brown , after the cuts of fish in the original . The book is small enough in size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " roomy pocket , and it has every attraction - which we have come to expect from the printing done under the supervision of Bruce Rogers We are inclined to name George Hodges 's " Garden of Eden " ( Houghton Mifflin Co. ) as the vulgarest production of the press this Year . It is an attempt to rewrite for the comprehension of children a number of stories from the first nine books of the Old Testament , the result is a translation of biblical language into a kind of smart " journalese " ( with incongruous relics of the original intermixed ) which it is not good for any child 's ear to hear , and a translation of biblical miracles into commonplace absurdities which are an insult to any child 's imagination and understanding . As an example , a mild one , of Dean Hodges 's Jaunty style , we ' may quote his version of Moses on Sinai " God told me that He would speak to us in that place . I am going up to meet Him " And he took with him a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people , " I 'll I con e back and tell you what God says " As an example of his rationalizing we may refer to the account of the passage of the Red Sea , which changes the marvellous to the pseudo-scientific action of wind and cloud and water Dean Hodges has a surprising knowledge of things which may never have happened at all We have given space to this criticism of a poor book because it is handsomely printed and illustrated , in a manner to attract unsuspecting buyers In dealing with the first two volumes of Prof J. E Spingarn 's " Critical Essays of the Seventeenth Century " ( the Nation , June 18 , 1908 ) , we called attention to the excellence of the editing and solid erudition of the introduction . The third volume , now before us , gives no occasion to withdraw any word of that commendation . Though , perhaps , the essays in this volume as a whole are more even in quality , due to the growing consciousness of literary procedure , they contain nothing so fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the earlier issue Yet we have here hints of the great quarrel of the ancients and the moderns in the essays of Sir William Temple , and the beginning of the bitter attack on the Restoration stage in the work of Jeremy Collier Even more interesting is William Congreve 's discussion of the nature of " humors " which introduces us to one of the great topics of English letters We get a glimpse far backward and forward in his remark " that there is more of humor in our English comic writers than in any others . And what appears to me to be the reason of it is the greater freedom , privilege , and liberty which the common people of England enjoy " The same remark is made later by Horace Walpole In a note to John Dennis 's " Impartial Critic . " Professor Spingarn observes that " only one or two of Dennis 's critical essays have been reprinted since that date when Johnson said that " he wished to see John Dennis 's ' Critical Works ' collected " , and the larger task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth doing , we think ; and Professor Spingarn would confer a favor on scholars by undertaking the task . It remains only to say that the notes of the present volume show the same accuracy and care as do those to the two earlier volumes Dumas may be tasted by English and American readers , not as romancer alone , but also as the writer of " My Memoirs " ( The Macmillan Co ) , and the same publishers now issue the supplementary volume , " Mes Hetes , " newly translated , as " My Pets , " by Alfred Allinson With sixteen vivacious drawings by V. Lecomte , this last book makes a most attractive volume of three hundred pages ; and one of the few works of the novelist which may be starred pour /a jeunesse . Each of the chapters is lighted up by the sunny humor of the romancer , ' who , in his life , whether in Paris or , as here , " in my solitude at Monte Cristo , " was as extravagant as in his wildest tales . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love solitude , " he writes " For those who can appreciate the charms , solitude is the most loving of mistresses . . . Society ' is the distraction of the body ; love the occupation of the heart ; solitude the religion of the soul . " But Dumas loved no lonely solitude , nor even a solitude a deux , save at rare intervals He was surrounded , in town er villeggiature , by friends  --  colleagues  --  collaborators  --  servants  --  parasites ; this from first to last But it the book before us it is his animal comrades in which he is most deeply interested ; end most deeply interests his readers Dogs there are in greatest abundance ; dog heroes and dog rogues , romantic dogs and dogs picaresque The cats , Mysouff I and Mysouff II , interest us less ; so , too , the residents of the aviary , eaten up by one of the Mysouffs , we forget just which ; a green monkey or two and a blue macaw communicate an exotic touch But enough of enumeration Dumas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be read straight off , cover to cover , notwithstanding the entertaining style of it . Three hundred pages of anecdote are not to be bolted . But where could one ever find for the country hcuse book-shelf ( no matter how many feet to it ) a better book than " My Pets " ? " Hints on House Furnishing , " by W Shaw Sparrow ( John Lane Co ) , is a diffuse and chatty book , but for that reason calculated to beguile the British householders , to whom primarily it is directed After a general introduction ? on various methods of furnishing , on taste , color , and the English tradition , there are specific chapters on the treatment of walls , floors , ceilings , and finally on furniture and fittings . It is H , practical book , even to giving the addresses of firms  --  in London , naturally In general Mr Sparrow is a safe and genial guide . He is ingenious in his method of teaching For example , the cardinal points in righteousness of color are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of speculative building and of dealer-made fashions in decoration the author attack . evils quite as glaring here as in England In his passion for sound and simple construction , in his dislike of naturalistic design , and his offishness towards overtly patterned hangings and carpets , he is distinctly on the side of the angels Idiosyncrasy perforce affects a book of this sort Few , perhaps , will share his antipathy to the pale greens , most useful colors when the setting is right . Again , does every wall require ' a frieze , and is it all the better for a dado ? We think not . It all depends upon the use of the wall , whether it is to be a composition in itself , or a mere background for a composition made up of pictures and furniture Mr Sparrow nowhere sufficiently sets forth the merits of tinted plaster , preferably roughcast , as a wall finish It is difficult to get it done well , but few textures are more permanently satisfactory . Combed paint , too , has its appeal , but here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reasonably well-to-do The volume is well illustrated with typical English interiors , the usefulness of which to American householders is limited . Still , the doctrine is the thing , and since the book makes for rational taste we wish it a wide reading S. G Tallentyre 's " Life of Mirabeau " ( Moffat , Yard &; Co ) is a very inferior book to that of Professor Fling on the same subject , which we reviewed favorably twelve months ago . It is far less learned , and much more pretentious . It adds nothing to our knowledge of the subject , whether by way of new facts , or of new points of view . It echoes throughout the notes of Macaulay and Carlyle , and the style is after the manner of the latter Dr. Arthur C.

The description is minute : forty-five closely printed pages contain the list of the authorities used . Its accuracy is vouched for by Prof. Frederick J. Turner and J B. McMaster. who critically read the work before publication The book will have small attraction for those who read merely for pleasure The sober student , however , will find here the bases of Illinois 's history clearly and fully discussed .

Adolf MfilIer 's " Der Galilei-Prozess ( 16321613 ) nach Grsprung , Verlauf und Folgen " ( Freiburg in Breisgau ?

Dr. William Torrey Harris , former United States commissioner of education , died at Providence , It . I , November 5 . His work as an educator had gained him an international reputation . Long before his . appointment by President Harrison he had impressed the educational methods of the country by introducing into the public scho ol system of St , , Louis the first successful ' course of nature study in the country .

He was also a lover of the classics , and was especially fond of medimkral Latin hymns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , literature , and customs . His versatility as a scholar is partly suggested by the fact that , while he was regarded as one of the two greatest contemporary exponents of Hegel , and as a keen critic of modern economic thought , he kept in touch with the latest developments in both experimental and pure science , and was a sound critic of architecture , sculpture , painting , and music . Born in 1835 , he was a student at Yale College , and held several degrees of ' that and other institutions , but was never graduated . The honorary title of " Officer of the Academy " was decreed to Dr Harris by the French government in 1878 fo school reports on exhibition at the great exposition , and in 1889 he received the title of " Officer of Public Instruction " from the same government . In his connection with the American Social Science Association he wrote many papers delivered before that organization . He was also a member of the Washington Academy of Sciences , and of the American Philosophical Association . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man so recognized . His death came at the completion of a new edition of Webster 's International ' Dictionary , of which he was editor-inchief He also established at St Louis , in. 1867 , the Journal of Speculative Philosophy , which he conducted up to the time of his-death , was the editor of various school texts , and edited the department of philosophy in Johnson 's Encvelopdia , for which he prepared many important articles He was the author of " Introduction to the Study of Philosophy , " 1889 , " The Spiritual Sense of Dante 's Divine , Commedia , " 1889 ; " Hegel 's Logic , a Book on the Genesis of the Categories of the Mind , " 1890 , and of the " Psychologic Foundation of Education , " - 1898 .

The Kea , a New Zealand Problem , . By George R. Marriner . Christchurch , New Zealand : Marriner Bros . &; Co . Several books have been published devoted to a single species of bird  --  one to the great auk , ianother to the passenger pigeon . Now we have a volume treating of a single species of parrot . The kea or mountain parrot has become a very serious problem to the sheep raisers of New Zealand . We know that parrots are not distantly related to owls and in this instance there seems to have occurred a slipping back from a vegetarian to a carnivorous diet . For inure than fifty years a few individual keas in the various sheep dis tricts have led attacks on these animals , killing from five to fifty per cent . of the flocks . They seem to kill for the love of killing , long after their appetites are satiated . Winter , when other food is scarce , is the season of carnage ; and at this time one or more birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing at the wool . In spite of every effort which the sheep may make , it ultimately succumbs , and the unnatural parrots feast on the kidney fat and other portions of the animal Mr. Marriner has treated his subject thoroughly , reviewing it from every standpoint . He has incorporated in his book information derived from many correspondents , and offers a pleasant account of the kea country . This is the most picturesque part of New Zealand  --  among the rocky crags and fiords , the gorges and snow-clad peaks of the high , rugged mountains . Such a region is not adapted to agriculture , but herds of sheep thrive hera , and thus the kea finds its prey ready to hand . It nests in a rocky hollow or burrows six feet deep under ground , lays four white eggs , and the young are hatched in the depths of winter . The kea , in its love of play , mischievous ways , and uncontrollable curiosity , brings to mind the Canada jay or moosebird . In districts where it is not hunted , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tent , but even on one 's back as one leans over to pick up something . After giving a detailed account of the ecology of the bird , the author proceeds to its relation to man . All the early records of sheep killing are narrated ; the probable cause which led to its change of habits is discussed ; the time and method of attack , the damage done , and the methods used in kea hunting are described . One learns that , although thousands of pounds have been paid in bounties for kea heads , at the rate of two shillings each , the problem is one that must be met and fought continually . Two points of unusual interest strike the casual reader . the remarkable fact of a member of the parrot family living and nesting amid Antarctic cold and snow , and the almost unique instance of a native bird de veloping into a pest , whereas in almost all other recorded cases it is an imported species ( as the English sparrow ) which acquires inimical tendencies .

The author has an excellent sense of proportion , and is evidently a thorough student It would be safe for a publisher to entrust to him the preparation of an exhaustive work with copious references to original authorities and with the reference tables which every scientific student of timber needs to have at hand From Eskbanlc , near Edinburgh , comes news of the death of David Thomson . the horticulturist , at the age of eighty-six He was for some time editor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book of the Flower Garden .
