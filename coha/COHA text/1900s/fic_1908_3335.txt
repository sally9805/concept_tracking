Hight for the very pleasant cat which he has drawn for the cover . THE AUTHOR Illustration : Cat dozing upon the top of the fence . THE CALICO CAT I Mr. Peaslee looked more complacent than ever . It was Saturday noon , and Solomon had just returned from his usual morning sojourn " up-street . " He had taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink , while his wife was " dishing up " the midday meal . There was salt codfish , soaked fresh , and stewed in milk --  " picked up , " as the phrase goes ; there were baked potatoes and a thin , pale-looking pie . Mrs. Peaslee did not believe in pampering the flesh , and she did believe in saving every possible cent . " Well , " said Mr. Peaslee , as they sat down to this feast , " I guess I 've got news for ye . " His wife gazed at him with interest . " Are ye drawed ? " she asked . " Got the notice from Whitcomb right in my pocket . Grand juror . September term . ' T ai n't more'n a week off . " The staccato utterance was caused by the big mouthfuls of codfish and potato which , between phrases , Mr. Peaslee conveyed to his mouth . It was plain to see that he was greatly pleased with his new dignity . " What do they give ye for it ? " asked his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit . " Two dollars a day and mileage , " said Mr. Peaslee , with the emphasis of one who knows he will make a sensation . " Mileage ? What 's that ? " " Travelin ' expenses . State allows ye so much a mile . I get eight cents for goin ' to the courthouse . " " Ye get eight cents every day ? " asked his wife , her eyes snapping . She was vague about the duties of a grand juror ; maybe he had to earn his two dollars ; but she had exact ideas about the trouble of walking " up-street . " To get eight cents for that was being paid for doing nothing at all , and she was much astonished at the idea . " Likely now , ai n't it ? " said Mr. Peaslee , with masculine scorn . " State do n't waste money that way ! Mileage 's to get ye there an ' take ye home again when term 's over . You 're s'posed to stay round ' tween whiles . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They give ye two dollars a day " she hazarded the shot --  " just for settin ' round and talkin ' , do n't they ? Walkin 's considerable more of an effort for most folks . " " ' Settin ' round an ' talkin ' ! ' " exclaimed Mr. Peaslee , so indignantly that he stopped eating for a moment , knife and fork upright in his rigid , scandalized hands , while he gazed at his thin , energetic , shrewish little wife . " ' Settin ' round and talkin ' ! ' It 's mighty important work , now I tell ye . I guess there would n't be much law and order if it wa' n't for the grand jury . They do n't take none but men o ' jedgment . Takes gumption , I tell ye . Ye have to pay money to get that kind . " " Well , " said his wife , with the air of one who concedes an unimportant point , " anyhow , it 's good pay for a man whose time ai n't worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " exclaimed Mr. Peaslee , in hurt tones . " Now , Sarepty , ye know better'n that . I do n't know how they 'll get along without me up to the bank . They 've got a pretty good idee o ' my jedgment ' bout mortgages . They do n't pass any without my say so . " Mrs. Peaslee sniffed . " I 've seen ye in the bank window , settin ' round with Jim Bartlett and Si Spooner and the rest of ' em . Readin ' the paper -- that 's all I ever see ye doin ' . Must be wearin ' on ye . " " Guess ye never heard what was said , did ye ? Ca n't hear ' em thinkin ' , I guess . They 're mighty shreued up to the bank , mighty shreued . " They had finished their codfish and potato , and Mrs. Peaslee , without giving much attention to her husband 's testimony to the business acumen of his banking friends and incidentally of himself , pulled the pale , thin pie toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said she . When his plate was again in place before him , Mr. Peaslee inserted the edge of his knife under the upper crust and raised it so that he could get a better view of its contents ; he had his suspicions of that pie . What he saw confirmed them ; between the crusts was a thin , soft layer of some brown stuff , interspersed with spots of red . " Them 's the currants we had for supper the night before last , and that 's the dried-apple sauce we had for supper last night , " he announced accurately . " An ' ye know how I like a proper pie . " " I ai n't goin ' to waste good victuals , " said his wife , with decision . There was silence for a moment ; Solomon did not dare make any further protest . " I suppose , " his wife said , picking up again the thread of her thoughts , " ye 'll have to wear your go-to-meetin ' suit all the time to the grand jury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . That 'll take off something . You be careful , now . Settin ' round 's awful wearin ' on pants . You get a chair with a cushion . And do n't ye go treatin ' cigars . And do n't ye go to the hotel for your victuals . I ai n't goin ' to have ye spendin ' your money when ye can just as well come home . Where ye goin ' now ? " Mr. Peaslee was putting on his coat . " Well , " he said , " I kind o ' thought I 'd step over to Ed'ards 's . I thought mebbe he 'd be interested . " " Goin ' to brag , are ye ? " was his wife 's remorseless comment . " Much good it 'll do ye , talkin ' to that hatchet-face . He ai n't so pious as he looks , if all stories are true . " But Mr. Peaslee was already outside the door . She raised her voice shrilly . " You be back , now ; them chickens has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sympathetic audience . Being drawn for the grand jury had greatly flattered his vanity , for it encouraged a secret ambition which he had long held to get into public life . Service on the grand jury might lead to his becoming selectman , perhaps justice of the peace , perhaps town representative from Ellmington -- who knew what else ? He looked down a pleasant vista of increasing office , at the end of which stood the state capitol . He could be senator , perhaps ! And he began planning his behavior as juror , the dignified bearing , the well-matured utterances , the shrewd cross-questioning . At the end of his service his neighbors would know him for a man of solid judgment , a " safe " man to be intrusted with weighty affairs . Mr. Peaslee was fifty-three years old . He had a comfortable figure , a clean-shaven , round face , and blue eyes much exaggerated for the spectator by the strong lenses of a pair of great spectacles . These , with his gray hair , gave him a benevolence of aspect which somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-humored and not without a still surviving capacity for generous impulse , he was only less " near " than his wife . Childishly vain , he bore himself with an air of self-satisfaction not without its charm for humorous neighbors . They said that they guessed he thought himself " some punkins . " " Some punkins " most people admitted him to be , although how much of his money and how much of his shrewdness was really his wife 's was matter of debate among those who knew him best . At any rate , the Peaslees had made money . A few years before , they had sold their fat farm " down-river " advantageously , and had bought the dignified white house in Ellmington in which they have just been seen eating a dinner which looks as if they were " house poor . " That they were not ; they had thirty thousand dollars in the local bank , partly invested in its stock . In Ellmington Mrs. Peaslee was less lonely , and through Mr. Peaslee was an unsuspected director in the bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which her husband 's association with the " bank crowd " opened to her . As for Mr. Peaslee , he did not know that he himself was not the business head of the house ; and his garden , his chickens , and his pleasant loafing in the bank window kept him contentedly occupied . For , in spite of her shrewish tongue , Mrs. Peaslee had tact enough to let her husband have the credit for her business acumen . " I ai n't goin ' to let on , " she said to herself , " that he ai n't just as good as the rest of ' em . " She had her pride . As Mr. Peaslee stepped along the straight walk which divided his neat lawn , and opened the neat gate in his neat white fence , he met Sam Barton , the broad-shouldered , good-humored giant who was constable of Ellmington . Sam gave him a smiling " How are ye , squire ? " as he passed . " Guess he 's heard , " said Mr. Peaslee to himself , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greeting was not different from that which Sam had given him daily for the past three years . Once on the sidewalk , Mr. Peaslee turned to the right toward the house of his neighbor , Mr. Edwards . Edwards was a younger man than Peaslee , perhaps forty-seven . His business was speculating in lumber and cattle , and in the interest of this he was constantly passing and re passing the Canadian border , which was not far from Ellmington . In the intervals between his trips he was much at home . He was a stern , silent , secretive man , and simply because he was so close-mouthed there was much guessing and gossip , not wholly kind , about his affairs . Mr. Peaslee found the front door of the Edwards house standing open in the trustful village fashion , and , with neighborly freedom , walked in without ringing . He turned first into the sitting-room , where he found no one , and then into a rear room opening from it . This obviously was a boy 's " den . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose string , a handful of spruce gum , some scattered marbles , a broken jack-knife , a cap , a shot-pouch , an old bird 's nest , a powder-flask , a dog-eared copy of " Caesar 's Commentaries , " open , and a Latin dictionary , also open . In a corner stood a fishing-rod in its cotton case ; along the wall were ranged bait-boxes , a fishing-basket , a pair of rubber boots , and a huge wasp 's nest . Leaning against the sill of the open window was a double-barreled shotgun , and on the sill itself were some black , greasy rags and a small bottle of oil . Various truths might be inferred from the disarray . One was that Mr. Edwards was generous to his son Jim , and another was that there was no Mrs. Edwards . Further , it might be easily enough guessed that Jim had been lured from the study of Latin , in which pretty Miss Ware , who was his teacher at the " Union " school , was trying to interest him , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something still more attractive -- perhaps a boy with crossed fingers , for it was not too late for swimming -- had lured him from that . At any rate , Jim was not there . Mr. Peaslee , still bent on finding Mr. Edwards , moved toward the open window . But he could see no signs of life anywhere . None of the household was , however , far away . Jim was in the loft of the barn , where he was carefully examining a barrel of early apples with a view to filling his pockets with the best ; the housekeeper had merely stepped across the street to borrow some yeast , and Mr. Edwards , who had a headache , was lying down in the chamber immediately above Jim 's den . Mr. Peaslee stood and gazed . He eyed in turn the kitchen ell , the shed , and the barn , and then gazed out over the " posy " garden , where still bloomed a few late flowers , of which he recognized only the " chiny " asters . He looked toward what he himself would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabbages , turnips , rustling corn-stalks , and drying tomato-vines . Seeing no one there , he sent his gaze to the distant rows of apple trees , bright with ripening fruit . Disappointed , he was about to turn away , but he could not resist taking a complacent , sweeping view of his own adjoining possessions . There , on the right , ran the long line of his own dwelling , continued by the five-foot board fence separating his garden from Mr. Edwards 's . This stood up gauntly white until near the orchard , where it was completely hidden by the high , feathery stalks of the asparagus-bed , by a row of great sunflowers , now heavy and bent with their disk-like seed-pods , and by a clump of lilac bushes . As his eye traveled along the white expanse , he gave a quick start , and his face clouded with vexation . There in the sun , prone upon the top of the fence , dozed the bane of his life -- the Calico Cat . Her coat was made up of patches of yellow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hind leg , and a large , round , black spot about her right eye , which gave her a peculiarly predatory and disreputable appearance . Solomon had disliked her at sight . Ever since he had bought the house in Ellmington he had been trying to drive her from the premises , but stay away she would not . Not all the missiles in existence could convince her that his house was not a desirable place of abode . And she was a constant vexation and annoyance . She jumped from the fence plump into the middle of newly planted flower-beds ; she filled the haymow with kittens ; she asked all her friends to the barn , where she gave elaborate musical parties at hours more fashionably late than were tolerated in Ellmington . Whenever she had indigestion she ate off the tops of the choicest green things that grew in the garden ; but when her appetite was good she caught and devoured his young chickens . Moreover , when at bay she frightened him . Once he had cornered the spitting creature in a stall . Claws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had leaped straight at his head , which he ducked , and , landing squarely upon it , had steadied herself there for a moment with sharp , protruding claws ; thence she had jumped to a feed-box , thence to a beam , thence to the mow , from the dusky recesses of which she had glared at him with big , green , menacing eyes . Not since that experience , which , in spite of his soft hat , had left certain marks upon his scalp , had he ever attempted to catch her . Instead , he had borrowed a gun , and a dozen times had fired at her ; but although he counted himself a fair shot , he had never made even a scant bit of fur fly from her disreputable back . And now he knew she laughed at him . Yes , laughed at him , for she had more than human intelligence . There was something demoniac in her cleverness , her immunity from harm , her prodigious energy , her malevolent mischief , her raillery . Actually , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstitious feeling that in the end she would bring him bad luck . How he hated her ! There she lay , with eyes shut , unsuspecting , comfortable , and basked in the warm September sunshine . Here at his hand was a double-barreled shotgun . The chance was too good . This vagrant , this outlaw , this trespasser , this thief -- he catalogued her misdeeds in his mind as he clanged the ramrod down the barrels to see if the piece was loaded . It was not . But ammunition was at hand . He put in a generous charge from Jim 's powder-flask and rammed it home with a paper wad . He grabbed up the shot-pouch and released the proper charge into his hand . He was disappointed ; it was bird shot . Scattering as it would scatter , it could do that cat no harm . Nevertheless , he poured the pellets into the barrel . As he rammed home the paper wad on top of these , his eye caught the marbles lying on the table . He took one that fitted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifted the gun to his shoulder , and fired . With a leap which sent her six feet into the air the Calico Cat landed four-square in Mr. Peaslee 's chicken-yard , almost on the back of the dignified rooster , which fled with a startled squawk . She dodged like lightning across the chicken-yard , between cackling and clattering hens , went up the wire-netting walls , leaped to the roof , paused , considered , began to reflect that she had been shot at before and to wonder at her own fright , stopped , and , sitting down on the ridgepole , looked inquiringly in Mr. Peaslee 's direction . She was , of course , entirely unharmed . But other matters were claiming Mr. Peaslee 's attention . Out from behind the screen formed by the asparagus plumes , the currant-bushes , the sunflowers , and the lilacs , all of which grew not so far from the spot on the fence where the Calico Cat had been sitting , fell a man ! Solomon had a mere glimpse . Standing behind taller bushes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his falling figure was describing the narrow segment of a circle had he been visible . But the glimpse was enough . Mr. Peaslee 's jaw dropped , his face turned white . But the next moment he gave a great sigh of relief . He saw the man rise and slip into cover of the bushes , and so disappear through the orchard . He had not , then , killed the fellow ! Relieved of that fear , he thought of himself . What would people say were he charged with firing at a man -- he , a respectable citizen , a director in the bank , a grand juror ? They must not know ! He silently laid the gun back against the window-sill , turned with infinite care , and tiptoed quickly back into the sitting-room , into the hall , into the street . Not a soul was visible . Nevertheless , such was Mr. Peaslee 's agitation , so strongly did he feel the need of silence , that , placing a shaking hand upon the fence to steady himself , he tiptoed along the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of his wife struck him . He was in no condition to meet that sharp-eyed , quick-tongued lady ! He softly entered the front door and penetrated to the dark parlor , where , as no one would ever enter it except for a funeral or a wedding , he felt safe from intrusion . There he sank down upon the slippery horsehair lounge , and , staring helplessly at the severe portrait of Mrs. Peaslee , done by a lugubrious artist in crayon , wiped the sweat from his forehead and tried to collect his scattered faculties . " Whew ! " he breathed . " Whew ! " Illustration : Cat licking paw . II Meanwhile , at the Edwards house , life had grown suddenly interesting . When the report of the gun reached Jim , he had stopped pawing over the apple barrel , and was sitting on the upper step of the staircase at the extreme end of the loft , slowly munching an apple and thinking . Jim was a healthy , active boy , with no more sense than naturally belongs to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been most unfortunately overstimulated . Without a mother , and with a father who paid him scant attention , he read whatever he liked , and as a result , his head was full of romantic road-agents delightfully kind to little crippled daughters at home , fierce pirates who supported aged and respectable mothers , and considerate bandits who restored valuable watches when told that they were prized on account of tender associations . His imagination had been still further fed by certain local legends and happenings , highly colored enough to excite the keenest interest . Ellmington is , as has been said , near the Canadian border . The place abounds in tales of smuggling , and the popular gossip , as gossip everywhere has a pleasing way of doing , associates the names of the most respectable and unlikely people with the disreputable ventures of the smugglers . Of course a story of contraband trade is the more striking if the narrator can hint that the judge of probate or the most stern of village deacons might tell a good deal if he were disposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest to their " yarns . " In Ellmington lived Jake Farnum , an ex-deputy marshal and an incorrigible liar , about whom gathered the boys , Jim among them , to hear exciting stories of chase and detection , exactly as boys in a seaport town gather about an old sailor to hear tales of pirates and buccaneers . And Jake loved to hint darkly that the best people shared in the illicit traffic . With it all , Jim 's sense of right and wrong was in a fair way to become hopelessly " mixed . " Exactly as boys at the seashore are prone to believe that a pirate is , on the whole , an admirable character , so these border boys , and especially Jim , had come to feel -- only with more excuse , because of the generally indulgent view of the community -- that smuggling is an occupation in which any one may engage with credit , and which is much more interesting than most . Now it is not likely that Jim 's father , a stern , secretive , obviously prosperous man , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border , could in all this gossip escape a touch of suspicion . No one , of course , denied that he really did deal in lumber and cattle ; the fact was obvious . But there were hints and whispers , shrewd shakings of the head , and more than one " guessed " that all Edwards 's profits " did n't come from cattle , no , nor lumber , neither . " Latterly these whispers had become more definite . Pete Lamoury , a French-Canadian , whom Mr. Edwards had hired as a drover , and abruptly discharged , was spreading stories about his former employer which made Blackbeard , the pirate , seem like a babe by comparison . Pete was not a very credible witness ; but still , building upon a suspicion that already existed , he succeeded in adding something to its substantiality . These stories had come to Jim 's ears , and Jim was delighted . The consideration that , were the stories true , his father was a criminal did not occur to him at all . Like the foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of his father as a man of iron determination , cool wit , unshakable courage , whom no deputy sheriff could over-match , and who was leading a life full of excitement and danger -- the smuggler king ! The only thing that Jim regretted was that his father did not let him share in these exploits . He knew he could be useful ! But his father 's manner was habitually so forbidding that Jim did not dare hint a knowledge of these probable undertakings , much less any desire to share them . Poor Mr. Edwards ! He loved his boy , but did not in the least know how to show it . Silent , with a sternness of demeanor which he was unable wholly to lay aside even in his friendliest moments , much away from home , and unable to meet the boy on his own level when he was there , deprived of the wife who might have been his interpreter , he had no way of becoming acquainted with his son . Anxious in some way to share in Jim 's life , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much pocket-money . Yet if Jim , thus unguided and overindulged , had gone astray in his conduct , Mr. Edwards was not the man to know his mistake and take the blame . He had in him a rigidity of moral judgment , a dryness of mind which made it certain that if Jim did do what he disapproved , he would visit upon him a punishment at once severe and unsympathetic . The man 's air of cold strength excited in the son fear as well as admiration ; his reserve kept his naturally affectionate boy at more than arm 's length . Poor Mr. Edwards ! Poor Jim ! Misunderstanding between them was as sure to occur as the rise of to-morrow 's sun . Pat on Jim 's speculations about his father 's stirring deeds , the gunshot came echoing through the silent barn . Jim ran to the loft door and looked out . He saw smoke curling up from the window of his " den , " and knew that it was his own gun that had been fired . Back in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Jim looked toward the orchard , and caught sight of another man disappearing in the trees . He was wild with excitement . As he knew that his father was the only person in the house , he was sure that his father had fired the shot . The tales that he had heard , his belief in his father 's life of adventure , made him conclude that here was some smuggler 's quarrel . So vividly did the notion take possession of his inflamed imagination that nothing henceforth could shake it . He simply knew what had happened . And his father had fled , leaving all the evidences of his shot behind him ! Jim 's loyal heart bounded ; here he could help . He turned , raced across the loft , clattered down the steep , cobwebby stairs , slipped through the shed passage , through the kitchen , and on into his own room . He knew what to do . Nothing must show that the gun had ever been used ! He set feverishly to work . He swabbed out the weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tossed the rags into the fireplace and covered them with ashes . He put the shot-pouch and the powder-flask into their proper drawer . Then he pulled a chair to the table and set himself to a pretended study of Caesar . If any one should come , it would look as if he had been quietly studying all the morning . All this had cost considerable self-denial ; for of course he boiled with curiosity about the man in the orchard . He did not dare to go out there , but now , stealthily glancing out of the window , he saw his father returning from the garden with long strides . Jim understood . His father , going out at the front door , had slipped round to the side of the house , so that it would look as if he had come from the street . He was not surprised that his father looked stern and angry . That fellow must have done something mighty mean , he thought , to make his father shoot ; and he admired at once the magnanimity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he supposed , by way , presumably , of teaching him a lesson . Then , struck by the boldness and openness of his father 's return to the house , Jim suddenly felt that he had been foolish ; that the cleaning of the gun had not been needed . What man would dare , after such a lesson , to complain against his father ! Mr. Edwards walked straight into Jim 's room . Aroused from his nap by the shot , he had leaped to the window and seen the man fall . He had then turned and run downstairs so quickly that he had not seen the fellow half-rise and crawl into the bushes ; and , having reached the spot , he was much relieved , if somewhat staggered , to find no body . He did find tracks , for this was plowed ground ; but they told him nothing of the wounded man except that he had left in a hurry on a pair of rather large feet . He looked about for a while , and then started toward the house , determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gun by the sound of its report , and felt no doubt that the boy had fired the shot . What sort of culpable accident had happened ? Suffering still with the splitting headache which he had been trying to sleep off , angry with Jim for his carelessness , concerned lest the man were really injured , Mr. Edwards was in his least compromising mood . " How did it happen ? " he asked , without preface . His tones were harsh , and he fixed Jim with stern eyes . " How did it happen ! " repeated Jim , in pure surprise . Certainly his father knew much better than he how it had happened . " Speak out ! " said Mr. Edwards , impatiently . " How did you come to shoot that man ? I want to know about it . " " Me ! " cried Jim , in complete bewilderment . " I -- I have n't shot any man , father ! You know I have n't . " Mr. Edwards , never a man of nice observation , and now bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishment for mere pretense and subterfuge . Were not the facts plain ? " I do n't want any nonsense about this , " he said incisively . " I heard your gun . I saw the man fall . No one else but you could possibly have fired it . It 's useless to lie , and I wo n't stand it . Tell me at once what happened . " " I did n't shoot him , father . You know I did n't ! " reiterated Jim , more and more dumfounded . " I do n't know how it happened , honest Injun -- I do n't , father ! " Mr. Edwards 's mouth shut tight . He swept the room with his eyes until they rested upon the gun in the rack over the mantelpiece . He stepped forward , took it down , and examined it . Holding it in his hands , he gazed about the floor . A rag which the ashes in the fireplace had not wholly covered caught his attention . " You cleaned the gun and put it away , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rag with which you cleaned it , " and he touched the bit of cloth sticking from the ashes contemptuously with his foot . " What do you expect me to think from that ? " Jim was silent . The boy was unlike his father in many ways , but they were alike in this : they both were proud . Each would meet an unjust accusation in silence . And Jim was beginning to show another of his father 's characteristics . A still anger was beginning to burn in him against this man who accused him of a deed which he himself had done , and he felt rising within him a stubborn will to endure , not to surrender . If his father was going to act like that , why , let him --  " Where is your shot-pouch ? " asked Mr. Edwards . Jim motioned toward the drawer . " Is your powder-flask there , too ? " " Yes . " Mr. Edwards was silent After all , he was a just man . He was trying , as well as his headache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's plain what happened , " he said at last . " You had an accident and got frightened . You cleaned your gun , you hid the rags , you put away your ammunition , you got your books and pretended to study . You 're afraid to tell the truth now . " Jim 's face flushed hotly , but he kept silent . Such assurance , such cruelty , he had never imagined . If this was what smugglers were like -- if this was a sample of their tricks --  " I 'll give you one more chance to tell the truth , " said Mr. Edwards . " Did you do it ? " " No , I did n't ! " said Jim , and his jaw snapped close like his father 's . " Very well , " said Mr. Edwards . " I 'll leave you until you change your mind . You will stay here . Sarah will bring you bread and milk at supper-time . If you 're willing to talk to me then , you may tell her that you 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then paused . " It 's a serious matter ; and all the facts are against you . It would go hard with you in court . It will go harder if you stick to your stubborn and foolish lie . One thing more : if you do n't choose to tell the truth , you will have to reckon with the law as well as with me . " Mr. Edwards , upon this , shut the door and departed . His was a stern figure , but the hurt within was very sore . This , then , he reflected bitterly , was the kind of boy he had . He suffered deeply at the discovery , which for him was unquestionable . Jim felt outraged . He had done his loyal best to save his father from the consequences of his rash act , and now , with incredible ingenuity and cool injustice , his father was using his son 's acts of helpfulness to make it appear that he had done the deed . Without a scruple , his father had made him a scapegoat . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his father , as chief of the band , demanded the sacrifice of this , his devoted follower . Nay , more , he would have endured the ordeal without a murmur had his father , deeming it unsafe to enter into formal explanations , only hinted to him that this was a farce which they two must play together . If his father had only winked at him ! Surely he might have done that with safety ! But not to be admitted to the secret , not to be allowed to play the heroic part , to be used as an ignoble tool by a father who neither loved him nor knew his courage ,  - -  that was too much ! He would not betray his father -- no , a thousand times , no ! But the day would come --  The afternoon dragged on . Jim sat there in his room , looking out into the pleasant sunshine , conscious that the boys were playing " three old cat " in the field not faraway -- as rebellious and magnanimous , as hot and angry , as heroic and morally muddled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the affair from his point of view , not many people will blame him . It is delightful , of course , to have a pirate chief for father ; but what if he makes you walk the plank ? It is amusing to think of Mr. Peaslee and Jim each shut up in his respective room ; but if Mr. Peaslee in his gloomy parlor -- faced by the crayon portrait of his masterful wife , a vase of wax flowers under a glass dome , the family Bible on a marble-topped table , and three stiff horsehair-covered chairs -- had the advantage of being able to leave at any moment , he was even more perturbed in mind . " Terrible awk'ard mess , " he kept repeating to himself , as he mopped his damp forehead with his handkerchief , " terrible awk'ard . " And indeed it would be awkward for a respectable citizen with political aspirations to be accused before a grand jury of which he is a member of assault with a dangerous weapon upon an inoffensive man . Mr. Peaslee 's reflections rose in a strophe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T ai n't likely it hurt him any -- just bird shot , " said Hope . " Bird shot 's mighty irritatin '  - -  specially to a wrathy fellow , " said Despair . And alternating thus , his thoughts ran on : " Bird shot 'll show I did n't have any serious intent ; but mebbe a piece of the marble struck him . He went off mighty lively ; do n't seem as if he 'd been hurt much ; more scared hurt , likely . But he might have been hurt bad , arm or suthin ' , mebbe . Marble ! ' T ai n't anythin ' but baked clay ; split all to pieces prob'ly -- but ye ca n't tell . I 've heard ye can shoot a taller candle through an inch plank -- and that 's consid'able softer than a marble . And that pesky cat 's jest as frisky as ever ! " Had any one seen him ? There certainly had not been any one in the street , but where had been Mr. Edwards , Jim , the housekeeper ? Where had his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen him returning , some from which she might even have seen him fire the fatal shot . But pshaw , there now ! Probably no one had seen him at all , not even his wife , not even his victim ! Probably no one would ever find out . " Must have been some worthless feller , stealin ' apples , mebbe , who wo n't dare make a fuss . ' T ai n't likely I 'll ever hear anythin ' of it . ' T ai n't no use sayin ' anythin ' till suthin ' happens . What folks do n't know do n't hurt ' em none . " The structure of comfort which he thus built himself was shaky indeed , but it had to serve . He nerved himself to meet his wife . He must not excite her suspicion by too long an absence . She was doubtless full of curiosity , for of course she had heard the shot , and would expect him to know what it meant . It would not do to seem to enter the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , sneaking outdoors again , he slipped round to the side of the house , and with much trepidation went into the kitchen . His wife began the moment she saw him . " Well , of all the crazy carryings on ! " she cried . " What 's the Ed'ards boy firin ' off guns for , right under peaceable folks ' windows ? I 'm goin ' to speak to Mr. Ed'ards right off . " " Now do n't ye , Sarepty , now do n't ye ! " said Mr. Peaslee , in alarm . Relieved as he was to find himself unsuspected , he did not like the idea of having his wife pick a quarrel with Mr. Edwards for what he himself had done ! The less said about that shot the better he would be pleased . " For the land 's sake , why not , I should like to know ? " " Well , now , Sarepty , I would n't . That Ed'ards boy ai n't more of a boy than most boys , I guess . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinder touchy , I guess . It might make hard feelin ' . ' T would n't look well for us to speak , bein ' newcomers so . I would n't , Sarepty , I would n't . Mebbe some time I 'll slide in a word , just slide it in kinder easy , if he does it again . " And Mr. Peaslee looked appealingly at his wife through his big spectacles , his eyes looking very large and pathetic through the strong lenses . " Humph ! " said his wife , unmoved . " I ai n't afraid of Ed'ards , if you be . " Nor could she be moved from her determination . Mr. Peaslee was vastly disturbed . But presently he forgot this small annoyance in greater ones . That evening after tea , when he went up to the post-office , he heard that Pete Lamoury had been shot by Jim Edwards , and was now in bed with his wounds . Jim 's arrest was predicted . Young Farnsworth , who kept the crockery store , told him the news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the village , shuffled in -- noticeable anywhere for his suit of rusty black , his empty sleeve pinned to his coat , the green patch over his eye , and his tobacco-stained lips . He confirmed the report . " Pete 's hurt bad , " he said , shaking his head , " hurt bad . I 've taken his case . Young Edwards is going to see trouble . " The speech frightened poor Mr. Peaslee , and he was hardly reassured by the skeptical smile of Squire Tucker , and his remark that he would believe that Lamoury was hurt when he saw him . The squire had small faith in either Lamoury or Hibbard . He knew them both . But Mr. Peaslee returned home with dragging feet . Silent and preoccupied all the evening , he went to bed early -- but not to sleep . Long he lay awake and tossed , while the Calico Cat wailed on the rear fence -- exultant , triumphant , insulting . And when he did finally get to sleep , he dreamed that he was being prosecuted in court by -- was it Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Calico Cat , with the black patch over hers ? He could not tell , study the fantastic , ominous figure of his prosecutor as he would ! Illustration : Cat sitting on post looking forward . III Immediately after breakfast on Monday morning Mr. Peaslee , in a mood of desperate self-sacrifice , started up-town to buy a knife -- for Jim ! All day long on Sunday , when he had nothing to do but think , he had struggled between his fear of exposure and his sorrow for the boy . The upshot was a determination to " make it up to him " by giving him a knife . He had in his mind 's eye a marvel -- stag-horn handle , four blades , saw , awl , file , hoof-hook , corkscrew ! Such a knife as that , he felt , would console any boy for being arrested . " Most likely ' t will end right there , " he said to himself . " I guess I 'd better go to Farley 's , " he thought , as he walked along . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare to stick it on like the rest . " But when he entered the store and looked about , his face fell . Mr. Farley was not there ! Willie Potter , Farley 's clerk , a young man peculiarly distasteful to Solomon , lounged forward with a toothpick in his mouth . Mr. Peaslee had half a mind to go , but the thought of poor Jim held him back . " What will you have to-day , Mr. Peaslee ? " inquired Willie , affably . He winked at young Dannie Snow , who sat grinning on a keg of nails , as much as to say , " Watch me have some fun with the old man . " " I thought mebbe I 'd look at some jack-knives , " said Solomon , eyeing Willie distrustfully . " Yes , sir , I guess you want the best , regardless of expense , " said Willie , impudently . He well understood his customer 's dislike for spending a penny . Stepping behind the counter , he drew from the show-case and held up admiringly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , what do you say to this ? Very superior article . Best horn , ten blades , best razor steel . Three-fifty , and cheap at the price . Ca n't be beat this side of Boston . Just the article for you , sir . " And he winked again at Dannie Snow , who was pink with suppressed merriment . " Well , now , well , now , " said Solomon , taking the knife in his hand and pretending to examine it closely . " That 's a pretty knife , to be sure ,  - -  to - -  be - -  sure . Real showy , ai n't it ? Looks as if ' t was made to sell -- all outside and no money in the bank , like some young fellers ye see . " Dannie Snow giggling outright , Mr. Peaslee turned and gazed at him in mild inquiry . Young Potter turned a dull red . He was addicted to radiant cravats and gauzy silk handkerchiefs , and from his " salary " of eight dollars a week he did not save much . But just the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still to examine the knife which Willie had given him , he squinted past it at the contents of the glass show-case on which his elbows rested . There all sorts of knives confronted him , each in its little box , in which was stuck a card stating the price ,  - -  $1.50 , $1.25 , 90c , 45c . The cheapest one would eat up the proceeds of three dozen eggs at fifteen cents a dozen -- a good price for eggs ! He had forgotten that knives cost so much . " A good knife ai n't any use to a boy , " he reflected . " Break it in a day , lose it in a week . ' T would n't be any real kindness to him . Just wastin ' money . " He pointed finally to a stubby , wooden-handled knife with one big blade , marked 25c . " There , now , " said he , " that 's what I call a knife . Good and strong , and no folderol . Guarantee the steel , do n't ye ? " He opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb , while with his mild blue eyes , which his spectacles enormously exaggerated , he fixed the humbled Willie . " That 's a good knife for the money , " said that young man . " Hand-forged . " " Sho now , ye do n't say so , " said Mr. Peaslee . " I guess ye give a discount , do n't ye ? Farley always allows me a little suthin ' . " " You can have it for twenty-one cents , " said Willie , much irritated . " Charge it ? " " Guess I better pay cash , " Mr. Peaslee answered hastily . If it were charged , his wife would question the item . Producing an enormous wallet -- very worn and very flat -- from his cavernous pocket , he deliberately searched until he found a Canadian ten-cent piece , and adding to it enough to make up the price , handed it to Potter , and left the store . Mr. Peaslee , who remembered no gift from his father other than a very occasional big copper cent , thought himself pretty generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two dozen eggs ? But now a question occurred to him which he had not thought of before . How was he to get the knife to Jim ? A gift from him would excite surprise , perhaps suspicion . It must not be known who had sent it . Ah , there was the post office ! Going in , he pushed the little box through the barred window . " Say , Cyrus , " he said to the postmaster , " kinder weigh up this consignment for me , will ye ? " The postmaster weighed the box . " That will cost you six cents , " he said . " Thank ye , " returned Mr. Peaslee , and dropping the box into his deep pocket , departed . Half a dozen eggs more to get it to his next-door neighbor ! " ' T ai n't right , " he muttered , " ' t ai n't right . " Uncertain what to do with his gift , but feeling , on the whole , pretty virtuous , Mr. Peaslee now started home . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but would wait at home for the threatened coming of the constable ; but still he was not sure , and he wanted to keep the boy under his eye . Suddenly he straightened . There was Judge Ames walking up the street , valise in hand , just from the early morning train . He had come a few days before the opening of court . Mr. Peaslee knew him slightly , and stood much in awe of him . He was greatly pleased when the judge stopped and shook hands with him . " I am glad to hear , Mr. Peaslee , " said the judge , in his precise , lawyer-like utterance , " that you are to be on the grand jury . We need men like you there . " " Thank ye , judge , thank ye , " said Mr. Peaslee , overcome . And he walked on home , quite convinced that a person of his importance in the community should not be sacrificed to the comfort of any small boy . " And I 've done right by the little feller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling the knife . As he turned into his own yard , he cast an anxious eye over to the Edwards house . There sat Jim , elbows on knees , chin on hands , staring into space . Jim was thinking that his father , had he been a pirate chief , would not have wiped a filial tear from his eye whenever he thought of his mother ; and the boy 's face showed it . The spectacle greatly depressed Mr. Peaslee . The smallest , faintest question entered his mind whether a twenty-five-cent knife would console such melancholy . To give himself a countenance while he watched events , Solomon got a rake and began gathering together the few autumn leaves which had fluttered down in his front yard . It was not useless labor , for they would " come in handy " later in " banking up " the house . And so , presently , he saw Sam Barton , the constable , his big shoulders rolling as he walked , advancing down the street . Mr. Peaslee expected him ; nevertheless his appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been coming for him ! " Ai n't arrestin ' anybody down this way , be ye ? " he called , with a feeble attempt at jocularity . Perhaps , after all --  " Looks like it , " said Barton , succinctly . Mr. Peaslee stepped to the fence . " ' T ai nt likely they 'll do much to a leetle feller like that , I guess , " he said , searching the constable 's face . " Du n no , " said Barton , passing on . Solomon , much concerned , leaned on his rake and watched him enter the Edwards house . Jim had disappeared ; there was some delay . Mrs. Peaslee came to the door . " Arrestin ' that Ed'ards boy , be they , Solomon ? " she said . " Well , serve him right , I say , shootin ' guns off so . Like father , like son . I du n no as ' t was the son . I 'd as soon believe it of the father . Everybody knows Lamoury and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks , prob'ly . " Mrs. Peaslee had taken a violent dislike to her taciturn neighbor , and she did not care who knew it . Her shrill voice seemed to her husband painfully loud , and , indeed , it was beginning to attract the attention of the group of children who had gathered about the Edwards gate . " Sh ! " hissed Solomon . " Ed'ards might hear ye . ' T would hurt us if he should take his account out of the bank . " " Humph ! " exclaimed Mrs. Peaslee . " Well , " she added , " you go to the hearin ' . Justice is suthin ' , I guess . " But she said no more , and with her husband and the children awaited events -- a silent group in the silent street before the silent house . The children 's eyes grew bigger and bigger with excitement . Was not Jimmy Edwards going to be arrested for mur-r-rder ? the horrid whisper ran . One small boy , beginning to whimper , asked if Jimmy was " going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older eyes of Mr. Peaslee . " S'posin ' it was me , " he said to himself . Presently Mr. Edwards , Jim , and the constable emerged from the house . Jim looked white and frightened , but was bravely trying to bear himself like a man . Mr. Edwards , his long , shaven upper lip stiff as a board , looked stern and uncompromising . Barton was as big and good-humored as ever . He turned upon the little boys and girls , and , waving his arm , cried , " Scat ! " They fell back -- about ten feet . Thus the procession formed : Barton and Jim , then Mr. Edwards , and -- at a barely respectful distance -- the crowd of youngsters . Mr. Peaslee , much moved , but trying hard not to show it , thrust his rake under the veranda with a great show of care , and joined Mr. Edwards -- much to that gentleman 's surprise . Solomon 's heart was throbbing with a great resolution . " I always aim to be neighborly , " said he , nervously lowering his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the veranda . " Thought I 'd just step along , too . I cal'late mebbe you 'd like comp'ny on his bail bond , " and he jerked his thumb toward Jim . It was out ; he was committed , and Solomon heaved a great sigh , he knew not whether of relief or dismay . There was not indeed any risk in signing with Edwards , who was " good " for any bail that the justice was likely to require ; but what would Mrs. Peaslee say if she knew ! He glanced apprehensively toward the house . His wife had gone in ; but , evil omen ! there , sitting on a fence-post , was the Calico Cat . She was placidly washing her face ; and as her paw twinkled past the big black spot round her right eye , she appeared , at that distance , to be greeting him with a derisive wink . Mr. Edwards , although his mouth shut tighter than ever at the mention of bail , was surprised and touched . " Thank you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " In the village , Sam ushered them into the musty law office of Squire Tucker , justice of the peace . The squire was a large , fat man , clothed in rusty black , with a carelessly knotted string tie pendent beneath a rumpled turn-down collar . He had a smooth-shaven , fat face , lighted by shrewd and kindly eyes , which gleamed at you now through , now over , his glasses . When the party entered he was writing , and merely looked up under his big eyebrows long enough to wave them all to chairs . Jim sat down , with the constable behind him and his father at his left , and studied the man in whose hands he thought that his fate rested . He watched the squire 's pen go from paper to ink , ink to paper , and listened to its scratch , scratch , and to the buzz of a big fly against the dirty window-pane . Ashamed to look at any one , he looked at the lawyer 's big ink-well -- a great , circular affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one with its own little cork attached with a short string to the side of the stand . He had never seen one like it before . Then some one entered the room . Jim , looking sidewise , recognized Jake Hibbard , and began covertly to study his face . He knew that this flabby-faced , dirty man , with the little screwed-up eyes , and the big screwed-up mouth , stained brown at the corners with tobacco , was Pete Lamoury 's lawyer . Familiar for many years to his contemptuous young eyes , Jake now looked sinister and dangerous . What were these men going to do to him ? Amid his fluttering emotions and rushing thoughts one thing only stood fixed and clear : he would not tell on his father . Some day , when all trouble was past , he would let his father know that he knew all the time . Then he guessed his father would be sorry and ashamed . Now , since his father would not take him into his confidence , he would not pretend he did the shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squire Tucker , pushing his writing aside , ran his fingers through the great mass of his tumbled gray hair , and looked quizzically at Jim over his glasses . " So this , " he said , " is the hardened ruffian of whom our esteemed fellow citizen , Mr. Lamoury , complains ? " And indeed Jim , although stubborn , did not seem very dangerous . The squire looked about the room . " Is he represented by counsel ? " he asked . " No , I represent him , " said Mr. Edwards . " The charge against him is assault with intent to kill , I believe ? " and he looked with demure inquiry at Jake Hibbard , who nodded with a wrath-clouded face . Tucker was not taking the case seriously . " Well , young man , " said the justice to Jim , " what 's your explanation of this ? " " We 'll waive examination , " said Mr. Edwards , briefly . The squire leaned back in his chair . " I suppose , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for the grand jury . But I guess the safety of the community wo n't be greatly threatened if I let him out on bail . I should think a couple of hundred would do . I suppose there 'll be no difficulty about the bond ? " The tone of the proceedings suited Mr. Peaslee well . In his nervousness and abstraction he had backed up to the rusty , empty iron stove at the end of the room , and stood there , with spread coat-tails , listening intently . On hearing the amount of bail , he gave a sigh of relief . His incautious offer had brought him no dangerous risk . Mr. Edwards , however , did not answer . Instead , consulting the justice with a look , he turned and beckoned Jim to follow him into the hall . " James , " he said , " this is the last chance I shall give you . If you confess to me , I will see that you have proper bail . If you do not , I shall let the law take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exasperated . If his father wished to be mean , let him be mean ; at least he might drop this farce , this irritating pretense . He lost his temper . " I do n't care what you do ! " he said fiercely . " Send me to jail if you want to . I guess I can stand it ! " " Is that all you have to say ? " Jim replied with a rebellious glance . " Very well , " said his father . " Then we will go back . " Once in the room , he stepped to the squire 's desk , and talked with him in low tones . Then the justice turned to Jim again , a new gravity in his jolly face . " Your father , " he said , " refuses to go on your bond . Have you any sureties of your own to offer ? " " No , sir , " said Jim . Mr. Peaslee was outraged . What kind of a father was this ! He half started forward to offer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but -- no , he dare not . The second surety might prove to be any sort of worthless fellow . But Jim in jail ! He had not for a moment dreamed of that . He was very indignant with Mr. Edwards . Meanwhile , Jake Hibbard was studying Mr. Edwards 's face with puzzled attention . He had supposed that the lumber dealer , whom he knew to be well-to-do , would have paid anything , signed any bond , to protect his boy from jail . He was disconcerted . He drew his one hand across his mouth nervously . " Well , Mr. Barton , " said Squire Tucker , " I do n't see but what you 'll have to take this young man over to Hotel Calkins . " " Hotel Calkins " was the name which local wit gave to the county jail . The words sent a cold shiver down Mr. Peaslee 's back . They stung him into generosity . As Barton and his prisoner , followed by Mr. Edwards and Jake , brushed by him on their way to the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy , trying to keep back the tears , looked up inquiringly , he murmured , in agitation :  --  " Do n't ye care , sonny ! Now do n't ye care ! " He was greatly stirred -- or he would not have been so incautious as to make his present in person and in public . Illustration : Cat lying on fence . IV When Nancy Ware , Jim 's pretty teacher , heard that Mr. Edwards had let Jim go to jail , she was hotly indignant . She liked Jim , and laughed a little over him , for she knew he adored her . In her view he was a clumsy , nice boy ; awkward and shy , to be sure , but rewarding her friendliness now and then with a really entrancing grin . She liked his imagination , she liked his loyalty , and she liked his dogged resolution . She heard the news at the noon hour on Monday , and after her dinner she hurried at once to the store of Fred Farnsworth . To him she roundly declared that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which struck Fred as a bit highly colored . Fred was thirty-one or thirty-two years old , a sensible , humorous fellow , with considerable personal force . He was very proud of the handsome shop over which hung the sign , " Frederick W. Farnsworth , Fine Crockery and Glassware , " and still prouder of his engagement to Miss Ware . He was the second grand juryman from Ellmington . " Oh , " said he , " Edwards is n't a bad sort of man . He is n't very sociable . I guess he would n't take much impudence , even from that boy of his . They say Jim would n't own up , and the old man wo n't do anything for him till he does . " " If Jimmie Edwards says he did n't fire that gun , he did n't , " said Nancy , positively . " Jimmie is n't the lying kind . I know Mr. Edwards . I ought not to call him a brute , I suppose . But he 's one of these obstinate men who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if you prove to them that they 're wrong , even if it hurts them more than it does any one else . He 's just got it into his head that Jimmie ought to confess , and he 'd let him go to the gallows before he 'd back down . " Nancy spoke with animation , her color rose and her eyes grew bright , and Fred looked and listened admiringly . He was skeptical about Jim , but he was struck with the accuracy of the portrait of Edwards . " I guess that 's about so , " he said . " And when I think of that poor boy shut up in that awful jail , locked into a cell , when he ought to be out-of-doors playing ball and having a good time , it makes my blood boil ! " continued Miss Ware . " Now , Fred , " she concluded , with pretty decision , " you must stop it . " Fred laughed . " Is n't that a pretty large order ? " he asked . " Squire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You can do something , " said his betrothed . " Go to see Jimmie . See if you ca n't find out what 's the matter . Jimmie likes you , perhaps he 'll tell . " " I did n't know Jim had any particular partiality for me , " said Fred , but he felt kindlier toward the boy in spite of himself . " If you can only find out what really happened , I know we can get him out , " averred Miss Ware . " Why do n't you go yourself ? " said Farnsworth . " I ca n't , not till five o'clock . Of course I 'm going then ! " " That 's about four hours off , " said Farnsworth . " But I want something done now ! " exclaimed Nancy . " Oh ! " said Fred , humorously . " Will you go ? " " Of course . I 'll start at once . " Fred dropped his banter . " I 'll tell you what , Nancy . I may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll promise you that he has a fair chance before the grand jury . " Farnsworth started at once for the jail . It was a poor place for a boy , he reflected , as he rang the jailer 's private bell . Calkins himself was not there , and his wife came to the door . She knew Farnsworth ; and when he asked if he might see Jim she laughed a little , and told him to " step right in . " " Hotel Calkins " was a brick building which looked pleasantly like a private dwelling , as , in fact , a good half of it was . In this front half dwelt the jailer ; in the rear half , separated from the living quarters by a thick wall and heavy doors , was the jail proper . There Farnsworth expected to be led . But not at all ! Mrs. Calkins ushered him into her own kitchen , where a wash-tub showed what she was doing , where the afternoon sun and sweet September air poured in at the open windows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here Farnsworth was much surprised to see Jim , curled up in Mrs. Calkins 's own rocking-chair , eating a large red-cheeked apple which he was dividing with a brand-new knife ! " Squire Tucker told Mark , " said Mrs. Calkins , enjoying the joke , " that he guessed James would like our society full as well as that of the prisoners . " As for Jim , he grinned affably , and took another slice of his apple . The awful picture which Miss Ware had drawn of Jim 's dreadful isolation and misery and her own indignant sympathy rushed upon Farnsworth 's mind , and were so comically out of relation with the facts that he sank weakly into the nearest chair and roared . " This -- is -- the way -- you go to jail -- is it ? " he gasped . Mrs. Calkins smiled in sympathy , and Jim , half-suspecting that he ought to be offended at this frank mirth , looked sheepishly at the floor . Farnsworth recovered himself . " A mighty good friend of yours , " he said , " sent me over here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes . She 's coming herself right after school , loaded down with things to console your desolate prison life , I believe , " and Farnsworth had to stop to laugh again . " But she wanted me to start right in and help you out of this , and that 's what I 'm here for . " " Thank you , " said Jim , embarrassed , but polite . But it struck Farnsworth , as he said afterward , that the boy " shied " a little . " Miss Ware says , " he went on , " that she does n't believe you fired that shot , and she wants you to tell me exactly what did happen . Now if we can show that you did n't shoot , I can get you out of here quick . " " What they going to do to me ? " said Jim . " That depends . It makes a difference how much Lamoury 's hurt . The penalty might be severe if he 's got a bad wound . But even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was there , or that the gun went off by accident , or that you were firing at something else , it would make a big difference . And if you can show that you were n't there at all -- why , out you go , scot-free . But , Jim , you can see yourself that if you do n't tell what you know , everybody 'll think that you shot and meant to hurt Lamoury , and then it might go pretty hard with you . Now come , tell me what happened . " " You 'd better tell , Jimmie , " said Mrs. Calkins , straightening up from her wash-tub . " You wo n't find any better friends than Mr. Farnsworth and Miss Ware . " The young man , as he talked , watched the boy curiously . Jim flushed and squirmed , and looked now at the floor and now out at the window , with a marked uneasiness and embarrassment that greatly puzzled his friend . And when he stopped , and the boy had to answer , his distress became really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Farnsworth hazarded , after a little , putting a kindly hand on the boy 's arm , while Mrs. Calkins stood quiet by her tub in friendly expectation . But Jim remained dumb . After waiting a little , Farnsworth , seeing the boy so miserable , took pity on him . " Well , never mind , Jim , " he said . " You need n't tell if you do n't want to . " He would have to let Nancy coax it out of him . But he was puzzled , impressed with a sense of mystery and with a growing conviction that the boy was shielding some one else . He began to talk cheerfully of other things , hoping that Jim might perhaps drop a useful hint , or , at least , that the boy would gain confidence in him as a friend . By chance he asked :  --  " Where did you get the knife , Jim ? " " Mr. Peaslee gave it to me . " " Peaslee ! " exclaimed Farnsworth . He well knew the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much of a knife , " said Jim , apologetic but pleased . Jim 's views of the world were changing : his father , although a bandit chief , had let him go to jail , while this stingy old man , with no halo of adventure about him , gave him a knife ; and here were Miss Ware and Mr. Farnsworth and Mrs. Calkins and the jailer , none of them smugglers , who were very kind . Farnsworth rose to go . Then Jim , summoning all his courage , asked a question which had long been trembling on his lips . " What do they do to smugglers , Mr. Farnsworth ? " " Fine ' em , or put ' em in jail , or both . Why ? " " Nothing much , " said Jim , but obviously he was cast down . Farnsworth walked thoughtfully toward his store . " By George ! " he thought suddenly . " I wonder --  " The gossip about the senior Edwards had occurred to him , and at the same time he remembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . " If Edwards wanted to shoot any one he would n't do it in his own back yard , and he would n't treat his own boy that way , either . " Still , the idea clung to him . And then he thought of Nancy , and chuckled . " If she comes to the store before she goes to the jail I wo n't tell her what she 'll find there , " he promised himself . Meanwhile , Mr. Peaslee felt a growing discomfort . He ate his dinner and answered the brisk questions of his wife with increasing preoccupation . Like Miss Ware , he was picturing Jim solitary and suffering in his lonely cell . With the utmost sincerity and ingenuousness he condemned Mr. Edwards . " Hai n't he got any feelin ' for his own flesh and blood ? " he asked himself . " ' T ai n't right ; somebody 'd ought to deal with him . " As he pottered about his yard after dinner , he finally worked himself up to the point of speaking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led him to this undertaking had he known Mr. Edwards better , or realized the father 's present mood . Hurt exceedingly by Jim 's lying and contempt of his wishes , hurt even more through his disappointed desire to help his boy , Mr. Edwards was sore and sensitive , discontented both with Jim and with himself . He did not want Jim in jail , he told himself ; and the neighbors who were so uniformly assuming that he did might better give their thoughts to matters that concerned them more . He would get the boy out of jail quick enough if the boy would only let him . As he stepped out of the house to do an errand at the barn , Mr. Peaslee hailed him over the dividing fence . Somewhat put out , Mr. Edwards nevertheless turned and walked toward his neighbor . Mr. Peaslee , leaning over the fence , began . " Ed'ards , " he said , reaching out an anxious , deprecatory hand , " do n't ye think you 're jest a leetle mite hard on that boy o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a look that made him shiver , and cut the conversation short by turning on his heel and marching toward the barn . " Dretful ha'sh man , dretful ha'sh ! " Mr. Peaslee muttered to himself . " Nice , likely boy as ever was . If I had a boy like that , I swan I would n't treat him so con-sarned mean ! " He turned away much shocked , and saw the Calico Cat watching him ironically from the chicken-house . " Drat that cat ! " said he . " I ai n't goin ' to stay round here -- not with that beast grinning at me . " He got his hat and started up-town , not knowing in the least what he intended to do there . He stopped , however , at every shop window and studied baseballs , bats , tivoli-boards , accordions . He was beginning to wonder if a twenty-five-cent knife was enough to console Jim for his unmerited incarceration . He was gazing forlornly in at the window of Upham 's drugstore , where some half-dozen harmonicas were displayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his dungeon cell , when Hibbard spoke to him . He drew the lawyer aside , and , peering closely into his face with anxious eyes exaggerated by his spectacles , said insinuatingly :  --  " Jest ' twixt you and me kinder confidential , Pete ai n't hurt bad , is he ? You do n't mind sayin ' , do ye ? " Jake drew himself up , surprised and suspicious . Did the old fool think him as innocent as all that ? " He 's hurt bad , Mr. Peaslee , bad , " he said , with dignity . " Of course it is n't fatal -- unless it should mortify . " He waved his hand deprecatingly . " I ca n't imagine what that Edwards boy used in his gun . " Mr. Peaslee knew : the marble ! He trembled . Still , he knew Jake 's reputation . A shrewd thought visited his troubled mind . " What doctor 's seein ' him ? " he asked . " Doctor ! " exclaimed Hibbard , irritated . " Doctor ! You know these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than of the evil one himself . Pete 's usin ' some old woman 's stuff on his wounds ,  - -  bear 's grease , rattlesnake oil , catnip tea ,  - -  what do I know ? I ca n't make him see a doctor . " " Some doctor 'll have to testify to court , wo n't they ? " persisted Mr. Peaslee . " Oh , I 'll look out for that , do n't you fear ! " the lawyer said easily ; but nevertheless he made a pretext for leaving the old man . Perhaps had Mr. Peaslee 's fears not been so keen , he would have taken some comfort from this conversation ; but as it was he felt that the lawyer was dangerous ; he feared that Pete really was badly hurt . It would go hard , then , with Jim . It would , by the same token , go hard with himself should he confess . Suddenly he turned and rushed into Upham 's store . " Upham , " said he , " I want that ! " And he pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " harp attachment "  -- bright-colored and of amazing possibilities . Upham , a neat little gentleman with nicely trimmed side-whiskers , who was always fluttered by the unexpected , hesitated , half opened his mouth , and then forgot either to shut it or to speak . " Why , Mr. Peaslee , " he stammered at last , " it 's real expensive ! You -- it 's two dollars and seventy-five cents . " " Do n't care nothin ' what it costs , " said Mr. Peaslee , who was in a hurry for fear lest he should think twice . When he came out of the store with the harmonica in his hands , he almost stumbled into Miss Ware . She was on her way to Jim , and , of course , her mind was full of his affairs . Here was Mr. Edwards 's next neighbor . She impulsively stopped to ask if the misguided father still held to his resolution about Jim . Mr. Peaslee had reason to know that he did , and said so . " I tell ye , Miss Ware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to a stony-hearted generation , and that 's a fact . He ai n't got any compassion in him , seems though . " " It 's a shame , a perfect shame ! " exclaimed Nancy . " ' T ai n't right , " said Mr. Peaslee , with a warmth which surprised the young woman , and made her warm to this old man , whom she had always thought so selfish . " ' T ai n't right -- your own flesh and blood so . " " Well , " said Miss Ware , " I 'm going to the jail now . I want to see Jimmie . It must be awful there . " " Well , now , that 's real kind of ye , " responded Mr. Peaslee . " I wonder now if you 'd mind taking this along to him , " and he offered her the paper parcel . " It 's a harmonica , I guess they call it . It 's real handsome . It cost consid'able -- a pretty consid'able sum . I feel kinder sorry for the leetle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And he kept repeating , in a tone which suggested whistling to keep your courage up , " Not a mite , not a mite . " Miss Ware smothered a laugh on hearing what the present was . She must not hurt the feelings of this kind old man ! " Oh , " said the little hypocrite , " that 's nice ! Jimmie 'll be so pleased . " But perhaps the harmonica pleased Jim as much as the schoolbooks which the school-teacher , with a solicitous eye on her pupil 's standing in his studies , was taking to him . Saying good-by to Mr. Peaslee , Miss Ware , books and harmonica in hand , went on her way to visit the afflicted boy in his dungeon . Meanwhile Jim , turning the wringer for Mrs. Calkins , and listening to her stories of " Mark 's " prowess with all sorts of malefactors , was having an excellent time . He had decided to be a sheriff when he grew up . Illustration : Cat curled up on floor . V The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term of the Adams County court finally dawned . How Mr. Peaslee had looked forward to that day ! How often had he pictured the scene -- the bustle about the court house ; the agreeable crowd of black-coated lawyers , with their clever talk , their good stories ; the grave judge , and the still graver side judges ; the greetings and hand-shakings amid much joking and laughter ; the county gossip among the grand jurors in the informal moments before they filed into the courtroom to be sworn and to receive the judge 's charge ; himself , finally , in his best black coat and cherished beaver hat , there in the midst of it -- important , weighty , respected , a public man ! He had cherished the vision of himself walking up the village street on that first morning , a dignitary returning the cordial and admiring salutes of his village friends . He had seen himself later in the jury-room , shrewdly " leading " the reluctant witness , delivering weighty opinions on the bearing of testimony , and making all respect him as a marvel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the most important and pleasurable days of his life , the rung in a ladder of preferment which reached as high as the state-house dome ! And when that day came , it rained ; steadily , gloomily , fiercely rained . Solomon was not allowed to wear his best clothes . When , peering out of the window , he hopefully said he " guessed mebbe ' t was goin ' to clear , " his wife invited him tartly to " wait till it did . " She insisted that he put on his every-day clothes , and thus arrayed , and without meeting a single villager to realize the importance of his errand , he waded up to the court house , the pelting rain rattling on his old umbrella , the fierce wind almost wrenching it inside out . There was , of course , no parade on the courthouse steps for the benefit of a wondering village , as there would have been had the day been fine . Instead , the men , steaming with wet , stood about uncomfortably in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet with the drip from their umbrellas . The air in the court house was close , and every one felt uncomfortable and depressed . Mr. Peaslee , having greeted three or four men whom he knew , found himself jammed into a corner behind four or five jurors who were strangers to him , but he was too disheartened to try to scrape acquaintance with them . He felt lonely and helpless . He looked enviously over to the other end of the corridor , where Fred Farnsworth , Eben Sampson , and Albion Small were standing together . In contrast with the others , these men were laughing . Albion was " consid'able of a joker , " Mr. Peaslee reflected gloomily . Then old Abijah Keith stormed in , and in his high , shrill voice began immediately to utter his unfavorable opinion of everything and everybody . " Well , if he ai n't here again ! " exclaimed , in disgust , Hiram Hopkins , one of the men in front of Solomon . " Cantankerest old lummux in the whole state -- just lots on upsetting things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abijah , I call him ! " Mr. Peaslee shrank back into his corner nervously . He knew this old tyrant and dreaded him . Not much was done that first day . The clerk swore them ; the judge charged them , and appointed the sensible , steady Sampson foreman . Then they retired to the jury-room -- a big , desolate place , wherein was a long , ink-spattered table surrounded by wooden armchairs and spittoons . The grand jurors seated themselves , and were solemnly silent while John Paige , the state 's attorney , began the dull task of presenting cases . Mr. Peaslee found that he had nothing brilliant to say . As a matter of fact , his own troubles were making him see everything yellow . The jurymen did not seem to him as agreeable a lot as he had expected , and as for Paige , he irritated Solomon beyond measure . Paige was an able young man and a good lawyer , and was entitled to the position which he had attained so young ; but , the son of a man of rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , and had a sophistication which Solomon viewed with deep suspicion . Moreover , he discarded the garb which Mr. Peaslee regarded as sacred . He was not in black . Instead , he wore a light gray business suit , his collar was very knowing in cut , and his cravat of dark blue was caught with a gold pin . " Citified smart Aleck , " was Mr. Peaslee 's characterization . To tell the truth , he mistrusted the man 's ability , and was afraid of him . If that fellow knew , Mr. Peaslee felt that it would go hard with him . Generally , Paige was popular . Solomon had , of course , been painfully awake to every hint and intimation in regard to Jim 's case . He had seen Jake Hibbard , that carrion crow of the law , loafing about the corridors , and the sight had made him shiver . He had next heard that Jim 's case would be quickly called ,  - -  probably on the next day ,  - -  news producing a complex emotion , the elements of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so which he overheard indicated that the out-of-town men were inclined to take a harsh view of the matter . And reflecting on all these things , he paddled home through the depressing wet . And the next day it rained . More and more perturbed , as the climax approached , Mr. Peaslee took his place in the jury-room , and sat there with unhearing ears . He sat and thought and delivered battle with his conscience , which was growing painfully vigorous and aggressive . But , after all , perhaps they would not find a true bill , and then Jim would go free , and he could breathe again . Mr. Peaslee clung to the hope , and hugged it . It was the one thing which gave him courage . " Gentlemen of the grand jury , " suddenly he heard Paige saying , " the next case for you to consider is that of James Edwards , aged fifteen , of Ellmington , charged with assault , with intent to kill , upon one Peter Lamoury , also of Ellmington . " And he proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monotonous rapidity with which he rattled it off , scared Mr. Peaslee badly with its solemn-sounding legal phraseology . " Gentlemen , " said Paige , laying down the paper , " there was no eyewitness to the actual assault ; and only three people have any personal knowledge of the event -- Mr . Edwards , the defendant 's father , the accused himself , and the complainant . Mr. Lamoury , his counsel tells me , is in no condition to appear . But I have here , " lifting a paper , " his affidavit , properly executed , giving his version of the matter . The boy 's father , however , is at hand . Probably the jury would like to question him . " " It seems to me , " said Mr. Sampson , " that Mr. Edwards would be pretty apt to know the rights of it , if he 's willing to talk . I guess we 'd better hear him . " The state 's attorney stepped to the door . " This way , please ! " he called , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the man 's face closely , although for very different reasons , and both found it sternly uncompromising . " Please take a chair , Mr. Edwards , " said Paige , and in a swift glance rapidly estimated the man . " Here 's some one who wo n't lie , " he thought , impressed . " Now , " he resumed , " will you kindly tell the members of the grand jury what you know of the case ? " Mr. Edwards cleared his throat painfully . Determined as he was to let his rebellious boy take whatever punishment his mistaken course might bring , he now began to wish that the punishment would be light . His confidence that Jim needed only to be pushed a little to confess was somewhat shaken , and the charge was really serious . He felt a desire to explain , to palliate , to minimize . " Gentlemen , " he said , " my boy 's always been a good boy . I ca n't believe that he meant to hurt Lamoury or any one else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , " said Paige , crisply . Mr. Peaslee caught his breath indignantly . He had been entirely in sympathy with Mr. Edwards 's soft mode of approaching his story . Paige seemed to him unfeeling . " I will answer any questions , " said Mr. Edwards , stiffening . " Did you hear any shot fired ? " began Paige . " Yes . " " Where were you ? " " I was asleep in the room above Jim 's . " " Was Jim in his room ? " " I suppose so . " " You suppose so . Do n't you know ? " " No , I do n't know . " " But to the best of your knowledge and belief he was there ? " " Yes . " " And the shot waked you ? " " Yes . " " What did you do on hearing the shot ? " " I jumped to the window . " " Tell what you saw , please . " " I saw a man fall in the orchard , and hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone when I got there . " " Then what ? " " I went to speak to Jim . " " He was in his room , then , immediately after the shot ? " " Yes . " " Ah ! And when you spoke to him , did he admit firing the shot ? " " No . " " Did he deny it ? " " Yes . " " Where was his gun ? " " In the rack over the mantel . " " In the rack over the mantel , " repeated Paige , slowly , glancing at the jurors . " Did you examine it ? " " Yes . " " What was its condition ? Did it show that it had been fired ? " " No ; it was clean . " " It was clean , " repeated Paige . " I understand that it was a double-barreled , muzzle-loading shotgun . Were there any rags about ? " " Yes . " " Where were they ? " " One was in the ashes of the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide it ? " " Yes "  - -  reluctantly . " If it was that sort of gun , there must have been a shot-pouch and powder-flask . Where were they ? " " In the drawer where Jim keeps them . " " Everything looked , then , as if no shot had been fired ? " " Yes . " " Was there any one besides yourself and your son in the house ? " " No . " " Your housekeeper ? " " She had stepped out . " " To the best of your knowledge , then , there was no one about to fire the shot except your son ? " " No . " " That will do , " said Paige , with an accent of finality . " That is , " he added , with the air of one who observes a courteous form , " unless some of the grand jurors wish to ask a question . " There were various things which were new to Mr. Peaslee in this testimony . He had supposed that Jim had been picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had had no idea that the case against him was so strong . How had the boy got to the room so soon after he himself had left , and why had he gone there ? And why , why had he cleaned the shotgun ? The grand jury must believe in his guilt . And when the case came to trial , what could Jim say to clear himself ? It was going hard , hard with the boy . Mr. Peaslee 's mouth grew dry , his palms moist ; he moved uneasily in his chair . Once or twice he felt sure that the next instant he would find himself on his feet , but the minutes passed and he still was seated . And Farnsworth , anxious , for the sake of his betrothed , Miss Ware , to help Jim , was nonplussed . There were two possible explanations of Jim 's cleaning the gun , if he did clean it : the first , that Jim was protecting himself ; the second , that he was shielding some one else . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious but well-directed inquiries about Mr. Edwards , and had satisfied himself that the rumors about his smuggling were nothing but malicious gossip . There was not a man of greater honesty in the state . The boy must have done the shooting . Miss Ware would have to give it up . Still , he would hazard a question . " Mr. Edwards , " he said , " Lamoury worked for you once , did n't he ? " " Yes . " " You quarreled , did n't you ? " " I discharged him for intemperance . " " There was no bad blood ? " " Lamoury was angry , I believe . " Farnsworth stopped ; there was nothing to be gained by this course of questioning in the way of clearing Jim . Of course later , the point that Lamoury had a grudge against the family might have importance , although he could not see just how . Some one else surely heard that gunshot . It was incredible that the neighborhood should be so deserted . If only there were another witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to tell the truth , a little impatient . It was near the dinner-hour , and they were hungry . The case seemed perfectly plain to them . It was not likely , they argued , that the boy 's father could be mistaken . " You may go , " said Paige to Mr. Edwards . " I do n't see , " he began , when the witness had left the room , " any need for our going further into this case . Whatever we may think of the animus of the complainant ,  - -  I take it that was what you wished to bring out , Mr. Farnsworth ,  - -  there seems to be no question but that the boy fired the shot . The presumption seems strong also that he intended to hit . Were there any accident or any good excuse , the boy could , of course , have no motive not to tell it . I suggest that a true bill be found at once , and that we proceed to more important matters . I want to remind you that we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemen , " said Sampson , " I guess we 're pretty much of a mind about this . If no one has any objections , I guess we 'll call it a vote . " He looked round . " As we 're all agreed --  " he began . " Just a moment , Sampson ! " suddenly exclaimed Farnsworth . It had just then flashed over him that Mr. Peaslee , the kind Mr. Peaslee , who gave Jim knives and harmonicas , was next-door neighbor to the Edwardses . If he had been at home when the shot was fired , he must have heard it , and he might have seen some significant thing which questioning might bring out . Of course , if Peaslee had seen anything , he would have spoken , but he might have overlooked the importance of some fact or other . " Just a moment , Sampson ! " he said , and put up his hand . Then he swung sharply in his chair and put the question :  --  " Peaslee , where were you when that shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . VI " Peaslee , where were you when that shot was fired ? " asked Farnsworth , and as he spoke he turned and looked toward Solomon , whose seat was some three or four places to his left , on the same side of the table . Had the question not been uttered , it would have died upon his lips , so much surprised was he at what he saw . Mr. Peaslee , white and trembling with some strong emotion , had his hands upon the table and was raising himself , slowly and painfully , to his feet . He rolled his eyes , which looked bigger and more pathetic than ever behind his glasses , toward Farnsworth at the sound of his voice , but the young man knew instinctively that Solomon , moved by some strong idea of his own , had not grasped the question . " Gentlemen , " Mr. Peaslee began , in shaky tones , " I guess I got a word to say afore ye find a true bill agin that little feller . He 's as peaceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't let him stay all bolted and barred into no jail , when it do n't need anythin ' but my say-so to get him out . Ye see , gentlemen , "  - -  Solomon paused , moistened his dry mouth , and cast a timorous look over the puzzled faces of the jurymen ,  --  " ye see , ' t was me that shot Lamoury . " Not a sound came from the grand jury ; the members sat and stared at him in blank wonder , hardly able to credit their ears . Paige , the state 's attorney , who was making some notes at the time , held his pen for a good half-minute part way between his paper and the inkstand while he gazed in astonishment at Peaslee . To have a grand juror , a sober , respectable man , rise in the jury-room and confess that he is the real offender in a case under consideration , is not usual . The surprise was absolute . For Farnsworth , it was more than a surprise ; it was a relief . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shot ! He felt a glow of admiration for Nancy 's sure intuition and loyalty to her pupil . He rejoiced that Jim was cleared for her sake and for the boy 's . Insensibly he had grown more and more interested in Jim and attached to him . Now -- everything was explained . Everything ? No , Jim 's strange activity in concealing the evidences of the shot , his queer reserve when questioned as to what he knew -- these seemed more perplexing than ever . Farnsworth , hoping for light upon these points , settled back in his chair to listen . Mr. Peaslee had more to say . " It kinder goes agin the grain , " Solomon resumed , with a weary , deprecatory smile , " to own up you 've been actin ' like a fool , but I guess I got to do it . " This was the way on ' t : I stepped over to Ed'ards 's jest to talk over matters and things . Well , I could n't seem to raise anybody to the front of the house , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there was n't somebody out back . There wa' n't . There did n't seem to be anybody to home . " Now , gentlemen , seems as though you 'd see how ' t was when I tell ye . There 's an old white and yaller cat , with a kinder sassy patch over her eye , "  - -  Mr . Peaslee 's meek voice here took on a trace of heat ,  --  " that 's been a-pesterin ' the life out o ' me goin ' on a year . I guess ye know how ' t is -- one of them pesky , yowlin ' , chicken-stealin ' , rusty old nuisances that hai n't any sociability to ' em , anyhow . " Well , there she was a-settin ' , comfortable as a hot punkin pie , and lookin ' as if she owned the place . And there was the boy 's gun right there handy . The cat riled me so , I jest loaded her up . ' T wa' n't in human natur ' not to , now was it ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sorter stuck in a marble . It could n't do no harm , and it might kinder help a leetle . And I just fired her off . I did n't expect to hit any French Canadian ; I did n't know there was any of the critters round . " Then when I see a feller fall out of the bushes I was scared , now I tell ye . Here I was , member of the grand jury , and everything , and it did n't somehow seem right and fittin ' for no member of the grand jury to be fillin ' up a feller human bein ' with bird shot an ' marbles . I guess I did n't think much what I was a-doin ' of , no-how . ' T any rate , I jest sneaked off home , and then I jest let things slip along and slide along till here I be . I guess if a true bill 's got to be found agin any one , it 's got to be found agin me . " And Mr. Peaslee sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were for a moment silent . But soon this tale of a cat , bird shot , and an unexpected Canadian began to disclose a comic aspect ; the plight of poor , respectable Mr. Peaslee , in all the fresh honors of his jurorship , began to show a ludicrous side ; their own position as grave men seeing what they thought a serious offense change , as by magic , into a farcical accident , bit by bit revealed its humor . Sampson , the foreman , glanced at Paige , the state 's attorney . The young man 's face wore an odd expression . Their eyes met , and Sampson 's mouth began to twitch . Albion Small , who was " consid'able of a joker , " suddenly choked . Farnsworth , having revealed to him in a flash the significance of the harmonica " with harp attachment , " gave way and laughed outright . Smiles appeared on faces all round the table ; and as the comicality of the whole affair more and more struck upon their astonished minds , the smiles became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirth had so good-humored a note that Solomon , taking heart , looked about the table with a sheepish grin . But his heart sank and his grin vanished when his eyes fell upon Abijah Keith . For Abijah did not smile . He sat grim as fate , stern disapproval of all this levity expressed in every deep fold of his wrinkled old countenance . A formidable person was Abijah . He had a great brush of white hair , which stood up fiercely from his narrow forehead ; a high , arched nose like the beak of a hawk , on which rested a pair of huge round spectacles ; a mouth like a straight line inclosed between a great parenthesis of leathery wrinkles . Up from under his old-fashioned stock , round a chin like a paving-stone , curled an aggressive , white , wiry beard , and his blue eyes were steel-bright and hard . " Ca n't see what you 're cackling so for ! " he exclaimed , his shrill accents full of contempt . " Actin ' like a passel of hens ! There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot him , did n't they ? He "  - -  and Abijah pointed a knotted , skinny , hard old finger at the shrinking Solomon --  " he shot him , did n't he ? Ser'us business , I call it . Guess the grand jury 's got suthin ' to say to it , hai n't they ? Cat ? Cat 's foot , I say . Likely story , likely story . Do n't believe a word on ' t . " Solomon dared to steal a look , and was not reassured to see in the jurymen 's faces doubt replacing mirth . Then Hiram Hopkins 's hearty voice , ringing with opposition , struck upon his delighted ear . He remembered Hiram 's dislike for the cantankerous Keith . Here perhaps was a defender . " Oh , come , Mr. Keith ! Oh , come now ! " he heard Hopkins exclaim . " What 's the use of raising a rumpus ? It was n't nothing but bird shot . Folks do n't go murdering folks with bird shot . " " Do n't care if ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones . " Do n't care if ' t was pin-heads ; principle 's the same . " " It is , it is ! " admitted Solomon , in his soul . " Well , " said Hiram , with a common sense in which Mr. Peaslee took comfort , " the practical effect is mighty different . Gentlemen , " he added to the jurors , " I ca n't see that we 've got any call to go any further with this . Peaslee was just shooting at a cat . I do n't see the sense of taking up the time of the court and makin ' expense for any such foolishness . I say we 'd better dismiss young Edwards 's case , and Peaslee 's along with it . It 's such fool doings , I think we 'd better , if only to keep folks from laughing at the grand jury . " Solomon 's heart was in his mouth . Would the others take this view -- or Keith 's ? " Oily talk , dretful oily talk ! " came Abijah 's fierce pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shot him , did n't he ? Grand juror -- what difference does that make ? If they ai n't fit , weed ' em out -- weed ' em out ! " " Fit ? " said Hiram . " It took some spunk to get up there and tell just what a fool he 'd been , didn't --  " " Humph ! " Abijah interrupted , with a snort . " Had to , did n't he ? Farnsworth asked him where he was , did n't he ? Had to squirm out somehow , did n't he ? Got about as much spine as a taller candle with the wick drawed out , accordin ' to his own showin ' . Better weed him out , better weed him out ! Humph ! " Poor Mr. Peaslee sank still lower in his chair ; his head fell still lower on his chest . They were taking away from him even the credit of voluntary confession . Why had Farnsworth asked that question ? In casting doubt upon his one brave deed fate seemed to him to have done its worst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Farnsworth . He wished to be just . But he was indignant with Peaslee . After his first laughter , his thoughts had dwelt upon the trouble that Solomon had brought upon the innocent Jim , " just to save his own hide , the old -- skee-zicks ! " he exclaimed to himself . After all , what did he know about Peaslee ? If the man had merely shot at a cat , why under the sun should he not have said so at once , and saved all this bother ? The more he thought , the more indignant he grew -- and the more doubtful . He did not notice at all the look of timid gratitude which Mr. Peaslee cast in his direction . " Course he was up before you spoke ! " Solomon was further gratified to hear Hopkins declare , in his big , hearty voice . " And I think a man who owns up fair and square just when it 's hardest to has got spine enough to hold him together , anyhow . " " Up before ye asked him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Tell me that , will ye ? " And Solomon , listening anxiously for Farnsworth 's answer , was depressed to hear him give merely a good-humored laugh at Uncle Abijah 's thrust . " Mr. Peaslee , " asked Sampson , so unexpectedly that Solomon jumped , " did n't you say something about a marble ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Peaslee , gloomily . " Fit the bore , did it ? " continued the foreman . " Slick , " answered Mr. Peaslee , with the brevity of despair . " If that marble fitted the bore , " said Albion Small , while Sampson nodded assent , " it 's my opinion it might do considerable damage . " His opinion had weight , for Small was a hunter of repute . Recovered from their amusement , the grand jurors had become gradually impressed with the idea that Mr. Peaslee 's confession still left some awkward questions unanswered . If the matter were so simple as he said , why had he kept silent so long ? The jurymen came from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some knowledge of the principal men of Ellmington , and although such of them as had dealings at its bank had met Mr. Peaslee , none of them knew him well . He was a newcomer at the village , and when at his farm had not had a wide acquaintance . They looked to Farnsworth as his fellow townsman to speak for him ; but Farnsworth said nothing , and seemed preoccupied and doubtful . The inference was that he shared their perplexity . They felt that Keith , for all his " cantankerousness , " might be right . Solomon could draw no comfort from their faces . All this while Paige had been playing with his watch-chain and watching Abijah , whose character he appreciated , with discreet amusement ; but he found himself in essential agreement with the peppery old fellow . " Ask the state 's attorney , why do n't ye ? " put in Keith , impatiently . " He 'll tell ye I 've got the rights on ' t . Ai n't afraid , be ye ? " Sampson smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paige , " I guess perhaps you 'd better give us the law of this . " " Well , gentlemen , " said Paige , " as a matter of law , Mr. Keith would seem to be right , " and at the word Solomon 's spirits sank to new depths . " Did n't I tell ye ? " said Abijah , triumphantly . Had the state 's attorney said that he was wrong , the old man would have called him a popinjay to his face . Abijah 's exclamation was not deference to legal knowledge ; it was merely quick seizure of a tactical point . " Lamoury was shot , " Paige went on , with a little smile at Keith 's interruption , " and by his own statement , Mr. Peaslee shot him . On his own admission , his gun was dangerously loaded . Although a boy , a neighbor 's son , was charged , through his act , with a serious offense against the laws , he made no confession . And when , at last , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did it of his own volition , or because he was forced to do so by the embarrassing question put to him by one of your number . I do n't impugn his veracity , but I am bound to remark that he is an interested witness . All this is a question of fact for you to consider . " I think you should know a little more . To determine if there was any motive , you need to know if there was any bad blood between Mr. Peaslee and Lamoury ; to find an indictment to fit the case you need to know how badly Lamoury is hurt . I think you should have Lamoury here . Cross-questioning him , and perhaps Mr. Peaslee , "  - -  Solomon shivered ,  --  " should establish whether the shot was accidental , as the accused says , or intentional , as Lamoury contends . I 'll have the complainant here to-morrow , if it 's a possible thing . As there 's no formal charge -- as yet -- against Mr. Peaslee , I think you may properly postpone until then the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , "  - -  Solomon shivered again ,  --  " and of his proper holding for appearance before the court . Meanwhile , I suggest that you dispose of the case against young Edwards , and then adjourn . Mr. Peaslee , " he added significantly , " will of course be present to-morrow morning . " " Sartain , sartain , " answered poor Solomon , tremulously . It was already late , and when the grand jury had formally dismissed the complaint against Jim , the hour was so advanced that adjournment was taken for the day . When Mr. Peaslee left the court house no one spoke to him , and he walked slowly home , full of the worst forebodings . Why had he put in that marble ? Relieved of his burden of anxiety and remorse in regard to Jim , he began to think more definitely than he had done heretofore of the possibility of serious harm to Lamoury . It was dreadful to think that he might have badly wounded an inoffensive man . Was Lamoury much hurt ? What would happen to a marble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would his case get to trial ? Could he , without a single witness , prove that it was an accident ? The sinister figure of Jake Hibbard rose before him , and made him feel helpless and frightened . The future looked black . " But I done right , " he tried to console himself by saying . " I done right . " Better late than never , to be sure ; but if genuine comfort in a good deed is sought , it is best to act at once . Mr. Peaslee could feel but small satisfaction in his tardy confession . Moreover , he must now face his wife . As he turned with reluctant feet into his own yard he fairly shrank in anticipation under the sharp hail of her biting words . To postpone a little the inevitable , to gather strength somewhat to meet the shock , he passed the kitchen porch and went on toward the barn . Seating himself upon an upturned pail , he stayed there a long while , still as a statue , while he chewed the cud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn door there was a familiar flash of white and yellow . Looking wearily up he saw the great , green eyes of the Calico Cat fastened upon him in fierce distrust . She had one foot uplifted as if she did not know whether it was safe to put it down , and in her mouth , pendent , was a Calico Kitten . Mr. Peaslee , silent and immovable , watched her with apathetic eyes . Finally , as if assured he was not dangerous , she put down her foot and disappeared with soft and cushioned tread into the dim recesses of the barn . Yet a little while and she again appeared in the doorway with a second duplicate of herself . Again an interval , and she brought a third . " Well , " said Solomon to himself , his spirit quite crushed , " I guess she ai n't bringing no more than belong to me by rights . " Nevertheless , he could not endure to see any others . He went desperately into the house , where he found his wife fuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well tell ye , first as last , " he said , in a sort of stubborn despair . " ' T was me that shot Lamoury . " " You ! " exclaimed his wife , dropping her knife and fork , and looking at him as if she thought he had taken leave of his senses . " I guess I 'm the feller , " he averred , with queer , pathetic humor . And turning a patient , rounded back to his wife 's expected indignation , he told his story while he nervously washed at the sink , and fumblingly dried his face and hands in the coarse roller towel . He made these operations last as long as his confession . Then , at an end of his resources , he turned to face the storm . Mrs. Peaslee simply looked at him . She struggled to speak , but she found herself in the predicament of one who has used up all ammunition on the skirmish-line , and comes helpless to the battle . She simply could think of nothing adequate to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . Then she gave it up . " Draw up your chair ! " she said sharply . " I guess ye got to eat , whatever ye be ! " Illustration : HE TURNED TO FACE THE STORM Illustration : Cat drinking from saucer . VII When the grand jury dispersed after Mr. Peaslee 's confession , Farnsworth , first speaking a few words to Paige , the state 's attorney , hurried toward the Union School . As he expected , he met Miss Ware coming from it on her way to her boarding-house . He waved his hat , and called :  --  " Jim 's free ! " As he reached her side he added , " He did n't fire the shot at all . " " Of course he did n't ! " cried Nancy , triumphantly . " Did n't I tell you ? But who did , and how did you find out ? " " Peaslee , " said Farnsworth . " He owned up . " " Mr. Peaslee ! Then that awful harmonica -- Why , the wretch ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud ! These are jury-room secrets which I 'm not supposed to tell . " But he told them , nevertheless . As the two walked along together , he gave her an account of all that had happened . " But what I do n't understand , " he concluded , " is what made Jim behave so . What did he clean his gun for ? Why did he hide the rags and put away the ammunition ? He acted just as if he were trying to shield some one . We know he was n't trying to shield himself , and I do n't see why he should shield Peaslee . " " Fred ! " said Nancy , stopping and facing him . " Jim knew that his father was the only person in the house , did n't he ? " " Yes , " said Farnsworth . " Then he thought his father did it ! " " O pshaw ! " exclaimed Farnsworth . " He could n't ! " " Do n't be rude , Fred ! " admonished Nancy . " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . How could he have thought anything else ? I 'm going straight to the jail and find out . And can we get him away from that jail ? " " Yes , " said Farnsworth . " I spoke to Paige . He said he 'd bring the boy in and have him discharged this afternoon . He has to appear before the judge , you know , before he can be let go . " " That 's nice , " said Nancy . " Now , Fred , you go straight to Mr. Edwards and bring him up there , too . I do n't suppose any one 's thought to tell him . " " But I have n't had any dinner , " objected Farnsworth . " Dinner ! " exclaimed Miss Ware , in deep scorn , and Farnsworth laughed and surrendered . They separated then . Miss Ware took the side street to the jail , while Farnsworth hurried along toward Edwards 's house . " Mr. Edwards , " he said , when that gentleman appeared at the door , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and as he spoke he was struck with the strain which showed in the man 's face . " He must have felt it a good deal , " he reflected , with surprise . A sudden fear showed in Mr. Edwards 's eyes . " Jim is n't sick , is he ? " he asked . " Oh , no ! " replied Farnsworth , hastily . " He 's cleared , that 's all . We 'll have him out of jail this afternoon . " " Cleared ? " repeated Mr. Edwards , distrustfully . Was Farnsworth joking ? Nothing was more certain in the father 's mind than that Jim had fired the shot . No other supposition was possible . His face grew severe at the thought that Farnsworth was trifling with him . " Yes , cleared ! " said the young man , somewhat nettled . " We have absolute , certain proof that Jim had n't anything to do with it . " " I should like to hear it , " said Mr. Edwards , coldly . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Farnsworth , irritated at the incredulity of the man . What was the fellow made of ? Mr. Edwards said nothing . He turned and got his hat , and walked with Farnsworth up the street the half-mile to the jail . His face was impassive , but his movements had a new alertness , and Farnsworth noted that he had to walk painfully fast to keep up with this much older man . Edwards , in spite of his cold exterior , was a man of strong feeling , and there was , in fact , a deep joy and a deep regret at his heart . He knew with thankfulness that he had a truthful and courageous son . He saw with passionate self-reproach that he had done the boy a great injustice . But why , why had Jim cleaned the gun ? Farnsworth , little guessing the turmoil in the heart of the grave man by his side , was wondering if , after all , Miss Ware could be right in thinking that Jim had sacrificed himself for this unfeeling parent . " If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the father 's treatment of the boy , " what a little brick Jim is ! " He had a very human desire to present this view and prick this automaton into some show of life . " Mr. Edwards , " he said suddenly , " Jim knew , did n't he , that you were the only person besides himself at home ? " " I suppose so . " " Does it occur to you that he may have thought you did the shooting ? " " That ca n't be so , " said Mr. Edwards ; but there was a note of shocked concern , of dismay , in his tone which satisfied Farnsworth , and again he thought more kindly of his companion . And Mr. Edwards was stirred by the unexpected question . After all , he thought , since Jim was not trying to shield himself , whom else could he wish to shield ? And a sudden deep enthusiasm filled him for this son who was not only courageous and truthful , but who , in spite of his unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! But no , it was not possible ! How could his son have thought that he could accuse his boy of what he had done himself ? And upon this doubt , he found himself with a quickened pulse at the door of the jail . Farnsworth rang the bell . Soon they stood in Mrs. Calkins 's sitting-room , facing Jim and Nancy . And then Miss Ware caught Farnsworth by the arm and drew him quickly into the hall , and shut the door behind her . " I 'm certain ! " she whispered , breathlessly . " When I told Jim first , he was n't glad at all , until I managed to let him know his father was n't arrested . O Fred , that boy 's a little trump ! " Meanwhile , in Mrs. Calkins 's sitting-room , father and son faced each other , and it would be hard to say which of the two was the more embarrassed . But certain questions burned on Mr. Edwards 's lips . " Jim , " he said , with anxious emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , sir , " said Jim . " But why , my boy , why should I want to shoot him ? " " Lamoury had been telling , " said Jim , highly embarrassed . " Telling ? " said his father , in perplexity . " Yes , sir , " said Jim , " you know -- about your being a -- a smuggler . " Much astonished , Mr. Edwards pushed his questions , and soon came to know the depth and breadth of his boy 's misconception . " Then , " he said finally , " when I accused you of having fired the shot , you thought I had to do so to avoid an arrest which would be serious for me . Is that it ? " " Yes , sir . " Mr. Edwards could not speak for a moment for emotion . Then he drew the boy to him . " My son , my son , " he said , " you and I must know each other better . " And by the same token , Jim realized that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was new and sweet . He felt a little foolish , but very happy . " Jim , " his father said huskily , " would you like a new breech-loader ? " And then Jim was happier still . * * * * * Those were reluctant feet which dragged Mr. Peaslee the next morning to the jury-room . The counsel of the night had brought no comfort , and when he came among his fellows their constraint and silence were far from reassuring . Nor , when the sitting had begun , did he like the enigmatic smile with which the well-dressed Paige stood and swung his watch-chain . How he distrusted and feared this smug , self-complacent young man ! Yet the state 's attorney 's first words brought him unexpected comfort . " Mr. Lamoury , " he said , still with that puzzling smile , " has consented , in spite of his serious physical condition , to appear before you . " Lamoury could not be so badly hurt if he could come to the court house ! But what was this ? While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnly pushed into the room a great wheeled chair , in which sat the small , wiry , furtive-eyed Lamoury . Mr. Peaslee 's heart sank as he saw the wheeled chair , and noted the great bandages about the Frenchman 's head and arm . He listened apprehensively to the loud complaint of cruelty to his client which Hibbard continued to make , until Paige , pulling the chair into the room , blandly shut the door in his face . Mr. Peaslee heaved a great sigh of mingled contrition and fear . This wreck was his work ; he would be punished for it . " Mr. Lamoury , " Paige began courteously , " we so wished to get your version of this painful affair that , though we are sorry to cause you any discomfort , we have felt obliged to bring you here . Will you kindly tell the gentlemen of the grand jury what happened ? " " Yes , seh , me , Ah 'll tol ' heem ! " said Lamoury , eagerly . Confident that no one knew anything about what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his narrative striking . " Yes , seh , Ah 'll tol ' de trut ' . Well , seh , Ah 'll be goin ' t'rough M'sieu ' Edwards 's horchard -- walkin ' t'rough same as any mans . Den I look , han ' I see dat leetly boy in de windy , a-shoutin ' and a-cussin ' lak he gone crazee in hees head . Ah tol ' you Ah feel bad for hear dat leetly boy cussin ' . Dat was too shame . " And Lamoury paused to let this beautiful sentiment impress itself upon the jurors . Mr. Peaslee listened with profound astonishment . " Den he holler somet'ing Ah ai n't hear , honly ' Canuck , ' han ' Ah begins for get my mads up . Ah hai n't do heem no harm , hein ? Den he fire hees gun ,  - -  poom ! an ' more as twenty -- prob'ly ten shot-buck heet me on the head of it ! " Buckshot ! " Them 's the marble , " thought Mr. Peaslee , " but there was n't but one ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah t'ink me , dat weeked leetly boy goin ' for shoot more as once prob'ly -- mebbe two , t'ree tam . Ah drop queek in de grass , an ' Ah run -- run queek ! An ' when Ah get home , Ah find two , t'ree , five , mebbe four hole in mah arm more beeg as mah t'umb . " Pete stopped dramatically ; his little sparkling black eyes traveled quickly from one face to another to note the effect he had made . Mr. Peaslee 's spirits were rising ; the grand jury could not believe such a " passel of lies "  - -  only , only was one of those holes " beeg as mah t'umb " made , perchance , by a marble ? " That 's a mighty moving narrative , " commented Sampson , dryly . " Did I understand you to say that you were hit in the head or the arm ? " " Bose of it , " averred Pete , without winking . " I did n't shoot any bag of marbles , " whispered Mr. Peaslee to his neighbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remark to any one shows how his spirits were rising . " You said you were going along the short cut through Mr. Edwards 's orchard , did n't you ? " the state 's attorney now asked . " Yes , seh , " said Pete . Paige stepped to a big blackboard , which he had had set up at the end of the room , and rapidly sketched a plan of the Edwards ' lot , with the aid of a memorandum of measurements which he had secured . A line across the upper left-hand corner represented the path commonly used by the neighbors in going through the Edwards 's orchard . " Now , Mr. Lamoury , " resumed Paige , " I do n't quite understand how , if you were on the path there , you could have seen young Edwards , or he you . The barn seems to be in the way until just at the right-hand end , and when you get to that , you 'd have to look through about ten rows of apple-trees . Now were n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exclaimed Pete , ingenuously . " Ah 'll was got for be , since Ah was shoot , ai n't it ? Ah 'll ca n't remembler . " " Mr. Edwards told us , " continued Paige , while Solomon 's heart warmed to him , " that he saw you fall out of some bushes . Now these are the only bushes there are , " and he rapidly indicated on the board the rows of currant bushes , the asparagus , the sunflowers , and the lilacs which lined the garden on its right-hand corner . " That 's a good way from the path . " " Ah 'll be there , me ! " cried Pete , in indignant alarm . " No , seh ! M'sieu ' Edwards say dat ? Respectable mans lak M'sieu ' Edwards ! It was shame for lie so . No , seh ! Ah go home t'rough de horchard . Mebbe Ah 'll go leetly ways off de path of it ,  - -  mebbe for peek up apple off'n de groun ' what no one ai n't want for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I ai n't go for hide in de bush ! Ah 'll be honest mans , me . Ah 'll go for walk where all mans can see , ai n't it ? What Ah 'll go hide for , me ? " Paige drew a square on Mr. Peaslee 's side of the fence , directly opposite the bushes . " That , " said he , " is Mr. Peaslee 's hen-house , " and he brushed the chalk from his fingers with an air of indifference . " So-o ? " cried Pete , with an air of pleased surprise . " M'sieu ' Peaslee he 'll got hen-rouse ? First tam Ah 'll was heard of it , me . Fine t'ing for have hen-rouse , fine t'ing for M'sieu ' Peaslee . Ah 'll t'ink heem for be lucky , M'sieu ' Peaslee . But Ah 'll ai n't know it . Ah 'll ai n't see nossin ' of it , no , seh ! " and Pete smiled innocently round at the enigmatic faces of the jurymen . " Mr. Lamoury , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind those bushes is a broken board . " " So-o ? " said Pete . " Any one who was there had an excellent chance to study the fastenings of Mr. Peaslee 's hen-house door . " " Mais , Ah 'll was tol ' you Ah 'll not be dere , me ! " cried Pete , alarmed and excited . " That , " said Mr. Paige , calmly , " is the only place where you could be and get shot from the boy 's window . Either you were there or you were n't shot . Besides , Mr. Edwards found your foot-prints . " Pete shrunk his head into his shoulders and glared questioningly at the state 's attorney . The examination was not going to his liking . " What Ah 'll care for dat ? " he said at last . " Oh , nothing , " said Paige , " nothing at all . Let us talk of something else . Let me ask why Mr. Edwards discharged you from his employ last spring ? " " Nossing ! Nossing ! Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If he treated you as unjustly as that , " said Paige , with sympathy , " you can not have a very high opinion of Mr. Edwards . " " Ah 'll tol ' you he was bad mans . He 'll discharge me more as seexty mile off . Ah 'll have for walk , me . Ah 'll tol ' you dat was mean treek for play on poor mans . " And Pete sought sympathy from the faces about him . " That was too bad , certainly , " said Paige . " Now about those wounds of yours . I have Doctor Brigham here , ready to make an examination . I 'll call him now , " and the state 's attorney started toward the door of the witness-room . Pete jumped . " Hein ! " he exclaimed . " You do n't object to having an excellent doctor like Doctor Brigham look at your wounds , do you ? " asked Paige . Now Lamoury had no wounds to show . The smiling , well-dressed Paige , standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he could bear . Pete suddenly lost his temper , never too secure . Out of his wheeled chair he jumped , and shaking his fist in Paige 's face , he shouted :  --  " T'ink you be smart , very smart mans ! Well , Ah 'll tol ' you you ai n't . Ah 'll tol ' you you be a great beeg peeg ! Ah 'll tol ' you dat Edwards boy , he shoot at me . I see heem . ' T ai n't my fault of it if he not hit me , hein ? You be peeg ! You be all peegs -- every one ! " and Pete , making a wide , inclusive gesture , shouted , " I care not more as one cent for de whole keet and caboodle of it ! Peeg , peeg , peeg ! " And turning on his heel , the wrathful Frenchman left the room . He left also a convulsed jury and a wheeled chair , for the hire of which Hibbard found himself later obliged to pay . Mr. Peaslee , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laughter which followed the exit of the discomfited Pete . " Terrible smart feller , Paige , ai n't he ? " said he to Albion Small . " Did him up real slick , did n't he ? " The delighted Solomon had quite forgotten his dislike for the citified Paige . Of course the grand jury promptly abandoned the inquiry . The fact was now obvious that the vengeful Lamoury , aided by the unscrupulous Hibbard , had merely hoped to be bought off by Mr. Edwards , and had been disappointed . " The case , " said Paige , " would never have come to trial . If Edwards had persisted , and let his boy go to court , they 'd have had to stop . They must have been a good deal disappointed when he refused bail ; they probably thought he 'd never let the boy pass a night in Hotel Calkins. " * * * * * Mr. Peaslee walked home sobered but relieved . The loss of public esteem which had come to him through his foolish adventure , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disgust of his wife were all things to chasten a man 's spirit ; but on the other hand , Jim was now out of jail , Lamoury had not been hurt in the least , and he himself had not been complained of or arrested . If he should have to endure some chaffing from Jim Bartlett and Si Spooner , his cronies at the bank , he " guessed he could stand it . " On the whole , he was moderately happy . The sun was low in the west , and the trees were casting long shadows across his yard , brightly spattered with the red and yellow of autumnal leaves . His house , white and neat and comfortable , seemed basking like some still , somnolent animal in the warm sunshine . Solomon turned , and cast his eye down the road and over the Random River , flowing smooth and peaceful through its great ox-bow . He recognized Dannie Snow , scuffling through the dust with his bare feet , as he drove home his father 's great , placid , full-uddered cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the place among the close-coming hills , struck him , in his relieved mood , as it had never done before . Even though disappointed in political ambition , a man might live there in some content . After all , he had thirty thousand dollars , and it had been calmly drawing interest through all his tribulations . Consoled by this reflection , he walked to the rear of his house and began pottering about the chicken yard . Then in the Edwards garden appeared Jim . Solomon gave a slight start , and took a hesitating step or two , as if minded to flee , but restrained by shame . He watched the boy come to the fence , and climb upon it . He said nothing ; he could not think of anything to say . " That harmonica was fine ! " said Jim , grinning amiably . Mr. Peaslee was immensely relieved . If there was a momentary twinge at the thought of the money it had cost him , it was quickly gone . " Glad ye enjoyed it . Seem ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  considerin ' . I hope you and your father ai n't ones to lay it up agin me . " " That 's all right , " said Jim , grandly . " I had a bully time at the jail . Mrs. Calkins is a splendid woman . You just ought to eat one of her doughnuts ! " " Did n't know they fed ye up much to the jail , " commented Solomon , puzzled . " Oh , I was n't locked up , " said Jim , and explained . " Well , well , I 'm beat ! That was clever on ' em , wa' n't it now ? " said Mr. Peaslee , much pleased . " And father ai n't holding any grudge , either , " said Jim . " He says he 's much obliged to you "  - -  a remark which the reader will understand better than Mr. Peaslee ever did . " You listen when you 're eating your supper ! " cried Jim , as he climbed down from the fence and ran toward the house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Solomon rejoiced . Poor man , he did not know how the popularity of his gift was destined to endure ; he did not know that he had let loose upon the circumambient air sounds worse than any ever emitted by the Calico Cat . Filled with the pleasant sense of having " made it up " with the boy whom he thought he had so greatly injured , Solomon started along the path toward the kitchen door . He began to realize that he had an appetite -- something now long unfamiliar to him . As he drew near , an appetizing odor smote his nostrils . " Eyesters , I swanny ! " he ejaculated . It was unheard of ! There was nothing which Solomon , who had a keen relish for good things to eat , and would even have been extravagant in this one particular had his firm-willed wife permitted , enjoyed more than an oyster stew , or which he had a chance to taste less often . Oysters could be had in town for sixty cents a quart , a sum that seems not large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the elegance and luxury of church " sociables , " and with the dissipation of supper after country dances . They were extravagant food . Solomon could not believe his nose . He entered the door , and there upon the table stood the big tureen , with two soup plates at Mrs. Peaslee 's place . There was nothing else but the stew , of course , but it lent a gala air to the whole kitchen . " Why , Sarepty , Sarepty ! " he said to his wife . " You goin ' to be arrested ? " asked Mrs. Peaslee , sharply . She wanted no sentiment over her unwonted generosity ; but , truth to tell , when she had seen Solomon depart that morning , and realized that he might be going to arrest , possibly to trial , perhaps to conviction and to jail , she had felt a sudden fright , a sudden sympathy for her husband , and she had bought half a pint of oysters for a stew -- in spite of expense . " No , I ai n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The grand jury found there wa' n't anythin ' to it ; but -- but , Sarepty --  " He paused helplessly , unable to express his complex feelings about the stew , and the attitude on the part of his wife which it revealed . " Oh , well , " said his wife , " after all , ' t ai n't ' s if you 'd gone and lost money . " And after supper Mr. Peaslee carefully poured some skimmed milk into a saucer and went out to the barn . " Kitty , kitty ! " he called . " Kitty , come , kitty ! " The Calico Cat did not respond . But in the morning the saucer was empty .
