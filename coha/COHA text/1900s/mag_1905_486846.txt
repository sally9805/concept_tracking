SIR . G. H. Warner , In this ' Jewish Spectre , ' repeats the fancy of former anti-Jewish writers , that Jesus of Nazareth was not a Jew of Judea , but a Galilean ; only thus could he possess the idealism foreign to the true Jew . Among the ten million Sews of our day about nine-twentieths belong to the German and Polish ritual , hardly one-twentieth to the Spanish and Italian ritual . The pronunciation of Hebrew followed by the former points them out unmistakably as descendants of the Galilean , while the latter are the true Judeans , to judge by the same token . Thus , if ' the high idealism of ' the Nazarene , shown in his actions and teachings , sheds honor on his special kinsmen , the Gahleans and their descendants , at enures to the benefit of the vast majority of present-day Jews . Yours truly , L. N. D. Louisynaa , October 11 , 1905 . SWISS RAILWAY TICKETS . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Your correspondent in the Nation of October 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of railway ticket called " abonnement general , " issued by the Swiss railways , but the information that he gives is incorrect in almost every detail . These tickets are issued for first , second or third class , and not only for a month , but for two weeks , three months or a year . The third-class ticket for one month costs forty francs , not seventy-five , which is the price of a second-class ticket for the same period . For a fortnight the rate is slightly higher than one-half ' of the rate for a month The holder may , indeed , travel all day and all night , not only on the trains , but also on the lake steamers ; but the tickets are not good on all the roads in Switzerland  --  those from Visp to Zermatt and from Interlaken to Gruidelwald , for instance , as well as most of the mountain roads , being excepted . The only red tape to be gone through in procuring the ticket is that the user must furnish a photograph of himself , of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purposes of identification . These tickets can be had at any station in Switzerland , also at the agency of the Swiss railways in Milan ; at the stations in large cities they are delivered at once ; in small places , notice of twenty-four hours is required . The convenience of this- ararngemeat is very great , to say nothing of the economy . Cook 's agents would probably profess dense ignorance of the whole matter , but the traveller who is no linguist will find that a great many of the railway officials in Switzerland speak English and are reasonably courteous . Similar tickets are issued for Belgium , for Italy ( divided for this purpose into zones ) , and for narts of France Most travellers will find them more useful then the old-fashioned " circular tour .

The thinness of the volume will encourage him to peruse it to the end . Richard Hildreth 's ' Japan as It Was and Is , ' though written in 1801 , has no superior as a summary of European relations with Japan up to the Perry era . It has been neatly reprinted in clear type in Tokio ( Sanshusha ) , even to lithographic reproduction of map and title-page , and edited by K. Murakawa , who has supplemented the original footnotes and enlarged and improved the index . Hildreth 's appendices are retained . The especial value of this ( second ) edition is that , after every Japanese word or name , in text and index ( except where the editor has been unable to make identification because of uncouth spelling ) , the Chinese characters or Japanese loom are added This is calculated to give much pleasure , not only to the Japanese , but to all who enjoy the illuminating Chinese picture-characters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not . It is good news to hear that Prof. E W. Clement is about to issue a revised edition of Hildreth 's work , of which Americans may be proud , with a continuation , on the same general principles of historical treatment , to the present time . Archibald Little , the explorer of inland China and author of ' Through the Yang-tse Gorges , ' has issued through the Clarendon Press , Oxford ( New York . Henry Frowde ) , ? ' The Far East , ' which is a geographic and physiographic description of what was once the Chinese world , including Japan . Though not a geographer or geologist by profession , Mr. Little has been worthily associated with the distinguished writers of the Geographical Series , of which this book is one . His ? long and intimate personal acquaintance with very much of the area of the countries described makes full amends for any lack of expert knowledge . Although old residents in the countries which were once Chinese in culture , but are now so only traditionally , may discern here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaring errors if set forth in historical monographs , yet these are not of the sort which affect the author 's conclusions or the general accuracy of his description , for he has ever an eye to the great underlying bases and to the visible features of the landscape The numerous maps , sketches , and diagrams show him to be a man thoroughly familiar with China 's drainage basins , river routes , watercourses , and coast contours Consequently , one who reads this book gains quickly and thoroughly a general idea of the country 's possibilities for commerce and human advancement Of the seventeen chapters , nine are very properly devoted to the three great divisions or river-valleys of China proper  --  that is , the northern and middle basins and the intermediate provinces The dependencies are then treated , Mantchuria , Mongolia , Turkestan , and Tibet , and those formerly under Chinese rule , Indo-China and Korea , Siam being the buffer kingdom and Japan the Island Empire . With a full index , this is a first-class work of reference . A little revision , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province as is Mr Little with all China , would have made this work almost perfect ' The Diary of a Girl in France in 1821 ' ( E. P. Dutton &; Co ) was written by one Mary Browne , a young north-country girl , who , with her parents and five brothers and sisters , spent rather less than four ! months of one summer in the neighborhood of Paris about the time of Napoleon 's death . Mary Browne wall no Marie Bashkirtseff . Her diary is written in the immature style of a girl of fourteen , gifted with no more than the average intelligence . What rqakes the book amusing is its frank insularity Little Miss Browne lived long ' before it - came to be good form in England to appreciate , or at least tolerate , foreign clothes and rnsimers She would have thought at unpatriotic to admire anything essentially French , and she found everything that the family encountered destestable , from the looks of the women to the bread and butter . The Brownes took a house at Versailles , and the daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively a , nd most unflattering description . At last their father , Who had left Cumberland in search of a warmer climate , decided that even the . weather in France was a fraud , and the Brownes turned their backs on French ignorance , dirt , and bad manners . They had suffered such misery on the crossing from Dover that , in returning , they arranged to charter a whole ship , and sailed from Dieppe . The account of both these passages should be read by those who nowadays complain of the discomforts of a Channel crossing . The diary is copiously illustrated with the writer 's original drawings , done with great spirit and an absolute lack of technique . The volume is beautifully got up We have no word in English to describe a literary type which is not uncommon and is usually wrongly labelled This is the semi-dramatic dialogue that aims at a sort of photography , at reproducing the scenes and dialogue of every-day life , without any devices of intrigue , development of character , or denouement , The Greeks called this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature is the famous Fifteenth Idyl of Theocritus , which reproduces the chatter of two Sicilian women who go to see the festival of Adonis in Alexandria . Just such a mime is Miss Mar ' guerite Merington 's ' Cranford ' ( Fox , Duffield &; Co ) , misnamed a " play , " and arranged in three acts as a " comedy " Sophron , however , the Sicilian writer of mimes , whom Theocritus , and even Plato , imitated , would have recognized in this adaptation of Mrs. Gaskell 's novel three mimes really disconnected , wholly undramatic ; not in the least suited to the ordinary stage He would have called the first " act , " " Women drinking tea in a small country town " ; the second he would have written rather differently , so as to make either the conjuror 's illness , or Lady Glenmire 's inesalliance , or the loss of Miss 1Matty 's fortune , the central interest , Instead of jumbling them all together , as Miss Merington has done ; the third " act " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and omitted the irrelevant brother . ' Cranford , ' the novel , is , in fact , a perfect storehouse of " mimes " of provincial women , their manners and affectations and petty social prejudices ; but to carve a three-act comedy out of it is a tour de force which merely exposes its essentially undramatic qualities . We commend the present attempt to the dramatic societies of women 's colleges , and we hope that when they perform it they will label it " ' Cranford , ' a Mime . " There is some information on a great many subjects m G Wooiliscroft Rhead 's ' Principles of Design ' ( London : B T. Bats-ford , New York : Scribners ) , but most of it is so summary as to be of little use , and not all of it is correct , while only about sixteen pages answer at all strictly to the title Its only conceivable purpose is that which the author rather disclaims , to afford a crib-book for candidates for English Boar , d of Education examinations The two latest volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newnes , in London , and imported by the Scribners , are devoted to the drawings of Rossetti and Poynter In taking up modern work , after Durer and Holbein , there must necessarily be a lowering of tone , but this is particularly noticeable when the modern work is English . Leighton is almost the only Englishman who really drew . Rossetti 's amateurishness is painfully evident in the present collection , but , after all , there is more life and beauty in his often feeble work than in the mediocre professionalism of Poynter The latter artist 's work , while relatively correct , is singularly uninspiring , and among the forty-eight drawings by him here reproduced there is only one that is capable of giving a sensitive eye any real pleasure . It would add very much to the usefulness and intelligibility of these volumes if the publishers would put the drawings in something like chronological order . In the Rossetti volume the mixing up of drawings of all periods and widely differing styles is very confusing . In our copy the confusion is aggravated by the omission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In neither of these volumes is the text of any importance Its appearance is probably a concession to the notion that a book should contain some reading matter ' A Descriptive Handbook of Architecture , ' by Martin A Buckmaster , A.R.0 A , who is " Art Master " at Tonbridge School and is also an examiner in several public positions in England ( London : Routledge , New York : Dutton ) , contains 180 pages , very largely taken up with cuts of different kinds , and with tables of dates and names As is natural in such a case , nearly half the book as devoted to the architecture of England . The five English chapters come in the middle of the book , after the very brief treatment of Classic Architecture ? Greek and Roman building viewed comparatively . What follows still is limited to a chapter on French Gotiiic , and a final chapter on the Renaissance , in which , again , England , the country in which the Renaissance is less easily traceable than in any land that it reached at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively from English sources . It is , of course , a grave question how far such a book can be of use to students . Perhaps ? the title might be changed to something like this : ' English Architecture , with some Allusion to its Affiliations ' Then it might be hoped that the reader would understand that his attention was to be concentrated on chapters v to x. inclusive , and that he need not look further except for some suggestions . Even in the English chapters , however , there is an-unfortunate tendency to insist upon names and dates , to the nearly complete exclusion of guiding principles by which systems of design may be discriminated . This would almost seem , in its innocent inutility , to be a very old volume reshaped with new pictures , including perhaps fifty half-tones of considerable value . The new volume of the Langham Series of Art Monographs ( Scribners ) deals with ' Italian Architecture . ' It professes to be a " brief account of the principles and progress " of that art , and is illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows , and a dozen illustrations from rough ' but expressive drawings Six chapters treat of the Architecture of Rome , the Basilicas , and the Byzantine , Lombard Romanesque , " Gothic Romanesque , " and Renaissance styles Now when such a problem is set as this , of treating a vast subject in the length of two magazine articles , the need is felt of some special method of treatment ; but the thought wanders about through history , social philosophy , principles of construction and theories of design in a way that might lead to clear results with five times the space at the author 's disposal , whereas in 20,000 words the thought could be made intelligible only by great com- pactness and severity of phrasing The adaptation of a round cupola to a square space which it must roof is called ( p. 32 ) squaring the circle . The Basilican style is assumed to depend upon and to embody the newly introduced springing of the round arches directly from the capitals ( p 21 ff. ) , although the Christian basilicas which are most highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lombard vaulting ( p 55 ) involves a misconception , and throughout the book there is a searching for poetical analogies where there is really not room enough for the presentation of essential facts On the whole , we find this book less to the purpose than most of the other volumes of the series . We have from time to time brought to the notice of our readers the remarkable discoveries of structural refinements in medieval buildings made by Prof. William H Goodyear , curator of fine arts in the Brooklyn Museum . The long unsuspected optical refinements of classic buildings have their parallel in the far more obvious , but still longer unobserved or uninterpreted , irregularities of the works of subsequent ages . Thirty-five years ago . Professor Goodyear commenced the study of these puzzling phenomena , and has for the last ten years pursued it with singular vigor and success . That he has won his case in favor of the existence of WI-cal and other refinements in many buildings and in a great variety of forms , no unprejudiced person who has taken the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found to deny . The study of ancient buildings which Professor Goodyear has carried on from Constantinople , through Greece . Sicily , and Italy to France , has resulted in the making of surveys and of great numbers of photographs , which , presented in the form of enlargements , constitute a collection of the highest interest . Ordinarily to be seen at the Brooklyn Museum , this collection ( or at least the better part of it ) has been taken to Edinburgh , where , under the auspices of the Edinburgh Architectural Association , it is now being publicly shown . The exhibition is arousing the lively interest of architects and archmologists , and so distinguished an authority on medieval architecture as Mr. Edward S. Prior is about to write a complete account of it for the Architectural Review For the exhibition , Professor Goodyear has prepared an admirable catalogue raisonae of over two hundred pages , illustrated with many reproductions of the plans and photographs , and summing up the results of his many years of labor in a most convincing fashion . Those who remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to bestow upon even the slightest of his publications , will regret that certain of his rough drafts of orchids , which he doubtless intended to elaborate , have been permitted to see the light in the ' form given to them in ' Our Native Orchids ' ( Doubleday , Page &; Co ) . The title-page states that the descriptive text " has been elaborated from the author 's notes , " but even the hastiest perusal indicates that the work of elaboration has not been upon lines which Mr Gibson would have approved Certainly , Mr. Gibson could never have adopted the nomenclature here given . Careful reading of the text and critical examination of the pictures will convince one that this posthumous publication is decidedly a mistake , unworthy of the artist and author whose name it is made to bear . ' Carnations , Picotees , and the Wild and Garden Pinks , ' written by several authorities and edited by E. T. Cook ( London ? Offices of Country Life ) , falls into the comfortably long list of special treatises In horticulture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pansies ' It is to be hoped that the plain , practical directions for cultivation will lead many amateurs to brighten their homes with these old-fashioned flowers The silly custom of bestowing on certain varieties of cultivated plants the names of living persons sometimes leads to amusing results , as shown in the following extract from this volume , ( it is better to abbreviate the proper names ) . " Mrs. T. W. L has improved rather than otherwise with those who grow carnations . Ethel C. , . . . from newly imported stock , did not come good at first . . . . Royalty appears to be identical with the above . " Carnations and picotees differ mainly in the color of the flowers , the latter being variously dotted . Copious quotations from Dante , in the original and in translation , sketches of Italian travel , accompanied by historical reminiscence and anecdote , if combined by a man of literary taste , may make a book attractive to the many readers who are always glad to be reminded of Italy  --  all the more attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photogravures . Such a compound is ' Dante the Wayfarer , ' by Christopher Hare ( Charles Scribner 's Sons ) , a handsome , portly volume , full of pleasing views of scenery and buildings , and consisting , in large measure , of extracts from the " Wayfarer " himself . The author is evidently not a profound Dante scholar , but he has read his poet assiduously , and shows unusual skill in selecting passages appropriate to the places described . Such chapters as contain a considerable proportion of Mr. Hare 's own composition ? " Travelin the Middle Ages , " for instance  --  are interestingly written . In a small and compact volume of about two hundred pages Dr. George B , Hussey has produced a ' Handbook of Latin Homonyms ' ( Boston : Sanborn &; Co ) . He has done pioneer 's work , for this is the first systematic treatment of the subject for Latin , and indeed it is one which has been little investigated , except for the French language . The lists in this book are made up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sallust , Virgil , Horace , Terence , Tacitus , and the orations of ' Cicero , together with what remains of the first twenty-two books of Livy Much care has obviously been devoted to its preparation , and it will be found to be of considerable service in settling the puzzling questions of identity which often arise in the richly inflected Latin . Good Americans , to whom the morning meal is ( or should be ) the pleasantest of the day , will find decidedly helpful to that end Olive Green 's ' What to Have for Breakfast ' ( Putnams ) It is the first of this firm 's projected " Home-Maker Series , " and augurs well for its five successors . Author and publisher profess ignorance of any other work on this momentous theme , and we join ours to theirs . There is some light introductory gossip about the ration- . ale of breakfast as a light or a hearty meal , the digestibility of certain foods , and the like , followed by directions how to set the table ; next come the receipts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by day . The little book is very pretty . The place which the public library has taken in our educational system is well indicated in the fifty-third annual report of the Boston Public Library . Of its 201 agencies , delivery stations and places of deposit , 103 are public and parochial schools . Instruction in the use of the Library was given during the year to twenty-one classes from eleven schools , and a comprehensive finding-list of books for boys and girls , the preparation of which has extended over several years , has been published The usefulness of the Library to the general public has been greatly increased by the placing of nearly 200,000 volumes ( including selections from the weekly accessions ) permanently on open shelves , available for use by any visitor without formality . Its cosmopolitan character is shown by the fact that 23,847 books in thirty-four different foreign languages were taken out for home reading . Out of a total of 597 works of English prose fiction received for examination by the volunteer fiction committee , 129 were accepted . Among the noteworthy additions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscript collection of the late Charles W Folsom , formerly the literary director of the University Press at Cambridge , Mass , and consequently in correspondence with many distinguished writers , such as Bryant . Longfellow , Holmes , Sumner , and Ticknor , the issue of whose publications was under his charge . A history of . the Library , giving a complete account of its origin and development during the fifty years of its existence , is about to be'published . ? The first volume of the ' History of the Collections contained in the Natural History Departments of the British Museum ' describes the departments of Botany , Geology , and Mineralogy , as well as the Libraries ; a second volume will describe the department of Zoology The collections of Sir Hans Sloane , which the Parliament purchased 331 1753 , consisted of " coins , ancient and modern antiquities , seals , cameos and intaglios , precious stones , agateS , Jaspers , vessels of agate and Jasper , crystals , mathematical instruments , paintings , and other things . " Among the " other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of natural history specimens , which formed the nucleus of what is now the richest and most important natural-history museum in the world . Soon after the erection of the large circular reading-room in 1857 it became evident that Montague House could not long suffice for the constantly increasing collections , and in 1860 a resolution was carried at a meeting of the Trustees to the effect that it was " expedient that the Natural History Collections should be removed from the British Museum " In 1863 , the House of Commons sanctioned the purchase of a site , but it was not until 1873 that the work of erecting a bulding began , and not until 1880 that this was turnedover to the Trustees The removal of the collections was commenced at once , and in 1881 the new Museum in Cromwell Road was opened to the public The volume before , us is essentially a history of the collections , and describes their growth and development . The description of each department opens with a summary sketch , whereupon follows a chronological account enumerating the principal accessions , lastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all countries . Each name is followed by a statement of the respective contributions . ? While the bulk of Sir Hans Sloane 's library went to make up the Library proper of the British Museum , three works accompanied the natural-history collections , namely , his manuscript catalogue of them , a copy of his own ' Voyage to the Islands Madera , Barbados , and Jamaica , ' annotated by himself , with the original drawings of plants from which the accompanying plates were made , and a copy of Ray 's ' Historia Plantarum ' Later on , some other volumes belonging to the Sloane collection were turned over to the Department library Other works were added from time to time , especially manuscripts and drawings , but it was not until 1842 that books were purchased systematically for the Natural History Libraries At present the library contains considerably over 100,000 volumes The Botanical department was . created in 1827 , when Sir Joseph Banks 's herbarium , which he had bequeathed to his librarian , Robert Brown , was transferred to the British Museum To this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown , who was the first Keeper of the department , his herbarium came into the possession of his successor in office , J.

The collection of Australian plants then became the property of the Museum The department of Geology ' includes Palaeontology as well , and among the most important accessions of fossils we might mention James Sowerhy 's collection , containing most of the original British fossils described in his ' Mineral Conchology ' ; it was acquired in 1860 . Very few large collections of minerals have been purchased by the Trustee 's , an account of the great chances of duplication . ? The severest of all touchstones of mathematical skill is universally acknowledged to be the working out of an exact numerical account of the way our satellite performs its intricate motions  --  the " theory " of the moon , as the mathematicians still call it , after Ptolemy . Well , inquire , say in Berlin , or in Pulkowa , or Paramatta , or Tacubaya , or in any corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our time has shown the most surpassing mastery of the theoryof the moon , and the answer of any competent authority will come unhesitatingly , " It is Mr. G. W. Hill of Nyack Falls , N. Y " Had that village been aware of its renown , it might not have changed its name , alluring as the melody of " West Nyack " no doubt is But Mr Hill is the reverse of the kind of man to whom the Sunday Herald devotes a page , and it is probable that the villagers know him only as the genial but retiring gentleman who so loves the paternal farm on which he was born and where he still lives The next most rebarbative problem of celestial mechanics , after the moon 's , is perhaps the theory of Jupiter and Saturn ( which have to be treated together ) , and in this Mr. Hill has outdone - all other astronomers But this is as nothing to his achievements in the theory of the moon For here the method he pursued launched him on an unknown sea , requiring an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here , by means of the staggering conception of an infinite determinant , he succeeded in the hardy enterprise of virtually solving a differential equation of an infinite order . The boldness of the undertaking consisted in this that Hill introduced into mathematics a kind of reasoning unrecognized by the mathematicians ( albeit they had often unconsciously employed it ) , namely , the experimental reasoning of physics . For , an infinite determinant being a complete novelty , it was as yet unknown whether the particular type of such a complex series required for Hill 's method of solution was convergent or not , or , if it were , whether it possessed the particular kind of convergency that would adapt it to the operations of the calculus Hill accordingly treated its satisfying this requirement as he would have treated a physical hypothesis , and proceeded to put it to the test of experiment , by calculating , on that theory , the irate of revolution of the axis of the moon 's elliptical orbit , which , of all the elements of the solar system , is observationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erroneous assumption about the perturbations He relied upon the knowledge that if his mathematics were wrong , there was every reason to expect that his calculated motion of the perigee would be sensi bly  --  would be enormously  --  at variance with observation . It turned out , however , to agree with observation as closely as the results of observation were known . Yet it must be confessed that it is not as clear as the noonday sun that Mr Hill himself , any more than previous mathematicians , perceived that he was applying Baconian reasoning to mathematics . In any case the brilliant demonstration of Poincare was needed to enable future astronomers to apply Hill 's method with entire confidence to all problems of three bodies . Neverthe-less , when we consider that it would , after all , only be to physical questions that such complicated differential equations would ever be applied , Hill 's procedure is seen to be of a piece with all the other reasoning that would go along with it , and therefore logically to be beyond criticism . ? By such means our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hours , while vastly increasing their exactitude . Mr Hill 's work upon the Moon , originally published over twenty years ago , has since been perfected in some parts and improved in others by an Englishman , Brown . Still , excellent as Brown 's work is said to be , the chief merit of the new method confessedly belongs to our neighbor across the river , eighteen miles above High Bridge . Therefore , with a stately quarto , Volume I of ' The Collected Mathematical Works of George William Hill , ' published by the Carnegie Institution , there came to us a visitor too infrequent of late years  --  we mean the oldtime glow of exultant American feeling . The volume is prefaced with a long and most interesting account of Mr Hill and his work from the pen ( on the whole the most competent and suitable that could have been selected ) of M. Henri Poincare . It is in French , of course ; and we find M. Poincare writing college with an acute accent , a practice which is redolent of Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Dr. Poincare . The volume falls but little short of being a handsome ' one , paper and type are good There is a pretty good portrait of the man ; but in the pose of the head , though it is not foreign to Mr. Hill , we see more of the photographer than of his subject .
