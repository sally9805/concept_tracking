IT is generally believed that America has no folk-music , nothing distinctively native out of which a national school of advanced composition may arise . The commercial spirit of the age , and our conventional mode of existence , have so far effaced original types of character and romantic phases of life that the folk-song seems already a thing of the past . Dvorak and a few other composers have indeed made use of negro themes , and the aboriginal Indian music has been seriously treated more than once . But these compositions , however excellent , are no expression of American life and character ; they fall as strangely on our ears as any foreign product . But there is hidden among the mountains of Kentucky , Tennessee . and the Carolinas a people of whose inner nature and its musical expression almost nothing has been said . The music of the Southern mountaineer is not only peculiar , but , like himself , peculiarly American . Nearly all mountaineers are singers . Their untrained voices are of good timbre , the women 's being sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone and harmony remarkably true . The fiddler or the banjo-player is well treated and beloved among them , like the minstrel of feudal days . .. The mountain fiddler rarely cuddles his instrument under his chin ; he sets it against the middle of his chest , and grasping his bow near the middle , wields it with a jiggling movement quite unlike the long sweep of the accomplished violinist 's bow-arm . It is sometimes complained that their playing is too rapid and jerky ; but the tunes are composed for this tempo , and no other would be found suitable . Prominent among the elements of this music is that leading American characteristic , humor ; not the sparkling wit of the French , nor the broad , clumsy jollification of the Teuton ; not sarcasm nor irony , but the keen , wholesome , freakish American love of a laugh pervades directly or indirectly almost every line . The music , too , while usually minor , is not of a plaintive tendency ; - there are few laments , no sobbing and wailing . In this it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any martial throb or clang . It is reflective , meditative , with a vein of genial and sunny philosophy ; the tunes chuckle , not merrily , but in amused contemplation . The mountaineer is fond of turning the joke on himself . He makes fun of his own poverty , his own shiftlessness , his ignorance , his hard luck , and his crimes : wel-come wher - ev er I 'll tune up my fiddle and rosin my bow , And make myself welcome wherever I go . I 'll eat when I 'm hungry and drink when I 'm dry ; If a tree do n't fall on me , I 'll live till I die . I went up on the mountain and give my horn a blow ; Ev'ry gal in the valley come running to the do ' . As I went down to my old field , I heard a mighty maulin ' ; The seed-ticks was a-splittin ' rails ; the chiggers was a-hanlin ' . Once touched by religious emotions. , however , the mountaineer seems to lose his sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reached at last . The metaphors of Scripture , the natural expression of the Oriental mind , are taken with a literalness and seriousness against which one can not help thinking a touch of humor might be a saving grace . Hit 's the old Ship of Zion , as she comes , Hit 's the old Ship of Zion , as she comes , Hit 's the old Ship of Zion , the old Ship of Zion , Hit 's the old Ship of Zion , as she comes . She 'll be loaded with bright angels when she comes , etc . Oh , brothers , what will you do when she comes : etc . We will flee to the rocks and the mountains , etc . Repetition carried to the point of wearisomeness is a favorite form of revival hymns : Some have fathers up in glory , Some have fathers up in glory , Some have fathers up in glory , On the other shore . Some bright day we 'll go and see them , Some bright day we 'll go and see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , On the other bright shore . Andante . I be-lieve in be - ing rea - dy , .7s=dsI be-lieve in be-lieve in be - ing rea - dy , When this world 's at an end . Oh , just let me in the kingdom , Oh , just let me in the kingdom , Oh , just let me in the kingdom , When this world 's at en end . Here a feeling for the supernatural is uppermost . The oddly changing keys , the endings that leave the ear in expectation of something to follow , the quavers and falsettos , become in recurrence a haunting hint of the spirit world ; neither beneficent nor maleficent , neither devil nor angel , but something , ? something not to be understood , yet to be certainly apprehended . It is to the singer as , if he stood within a sorcerer 's circle , crowded upon by an invisible throng . BMW , MIGHTY LORD Rain , rain , mighty Say - - lour , Rain con - vett - ing pow F - er down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way the ho-ly ? proph-ets went , Rain , might- y Say- lour , The road that leads from Shout , shout , we 're gaining ground , hal le-hallelujah ; The power of God is a-comin ' down() glory hallelu ' . I do believe beyond a doubt , halle-hallelujah ; The Christian has a right to shout glory hallelu ' . It is their one emotional outlet . Having no theatre , no bull-fight , no arena , no sensational feature of any kind in their lives , they must , being a high-strung race , find vent some other way . They rock to and fro softly , crooning and moaning , until the impulse comes upon them to leap into the air and scream and shout until exhausted . It is common for women , and even men , to injure themselves unawares ; or , at . baptizings , to w pitch headlong into the water . I have seen convulsions and even temporary insanity brought on by these excesses . It is the music that produces this feeling ; but these songs can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushwood camp or half - lighted log church , and reenforced by the vibrant , frenzied voices of exhorters and the high strained singsong of the preacher who has reached what is known as his " weavin ' way . " I confess that the wild fascination of a mountain revival has a strange power over me ; the scene and the music draw me with a charm that I do not understand . Such a religion has naturally little to do with the moral law . I am far from wishing to imply that they regard no principles of right and wrong , or that their own code of morals is not rigidly ad- , . hered to by the majority . The popular idea in this connection is , I am well aware , one of mere lawlessness . But the world at large knows little of the mountain people except as some bloody feud or fight over a raided still finds its way into court . This is as if one judged society by the divorce columns and reports of fraud and embezzlement . It should be remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers . Who is there to speak of their hospitality , their independence , their fidelity to marriage bonds ? They are really of superior moral fibre for so primitive a race . But , like most primitive peoples , they are prone to hold brute courage the first of the virtues , and the hero of their ballad is too often the criminal . The bold robber stands to their minds as the buccaneers and marooners of the Spanish Main stood to seventeenth-century England . He is the Man Who Dared ? that is all ? and if justice overtakes him , their sympathies , of course , follow him all the more . Last night as I lay sleeping , 1 dreamt a pleasant dream ; I dreamt I 1% as down in Moscow , ' way down by Pearly stream ; The prettiest girl beside me , had come to go my bail ; I woke up , broken - hearted , in Knoxville County jail . In come my jailer , about nine o'clock , A bunch of keys was in his hand , my cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my prisoner , for I heard some voices say You 're bound to hear your sentence some time to-day . " In come my mother , about ten o'clock , Saying , Oh , my lovin ' Johnny , what sentence have you got ? " " The jury found me guilty , and the judge a-standin ' by Has sent me down to Knoxville to lock me up to die . " THE GAMBLING MAN I have played cards in England , I have played cards in Spain , I always played the high-low-jack , And never lost a game . My mammy used to talk to me Of things I had n't seen ; Said she , " My boy , you 'll be in the work-house Before you are sixteen . " I knew she was a-tall:in ' , But I thought she was in fun , But I had to wear the ball and chain Before I was twenty-one . I 'll play cards with a white man And play with him fair ; I 'll play the hat right off of his head , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambled away my pocketbook ; I 've gambled away my comb ; I 've gambled away all the money I had , And now I will go home . There are simple dance tunes , such as " Citieo , " " Shady Grove , " and " Muskrat , " to which a mere shuffling step is measured , the couples dancing in an " eight-handed set " : Romantic love as a motif is almost altogether absent throughout the mountaineer 's music . It is a subject of which he is very shy . His passion is not a thing to be proclaimed from the housetops . Once married , his affection is a beautiful thing , faithful to whatever end ; but he does not sing of it . The young men and maidens have , however , something that stands to them instead of love-songs ? almost , one suspects , instead of wooing . These are the " kissing games , " half dance , half romping child-play . They are next of kin to the old May-pole dance ? real playing at love , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many kisses are taken openly , in wholesome lightness of heart as part of the game . These are such games as the children of more civilized societies play ; but the mountain children rarely organize their frolics into games ; ? their sport is scarcely more elaborate than the romping of colts in a pasture , or the imitative pranks of monkeys . They are half-grown lads and girls who sing these songs , and tall bachelors are not in the least ashamed of joining in with whole-hearted abandon . Hit 's over the river to feed my sheep ; Hit 's over the river , Charley ; Hit 's over the river to feed my sheep And see my lonesome darling . You stole my partner , to my dislike , You stole my partner , to my dislike , You stole my partner , to my dislike , And also my dear darling . I 'll have her back before daylight , etc . The following is a game of marriage , with a ceremony of joining hands : All around this world so straight Go choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they dance in a ring around the happy pair : Kiss the bride and kiss her sweet ; Now you rise upon your feet . Another gives a picture of a burlesque paradise : Where coffee grows on white-oak trees , The river runs with brandy ; The buys are made of lumps of gold , And the girls are sweet as candy . " Weevily Wheat " is very old and very popular . It is more like a dance than a game : 0 law , mother , my toes are sore , Tra la Ia Ia la Is la Dancing on your sandy floor , Tra Ia is la la In la . Your weevily wheat is n't fit to eat , And neither is your barley ; I wo n't have none of your weevily wheat To make a cake for Charley . Charley he is a handsome lad , Charley is a dandy ; Charley he is the very one That sold his hat for brandy . Your weevily wheat is n't fit to eat , Nor neither is your barley ; We 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Charley . It is not improbable that the " Charley " of these songs is the Prince Charlie of Jacobite ballads . " Over the River , Charley , " may or may not be an echo of " Over the Waters to Charlie , " for a large proportion of the mountain people are descended from Scotch Highlanders who left their homes on account of the persecutions which harassed them during Prince Charlie 's time , and began life anew in the wilderness of the Alleghenies . The mountaineers sing many ballads of old England and Scotland . Their taste in music has no doubt been guided by these , which have come down from their ancestors . Indeed , so prone are they to cling to tradition that it is often difficult to distinguish these from their own modern compositions , especially as many have been recast , words , names of localities , and obsolete or unfamiliar phrases having been changed to fit their comprehension ? Chester town being substituted for ' London town , and the like . Here is one exactly as it was sung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child she had was three ; She sent them of to a Northern State , For to learn theirtheir gram - ar - ie. It was a lathe bright ; Each child she had was three ; She sent them off to a Northern State For to learn their gramarie . They had been gone but a little time Two months , perhaps , or three ? Till sickness spread all over the laud And swept her babes away . She prayed if there was a King in Heaven Who chose to wear a crown , That He would send them home that night Or in the morning soon . ' T was twelve long months , about . Christmas-tide , The night being cold and long , The three little ones came running home , And into their mother 's arms . She set a table ' before them soon , On it spread bread and wine , " Nun , come along my little babes , Come , cat and drink of mine . " " I may nut eat of your bread , my mother , Nor drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back room side , On it spread a clean sheet , And over the top spread a golden skirt For to make a sweeter sleep . " Awake , awake , " said the oldest one , ? " Now soon the cock will crow . I see our Saviour smiling down , And to Him we must go . " Some of the best instrumental music is of a descriptive nature , reflecting vividly the incidents of every-day life . Peculiar fingering of the strings , close harmonics , curious snaps and slides and twangs , and the accurate observations of an ear attuned to all the sounds of nature , enter largely into the composition of these . In the " Cackling Hen " the cackle , hard , high , and cheerfully prosaic , is remarkably well rendered , as may be easily seen . " Big Jim " is a dance tune in which the major melody drops suddenly into a running repetition of two or three minor notes , beautifully like the drumming of rain on a cabin roof . In the " Fox-Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager start of the pack as they take up the trail to the last lingering yelp , after the quarry is treed , is given by the banjo accompaniment . The spoken " patter " runs along irrespective of rhythm , interpolated irregularly with the hunting-cry . It is almost impossible to reduce the effect to musical notation ; the emphasis is all on the hound 's deep note ; the thumb-string , while almost imperceptible to the ear , still plays an important part in producing the rhythm . It begins with a regular movement , which grows more and more rapid and exciting as it progresses ; then , as the fox is treed , the close comes , suddenly , with the baying of " Old Sounder . " Boys , blow up the dogs and let 's have a fox-chase . Get the horn and give her a toot . Call up the dogs and we 'll go down on the creek . Whoopee ! Go it , Lead ! Come on , boys , and let 's go down on the point of the ridge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side . Whoopee ! Go it , Lead ! Come on , old dog ! Whoopee ! Just listen at those dogs run that fox ! Listen , boys ! I believe they have run him down in the gulf ; we can just hear them down in there . Whoopee ! Go it , Lead ! Just listen at ' em . boys ! They have started him out of the creek . Whoopee ! Come on , old dogs ! Come , boys , let 's go round on the point of the ridge and hear that race . Whoopee ! Just listen at Old Sounder ! Boys , they are bringing him out on the ridge . Just hear old Lead ? Bow ! Bow ! Wow ! Wow ! Come on . boys ; you will miss the best part of the race . Whoopee ! Hold ' em down , Rocks ! Boys , I ca n't stay here any longer ? I 've got to go to those dogs . I believe I hear old Lead at that old tree ? bow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are treed on Round Knob . Whoopee ! Coming to you , old dogs ! As T write these songs , old memories come drifting on their melody ? memories of drowsy noons and the tankletump-a-tankle of the banjo on the porch , and the thump-chug , thump-chug of the batten as the mother 's shuttle went patiently to and fro ; of yodels ringingdown the gulch ; of spinning - wheel songs , old Scotch ballads blurred together with the crescendo and diminuendo of the whirling spokes ; of the crooning " By-ee . . . . By-ce. . . " that lulls little children to sleep ; of the laugh and leap of dancers bounding through " Cripple Creek " at the bidding of a man told off to call the figures ; of red firelight flickering over an impromptu play party ? neighbor lads and girls singing and romping through all the evolutions of those intricate games of courtship , in which the couples are never finally mated , saluting and pirouetting and following and flouting ; of wilder nights at " protracted meeting , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall or clambered on the benches to be out of harm 's way ; of the ripple of water and the drone of bees .... Had I but words to say how these tunes are bound with the life of the singer , knit with his earliest impressions , and therefore dearer than any other music could ever be , impossible to forget as the sound of his mother 's voice ! Crude with a tang of the Indian wilderness , strong with the strength of the mountains , yet , in a way , mellowed by the English of Chaucer 's time ? surely this is folk-song of a high order . May it not one day give birth to a music that shall take a high place among the world 's great schools of expression ?
