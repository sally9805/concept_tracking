AMONG the many changes which have improved modern English life , none , I think , are more remarkable than those which have affected young people . Nowadays it is the young who dominate English social life , and though it has been the fashion to accuse English mothers of devoting more time to their own personal amusement and pleasure than to the care of their children , it is undoubtedly a fact that Society and home life are run on lines which conduce more to the enjoyment and amusement of the young people than of their elders . Women preserve their youth much longer now , and treat their children more as friends and contemporaries . A juvenile grandmother is a common object today , while daughters are scarcely younger , scarcely less developed , and less qualified to fill whatever position in life they may be called upon to occupy , than their mothers . When I first came out it was a recognized fact among our family friends and . contemporaries that when a woman attained the age of fifty years or thereabout , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical purposes , quite old . At forty-five my mother , who was still young and good-looking and sang divinely , began to wear caps , and assumed the toilette adopted by women who recognized that they had passed the age when they could he called young . Nowadays mothers and daughters dress almost alike ; and what is a more general sight than that of a young and still beautiful mother dancing all through an evening as merrily , and as much sought after , as her daughter ? Nothing could exceed the simplicity and economy which were practised by thewas very limited ; ? 100 a year was considered princely , especially when it was augmented by our parents providing our court dresses . But the real reason for the lesser cost of our toilettes lay in the fact that amusements were fewer , and generally confined to an occasional afternoon party and a ball , ? so that only two changes of dress were necessary , even among those who went out to a very great extent . A certain number of people rode in Rotten Row in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evening parties ; Burlingham and Ranelagh were unknown , and girls were hardly ever asked out to dinner . Evening receptions were rare , and they were generally attended by elder people only , girls usually being put to bed at eight o'clock to sleep until nine-thirty , when , refreshed and beautified by their rest , they dressed themselves for their ball . As a rule , there was only one ball of a night , and though there were exceptions , few people went to two balls , so that the evening ended not later than one-thirty , and if on rare occasions the rule was broken , it was a distinct exception , and found no favor in the maternal mind . The contrast between the conduct of the young people of to-day and then is even more marked . Balls began earlier . and young men came to them in good time , so that a row of girls awaiting partners was unknown . The unwritten law of etiquette and conduct enjoined that no one should dance more than once with the same partner . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that a girl was ticketed as being fast , and she was held up as a warning to well-brought-up and well-conducted young ladies . Your young ladies of my time . Our allowance partner brought you back to your mother or your chaperon , where you remained until your next partner came to claim his dance . The cotillion was always danced in those days as the finale of a ball . It was generally led by Sir Augustus Lumley , whose services on such occasions gave it a great cachet . At Dudley House , at Apsley House , at Lady Molesworth 's or at Lady Waldo-grave 's , he alw a y s officiated , and being asked to dance by him during the cotillion was considered a great compliment . Society in London in the early sixties was not very brilliant , because of the Queen 's retirement from every kind of social life , but after the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales it received a marked impetus , and there was a great recrudescence of hospitality . The Princess of Wales took t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beauty , and charm of manner captivated every one , and no one ever received a warmer welcome to her new home , from all classes , than she . Crowds stood in the Park all the afternoon waiting for her , and the enormous interest that was taken in everything that she did was unbounded . I do not imagine that any more remarkable instance of this maid have been given than when she held her first Drawing Room in London after her marriage . The crowds in the streets were enormous , but nothing in comparison to the multitude of ladies who attended the Drawing Room . - Many people started at nine o'clock in the morning , and waited in their carriages in the streets till the doors were opened at twelve ; and in spite of all the precautions that were taken , and the barriers that were erected to deal with the crush of ladies inside the Palace , the hustling and pressure were so great that many gowns were almost entirely destroyed before the wearer reached the Presence Chamber where the Prince of Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sketches in which he depicted the scenes at the Drawing Room were no exaggeration . Every scrap and vestige of trimming on most of the dresses and trains was destroyed , and many ladies ' gowns bore testimony to the severe conflict they had miler-gone in their pas- , : age front the en trance of the Palace to the moment when the Princess smiled her sweet welcome upon them . Many dinners and halls were given in London to the royal couple , but t h e most magnificent was the ball given by the officers of the Brigade of Guards at South Kensington . No invitations were ever more eagerly expected and longed for , . and London Society was , generally speaking , very well represented . It was a beautiful sight ; the long building be-longing to the horticultural Society , which stood on the ground now partly oc-cupied by the Imperial Institute and the South Kensington Museum , was beau-tifully decorated with flowers , flags , trophies of all times , and a wonderful mixture of exotic plants . The scene , as the Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the royal family and state officials , en-tered , was most brilliant , and as the strains of the royal anthem died away a wonderful state quadrille was performed , in . which all the royalty danced ; and no one seemed to enjoy it more than the Duke of Cambridge , then a very active man , and Princess May , one of the best dancers in London . The ballroom has long since been swept away , and that fairy scene and many of the actors who took part in it are but the ghosts of memory . I remember how lovely the Princess of W ales looked , dressed in a beautiful white gown , covered with clouds of tulle , which was then t h e fashionable material for ball dresses , and she wore the diamond necklace which the City of Land o a had given her as a wedding-present . There were comparatively few theatres in London at that time ? t h e Princess ' , the Adelphi , the Olympic , and the St. James ' were the most important ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day , and went mostly in the winter or early spring , and never during Lent . Very few theatres paid well , and most of the people who " roll " them lost their money ; but as London was only crowded during the season , from Faster to the end of July , and there were no festivities before Easter , the existing playhouses supplied quite as much amusement as the public required . It was just about that time that the little Prince of Wales ' Theatre , in Tottenham Street , was opened , and Robertson 's plays created a new standard of dramatic art . I suppose there was no event in our lives which gave us greater pleasure and delight than going to the Prince of Wales ' Theatre for the first time . What more could be desired ? And one laughed and cried to one'sheart 's content at Caste , School and Oars . They were nothing but the purely delightful simple comedy , played by the most perfect company that had ever been brought together . There were also two **27;94;TOOLONG and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time was a very serious as well as an educational performance . Norma , Lucrezia Borgia , La Sonnant-bula , Don Giovan-ni , La Gana La-d r a , were the favorites , for the operas then per-formed belonged to a very different school from those of to-day . I was at the opera the first night t h a t Patti made h e r appearance , a n 1.1 t h e wild enthu-siasm of the house over the new diva was indescribable . Her extraordinary youth and beauty , the marvellous quality of her voice , the facility and ease with which she sang , and the complete grasp she showed of her part , made an impression which time has never obliterated . She had come with a certain reputation , and the audience waited expectantly as she made her appearance , but when she opened her lips , and after her singing of the duet scene , there could be no doubt that Patti was enthroned forever in the position she has held all through her life . The opera was a very expensive amuse-ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Dudley and Mr. Delane , I should have gone there very little . Gounod had just written Faust , which was produced in London with some hesitation on the part of the managers , as it was not considered an opera to which les jeun es fines should go . My people , however , belonged to that section of Society which thought that an opera in a foreign language was different from an English play , because very few people could understand the words . I remember as a great treat , and under promise of inviolable secrecy , being taken by my father and my aunt to Cremorne . There is always in the feminine heart a great craving for a taste of forbidden fruit , and I suppose that was why I wanted to go . But I found it very dull , and could see no fun in it , or reason for visiting it a second time . The gardens were pretty , but badly illuminated ; the dancing was ungraceful and dull ; and the various grottos , or what we should now call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how it appeared to me , and I never had any desire to go there again . One year when my father and I were in London before Easter , he also took me to what was then considered hardly a place for Young ladies ? Evans ' Supper Room in Covent Garden . My contemporaries must remember it perfectly well , and to me it was then a most decidedly thrilling place , especially as I went there for the first time on the night of the boat-race . But I do not think to the young lady of today Evans ' would present any charm , except that it was a place to which she had better not go . The room in Which we sat , with its grille in front entirely hiding us from the view of the people in the restaurant , was stuffy and ill-ventilated . There were crowds of men sitting at tables all along the room , and the fact that everybody smoked added to the discomfort and heat of our prison . The really interesting performance was the part-singing which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The choir , which sang part-songs and patriotic ditties , was beautifully trained , and the voices of the boys were as exquisite as boys ' voices always are . But two or three visits to Evans ' quenched all desire on my part to go there again . Though tennis a n d croquet were not a pop-ular form of amusement and garden-parties were not of frequent occur-rence , there was one hostess in London who gave one every Saturday during the season . Lady Shelley was a delight-ful old lady , very kind , hospitable , and popular , and her garden-parties were most enjoyable . There was no music , or games of any kind , to vary the afternoon 's amusement , but people walked about and talked . She lived in a very old house ( which has now dis-appeared ) on the banks of the Thames at Fulham , and endless streets of small houses cover what was once a beautiful garden bright with flowers and full ? of magnificent old trees . Every one in society went to Lady Shelley 's on Saturdays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the house which still exists as Ilurlingham , also was her neighbor and gave parties . Occasionally Lady Burdett-Coutts ( then Miss BurdettCoutts ) gave a tea-party at Holly Lodge , and Lord and Lady Westminster sometimes opened Grosvenor House in the afternoon . I remember being there , and watching with much interest the host , who was a curious mixture of great generosity and economy , and who , though he gave large sums of money privately to charity and helped endless cases of people needing help in a most unstinted manner , was curiously economical in his household arrangements , and all the parties at Grosvenor House were conducted in the most simple and careful way . I remember being astonished by the enormous quantities of fruit which were placed on the buffet where tea was served . and was told it was all made of wax , as Lord Westminster thought it an extravagance to have real fruit . And yet he had only a few days before heard of the case of a remarkably clever young man who was too poor to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk in a bank . After satisfying himself that The story was true , and making a condition that his name should never transpire , he paid all the expenses of this young man 's university career , so that he was able to enter the civil service and was secure of an income for life . This was only one of the many people he befriended . While . on the other hand , it was generally said that , on one occasion , when a servant left him after only two or three days ' service , he had the man 's overcoat altered and wore it himself ! The season generally finished by the end of July , and then everybody went to the country and remained at home , with the exception of one or two visits for shooting , until next spring . I believe one reason why people in those days were so well and healthy , and suffered so little from the nervous diseases which are the maladies of to-day , was because their season was less severe and they had a much extx. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came round . No one can say that the autumn and winter life of people to-day is a tranquil or peaceful one , and the round of enjoyment and gayety must entail a strain and fatigue on even the robust constitutions of English women and girls . It is very difficult , after the lapse of so many years , to compare the physical qualities of English men and women then with those of to-day . When one is young , what with the novelty of coming out and the freshness of enjoyment that young people have , added to the keenness with which they throw themselves into it , every woman is a Venus and every man an Adonis . If I were going to be critical I should say that the women of to-day are prettier than their grandmothers , and stronger , better developed , better set-up , and certainly more independent and more self-reliant than they were forty years ago ; but I do not think that men to-day are as handsome or physically as strong and as finely developed as their grandfathers . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their parents . Though my father and mother had lived for many years very quietly in the country , they belonged to that happy class of people who had a large number of relations and connections , who , luckily for me and my sister , were extremely kind , so that the first year I came out was in every way a delightful time . I remember being proud of the fact that during my first season I bad sat next to Lord Clarendon one night at my aunt 's ( Lady Ely ) ; that I had sat between Charles Dickens and Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton at Lady Moles-worth 's ; while at Mr. Shirley Brooks ' I met Mark Lemon , Sir Henry Thompson , Sir John Ten-ilia and sundry other interesting and remarkable people . Lord Clarendon was charming , as he always was to all young people , but Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton was the person who interested are most , I suppose from the fact that he was exceedingly nice to me and talked to me as if I were much older than my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the noise and fatigue of the dinner seemed to distress him very much . Lady Palmerston was then the great political hostess , and her Saturday evenings were very exclusively Whig , and she was served by an able staff of aides-de-camp . Mr. Abraham Hayward , who was chief of the staff , kept her informed of everybody who came to London whose political support was worth having and who ought to be invited to her house . Undoubtedly Lady Palmerston by her social gifts was a very great assistance to her husband in his political life . Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Dutton were friends and neighbors of Lord and Lady Palmerston in Hampshire , and Lady Palmerston was very fond of Mrs. Dutton , who was the youngest . daughter of Mr. Stevenson , formerly American minister in London . and a clever woman . Mr. Dutton 's sister , Lady Dunsany ( the mother of Sir Horace Plunkett ) had been a great friend of my mother 's in her youth , and Mrs. Dutton was exceedingly kind to me as the daughter of her sister-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a most interesting incident in the life of Lord and Lady Palmerston . The question of the position which England had adopted with regard to Denmark at the time of the war between that country and Germany about the Duchies in 1861 was the subject of a great debate in the House of Commons , and a vote of censure was moved against the government , of which Lord Palmerston was then the head . Political feeling ran high , and it was expected that the government , if they won , would have a very small majority . I went with Mrs. Dutton to the Speaker 's box on the last night of the debate ; and Lady Palmerston was also there . She was in an evident state of excitement and anxiety during the whole evening , but the division gave Lord Palmerston a substantial majority . 1 skill never forget Lady Palmerston 's delight as she hurried downstairs to meet Lord Palmerston , and we followed her . She got down into the Lobby just as the House was emptying . and Lord Palmerston came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her joy , she rushed forward and threw her arms round him and kissed him , to the surprise of Lord Palmerston and the obvious delight of his followers . It was a very striking and touching instance of her devotion to him and the complete way ? in which she made his successes and triumphs the great object of her life . I only once spoke to Lord Palmerston , and it was at a concert at Apsley House just after I came out . It was very crowded , but there were some empty seats in front , and T was told by my mother to go and sit farther forward , as there was no room beside her . I found myself next to an old gentleman who was very kind to me and told me about the music and talked to me on a variety of subjects . I Igo/ not the least idea who he was , but thought him quite delightful . On rejoining my mother , who was sitting among some friends . I got dreadfully chaffed and laughed at for sitting next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing who he was . I remember at the time being struck by the fact that I had never heard any one with such a boyish laugh , and my perfect ignorance of his personality had evidently amused him very much . LONDON SOCIETY The first time I really made Lord Beaconsfield 's acquaintance was after my first marriage , at Lady Stanhope 's , when I sat next to him at dinner . He was very kind to me , while I was shy and nervous at my proximity to the great man ; but he was specially sympathetic , as Colonel Stanley had just stood ( unsuccessfully ) as Conservative candidate at the election for Maidstone in 1874 . Maidstone was the first constituency which returned Lord Beaconsfield to Parliament , and he had shown his interest in Colonel Stanley 's candidature by writing a letter to him , which iii those days was rather an unusual ON'tt rrenee . I found on talking over the names of our supporters t h at some of them were well known to him . But I did not like to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent had told me , as Mr. Wyndham Lewis , Mrs. Disraeli 's first husband , was his colleague and was defeated . The elections then lasted for several days , and on the closing day the Conservative agent was standing in the garden of the little inn which was the headquarters of the Conservative candidate . Mr. Disraeli came into the garden where Mrs. Wyndham Lewis and the agent were sitting , and throwing himself down on the grass , exclaimed that if he was not elected for Maidstone his career would be ruined . Mrs. Lewis , in great agitation , went into the house , leaving the two men together , and she waylaid the Conservative agent as he was ieaving the hotel , and pressed a small parcel into his hands , saying , at whatever cost , Mr. Disraeli mast be returned ; and the next day Mr. Disraeli was returned at the head of the poll . Our chairman used always to relate with great delight endless incidents connected with that election at Maidstone , and spoke of Mrs. Wyndham Lewis ' evident admiration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all through had been to get Mr. Disraeli returned . Lord Beaconsfield talked about his experiences at Maidstone with much interest , and was very amusing over some of his reminiscences . I saw something of him later , and he dined with its once or twice . The last time I met him was one day paying a visit to Lady Iddesleigh , not long before he died . There Was a little child I knew , who once had a most delightful experience of his kindness . She had been told by her father , a strong Conservative in a Radical family , where political feeling ran high even in the nursery , to say , whenever she was asked whom she loved best , " Dizzy . " She always remembered the paternal injunction . One clay while calling with her mother on a mutual friend of Lord Beaconsfield , he came in to tea , and seeing the child , he began to talk to her . He was very fond of children , and they were never shy with him . After talking to her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he kissed her on parting he said , as one often does to a child , " Now tell me whom you love best in the world , " and she promptly replied , to his great amusement , " Dizzy . " Lord Beaconsfield used to speak constantly about Mr. Gladstone ? his career , his political life , and , above all , his attitude toward himself . I think that Mr. Gladstone 's dislike to Disraeli , which was exceedingly acute , puzzled Lord Beaconsfield , but at the same time rather amused him . Personally , he was a man who allowed no feeling of animosity or antipathy to his political opponents to influence his attitude toward them , and , in fact , I think ( with the exception of Lord Sherbrooke ) , that he felt quite indifferent to the leaders of the Liberal party . But Mr. Glad-stone 's attitude of open hostility and the exhibition of animosity which he constantly showed in the House of Commons was a subject which Lard Beaconsfield often discussed . He told me that he considered Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettiest women of her day , and that he and Lady Beaconsfield had always liked her , and wished to be friends with her , but that Mr. Gladstone , instead of giving them the slightest encouragement , was most repellent to any overture he had attempted to make . Though my acquaintance with Lord Beaconsfield was of so recent a date , I had often seen him at Lady Ely 's house , and one of the most curious of his characteristics always appeared to be the fact that he had aged so little during the years I had known him . He had always the same curious sallow skin , and the dark hair , and neither in color nor in texture did either seem to change . Mrs. Norton , who was very kind to me when I was a girl , used often to relate many of her experiences and recollections as a young woman , when she was in the mind to talk , and one , connected with Lord Beaconsfield , was , I think . rather interesting . One night she was dining with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three young men , who were distinguished , each in his own particular way , and were , he believed , all going to make a mark in the world . They were practically unknown to any one but him ; he , however , had come across them , and was anxious to befriend them . One was a brilliant young man ? a lawyer ? not particularly talkative , b u t still clever and amusing . The second was dressed in an exaggerated , fantastic way , with velvet coat and ruffles , h i s hair very much curled , and his person carefully groomed and attended to . lie was brilliant , irrational , amusing , and sarcastic , and during the whole dinner he and the young barrister sustained the conversation , which gave Lord Melbourne great enjoyment . The third guest was a silent young man , with strongly marked features and dark hair . He seldom spoke , but listened with great attention , and impressed the other guests with a sense of his strong personality and power of observation . Mrs. Norton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tantalizing ? evening , because at the moment she knew nothing ? not even the names ? of the young men . After they had gone her host informed her who they were : the first , the young barrister , was Sir Alexander Cockburn , afterward Chief Justice of England ; the brilliant . versatile young man was Benjamin Disraeli , and the third , the silent and observant guest , was the late Emperor Napoleon III . She told inc with what deep interest she had followed their careers , but the one of the trio that impressed her most was Lord Beaconsfield .
