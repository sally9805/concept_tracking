She lies on a divan , propped up with many cushions . She is clad in an elaborate tea-gown , her hair elaborately coiffed . In her hand she holds a cut-glass smelling-salts bottle which she sniffs from time to time . Beside the couch a tabouret supports a pink-and-gold chocolate service . She puts down her cup as her visitor enters @x She speaks over the heads of line standing at box-office window , to husband . NOW , Richard , do n't take anything but aisle seats  --  you know I do n't like anything else  --  having those men drag over you between the acts and  --  What 's that ? Eighth row ? Is that the best he can do ? Well , ask him again if he 's positive . I do n't believe it , because just look at all these people waiting he 's got to give seats to . Well , if he 's perfectly sure I suppose we had better take them .  --  Now , Richard , I believe if you had been a little more decided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said so  --  they 're all disagreeable , but I think  --  ( They enter the house . ) Ushers all busy .  --  I never went into a theatre in my life they were n't showing some one to a seat and I had to wait  --  and it 's late at that . Well , dear , it 's almost time for the curtain to go up  --  I call that late . If it 's the eighth row we can find them ourselves . Come on .  --  Yes , we can ; come on .  --  There , this is it . What are the numbers ? Oh , Richard , I told you on the aisle . Well , suppose he did , I said on the aisle , did n't I ? I do n't care , I said  --  Well , I 'm not going to stand up here before all these people and argue about it . I know what I said . I 'm not either , but you will make me if you continue like that . All right , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard , when you get an idea in your head . I sha' n't quarrel with you , no matter what you say  --  I 'm good-natured if you 're not. Oh , bother  --  now we 've got to squash past all of them . It will pull my waist all crooked .  --  There , I knew you would  --  you are so clumsy , Richard . Done ? Why , you 've stepped on my skirt and torn it loose from the belt . You might have been a little careful . How could I hold it up passing in front of all these people ? You are so unreasonable.These vacant seats must be the ones .  --  I do n't believe I 'm going to be able to see a thing . You know , Richard , it was n't my idea to see this play at all . I should have much preferred to have waited till next week when they put on a fresh play , whatever it was  --  they 've been playing this so long .  --  If that woman does n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see a thing . Now , is n't that horrid of you , Richard , and just like you . What did you bring me for  --  to have a good time or not ? Well , all right , then let me enjoy myself in my own way.What is that usher beckoning to us for  --  what does he want ? Well , here are our tickets ? What ! They 're balcony seats ! Then what in the world did you drag me down here for ? I did n't insist any such thing . And I told you at the box-office the eighth row would do . You could n't hear with all those people talking ? I do n't believe these seats are sold at all . I do n't believe it , with all that line waiting behind you . Of course there 's no use standing here in the middle talking about it . ( They crush their way out . ) I do n't see how I 'm going to climb these stairs in this tight gown . No , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest it .  --  There , we 're up at last.Eighth row in the balcony ! Horrible ! Go and see if you ca n't get others . All sold out ? I do n't care if he did say so  --  maybe he 's changed his mind by now . Very well  --  I see you are determined to make me uncomfortable  --  I ca n't help it if they do n't like it  --  we 've got to get by  --  you will kindly remember I told you to get aisle seats.I do n't feel as though I was going to enjoy this a bit . You do n't either ? Thank you , that is pleasant . Take me out for a nice evening and then do all you can to spoil everything.These seats are worse than ever when you get in them . There , I 've dropped my boa climbing over these people . You 'll have to go back and look for it . Why , I certainly did wear it , and I have n't taken my coat off yet  --  I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up while you look . Well , it 's a matter of perfect indifference to me whether they like it or not  --  I 'm not going to lose my new boa just for the sake of not disturbing them. You do n't see it ? Then poke about underneath with your cane . You do n't see it ? Well , you 'll have to ask them all to get out in the aisle while you look under .  --  There , what 's that big black thing ? Oh , that lady 's foot .  --  No , it is n't there . Now , do n't ask me again if I left it at home . But it must be there  --  I remember stepping on something as we were getting past .  --  There , what 's that ? Oh , that man 's hat .  --  It does look badly . That must have been what I stepped in.  --  It is too bad , but you know really it is a risk to put a hat on the floor  --  you know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the seat the way we do  --  ( All seat themselves again . ) No , I did n't wear it to-night  --  I remember , now . I was afraid I 'd lose it just like this. Oh , Richard , you did n't get a programme . You have one ? That wo n't do .  --  I want another one to use now and one to put in our programme-book . No , I wo n't wait till later  --  they may be all gone . Now , I ask you , did we come here for the comfort of these people or to amuse ourselves ? I should think so  --  go and get it . ( Every one again rises . ) They 're all gone ? What did I tell you  --  did n't I say they would ? Now , what good would it have done to have waited till the end of the performance if they are all gone already ? If you would only listen to me.  --  Good gracious , Richard , I forgot to tell mother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ice-box instead of the one in the bottom . What shall we do ? You 'll have to go right out and telephone  --  that 's all there is to it . If you say anything more about disturbing these people I shall lose my temper  --  what are they here for ? ( Every one again rises. ) @x She timidly accosts a large brass-buttoned employ. @x She sits at a table on which reposes a packet of letters fastened with a blue ribbon . She is pretty in a plaintive , wistful fashion . She contemplates the small bundle in silence for some moments , then with a sigh slowly unties the bow . THERE they are ! All of Reggie 's love-letters ready for the funeral pyre . I suppose that , properly , one ought to weep over obsequies of this nature , but , really , I do n't feel in the least like crying  --  ( with a little catch in her breath )  --  at least I  --  I  --  do n't think I do . I  --  no , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite recovered from my childish fancy for Reggie . ( Primly . ) Thank goodness , I am one of those , rare , I must confess , thoroughly sensible girls who are ever ready to listen to the dictates of reason . Fancy mamma saying I 'm silly and romantic , and my head full of theatricals and nonsense . Me ! ( Dramatically . ) " Nay , willingly and gladly I lay my marble heart on the bleeding altar  --  " Oh no ! How does that go ? " Nay , willingly and gladly I lay my bleeding heart on the marble altar of sacrificial devotion . Have you not guessed that love of money is more to me than family , friends  --  " No , no , that is n't right . That love of family and friends is more than money  --  " Oh , dear , that wo n't do at all , for I 'm giving up Reggie because he 's poor . But it 's all right . I certainly do n't love him , or I could n't be calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or regret.I do n't feel a bit more upset than if I were cutting button-holes ! I really don't.Then Reggie was so foolish about me ; his letters were n't a bit sensible  --  so different from Colonel Browne 's . I 'll just pick one out at random . " My Ownest Own Darling of a Sweetheart ! " ( Her lip trembles perilously . She recovers herself and suddenly sits up very straight . ) Awfully silly ! Yes , too awfully absurd . I 'm rather sorry I looked at it  --  it 's more foolish than I thought . I 'm quite convinced that in listening to reason  --  and mamma  --  I 'm doing what is best for my future welfare , and also that I 'm thoroughly over any notion I had for Reggie . Now , I 'll just try something . Where 's my pulse . ( Places one finger on the wrist of the other hand . ) Now , I  --  do nt  --  love  --  Reggie  --  any  --  more . One  --  two  --  three  --  four . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as even and steady as can be . Now , Reggie  --  does  --  not  --  love  --  me  --  any  --  more . One , two , three , four , five , six ! Why , what is the matter ? How queer ! It went so fast I could n't count it . Oh , of course , it 's the exertion of tearing up these letters . Reggie always uses  --  I mean used  --  such strong paper when he writes  --  wrote  --  to me . He said he never could find paper half strong enough to bear the weight of his love for me . ( She pauses . A solitary tear slowly makes its way down her cheek and falls with a tiny splash on the letter she holds . ) What a preposterously ridiculous idea of his  --  I hate foolish men ! I  --  I  --  believe I 'm tired  --  I  --  do n't think I 'll do any more now . ( After a time . ) No ! ( With great decision . ) I certainly never could endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reggie . We would have to live in a flat  --  not a proper house , but a flat . One of those horrid places where you push the button and the door opens without any visible agency , and you go diving up dark , nasty staircases while some one leans over the banister above and shrieks , " Who is it ? " And you tell your name , and then they say , " Wrong bell , " and slam a door , and you have to go down and do it all over again ! Oh no  --  I assuredly do not love Reggie . ( Suddenly she starts , a wave of color overspreads her face . She drops the letters , and , hastily recovering them , makes an attempt at an air of extreme indifference . ) That 's Reggie 's step now . How stupid of him to come over after I wrote explaining the situation perfectly , and that mamma had persuaded me that it was best for me to marry Colonel Browne . Browne ! what a hateful , plebeian name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " anyway.Here he is . How d'ye do , Reggie ? Pardon my not shaking hands with you , but you see I 'm busy . I 'm tearing up your love  --  letters  --  you can have the pieces back if you want them. Do be sensible , and do n't make a scene  --  you ca n't do that sort of thing gracefully . You know in our balcony scene in " Romeo and Juliet " how awfully awkward you were . That was rather nasty of me to tell you , Reggie , but it was for your own good  --  the sooner you hate me the better it will be for you. Well , it was very foolish of you to come after my writing fully why it ca n't be . I do n't know why marriage is referred to as " it . " I 'm not flippant . I 'm calm , that 's all . Do n't go on so ! It 's absolutely impossible . If you do n't stop raging up and down like that you will knock over my tea-table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only wedding present . It was rather previous of Aunt Lucy , was n't it ? Oh , Reggie , do you think I 'll have to send them back now ? You do ? I never thought of that before . Mamma never said a word about it . But , Reggie , they would do just as well for me and the Colonel ! Reggie , you swore a horrid swear ! ( Dramatically . ) Ah , but all this is a mere trifle . When the happiness of two young lives hangs quivering in the balance of  --  of something or other . Reginald , from now , henceforth , our paths diverge . What 's that  --  yours is to the devil ? No , Reggie , that 's much too expensive a road for you . We must part forever at once ! Oh , you 're not going now ? Sit down  --  I 've just commenced.From now on I live for duty alone . I shall be a loveless bride , but serene in the uplifting thought that in sacrificing my life for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reggie ! And it 's very mean of you to say I am . But do sit down like a good boy , and we can talk things over while I finish up your letters. Oh , Reggie , you must n't get on your knees to me . You know , dear , you are poor , and you ca n't have new trousers every day , like Colonel Browne . There , there ; get up . ( A long pause . ) How pitiful he looks ! I 'm very glad I do n't care for him , for I should feel awfully to see him like this if I did. Now he 's at the fireplace . I 'm glad that he did that , for in books the discarded lover always leans moodily against the mantel  --  piece , staring with gloomy eyes into the heart of the glowing coals ! Reggie is dreadfully handsome . And he looks so well smooth shaven . So few men can stand that . Colonel Browne has fur all over his face . Ugh ! It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I 'm married and settled  --  I suppose I 'll have to " settle " when I marry the Colonel  --  and Reggie , of course , will be a bachelor , and then he can come and visit us . And I 'm sure the Colonel will be delighted to have him when I tell him how long Reggie and I have been friends.What fun Reggie and I will have ! I say , Reggie , I 've got such a lovely idea . Oh , do n't look so happy  --  it is n't that . Listen ! When the Colonel and I are married and settled out at Oakhurst , you are going to visit us , and , you know , Reggie , that will save you lots of expense . And , say , Reggie , we 'll have more fun playing golf  --  you know the Colonel hates it . And , I say , Reggie , the shooting  --  What  --  you do n't care to come  --  do n't care to accept Colonel Browne 's hospitality ? Indeed  --  indeed ! Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper you have before I became irretrievably entangled with you ! Colonel Browne has the disposition of an angel. He would have to have to get along with me ? That is polite ! You do n't believe I love him ? I never said I did . Oh well , if I do n't I ought to  --  it 's the same thing . You 're going ? Very well  --  I 'm glad of it . Goodbye ! One moment . You 've forgotten something . Your manners. What was that ? You are going to marry , too  --  two ? No , you ca n't ; it 's against the law  --  you can only have one  --  at a time ! I suppose the future Mrs. Reggie is that horrid Nan Baker  --  she always was a fool . Of course , you 're marrying her for her money , and let me tell you right now that the creature who would marry for mere wealth is too  --  well , too contemptible to even mention , and  --  I  --  I  --  marry for money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . I said you would n't understand . ( A protracted silence ensues . ) ( Finally , with desperation. ) @x ( Turns away with a sniff and a toss of her head. ) @x ( She sits , Enter another woman . ) Yes , it is unpleasant , but you always have to wait like this here . Yes , the second time  --  they utterly ruined my gown last year , so this time I thought they would make me a perfect one . I am afraid , though , it wo n't turn out any better . Yours is what ? Brown with green polka-dots  --  oh , I should n't  --  Yes , yes , indeed , very odd . I only came here because Mrs. Tyler  --  do you know her ?  --  she lives up-town and has blond hair and one child  --  such a disagreeable , forward boy , too . Oh , you do n't  --  well , she recommended these people so highly to me and urged me to try them . I never could imagine why she took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me any better than I do her. Are you in such a hurry ? Have to catch a train ? Is n't that too bad . Yes , I 'm afraid you 'll miss it  --  such a shame . I always tell them I 'm in a hurry , whether I am or not  --  that 's the way I did this morning , though I have n't a thing to do till lunch-time . Let you take your fitting before I finish ? Oh , really  --  why  --  you know I would be so glad to , but , now I come to think of it , I have a number of things I ought to attend to this morning . I 'm so sorry . No , I do n't think it was cheeky of you a bit .  --  Perhaps we will meet here again , and I would be so glad to oblige you . If it had been any other day but this  --  Here he is with my jacket , now . I 'll try my best to make him hurry ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just by looking at it . Now , I told you so carefully to make it much too broad across the shoulders or it would n't be right . Just look at that ! I ca n't get my arms down . Well , the more you cut out the less there will be of it . Yes , it feels more comfortable , but I do n't care at all how it feels  --  I want it to look right . Maybe , but I do n't believe it . Just look where the waist line comes  --  You said that before ; but you should be able to make me look long-waisted , whether I am or not . I told you expressly I wanted it very loose across the chest.It 's simply awful . It gives me absolutely no figure . Well , I told you you could pad it , if you thought it was necessary . I do n't care what you do with it as long as you make me look the way I want to look . I am so discouraged I could cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no use twitching it like that  --  it wo n't do a bit of good.Every time I wiggle it pokes right out at the neck . Are you really positive you can ? You know they all say that  --  I wish I could think  --  All right . Now , you are absolutely sure the pressing will make it perfect ? All right . Very well , to-morrow morning at ten-thirty . Good-morning . ( Exits . Re-enters. )
