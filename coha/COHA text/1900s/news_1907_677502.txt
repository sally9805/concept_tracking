txt That millions of dollars of stock tax stamps had been intrusted in two years solely to a $2,500 a year clerk , not under bond , and that $5,611,658 of these stamps had disappeared with only the word of this clerk to prove that thy were destroyed , was told by Controller Martin H. Glynn to-hight . Paper on when the stamps were planted , he declared , had been left carelessly around a printer 's shop and even the completed stamps had bean left unguarded in a general laxity of administration concerning this important matter . Mr. Glynn did not charge that any stamps went astray , but said he revealed the state of affairs so that in case R. should be ft , und that some of them had " escaped from the custody of the Controller , my skirts will be clean . " Charles M. Watkins of Penn Yan was the chief clerk in the Transfer Tax Bureau under Controllers Kelsey and Wilson . and had charge of the stamps .

It was in the process of checking up the stamps on hand immediately after taking office in January that Controller Glynn discovered such a muddle that he asked the Civil Service Commission for the services of an expert accountant . John Hotirigan was detailed for the work , and after weeks of investigation , made his report . He found that stamps aggregating $6,000,000 were on hand and the " deficiency was accounted for by the stamps reportedas , destroyed , either in ro pCesS , manufacture ' or - by aetaiat burning in bulk .

Two lets reported as actually burned represented re , pectively $174,000 and $2 , - 283,507.40 .

The stamps were printed by Quayle &; Son of this city at their plant in Green Street . The plates were in the custody of the Controller 's representative , and each day of work were delivered to Quayle . The paper first used was of an ordinary commercial sort . which Controller Glynn said was stored in the Quayle shop under an ordinary lock in an ordinary room , and while the sheets . were counted out before printing there was no safeguard to prevent them from being abstracted . Moreover , the Controller declared the count of sheets did not tally , the explanation being that some of them were used for other purposes . The first issue of stamps was found to be susceptible to counterfeiting , and the removal of cancellation marks , and in May or June of last year the printing of these was stopped and a new Issue was begun on patent paper .

And the Controller 's seal with which the bundles were sealed , was ap- , parently as carelessly treated . " The finished stamps were stored in the safe deposit vaults of the Albany City Safe Deposit Company under Mr. wat-1 kins 's supervision . Mr. Glynn said that about Oct. 1 , 1905 , the record showed that a lot of $1744100 which had been accepted and sealed as good and placed in the deposit vault where the stamps were kept were removed and recorded as " burned , " and the statement was made that they had been " replaced by the printer " as not having been up to the standard of workmanship . " There is no record to this effect , " declared Mr. Glynn . " I had difficulty in getting Watkins to return to Albany .

" There is a conflict of testimony on this point . The safe deposit people say they were not returned until Dec. 26 . There were over two millions In this lot ? $1,256 , . 21L40 which had been returned by the Bank of Manhattan Company , the official distributors of the stamps , and $1 , -1 027,366 which had never been issued . " I do not know how long they remained at the Green Street shop , but , according to Watkins 's statement , they were brought back here to the State House , . and on Dec. 29 , two days before I as-1 sumed office , they were burned in the : furnace downstairs without being counted ' or checked up , and without witnesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who. was in no way legally responsIble for their care . The record of // $0,611,658 IN STAMPS GONE // the burning of Dec. 29 was not entered until Dec. 31  --  the day before I took office . " Mr. Quayle sail that he urged the Iformer Controller to appoint a watchman Ito guard the property of the State in his shop , but it was never done . Watkins says he worried about it himself , and once slept there a week . Watkins Offered a Bond . " I asked Watkins if he did not think it would have been better , if only for his own protection , to have deferred the destruction of this great amount of stamps until the new Controller could at least have verified his count . He said he no never thought of that , and offered me bond of $5 for every dollar 's worth of stamps that was found to have gone astray . I called his attention to the fact that such a bond would total $25,000,000 . He admitted that the system was lax , but contended that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " These stamps are practically cash , and I feel it my duty . if only to myself , to make the facts public , so that should it turn out that any of these stamps supposed to have been destroyed have escaped from the custody of the Controller , my own skirts would be clean . The Government of the United States does not handle its stamps or money in this way . and I do n't believe the people of this State want their money handled in this way , eft her . " " No stamps have been printed since I assumed office , and none will be until I have perfected a system for caring for them . I have already obtained new vaults , and only Mr. Kearney , Watkins 's successor , and Mr. Gott , my secretary . have access t ' them , and then only with an order from the Controller . All the unprinted paper has been brought to the Controller 's of f ice .

Coming with the revelations of graft In the Public Buildings Department , the finding by Attorney General Jackson of an empty treasury in his department , and the disappearance of important papers in the proceedings against the American Ice Company . the findings of Controller Glynn puts another item In the bill of particulars against the old Republican administration . KELSEY IS SUSPICIOUS . Distrusts Charges Made at Night Knows Nothing of Stamps . Otto Kelsey , State Superintendent of Insurance and ex-Controller. was at the home of L. B.

He declared that if the charge had reference to the old issue of stamps , which was destroyed at the time the new issue was made it was a matter entirely out of his knowledge , for it would have occurred in. the administration of ex-Controller Wilson . The destruction of defective stamps , he believed , was the duty of Mr. Quayle . the ' printer , and had always been done under his supervision . The work was further supervised and watched by an agent from the Controller 's office . Which one Mr. Kelsey did not know .
