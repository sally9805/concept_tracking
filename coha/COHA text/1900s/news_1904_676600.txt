txt When it was learned at the Criminal Court Building yesterday that District Attorney Jerome had left his private car at El Paso , Texas , and had gone into New Mexico , instead of carrying out his programme of spending his three weeks ' vacation in Arizona , it ' was asserted that the District Attorney had no particular plans for his Southwestern trip , but simply intended to remain away from New York long enough to fool the Tammany organization . It , was his design to make the organization believe that he had really gone away on a pleasure trip , and had forgotten all about gamblers , hiving that the present administration would stand for a wideopen town during his absence and get caught in a trap which he had carefully prepared before starting for the West . The real reason for the vacation taken at this time by the District Attorney , it was said , was to allow the new Police Commissioner , , a free foot in the handling of vice in New York . It was also said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans of the District Attorney , and consequently had given orderi to all of the Police Inspectors to enforce the laws more rigidly than ever before . That they have been enforced rigidly is apparent in the grumbling of the poolroom men and other gamblers , who , for a time ; believed they would be permitted to open up after Mayor McClellan took his seat in the City Hall . The fact that these gamblers are now denouncing Tammany is taken as sufficient proof that they have not been allowed to open with the consent of the police . That , if reports be correct , will be a disappointment for District Attorney Jerome . His plans are said to have leaked into the hands of the enemy , and Tammany has taken advantage of the ' leak to close up every poolroom and gambling house in town during Mr. Jerome 's absence . The liquor dealers have been given to understand that the administration favors a liberal excise policy , but they have also been told that they must stand for excise arrests for the purpose of making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one case a policeman , it is said . told a certain liquor dealer that it was up to the police to arrest some one for Sunday violations , and to help along this plan the liquor dealer surrendered his bartender , confident that he would not be successfully prosecuted in the Court of Special SesSions . In the Essex Market Court , where a dozen saloonkeepers were arraigned yesta:db.y on charges of ' violating the liquor tax law , Magistrate Cornell asked the counsel for the liquor dealers whether counsel expected so many arrests in one particular district after election . Counsel replied : - " " No , it was a disappointment . " - " I have not seen the like of this in six months , " - said the Magistrate : " -I . expected that just the opposite-of this would be the State of affairs : But at the- time of saying this Magistrate - Cornell had not heard - of the District Attorney 's reputed plans to ' entrap Tammany , with . the resultant-consequences. - Notwithstanding the fact that- the Tamnatty administration officials - are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District .
