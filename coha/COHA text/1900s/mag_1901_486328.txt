Recent dispatches from Havana report that MasO is making great gains in his canvass foie the Presidency . That ' there ib even to be an election of a Cuban President will come as a piece of news to most Americans , busied as they are about farm and merchandise , and already thinking of Cuba more " as a nuisance than as an isle of the oppressed to be made one of the blest . Yet if present plans hold , the Cubans will choose a President and other officers of their so-called independent government next February ; and the thing to make note of just now is that Mash 's candidacy , with its probable success , represents a serious derangement of what is understood to be the " official " programme kindly prepared for the Cubans by our military authorities . Estrada Palma was plainly ear-marked as the candidate favored by Gen. Wood and by our War Department . MasO was to be induced to accept the Vice-Presidency . The two were expected to be the docile team which the Military Governor could drive whithersoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On October 31 he issued an electoral manifesto , to explain why it was a " patriotic duty " for him to stand for the Presidency of the Cuban republic . He declared that he had been appealed to from all parts of the island to lend his name to a candidacy which would represent the " genuine Cuban tradition , " and which would aim at " saving from the general shipwreck at least the political life of the country , the principles of the revolution , and the honor of Cubans . " In his appeal for popular support , Rase did not think it necessary to pay any compliments or show any gratitude to the American Government . He round- declared that the American intervention in Cuba had been " perverted into a military occupation approaching a conquest " ; and frankly admitted that Cuba could not be , under the terms of the Platt amendment , a really independent state . Yet , within the limitations imposed upon them , he thought that the Cuban people should proceed with firmness and prudence to set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain cordial relations with the United States . Mese appealed openly to the negro vote , asked for the support of his fellow-veterans of the Cuban army , and addressed himself also to citizens of Spanish antecedents , who are , he asserted , the " very nerves of our national life . " It is easy to see why the candidacy of such a man on such a platform should alarm the American foster-fathers of Cuba . In Mash 's bold appeal to colored voters , they discern the threat of a war of races inthe island ; and it appears that the negro citizens in Santiago and-elsewhere are , in fact , flocking to his standard almost in a body . His adroit an gling for the votes of soldiers and Spaniards must be a source of nearly as great uneasiness to Gen. Wood . If Mas6 succeeds , the whole carefully - arranged plan for gently leading the Cubans along under Palma into whatever course their American rulers might finally decide to be good for them , will be in danger of being shattered . The National party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent into fragments , most of which have fallen into Mash 's basket . All told , the political outlook in Cuba has radically changed within the past month , and in a way necessarily disquieting to Gen. Wood and Secretary Root . But the main question in Cuba is , after all , economic rather than political . Even Mese recognizes this . With whatever insubordination he may propose to cut loose from Gen. Wood 's leading-strings , he does not neglect to emphasize the importance of speedily securing a treaty with the United States which shall give life to Cuban industries . How commercially to rescue the islands we have rescued by force of arms , is now the great and pressing question in Cuban administration . All accounts agree that the industrial and commercial situation in Cuba is bad , and rapidly growing worse . There will be a large sugar crop , but no market for it . Neither capital nor labor is freely entering the island . A committee of representative merchants and planters is en route from Havana to Washington to lay all these urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , for one thing , we ought to treat Cuba decently . Having cut her off from her old market , we ought to provide her a new one . Nor should we forget that we have promised to do en . We ought to keep that promise . The case of Cuban reciprocity stands by itself . Senator Spooner says that he does not know what reciprocity means  --  at least , he wishes some one would define the word for him . But he ought to know exactly what Cuban reciprocity means . He was one of the Senators called into conference with the Cuban delegates last spring , when it was agreed that , if the Platt amendment were accepted by the Convention , a considerable reduction in our tariff on Cuban sugar and tobacco should be made as speedily as possible . Of course , that agreement is not legally binding upon us ; but it is morally binding . The Cubans fulfilled their part of the bargain ; we must live up to ours . Whatever else President Roosevelt urges Congress to do , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Cuba at the earliest possible day . Other reciprocity proposals may fail , but to establish reciprocal trade , with Cuba we are in hon- ' or bound . Hating done that and having left the Cubans to govern themselves , we , may withdraw our troops and our control with as comfortable a feeling as that which Sancho Panza had in leaving Barataria , and may even come away as convinced as he was that our talents do not lie in the direction of governing islands . THE IRREPRESSIBLE TARIFF . Many wise men , not to say wiseacres , are declaring at Washington that Congress must not touch the tariff . No one really thinks of disturbing it , is the first thing they assert . Then they add that it would be absurd to revise the tariff ; that it could not be done without much difficulty ; that they will do it themselves all in good time if you will only let them alone now ; and they wind up with an ago'nized cry for help : " Men and brethren , come , in heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from clouding prosperity and ruining business ! " Well , who are these impious men who would lay a sacrilegious hand upon the sacred ark of protection ? They are , most of them , lifelong protectionists . First among them we rank William McKinley , who , being dead , yet speaketh in favor of tariff revision . His laSt public utterance was an earnest call to his party and to his countrymen to " extend and promote our markets abroad " by doing away with " some of our tariffs that are no longer needed for revenue or to encourage and protect our industries at home . " There can be no doubt chat , if President McKinley had lived , he would be to-day the leader in the movement which excited protectionists are foolishly denouncing as treason to his memory . Another of the pestiferous agitators is Congressman Babcock , honored Republican , convinced protectionist . He announced last week that he should push from the first day of Congress his bill for putting upon the free list all the manufactures of the Steel Trust His ground is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steel are no longer needed . There are practically no imports . Exports go to foreign countries , and are there sold at lower prices than those demanded of the American consumer . President Schwab admitted this in his testimony before the Industrial Commission . Very well , says Mr. Babcock ; duties that not only are not needed , but furnish a barrier behind which a giant Trust can take refuge and make exactions from the American people  --  such duties must be repealed . It is not a question of fiscal policy , but of simple social justice . In addition to these cantankerous Republican revisers of the tariff , we have the Chambers of Commerce , all over the country , meeting to resolve that tariff obstructions , ta foreign trade ought to be removed at once , and sending large delegations to Washington to urge their views upon the President , In other words , the very business men who are to be ruined by so much as a discussion of the tariff , are foremost in agitating its revision ! It is a wise business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened Congressman . Right un-= der Senator Hanna 's nose , the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce rises up to advocate a large measure of reciprocity with Canada That city has become a great manufacturing centre , and is looking about for markets . What market so natural or alluring as the one just across Lake Erie ? But mutually repellent tariff laws prevent the exchange of raw materials and finished products across that international border ; and Cleveland business men are clear-headed enough to see that a lowering of the barriers would promote a flow of commerce advantageous to both countries . So they are for reciprocity  --  that is to say , for tariff revision . The contending forces in this latest struggle over the tariff are aligned in a novel way . It is no longer political party against political party . The tariff sword has gone into the Republican vitals , and that party sees itself divided on the issue . It may be that the Democrats are as sharply divided , but they can count as little more , just now , than spectators of the contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , which the present controversy has arrayed . Historically , of course , the manufacturers have been the great upholders and beneficiaries of the tariff . From time to time they threw a sop , as a rule wholly unsubstantial , to agricultural interests , to keep them quiet . But now the day has arrived when the manufacturers , as a whole , want a modification of the tariff , which they no longer need ( they never did need it , really ) , and lo ! it is the despised producer of raw materials who now rises up to say them nay . If the great manufacturers of the country could now have their way , we should have a revised tariff , and that right early ; but the sugar-growers and the wool-raisers , the tobacco-farmers and the fruit-growers , sullenly say , " No , you do n't ! Our inning has come , and we mean to make the most out of it that we can . " It is the spectacle of this quarrel between old friends , the fear that battling interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that leads timid counsellors to recommend soothing-syrup and silence . " Let the old man sleep , " says Senator Mason elegantly , " for there is always trouble when you arouse him . " Yes , but suppose the old man is already suffering from colic , and has a nightmare , and will soon get up and begin to smash the furniture unless something is done to relieve him ? It is a counsel of folly as well as of cowardice , this renewal of Lord Melbourne 's impatient cry , " Why - ca n't you let it alone ? " The trouble is that it wo n't let you alone . Time and the course of our industrial development and the march of commerce and the competition of nations have set the-movement for tariff revision running like a strong tide ; and , all the mops of all the Mrs. Partingtons in Washington can not keep it out of the Republican house . The alarmed or the greedy may cry , Down with tariff revision ! but it will not down . It is as irrepressible , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BLACK AND WHITE RATIOS FOR ELEVEN DECADES . An analysis of the relative numbers of the white and of the negro population of the several sections of the United States at different periods in our national history reveals some facts of interest and importance . For the purposes of such an analysis the country may be conveniently divided into seven groups of States and Territories . Three of these comprise that portion of the country in which , in 1860 , slavery was either legally or practically non-existent . The North Atlantic group covers the section north of Mason 's and Dixon 's line and east of the State of Ohio . That is , it is made up of New England , New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania . The Northern Central group includes all the old free States from Ohio to Kansas , inclusive , and from the Ohio River and the northern boundary of Missouri to the Canadian border . The States and Territories of the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast make up the Western group . This grouping is the same as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the Census Office considers as one of the Northern Central group , is not so dealt with in this discussion . It is excluded because , in 1860 , it was a slave State . Of the sixteen slave States Delaware , Maryland , the Virginias , North Carolina , Kentucky , Tennessee , and Missouri , together with the District of Columbia , lie to the north of the States in which the negro population is relatively the most numerous . Before the war , the phrase " Border States " was sometimes used so as to include all this region , although in its more precise and accurate definition that term excluded North Carolina and Tennessee . No one of the States which we here class as " Border States " had , before the attack upon Sumter , passed ordinances of secession . The Border States may be divided into two groups  --  the eastern , made up of Delaware , Maryland , the District of Columbia , the Virginias , and North Carolina ; the western , of Kentucky , Tennessee , and Missouri . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave States , the whites have always . been in an overwhelming majority . These two States , together with - Oklahoma , make up the group Which is here stylifd the ble change in the proportion of negroes to whites in this section , although in the last ten years there seems to have been a very large negro emigration from other States into Illinois and Indiana . In the North Atlantic group , the negroes constituted numerically a more important part of the population in 1790 than they have ever done since . For nearly three-quarters of a century the proportion they bore to the entire population steadily declined , and in 1860 it was not half as great as it had been seventy years before . In this part of the country no such sudden increase of negro population followed emancipation as took place in the Northern Central section . From 1860 to 1890 there was no substantial change in the proportion of negroes to whites . In the last ten years the number of the former in New York and Pennsylvania , and in some of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the negroes are now relatively more numerous in this section than they have been at any preceding period for more than half a century . They do not even now , however , constitute so large a proportion of the inhabitants as they did in 1840 before the great rush of European immigration set in . The figures for the three Northern groups sb ow that so long as slavery lasted , the proportion of negroes to the total population of the free States grew less and less , and that since emancipation the tendency has been in the opposite direction . When we pass to the Border-State groups , we find that in each of them the relative numerical importance of the negro population increased for the first four decades ; that is , from 1790 to 1830 . During this period the increase of the white population of the Eastern Border States was but small . There was then a large white emigration from those States to the South , to the West , and to the Northwest . It was at that time that southern Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives of Virginia and Kentucky . The business of shipping Virginia and Kentucky slaves southward had not then attained the magnitude it afterwards reached . Since isao there has been a steady decline in the proportion of negroes to the total population of the Border States . The slight increase shown in the table in that proportion in the eastern Border States between 1870 and 1880 was doubtless due entirely to the defective enumeration in 1870 . From 1830 to 1860 the negro population of the border was depleted by the sale of slaves South . Between 1845 and 1860 an appreciable portion of the foreign immigrants to this country , then so numerous , found their way to the more northern of these States . It was at this time that there grew up a so-called " Limerick " in Baltimore and a great German city in St. Louis . Since the war the foreign-born population of these States has received constant accessions , while the Border-State negroes have moved ' in considerable numbers to the Northern States and in a less degree to the States further South . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Four of the six are in the group of Eastern Border States . In 1790 these four States contained more than two-thirds of the entire negro population of the country . The steady decline for nearly three-quarters of a century in the relative numbers of the negro population of these States proves how unnecessary in their climate negro slavery ever was . How different the history of the country would have been had no negro slaves ever been brought into them/ How unfortunate it was that the Ordinance of 1787 could not have been extended to the territory southwest of the Ohio and subsequently to Missouri . There can be no question that to-day the Border States would have been more wealthy and prosperous , and doubtless would have contained a larger population , if slavery had never been established in them . If they never had been slave States , their negro population at this time would probably be relatively little more numerous than is that of the North Atlantic States . As it is , the negro problem in all the Border States is steadily becoming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation the politicians of those States may for their own purposes now or hereafter stir up Substantially the same thing may be said as to the Southwestern group . Although the negro population of Arkansas has for many years increased faster than the white , it still numbers less than three-tenths of the whole . Since 1870 the proportion of negroes in the Southwestern group as a whole has steadily declined . The negroes now number little more than one-fifth of its entire population . It is only in the Southern group of States that the negroes are so numerous that they can be regarded by even the most prejudiced of sensible men as in any aspect a source of possible danger . For eighty years , from 1800 to 1880 , they steadily gained in numbers upon the whites . In the last-named year , out of every one thousand inhabitants of these States , five hundred and nineteen had African blood in their veins . So long as slavery continued , or the economic and industrial conditions resulting from slavery remained substantially unchanged , the whites became relatively less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Southwestern groups of States . This was not due to any greater rate of natural increase among the negroes of these States than among their white inhabitants , for probably the reverse was the case . In the country as a whole , the nevo'rateof natural increase is as great as that of the whites , but it is as great because , while it is less than that of the Southern , it is greater than that of the Northern whites . While slavery lasted , the failure of the superior race in the South and Southwestern groups to maintain its relative proportion of the population was due to the constant emigration from those States of the more active and enterprising of the non-slave-holding whites . Had slavery not been abolished , it is probable that the negroes would have continued to gain . The tide turned when manufacturing and mining industries began to spring up in the South on a large scale . Home employment for the surplus white population was thus created . The negroes now constitute a smaller proportion of the population of ' the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true not only of the group as a whole , but of five of the six States which compose it . It is significant that Mississippi , the single exception , is the very one of those States in which there has been least of that industrial development which we have in mind when we speak of the " New South . " A CENTURY OF THE EVENING POST . As merely to have lived through the Reign of Terror was achievement enough for Siey'es , so a newspaper , when asked what it has done in the course of a hundred years of continuous existence , might simply reply with the French abbe , " I have lived . " But a century of life for an institution means something different from what it does for a man . Dean Swift once broke out violently , as Sir Walter Scott relates , when some one spoke in his presence of a certain " fine old man . " " If the man you speak of , " cried he , " had either a mind or a body worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But a centenarian newspaper is not open to that reproach . The processes of decay which go on in the human organism ai ' age increases are , in an institution , continually made good by the processes of repair . Just as the individual withers but the world is more and more , so the successive editors of a daily journal pass away only to leave it flourishing in perpetual youth . Yet it is perhaps more strikingly in a newspaper than in any other form of collective activity persisting from generation to generation , that the power and impress of strong personality abide . Editors live in their successors , as ancestors do in their descendants , whether the latter will or no . The unconscious formation of a newspaper 's style is seize ( ' upon by Walter Bagehot , in his Physics and Politics , ' as an excellent illustration of the way in - Which a type is created . " A certain trade-mark , " ' he writes , " a curious and indefinable unity , settles on every newspaper : " How the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder of the London Times , who replied to the query why all the articles read as if written by one man , " Oh , there is always some one best contributor , and all the rest copy . " It is an honorable line of " best contributors " to which the Evening Post can point in the persons of its editors from 1801 down . There may have been more vivid personalities connected with the American press ; other names may suggest more of sound and fury ; but what other newspaper numbers , among those who have shaped its policy and wielded its leading pen , men whose names stand for so much of culture and power and fire and integrity as do those of William Coleman , William Leggett , William Cullen Bryant , Parke Godwin , John Bigelow , Carl Schurz , and Edwin L Godkin ? Of marked diversity of gifts , these editors of the Evening Post were one in devotion to the highest standards in journalism and in public life All of them helped to give to their newspaper a certain tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Bigelow in 1850 , " I can not forbear expressing the sincere delight with which I read your paper . Its politics have such a temper from literature that they fascinate as well as convince . " Bryant , of course , was the editor who most closely fixed , in the public mind , the association of the Evening Post with literature . It was as " The Man of Letters , " not the editor , that he was commemorated in its columns , after his death , by Edmund Clarence Stedman But there were other brave writers , both before and after that Agamemnon . Of the anti-slavery writing in the Evening Post in 1835-37 , done by William Leggett , an historian of the time says that it was a " really noble series of editorials " ; and Bryant himself paid tribute to the memory of his brother-editor , by writing of him after his untimely death ? " The words of fire that from his pen Were flung upon the fervid page , Still move , still shake the hearts of Men , Amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen of Mr. Godkin , which so lately ceased to adorn the pages of the Evening Post , what newspaper ever matched it for satire that read like a page of Swift 's , for Olympian. humor , for fearlessness and fervor , for clarity of moral perception , and for a broad acquaintance with the best that has been thought and clone in the world 's history , brought to bear upon the endless and apparently petty problems of the day which confront a writer for the day ? A man has mingled feelings , remarked Phillips Brooks , when he walks through a gallery of his ancestors Their fame is his , yet not his , unless , he reproduces and continues it . To its editorial ancestors the Evening Post paid on Saturday its just acknowledgments , joiningreverence to those who are dead with greetings to those who are still among the living , and ending with the devout hope , &cut; patribus , sit Deus nobis . OUSTING AN ITALIAN TAM-MANY . If ever the appeal to the ballot looked hopeless , it was in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated last week by a narrow majority will surprise not only general students of municipal problems , but the Italians themselves . Conditions had seemed too bad to be immediately edied . More than a year ago the ian Government was forced , by the accumulating proofs of corruption in Naples , to suspend - the municipal government and to place the city in the charge of a Royal Commission of Inquiry . The bulky report of this Commission , which was recently published , gives what should for the future remain a veritable encyclopedia of municipal pathology . The situation was not one to encourage reformers Unscrupulous political leaders had been allowed to grow into great power , because they were necessary , or made themselves appear so , to the success of the national parties . The infamous Casale and Summonte may have seemed as necessary to Giolitti 's leadership as Croker seemed indispensable to Mr. Bryan 's canvass . The Commission of Inquiry followed the matter further , and found that the voting-lists were scandalously stuffed , and that , short of a popular uprising , the candidates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city was found to be in frightful disorder . In many departments no pretence of adequate bookkeeping had been made , and the heads were only able to say that the money had been spent in some unexplained fashion for the good of the city . Wherever the Commission followed the city 's transactions with holders of franchises , or its conduct of public utilities , it found evidences of wastefulness and of corruption . Light , Water , and traction companies paid tribute to the machine ; the Department of Sanitation showed the same taint . There was no doubt about the disease ; the question was as to the cure . To many it was discouraging that the Commission made no positive recommendations . Conservative editors deplored the fact that the prosecutions which must follow the exposure could be undertaken only after considerable delays . Many feared that the decision to hold a city election in November , and to restore the control to a demoralized people , was at least premature , and might turn out to be disastrous . There were , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city had been so completely sapped that the power of reaction was lost . If the political abuses of Naples are of the kind whichwe know in most of our American cities , the relation of the machine to the average citizen is of a sort not only to despoil , but to humiliate . Imagine a condition of things where one may not discharge a Camorrist servant without incurring threats and personal peril ; where the agents of the " High " Camorra may demand to inspect your books , so that you may be mulcted intelligently on the basis of your profits . A terrorism which in the worst days of Tammany was chiefly directed against the vicious , the miserable , and the poor , has been in Naples systematically employed against the well-to-do ; so that to arouse civic courage to revolt against extortion was vastly more difficult in Naples than it was in New York . Believing that the whole community was honeycombed by the system or blackmailing , many of the North Italian journals feared that a great mistake had been made in appealing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , to keep the city under the Commission until the voting-lists had been thoroughly revised , the bosses tried and punished , and a better public spirit aroused . From this prudent , if rather timid , opinion the Committee dissented utterly , and , whether moved by questions of ministerial expediency or by a sole regard for the matter in hand , held to the decision that the city must settle its own political future  --  and promptly . The result will show to doubters that - it is unwise to think too meanly of the people . The victory over the Camorra , it should be noted , was won . in the normal way , by a non-partisan coalition which had frankly no other aim than to " destroy an historic organization . " To this end , parties as different as Socialists and Monarchists , as Catholics who had long abstained from political activity and the members of the influential Merchants ' Association , who had long suffered from the blackmail system , all united . Against this improvised movement the most desperate efforts of the bosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have fought longest against our Tammany will be freest to admit . Such a victory gives hope to all who are working for decent civic housekeeping . Even Philadelphia need not despair of shaking off her present unenviable distinction of being the worst governed of civilized cities .
