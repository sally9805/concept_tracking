txt Following a secret investigation covering six months the InterState Commerce Commission began to-day its public inquiry into the relations of private car companies and railroad companies ' and the effect on trade . The movement to investigate the situation was originally begun by the National League of Commission Merchants at Louisville a year ago . Since then It is said that evidence has accumulated to show that the transportation facilities of the country are almost within the control of the private car corporations . It is further alleged that these abuses have created monopolies of several staple commodities . As the inquiry advances it is declared that it will be shown that the making of rates for packing house products , for produce , and dairy products , is controlled by the companies who compel the railroads to use their cars . It is asserted that the entire refrigerator service is in a trust . The companies not only insist upon exclusive contracts , but also demand mileage from the railroads and thereby gain annual returns of 20 to 25 per cent . on the investments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car lines . BIG MEN PACE : FIGHT . W. Midgley , said to be in the employ of such men as J. Pierpont Morgan , James J. Hill , and E. H. Harriman , was the principal witness at the morning session . He declared the system of private ownership of cars " had the railroad companies firmly in its grasp " and that it was " one of the greatest powers ever known . " Counsel for the Interstate Commerce Commission referred to Mr. A/idg-ley 's private meetings with various railroad Presidents , and asked him what position he held that he was able to get such close attention . There is no need for me to say with whom I am identified , " he said , smiling . " I can only say that I am my own boss . There is no one above me . I represent all of the companies , and therefore there is no way to get me . ' I have introduced more reforms and systems of economy into the railroad business in America than any other man living . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After testifying that the packing companies , particularly Armour &; Co. , and other companies owning private-car sys-tems , invoked hardships upon the railroad companies as well as the shippers , Mr. i Midgley was interrupted by Attorney Marchand . " Now , you are ? more familiar with the system complained of than any one else , " said Mr. Marchand . " What , in your opinion , offers a solution ? " " My solution , " replied the witness , " is the per diem system . Put refrigerator cars on the per diem basis of 50 cents a day for so much weight , stock cars 30 cents a day , and other cars 20 cents a day . " I can state authoritatively there is a New York company backed with aa0,000,000 ready to buy these cars , and that would be a solution . The packers would then pay the same rate for cars as any other shipper . " " Would the private car companies be willing to give up their cars ? " Mr. Midg- , ley was asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodity which their - cars carry . It is the most profitable part of their business . " " How does the private ownership of car system effect the market ? " HOW MARKETS ARE MADE . " The companies owning the cars which have the monopoly on any one commodity make the markets . It is wonderful the influence they have . The car company which now controls the price of beef is rapidly getting within its grasp the dairy trade . " " How does the system affect the consumer ? " " Everybody must eat meat , or everybody does , " replied Mr. Midgley . " For that matter , rates may go down and prices of beef go up . Whether the freight rates go up or down prices of beef go up . " Commissioner Prouty then asked the witness a few questions . " Why could n't other companies be organized and build cars and go into competition and thereby rob the system of bad features ? " inquired the Commissioner . " Competition , some people say , will straighten such things out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e:zplained , " for the very simple reason that these companies have already the monopoly . The railroad companies are under contract to handle certain commodities only in the refrigerator cars of the big packing companies . Now , for instance , if the railroad company should break this contract and handle an independent company 's iced cars , the big company having the monopoly would blacklist that particular railroad . WHAT BRINGS THEM IN LINE . " If Amour &; Co. and the Standard Oil Company should take their patronage front any one railroad line there would be a big hole in the earnings of that railroad I have seen this system tried , and successfully , too . " It 's all a question of traffic , " continued the witness , " and I do not mean to reflect in any way upon the traffic managers of our railways . Any traffic manager - who ' does not get business ' will lose his position . He simply has to get it , and he can get it only by meeting the terms made for , him by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior men , and as soon as a young road , struggling , starving for business , sees fit to dicker with these shipping combinations , competing roads must follow their lead . " . Mr. Midgley told how when the mileage rate had been reduced to half a cent and a further reduction was in prospect , the representatives of the Standard Oil Company asked for a conference , which took place at the company 's New York offices . " One of the Standard officers named Tilford , I think , remarked that there was always a weak sister ' in any crowd , " said the witness . " ? Now we 'll proceed to discover the weak sister , ' he said , ' and make all our shipments over her road at threequarters of a cent per car per mile . ' One of the railway Presidents at the conference then said that if the Standard proposed to deal-that way the railroads , who were largo buyers of oil , would turn about and buy their oil elsewhere . STANDARD OIL 'S THREAT . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' We own all the oil , and would like to see you do it . Good day , gentlemen , ' whereupon he put the conference ' out of the room . " " When did you go into this movement against the private car companies , and - who hired you to do it ? " inquired Attorney Marchand of the witness . " I took an interest in this matter first at the request of H. H. Porter , " said Mr. Midgley . " That was several years ago . At that time the railroad companies had an investment of millions of dollars in refrigerator cars and stock cars that were paying them scarcely any profits . I was implored by the Presidents of the railroad companies to do something for them if I could , and to introduce other systems of economy . " The principal witness in the afternoon was J. Ogden Armour , but he proved reluctant in answering questions . Instead he referred the investigators to George Robbins , Vice President of the Armour Car Line . Mr. Robbins was also unwilling to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line had contracts with the Michigan Central Railroad Company and the Pare Marquette Railway Company , but that if any rate lower than the tariff rate was made to those companies it was because of some concessions in the service . He insisted that preference was shown to no railroad .
