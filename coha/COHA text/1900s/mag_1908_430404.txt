 | I AM an American drummer . I live my life in the midst of war ? in the thick of the struggle of competitive business . The ruling class of the medieval nation hired soldiers to wrest property and power from the ruling class of a neighbor nation . For the same purpose individual noble contended with individual noble . In the conflict much blood was spilled . But the world has advanced ? the transfer of power from nation to nation , from individual to individual , goes on today , but , in the main , it is effected by subtler means than by the clash of arms . I am It , today ? I am the soldier of the bygone age , the heroic figure of the hour . Mr. Digbv , capitalist , hires me to extend the market for his " Arcadian " shoes . Mr. Burrington , capitalist , hires Jinn Brown to do the same for his " Stepover " shoes . Jim 's and my objective point is Mr. Dealer . Separately we talk the goods to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality and quote prices , the " lowest on earth , " intermingling with all a run of delicate flattery that we ever carry as one of our most effective weapons . If Jim wins Mr. Dealer , I lose . Mr. Digby 's shoes never reach the public of Mr. Dealer 's town . Mr. Burrington has extended his market , enlarged his profits and increased his power . And if all of Mr. Digby 's drummers  | do no better than I , Mr. Digby will find himself eliminated from the strife of competitive industry . He will be down and out . Do n't you believe me ? I make or break Mr. Digby . I am It ? the American drummer . I know it , too . That 's why I am beginning to carry myself with unshakable dignity . That accounts for the self-respect Digby 's son wonders at . Digby 's son is a Harvard graduate -- I had a hand in making him one . Digby 's on has a head full of fantastic notions handed over to him from the books by the pedagogs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he came to he so fortunate or unfortunate as to " connect " with those notions . I can tell him . A full decade before Digby 's son was horn Digby made hoots. made them by hand in a little shop that eventually became his own . He made good boots and he trained the men that worked for him to make good hoots . The people learned to like those boots and they sold well in a local way . Then , about the time Digby 's son was born T came into his life . I put strange ideas into his head . The suggestion that Digby 's shoes could be sold outside of the county ? why , it fairly staggered him ! But Digby hired me as a salesman and I went at it . Soon I had his " Arcadian " shoes advertised in a half dozen neighboring towns and 1 went out and sold them to the merchants of those towns . And the business grew until it covered the State . And it continued to grow until today " Arcadian " shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionized Digby and his business . His original idea was to build up by the slow process of earnest inlit ideal labor a good local business and to place himself in comfortable circumstances . His sons , should he have any , should learn to work with him in the shop and eventually he should leave the business for them to carry on . But my salesmanship and the revelation of what a sales campaign could do gave this idea a solar plexus . Dishy was pulled from his bench one day and established in his office as manager . " Henceforth , " said I to him , going to be ton busy making money to work . " Since then the plant has been enlarged a number of times and there have been yearly additions of complicated machinery . Now Digby had dreamed of laving by a few thousands to meet a rainy day , but instead of realizing his little dream he had become worth over three-quarters of a million . And with a part of this fortune , made from such a vulgar thing as shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive and exclusive notions that the college uttered for sale . If it had n't been for that large market my salesmanship uncovered and helped to win , Digby 's son today would in all probability be seated , hammer in hand , in a little shop helping his father repair old shoes . Quite probably you do n't understand me ? this modern American drummer . Honest . do you think me a loquacious asp with a clash of the libertine in me ? If you do you 're all wrong . I am not loquacious and I am not a libertine , today . I am too dead in earnest to be either . The stress of relentless competition holds me together , forces me to keep on the right side of the traces . Fifteen years ago I might have been a man who looked often in the cup ? even a man of decidedly lax morals . For it must be admitted that the life of the road , itself , did not tend to encourage in me a rigid adherence to the moral cedes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i was often subjected to peculiar temptations . I was beyond the reach of those restraining influences that family , friends and neighbors exert upon ( me . . And it was to be anticipated that 1 ryonld overstep the bounds of propriety at least occasionally . lint for the past jell or fifteen years I have found the purist in me talking more insistently every day . " I do not smoke , chew or drink "  - -  I hear salesmen say this very often ? ' and I mean it when I say that I am strictly decent . I am a married man and I am loyal to my family . I regard vices as encumbrances in my business . " I am quite sure it is true that " good fellows " of the ultra type -- the men whose days and nights are marked by excesses of some sort or other are slowly  | but surely being eliminated from the drummer world . There are two reasons for this process of elimination . These reasons may be found , first , in the changing attitude of the dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changing attitude of the house itself toward its representative . As to the first reason . In the old days the dealer or merchant was the victim of the " treating " habit . Only yesterday I heard a drummer tell a story much like this : " When I first started on the road I had to be a spender , a ' good fellow ' with my prospective buyer . The other drummer was and I had to he or quit the road . This prospective buyer , my dealer , expected me to warm hind up . I had to buy the drinks freely . And with a number of my biggest buyers it was necessary for me to go out on a regulation spree before I could write an order . " But that 's all changed today . Why , I have to be careful now even about offering a cigar to a ' prospect ' for fear 1 may offend him . f offered a cigar the other day to a man whom I know tip be a smoker and instantly his attitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar with a curt , No , thank you . Before I left he reluctantly gave his reasons for so doing . ' " When I buy goods , ' he said , I want to buy the very best 1 can for the money . And I want to make my decision as to the line I am to carry feeling perfectly free from the slightest sense of obligation to any man . And this slight sense of obligation I should feel toward you if I smoked your cigar even though I knew on sober second thought that you were n't paying for the cigar , nor was your house . For it has occurred to me that finally the dealer pays the entertainment bill . ' " As the dealer educates himself on the general subject of trade relations , he looks more and more with impatience upon the salesman who , no matter how engaging his personality may be , obtrudes the fact that he is a " good fellow . " For the instinct of the intelligent buyer today is to get down to bed rock as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all kinds and to discuss two things ? quality and price . Such men , although they may accept entertainment from salesmen , do not desire it . They merely tolerate it . Now , f am not saying that the successful drummer of today is merely the in personal mouthpiece of the house . Personality counts tremendously , but it gets in its work in a different manner than it did ti f tee n years ago . The dealer during his leisure moments will persistently ask questions of the drummer that evince the keenest appetite for the business and political gossip of the hour . How are Smith . Jones and Miller , dealers in three neighboring towns , getting along ? Do you think they sell loo close ? Is the 2 cent passenger rate law a good thing ? I has n't this law been responsible for the recent advance in our freight rates ? What do you think of the panic ? What caused it ? ' Was it the desire on the part of the Wall street financiers to discredit Roosevelt 's administration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations ? Is business resuming ? Where ? What do you think of the prices of farm products ? Will hogs get back where they were before the money scare ? Such are the inquiries the drummer meets today among buyers in metropolis and at cross-roads corners . The drummer has his finger on the trade pulse of the nation . And the dealer looks to him for information as to the condition . Behold the drummer , then , in a new role . lie is no longer entertainer . Sharply he observes the facts around him . He studies them in order that he may give the plausible answer . And then he steps forth confidently as an educator of the tradesmen of the country . Now , as to the second reason for the changing character of the drummer . There is a growing reluctance on the part of the house . particularly of the large business institution , to make allowance for that one-time prominent item of expense -- entertainment . In their passion for economy in the production and marketing of their article not a few houses already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " purchasing the goodwill of the customer . " The expense of treating , of all the evidences of " good fellowship , " is thereby thrown upon the drum-  | mer . And this individual , so long noted for his far-flouted generosity , begins to retrench . He cuts off all the costly excesses ? one by one they go until he is left very much like the mass of men . You see , it pays him to walk the strait and narrow path . And he tries it . And the house applauds him in the effort . For it believes that only along this line can he grow in efficiency from year to year . No , the man on the road is not a devotee of Folly . He is the strenuous laborer in the business world of today . Whether his mission be as worthy or not , he strives with all the zeal of a fanatical social and political reformer to attain his end . That end , the conquest of territory for his house , enlists his continuously concentrated efforts . Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices cunningly implanted by his competitors and sowing the seeds of confidence in the line of his house . Or it is as if his competitor were an enemy in war and he were constantly watching that enemy 's defenses to discover a weak point ; and when that weak point appears he hurries on to the ground for an attack . For the drummer of today is. first of all , be it remembered , a fighter : he never admits defeat . Repulsed today , he swings into the struggle tomorrow with conviction unshaken . He is so mastered thru and thru by the passion for ultimate victory that no series of temporary reverses may dampen hig ardor . And these victories of this modern man of exploits , what do they mean ? They mean that back there in the factories and workshops dominated by his house the wheels of industry will start to exultant whirling , and thousands of men will find employment . Oh , yes . I must n't forget , and women and children , too . For the drummer 's vigilance of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may be thinking of the " traveling man " in George Ade 's " The County Chairman . " But do n't you believe Ade . That " traveling man " in actual life would n't last as long as a wreath of cigar smoke in a whirlwind . He is n't real . My friends sometimes laughingly refer to me as a pedler . But I am not a pedler . I tell you ? and I want you to remember it ? that I am put on the road to fight for territory , to win territory and to hold it . The pedler concentrates himself on the deal at hand . The future may go hang . He is after just one thing . - . sell his article to the interested part : now and at the biggest possible profit . Tomorrow he will move on . Today he will grossly misrepresent , and tomorrow , of necessity , he will seek a new market He holds tenaciously to a perversion of that ancient adage , " A bird in the hand is worth two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social function I am seen to be an evolved pedler . Two parallel streaks of steel glimmering in the sun and crisscrossing the entire country are responsible for the evolution . Rig markets were made accessible by steam to thousands of little shops . Markets overlapped . Relentlescompetition ensued , marked by the wholesale slaughter of the incompetent and by the growth of the small to the large institution . And in this process the pedler , nomad of bargain and dicker , composite buyer and seller , was eliminated , and in his place appeared that modern specialist , the drummer , whose function was to sell continuously in a defined area . It must be admitted , however , that pedler ethics have not yet been wholly eliminated from the world of the traveling salesman . Only recently I had an opportunity to study a drummer of the " pedler " type . He was an elderly man , with gray hairs , and he had sold goods on the road for thirty years . During my chat with him he complained that business was not what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given volume of business a year , he was making much less money for his firm than in the early clays . Profits were all shot to pieces today . This man did n't know what a price list was . He confessed that he quoted a dozen different figures on the same product for a dozen different dealers : that he " dickered " with his prospect , set his price high and got all he could get out of his man . Sometimes it was necessary to make big concessions and sometimes only trifling ones . Now , it is quite probable that the av-  | erage progressive , aggressive dealer is n't wasting much of his valuable time on this fellow . For , first of all , the modern dealer demands from the salesman precision of statement and accuracy of information . And the modern drummer is aware of this demand , and in response to it he hands over at the opportune time the modern price list , a schedule carefully built up on a basis of actual cost . Such and such are our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place , of course , after he has brought into play all the forces of his personality to convince his " prospect " that his stuff has the quality for the money . And such the price remains , and such the discounts . There may be only very minor concessions , if any at all . Yes , it is true . We drummers are getting to be more and more " on the square " with buyers , so far as putting them on a basis of price equality is concerned . But now do n't you get maudlinly sentimental and go to talking about the moral and spiritual influences of the clay ; for these have little , if anything , to do with the modern drummer 's " squareness . " if you 're hunting for causes , l 'll remind you of those parallel streaks of glimering steel that tie communities together today . How much these are really back of , anyway ! The ideal community for the drummer to enter is the community of liberal capacity to consume . And if he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would result in crippling the purchasing power of the great masses of people . If he sells in the rural community he rejoices to see high prices for farm products . And if his " line " enters the industrial center , he is glad to note a generally high wage scale and the accompanying high standard of living . Despite this latter fact , however , one meets among men of the road not a few bitter antagonists of trades unionism . But the attitude of such is easy to understand when the fact is made clear that the drummer 's business and social associates are often men belonging to the employing class , or that the drummer may be a stockholder in the institution he represents , or may hope to become some day a direct employer of labor . Unconsciously , but irresistibly , the drummer is drawn to a close study of the markets . And you will be surprised at the amount of information he has gathered on this subject . A really imposing array of facts he can marshal relative to conditions in the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't expect to sell heavily this year because a bank failure cleaned the farmers about that place out of $120,000 . Or a prolonged strike in the iron foundries at Westphalia , Pa. , will curtail his sales there this spring . Trade is phenomenal at Jackson , Ill. , because the price of corn is high , and Jackson farmers produce heavily for the market . At Wiltsburg , Mich. , on the contrary , business is practicaly at a standstill , because Wiltsburg farmers go in heavy on hogs , and hogs have been " off " all winter . Too much of that high-priced corn had to be imported into the community . Bad floods at Wolcottville , lnd. , have hurt the wheat , and it just happens that the wheat acreage is heavy there this year . Thus the facts assemble in the mind of the traveling salesman . And with this intimate knowledge of market conditions the drummer army is often able to do valuable work toward warding off those periodically threatening strokes of industrial paralysis . Imagine , for instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer and merchant world during the past winter . Following the panic fear pervaded the minds of middlemen everywhere . But the thousands of drummer got in their work . Insistently they delivered the advice , " Buy , buy now . " And they fought fear with a counter fear . " Buy now , " they declared , " for you will want to sell later . And if you fellows hang off now you wo n't be able to get your stuff when you want it . " And the middlemen bought , cautiously , but they bought . And their buying kept open the shops that put out the finished product , and these in turn opened the accessory institutions . For the dealer and merchant feared , what the drummer predicted , that with the breaking up of winter , the consumer , able or compelled to buy , would demand the product , and with the sudden rush of  | orders from middleman to factory and from factory on thru the line of accessories , he would become the victim of an inevitable delay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in return for all this service to the captains of industry drummers are comparatively well paid . I myself know several salesmen representing smaller houses whose salaries nearly equal those of the heads of the institutions . It may be stated as a general truth that the drummer is best paid in those lines where competition is keenest , where salesmanship enters as a factor of great importance , and that the man on the road representing a house that has a practical monopoly in his territory travels on a much smaller salary . Not long ago I met a young fellow who sold " fancy " canned meats , and who in the course of a year swept over a tremendous stretch of territory . He appeared to me from the conversation I had with him to be a faithful and reliable worker , but an individual wholly incapable of developing anything like brilliant salesmanship . This young man spoke frankly with me . " My salary is not large , " he said , " but I like the road . I want to know what this country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am simply an order taker for my house , which in my line has no real competition . I make the calls I am expected to make and the demand for the goods does the rest . It 's a simple matter of making calls ? that 's all there is to it . " But while it may be true that the general tendency in the business world is inevitably toward ultimate monopoly , competition reigns supreme in the majority of the industries , and the selling expense , the price paid for winning and holding a market , is tremendous . This fact was made the subject of comment the other day by a mild-mannered man who rode into Chicago with me . " You drummers , the whole vast army of you , " he said , smiling pleasantly , " arc a big load on the consumers of the nation . You are ? pardon me , sir , but you are ? parasites . You render society no service ; you are not producers of real value . And yet comparatively you are generously paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , bristling up , in self-defense , " and whether we are a load on society or not , we are indispensable . " " You work , " he retorted ; " truly , you work hard ? in the effort to do up the other fellow . And your work is indispensable ? to your house , but not to the public in general . " My companion paused dreamily for a moment , and then continued : " Of course , I understand that as long as competition survives you drummers are a necessity . But you will have to go , for competition is surely doomed . Every clay the trust renders your job less secure . For the trust , when it comes , will not tolerate economic waste , and the selling- expense will he cut to the minimum . " " But the trust , " I burst out with fervor , " is an enemy of the people . The country will be worse off with it and without us than without it and with us . For the trust , possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a leveling effect . " " That may all be true , " he replied in his quiet , dogmatic tone , " but the fact remains that the trust , thru the economy of production on a large scale and thru the elimination of the wastes of advertising and selling wars , could furnish us goods at a lower figure than your small competing firms , if it wanted to . " At present the trust 's only service to society , I 'll admit , is to demonstrate the superiority of a method . But evolution will carry it eventually out of the control of irresponsible individuals . "
