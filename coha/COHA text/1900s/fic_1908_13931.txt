The interior of a blacksmith shop . On the right of the stage toward the center there is a forge . On the left stands a loft , from which are hanging dried cornstalks , hay , and the yellow ears of cattlecorn . Toward the rear is a wide double door , closed when the curtain rises . Through this door  --  when later it is opened  --  is visible a New England landscape in the late springtime : a distant wood ; stone walls , high elms , a wellsweep ; and , in the near foreground , a ploughed field , from which the green shoots of early corn are just appearing . The blackened walls of the shop are covered with a miscellaneous collection of old iron , horseshoes , and cart-wheels , the usual appurtenances of a smithy . In the right-hand corner , however , is an array of things quite out of keeping with the shop proper : musical instruments , puppets , tall clocks , and fantastical junk . Conspicuous amongst these articles is a large standing mirror , framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embroidered with peaked caps and crescent moons . Just before the scene opens , a hammer is heard ringing briskly upon steel . As the curtain rises there is discovered , standing at the anvil in the flickering light of a bright flame from the forge , a woman  --  powerful , ruddy , proud with a certain masterful beauty , white-haired ( as though prematurely ) , bare-armed to the elbows , clad in a dark skirt ( above her ankles ) , a loose blouse , open at the throat ; a leathern apron and a workman 's cap . The woman is Goody Rick-BY . On the anvil she is shaping a piece of iron . Beside her stands a framework of iron formed like the ribs and backbone of a man . For a few moments she continues to ply her hammer , amid a shower of sparks , till suddenly the flame on the forge dies down . RICKBY Dickon ! More flame . A VOICE . ( Above her . ) Yea , Goody . ( The flame in the forge spurts up high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce . DICKON ( At her side . ) Votre pardon , madame . ( The flame subsides . ) Is that better ? RICKBY That will do . ( With her tongs , she thrusts the iron into the flame ; it turns white-hot . ) Quick work ; nothing like brimstone for the smithy trade . ( At the anvil , she begins to weld the iron rib onto the framework . ) There , my beauty ! We 'll make a stout set of ribs for you . I 'll see to it this year that I have a seareerow can outstand all the nor'easters that blow . I 've no notion to lose my corn-crop this summer . ( Outside , the faint cawings of crows are heard . Putting down her tongs and hammer , Goody Rickby strides to the double door , and flinging it wide open , lets in the gray light of dawn . She looks out over the fields and shakes her fist . ) So ye 're up before me and the sun , are ye ? ( Squinting against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aha ! One for sorrow , Two for mirth  --  Good ! This time we 'll have the laugh on our side . ( She returns to the forge , where again the fire has died out . ) Dickon ! Fire ! Come , come , where be thy wits ? DICKON ( Sleepily from the forge . ) ' T is early , dame . p. 4 RICKBY The more need  --  ( Takes up her tongs . ) DICKON ( Screams . ) Ow ! RICKBY Ha ! Have I got thee ? ( From the blackness of the forge she pulls out with her tongs , by the right ear , the figure of a devil , horned and tailed . In general aspect , though he resembles a mediaval familiar demon , yet the suggestions of a goatish beard , a shrewdly humorous smile , and ( when he speaks ) the slightest of nasal drawls , remotely simulate a species of Yankee rustic . GOODY RICKBY substitutes her fingers for the tong . ) Now , Dickon ! DICKON Deus ! I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , sweet Goody ? RICKBY The bellows ! DICKON ( Going slowly to the forge . ) Why , ' t is hardly dawn yet . Honest folks are still abed . It makes a long day . RICKBY ( Working while DICKON plies the bellows . ) Aye , for your black pets , the crows , to work in . That 's why we must be at it early . You heard ' em . We must have this scarecrow of ours out in the field at his post before sunrise . Here , I 've made the frame strong , so as to stand the weather ; you must make the body lifelike so as to fool the crows . This year , we must make ' em think it 's a real human crittur. p. 5 DICKON To fool the philosophers is my specialty , but the crows  --  hm ! RICKBY Pooh ! That staggers thee ! DICKON Madame Rickby , prod not the quick of my genius . I am Phidias , I am Raphael , I am the Lord God !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yonder broom-stick . RICKBY ( Fetching him a broom from the corner . ) Good boy ! DICKON ( Straddling the handle . ) Ha , ha ! gee up ! my Salem mare . ( Then , pseudo-philosophically . ) A broomstick  --  that 's for imagination ! ( He begins to construct the scarecrow , while GOODY RICKBY , assisting , brings the constructive parts from various nooks and corners . ) We are all pretty artists , to be sure , Bessie . Phidias , he sculptures the gods ; Raphael , he paints the angels ; the Lord God , he creates Adam ; and Dickon !  --  fetch me the poker  --  aha ! Dickon ! What doth Dickon ? He nullifies ' em all ; he endows the Scarecrow ! A poker : here 's his conscience . There 's two fine legs to walk on ,  --  imagination and conscience . Yonder flails now ! The ideal  --  the beau idal , dame  --  that 's what we artists seek . The apotheosis of scarecrows ! And pray , what 's a scarecrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let there be candles ! " quoth the Lord God , sitting in the dark . " Let there be candle-extinguishers , " saith Dickon . " I am made in the image of my maker , " quoth Adam . " Look at yourself in the glass , " saith Goodman Scarecrow . ( Taking two implements from GOODY RICKBY . ) Fine ! fine ! here are flails  --  one for wit , t ' other for satire . Sapristi ! with two such arms , my lad , how thou wilt work thy way in the world ! p. 6 RICKBY You talk as if you were making a real mortal , Dickon . DICKON To fool a crow , Goody , I must fashion a crittur that will first deceive a man . RICKBY He 'll scarce do that without a head . ( Pointing to the loft . ) What think ye of yonder Jack-o ' - lan- tern ? ' T was made last Hallowe'en . DICKON Rare , my Psyche ! We shall collaborate . Here ! ( Running up the ladder , he tosses down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Then rummaging forth an armful of cornstalks , ears , tassels , dried squashes , gourds , beets , etc. , he descends and throws them in a heap on the floor . ) Whist ! ( As he drops them . ) Gourd , carrot , turnip , beet :  --  the anatomy . RICKBY ( Placing the pumpkin on the shoulders . ) Look ! DICKON O Johannes Baptista ! What wouldst thou have given for such a head ! I helped Salome to cut his off , dame , and it looked not half so appetizing on her charger . Tut ! Copernicus wore once such a pumpkin , but it is rotten . Look at his golden smile ! Hail , Phoebus Apollo ! RICKBY ' T is the finest scarecrow in town . DICKON Nay , poor soul , ' t is but a skeleton yet . He must have a man 's heart in him . ( Picking a big red beet from among the cornstalks , he places it under the left side of the ribs . ) Hush ! Dost thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! DICKON Now for the lungs of him . ( Snatching a small pair of bellows from a peg on the wall . ) That 's for eloquence ! He 'll preach the black knaves a sermon on theft . And now  --  ( Here , with GOODY RICKBY 'S help , he stuffs the framework with the gourds , corn , etc. , from the loft , weaving the husks about the legs and arms . ) Here goes for digestion and inherited instincts ! More corn , Goody . Now he 'll fight for his own flesh and blood ! RICKBY ( Laughing . ) Dickon . I am proud of thee . DICKON Wait till you see his peruke . ( Seizing a feather duster made of crow 's feathers . ) Voici ! Scalps of the enemy ! ( Pulling them apart , he arranges the feathers on the pumpkin , like a gentleman 's wig . ) A rare conqueror ! RICKBY Oh , you beauty ! DICKON And now a bit of comfort for dark days and stormy nights . ( Taking a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe , which he puts into the scarecrow 's mouth . ) So ! There , Goody ! I tell thee , with yonder brand-new coat and breeches of mine  --  those there in my cupboard !  --  we 'll make him a lad to be proud of . ( Taking the clothes , which GOODY RICKBY brings  --  a pair of fine scarlet breeches and a gold-embroidered coat with ruffles of lace  --  he puts them upon the scarecrow . Then , eying it like a connoisseur , makes a few finishing touches . ) Why , dame , he 'll be a son to thee . p. 8 RICKBY A son ? Aye , if I had but a son ! DICKON Why , here you have him . ( To the scarecrow . ) Thou wilt scare the crows off thy mother 's cornfield  --  wo n't my pretty ? And send ' em all over t' other side the wall to her dear neighbors , the Justice Gilead Merton 's . RICKBY Justice Merton ! Nay , if they 'd only peek his eyes out , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Justice was a dear friend of " Blacksmith Bess . " RICKBY Aye , " Blacksmith Bess " ! If I had n't had a good stout arm when he cast me off with the babe , I might have starved for all his worship cared . DICKON True , Bessie ; ' t was a scurvy trick he played on thee  --  and on me , that took such pains to bring you together  --  to steal a young maid 's heart  --  RICKBY And then toss it away like a bad penny to the gutter ! And the child  --  to die ! ( Lifting her hammer in rage . ) Ha ! If I could get the worshipful Justice Gilead into my power again  --  ( She drops the hammer sullenly on the anvil . ) But no ! I shall beat my life away on this anvil , whilst my justice clinks his gold , and drinks his port to a fat old age . Justice ! Ha  --  justice of God ! p. 9 DICKON Whist , dame ! Talk of angels and hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside a girl 's figure approaching . ) His niece  --  Rachel Merton ! What can she want so early ? Nay , I mind me ; ' t is the mirror . She 's a maid after our own hearts , boy ,  --  no Sabbath-go-to-meeting airs about her ! She hath read the books of the magi from cover to cover , and paid me good guineas for ' em , though her uncle knows naught o n't . Besides , she 's in love , Dickon . DICKON ( Indicating the scarecrow . ) Ah ? With him ? Is it a rendezvous ? RICKBY ( With a laugh . ) Pff ! Begone ! DICKON ( Shakes his finger at the scarecrow . ) Thou naughty rogue ! ( Then , still smiling slyly , with his head placed confidentially next to the scarecrow 's ear , as if whispering , and with his hand pointing to the maiden outside , DICKON fades away into air . RACHEL enters , nervous and hesitant . GOODY RICKBY makes her a curtsy , which she acknowledges by a nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so early ! I hope your uncle , our worshipful Justice , is not ill ? p. 10 RACHEL No , my uncle is quite well . The early morning suits me best for a walk . You are  --  quite alone ? RICKBY Quite alone , mistress . ( Bitterly . ) Oh , folks do n't call on Goody Rickby  --  except on business . RACHEL ( Absently , looking round in the dim shop . ) Yes  --  you must be busy . Is it  --  is it here ? RICKBY You mean the  --  RACHEL ( Starting back , with a cry . ) Ah ! who 's that ? RICKBY ( Chuckling . ) Fear not , mistress ; ' t is nothing but a scarecrow . I 'm going to put him in my cornfield yonder . The crows are so pesky this year . RACHEL ( Draws her skirts away with a shiver . ) How loathsome ! RICKBY ( Vastly pleased . ) He 'll do . RACHEL Ah , here !  --  This is the mirror ? RICKBY Yea , mistress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I would n't sell it to most comers , but seeing how you and Master Talbot  --  RACHEL Yes ; that will do . p. 11 RICKBY You see , if the town folks guessed what it was , well  --  You 've heard tell of the gibbets on Salem Hill ? There 's not many in New England like you , Mistress Rachel . You know enough to approve some miracles  --  outside the Scriptures . RACHEL You are quite sure the glass will do all you say ? It  --  never fails ? RICKBY Ah , now , mistress , how could it ? ' T is the glass of truth  --  ( insinuatingly )  --  the glass of true lovers . It shows folks just as they are ; no shams , no varnish . If a wolf should dress himself in a white sheep 's wool , this glass would reflect the black beast inside it . RACHEL ( With awe . ) The black beast ! But what of the sins of the soul , Goody ? Vanity , hypocrisy , and  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you , my young lady . If it doth not as I say , bring it back and get your money again . Oh , trust me , sweeting , an old dame hath eyes in her heart yet . If your lover be false , this glass shall pluck his fine feathers ! RACHEL ( With aloofness . ) ' T is no question of that . I wish the glass to  --  to amuse me . RICKBY ( Laughing . ) Why , then , try it on some of your neighbors. p. 12 RACHEL You ask a large price for it . RICKBY ( Shrugs . ) I run risks . Besides , where will you get another ? RACHEL That is true . Here , I will buy it . That is the sum you mentioned , I believe ? ( She hands a purse to GOODY RICKBY , who opens it and counts over some coin . ) RICKBY Let see ; let see . RACHEL Well ? RICKBY Good : ' t is good . Folks call me a witch , mistress . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a justice 's gold . The glass is yours  --  with my blessing . RACHEL Spare yourself that , dame . But the glass : how am I to get it ? How will you send it to me  --  quietly ? RICKBY Trust me for that . I 've a willing lad that helps me with such errands ; a neighbor o ' mine . ( Calls . ) Ebenezer ! RACHEL ( Startled . ) What ! is he here ? RICKBY In the hayloft . The boy 's an orphan ; he sleeps there o ' times . Ebenezer ! ( A raw , disheveled country boy appears in the loft , slides down the ladder , and shuffles up sleepily. ) p. 13 DICKON Evenin ' . RACHEL ( Drawing GOODY RICKBY aside . ) You understand ; I desire no comment about this purchase . RICKBY Nor I , mistress , be sure . RACHEL Is he  --  ? RICKBY ( Tapping her forehead significantly . ) Trust his wits who hath no wit ; he 's mum . RACHEL Oh ! DICKON ( Gaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job this morning is to bear yonder glass to the house of Justice Merton  --  the big one on the hill ; to the side door . Mind , no gabbing . Doth he catch ? DICKON ( Nodding and grinning . ) ' E swallows . RACHEL But is the boy strong enough ? RICKBY Him ? ( Pointing to the anvil . ) Ebenezer ! ( The boy spits on his palms , takes hold of the anvil , lifts it , drops it again , sits on it , and grins at the door , just as RICHARD TALBOT appears there , from outside . ) RACHEL Gracious ! p. 14 RICKBY Trust him . He 'll carry the glass for you . RACHEL I will return home at once , then . Let him go quietly to the side door , and wait for me . Good-morning . ( Turning , she confrontsRICHARD . ) TALBOT Good-morning . RACHEL Richard  --  Squire Talbot , you  --  you are abroad early . TALBOT As early as Mistress Rachel . Is it pardonable ? I caught sight of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow , lest  --  ( Looks hard at GOODY RICKBY . ) RACHEL Very kind . Thanks . We can return together . ( To GOODY RICKBY . ) You will make sure that I receive the  --  the article . RICKBY Trust me , mistress . ( She curtisies to RICHARD . ) TALBOT ( Bluntly , looking from one to the other . ) What article ? ( RACHEL ignores the question and starts to pass out . RICHARD frowns at GOODY RICKBY , who stammers . ) RICKBY Begging your pardon , sir ? TALBOT What article ? I said . ( After a short , embarrassed pause , more sternly . ) Well ? p. 15 RICKBY Oh , the article ! Yonder old glass , to be sure , sir . A quaint piece , your honor . TALBOT Rachel , you have n't come here at sunrise to buy  --  that thing ? RACHEL Verily , " that thing , " and at sunrise . A pretty time for a pretty purchase . Are you coming ? TALBOT ( In a low tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious ? RACHEL Oh , of course . You know I am desperately mystical , so pray let us not discuss it . Good-bye . TALBOT Rachel , just a moment . If you want a mirror , you shall have the prettiest one in New England . Or I will import you one from London . Only  --  I beg of you  --  do n't buy stolen goods . RICKBY Stolen goods ? RACHEL ( Aside to RICHARD . ) Do n't ! do n't ! TALBOT ( To GOODY RICKBY . ) Can you account for this mirror  --  how you came by it ? RICKBY I 'll show ye ! I 'll show ye ! Stolen  --  ha ! TALBOT Come , old swindler , keep your mirror , and give this lady back her money . RICKBY I 'll damn ye both , I will !  --  Stolen ! p. 16 RACHEL ( Imploringly . ) Will you come ? TALBOT Look you , old Rickby ; this is not the first time . Charm all the broom-sticks in town , if you like ; bewitch all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gull no more money out of young girls . Mind you ! We ' re not so enterprising in this town as at Salem ; but  --  it may come to it ! So look sharp ! I 'm not blind to what 's going on here . RICKBY Not blind , Master Puritan ? Oho ! You can see through all my counterfeits , can ye ? So ! you would scrape all the wonder out'n the world , as I 've scraped all the meat out'n my punkin-head yonder ! Aha ! wait and see ! A fore sundown , I 'll send ye a nut to crack , shall make your orthodox jaws ache . Your servant , Master Deuteronomy ! TALBOT ( To RACHEL , who has seized his arm . ) We 'll go . ( Exeunt RICHARD and RACHEL . ) RICKBY ( Calls shrilly after them . ) Trot away , pretty team ; toss your heads . I 'll unhitch ye and take off your blinders . DICKON ( Capering and grimacing in front of the mirror , shrieks with laughter . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Stolen goods " ( Screams . ) Dickon ! Stop laughing . p. 17 DICKON O Lord ! O Lord ! RICKBY What tickles thy mirth now ? DICKON For to think that the soul of an orphan innocent , what lives in a hayloft , should wear horns . ( On looking into the mirror , the spectator perceives therein that the reflection of the slouching boy is the horned demon figure of DICKON , who performs the same antics in pantomime within the glass as the boy does without . ) RICKBY Yea ; ' t is a wise devil that knows his own face in the glass . But hark now ! thou must find me a rival for this cock-squire ,  --  dost hear ? A rival , that shall steal away the heart of his Mistress Rachel . DICKON And take her to church ? RICKBY To church or to hell . All 's one . DICKON A rival ! ( Pointing at the glass . ) How would he serve  --  in there ? Dear Ebenezer ! Fancy the deacons in the vestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they saw him escorting the bride to the altar , with his tail round her waist ! RICKBY Tut , tut ! Think it over in earnest , and meantime take her the glass . Wait , we 'd best fold it up small , so as not to attract notice on the road . ( DICKON , who has already drawn the curtains over the glass , grasps one side of the large frame , GOODY RICKBY the other . ) Now ! ( Pushing their shoulders against the two sides , the frame disappears and DICKON holds in his hand a mirror about a foot square , of the same design . ) So ! Be off ! And mind , a rival for Richard ! p. 18 DICKON For Richard a rival , Dear Goody RickbyWants Dickon 's connival:Lord ! What can the trick be ? ( To the scarecrow . ) By-by , Sonny ; take care of thy mother . ( DICKON slouches out with the glass , whistling . ) RICKBY Mother ! Yea , if only I had a son  --  the Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived now to remind him of those merry days , which he has forgotten . Zooks , would n't I put a spoke in his wheel ! But no such luck for me ! No such luck ! ( As she goes to the forge , the stout figure of a man appears in the doorway behind her . Under one arm he carries a large book , in the other hand a gold-headed cane . He hesitates , embarrassed . ) JUSTICE MERTON Permit me , madam . RICKBY ( Turning . ) Ah , him  --  Justice Merton ! JUSTICE MERTON ( Removing his hat , steps over the sill , and lays his great book on the table ; then with a supercilious look , he puts his hat firmly on again . ) Permit me , dame . RICKBY You ! ( With confused , affected hauteur , the JUSTICE shifts from foot to foot , flourishing his cane . As he speaks , GOODY RICKBY , with a shrewd , painful expression , draws slowly backward toward the door , left , which opens into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , stands facing him , and listens. ) p. 19 JUSTICE MERTON I have had the honor  --  permit me  --  to entertain suspicions ; to rise early , to follow my niece , to meet just now Squire Talbot ; to hear his remarks concerning  --  hem !  --  you , dame ! to call here  --  permit me  --  to express myself and inquire  --  RICKBY Concerning your waist-coat ? ( Turning quickly , she snatches an article of apparel which hangs on the inner side of the door , and holds it up . ) JUSTICE MERTON ( Starting , crimson . ) Woman ! RICKBY You left it behind  --  the last time . JUSTICE MERTON I have not the honor to remember  --  RICKBY The one I embroidered ? JUSTICE MERTON ' T is a matter of  --  RICKBY Of some two-and-twenty years . ( Stretching out the narrow width of the waistcoat . ) Will you try it on now , dearie ? JUSTICE MERTON Unconscionable ! Un-un-unconscionable witch ! RICKBY Witchling  --  thou used to say . JUSTICE MERTON Pah ! pah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a fall . As a magistrate , Rickby , I have already borne with you long ! The last straw , however , breaks the camel 's back . p. 20 RICKBY Poor camel ! JUSTICE MERTON You have soiled , you have smirched , the virgin reputation of my niece . You have inveigled her into notions of witchcraft ; already the neighbors are beginning to talk . ' T is a long lane which hath no turning , saith the Lord . Permit me  --  as a witch , thou art judged . Thou shalt hang . DICKON ( Behind him . ) And me , too ? JUSTICE MERTON ( Turns about and stares . ) I beg pardon . DICKON ( In front of him . ) Not at all . JUSTICE MERTON Did  --  did somebody speak ? DICKON Do n't you recognize my voice ? Still and small , you know . If you will kindly let me out , we can chat . JUSTICE MERTON ( Turning fiercely on GOODY RICKBY . ) These are thy sorceries . But I fear them not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the book which lies on the table . ) Satan , I ban thee ! I will read from the Holy Scriptures ! ( Unclasping the Bible , he flings open the ponderous covers .  --  DICKON steps forth in smoke . ) DICKON Thanks ; it was stuffy in there . p. 21 JUSTICE MERTON ( Clasping his hands . ) Dickon ! DICKON ( Moving a step nearer on the table . ) Hullo , Gilly ! Hullo , Bess ! JUSTICE MERTON Dickon ! No ! No ! DICKON Do ye mind Auld Lang Syne  --  the chorus that night , Gilly ? ( Sings . ) Gil-ead , Gil-ead , Gil-ead Merton , He was a silly head , silly head , Certain , When he forgot to steal a bed-Curtain . Encore , now ! JUSTICE MERTON No , no , be merciful ! I will not harm her ; she shall not hang ; I swear it , I swear it ! ( DICKON disappears . ) I swear  --  ah ! Is he gone ? Witchcraft ! Witchcraft ! I have witnesed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swear it : thou shalt hang . ( Exit wildly . ) RICKBY Ay , Gilead ! I shall hang on ! Ahaha ! Dickon , thou angel ! Ah , Satan ! Satan ! For a son now ! DICKON ( Reappearing . ) Videlicet , in law  --  a bastard . N ' est ce pas RICKBY Yea , in law and in jus- tice , I should ' a ' had one now . Worse luck that he died . DICKON One-and-twenty years ago ? ( GOODY RICKBY nods . ) Good ; he should be of age now . One-and-twenty  --  a pretty age , too , for a rival . Haha !  --  For arrival ?  --  Marry , he shall arrive , then ; arrive and marry and inherit his patrimony  --  all on his birthday ! Come , to work ! p. 22 RICKBY What rant is this ? DICKON Yet , Dickon , it pains me to perform such an anachronism . All this mediaevalism in Massachusetts !  --  These old-fashioned flames and alchemic accompaniments , when I 've tried so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But che vuole ! I 'm naturally middleaged . I have n't been really myself , let me think ,  --  since 1492 ! RICKBY What art thon mooning about ? DICKON ( Still impenetrable . ) There was my old friend in Germany , Dr. Johann Faustus ; he was nigh such a bag of old rubbish when I made him over . Ai n't it trite ! No , you ca n't teach an old dog like me new tricks . Still , a scarecrow ! that ' s decidedly local color . Come , then ; a Yankee masterpiece ! ( Seizing GOODY RICKBY by the arm , and placing her before the scarecrow , he makes a bow and wave of introduction . ) Behold , madam , your son  --  illegitimate ; the future affianced of Mistress Rachel Merton , the heir-elect , through matrimony , of Merton House ,  --  Gilead Merton second : Lord Ravensbane !

RICKBY ( Wrenching a spoke out of an old rickety wheel . ) Here : the spoke for Gilead . He used to take me to drive in the chaise it came out of .

( Clouds of smoke issue from the pipe , half fill the shop , and envelop the creature , who staggers.At Dickon 's words , " Come to work ! " on p. 693 the living actor , concealed by the smoke , and disguised , has substituted himself for the elegantly clad effigy . His make-up , of course , approximates to the latter , but the grotesque contours of his expression gradually , throughout the remainder of the act , become refined and sublimated till , at the finale , they are of a lordly and distinguished caste . ) RICKBY See ! See his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fili ! Veni ! Take ' ce first step , bambino !  --  Toddle !

He 's fallen . DICKON Well done , Punkin Jack ! Thou shalt be knighted for that ! ( Striking him on the shoulder with the hazel rod . ) Rise , Lord Ravensbane ! ( The SCARECROW totters to his feet , and makes a forlorn rectilinear salutation. ) p. 25 RICKBY Look ! He bows .  --  He flaps his flails at thee . He smiles like a tik-doo-loo-roo ! DICKON ( With a profound reverence , backing away . ) Will his lordship deign to follow his tutor ? ( With hitches and jerks , the SCARECROW follows DICKON . ) RICKBY O Lord !

JUSTICE MERTON 'S parlor , furnished and designed in the style of the early colonial period . On the right wall hangs a portrait of the JUSTICE as a young man ; on the left wall , an old-fashioned looking-glass . At the right of the room stands the Glass of Truth , draped  --  as in the blacksmith shop  --  with the strange , embroidered curtain . In front of it are discovered RACHEL and RICHARD ; RACHEL is about to draw the curtain . RACHEL Now ! Are you willing ? TALBOT So you suspect me of dark , villainous practices ? RACHEL No , no , foolish Dick . TALBOT Still , I am to be tested ; is that it ? RACHEL That 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . TALBOT Why , of course , then , I consent .

Now ; when I draw the curtain  --  TALBOT ( Staying her hand . ) What if I be false ? p. 30 RACHEL Then , sir , the glass will reflect you as the subtle fox that you are . TALBOT And you  --  as the goose ? RACHEL Very likely . Ah ! but , Richard , dear , we must n't laugh . It may prove very serious . You do not guess  --  you do not dream all the mysteries  --  TALBOT ( Shaking his head , with a grave smile . ) You pluck at too many mysteries . Remember our first mother Eve !

RACHEL ( To RAVENSBANE . ) Do describe it to us . We are so isolated here from the grand world .

I have heard that in England ladies followed the hounds ; and sometimes  --  ( looking at her aunt and lowering her voice )  --  they even dance . LORD RAVENSBANE Dance  --  ah , yes ; my lady mother dances about the  --  the altar ; she swings high a hammer . DICKON Your lordship , your lordship ! Pray , sir , check this vein of poetry .

DICKON ( As he lights the pipe for RAVENSBANE , speaks suavely and low as if not to be overheard by him . ) Pardon me . The fact is , my young pupil is sensitive ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you observe a slight lameness , an occassional-absence of mind . p. 49 RACHEL A wound  --  in a real duel ?

LORD RAVENSBANE ( Regaining slowly a look of intelligence , draws himself up with affronted hauteur . ) Permit me ! ( Puffs several wreaths of smoke into the air . ) I am the fashions . TALBOT ( Going . ) Insufferable ! ( He pauses at the door . ) CYNTHIA ( To JUSTICE MERTON . ) Well  --  what do you think of that ? JUSTICE MERTON Spoken like King Charles himself .

RACHEL ( To RICHARD . ) Are you satisfied ? TALBOT ( Trembling with feeling . ) More than satisfied . ( Exit . ) LORD RAVENSBANE ( Looking after him . ) Ah ! Betrothed is not pleasant .

Late afternoon . The same scene as in Act Second . RAVENSBANE and DICKON are seated at the table , on which are lying two flails . RAVENSBANE is dressed in a costume which , composed of silk and jewels , subtly approximates in design to that of his original grosser composition . So artfully , however , is this contrived that , to one ignorant of his origin , his dress would appear to be merely an odd personal whimsy ; whereas , to one initiated , it would stamp him grotesquely as the apotheosis of scarecrows . DICKON is sitting in a pedagogical attitude ; RAVENSBANE stands near him , making a profound bow in the opposite direction . LORD RAVENSBANE Believe me , ladies , with the true sincerity of the heart . DICKON Infllection a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heart . LORD RAVENSBANE Believe me , ladies , with the true sincerity of heart . DICKON Prettily , prettily ! Next !

LORD RAVENSBANE ( With a superb air . ) The second , I believe . DICKON Quite so , my lord .

This right of etiquette must be observed . Nevertheless , believe me , I have no selfish desire that my superior- DICKON Attainments ! LORD RAVENSBANE Attainments in this art should assume advantage over my challenger 's ignorance . I have , therefore , chosen those combative utensils most appropriate both to his own humble origin and to local tradition . Permit me , sir , to reveal my choice . ( Pointing grandly to the table . ) There are my weapons ! p. 62 DICKON Delicious ! O thou exquisite flower of love ! How thy natal composites have burst in bloom ! - The pumpkin in thee to a golden collarette ; thy mop of crow 's wings to these raven locks ; thy broomstick to a lordly limp ; thy corn-silk to these pale-tinted tassels . Verily in the gallery of scarecrows , thou art the Apollo Belvedere ! LORD RAVENSBANE Mistress Rachel-I may see her now ? DICKON Romeo ! Romeo ! Was ever such an amorous puppet show ! LORD RAVENSBANE Mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art wound up now , my pretty apparatus , for at least six-and-thirty hours .

DICKON Fie , fie , Jack ; thou must not be breaking thy Dickon 's apron-strings with a will of thine own . Come ! LORD RAVENSBANE Mistress Rachel- DICKON Be good , boy , and thou shalt see her soon .

( DICKON 'S intense glance focusses on RAVENSBANE 'S face with the faintest of smiles . ) LORD RAVENSBANE My adversary should be deft in their use . He has doubtless wielded them frequently on his barn floor . CAPTAIN BUGBY Ahaha ! I understand now . Your lordship-ah ! is a wit . Haha ! Flails ! p. 66 DICKON His lordship 's satire is poignant . CAPTAIN BUGBY Indeed , sir , so keen that I must apologize for laughing at my principal 's expense .

RACHEL So do I  --  that is , innocent witchcraft ; not to harm anybody , you know , but just to feel all the dark mystery and the trembling excitement  --  the way you feel when you blow out your candle all alone in your bedroom and watch the little smoke fade away in the moonshine .

( To SIR CHARLES . ) Your Excellency , let me introduce  --  permit me  --  LORD RAVENSBANE Permit me ; ( addressing her ) Mistress Rachel !  --  Mistress Rachel will introduce  --  p. 85 RACHEL ( Curtsying . ) Sir Charles , allow me to present my friend , Lord Ravensbane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  did you hear ? CHARLES Mistress Rachel , I see you are as pretty as ever . Lord Ravensbane , your hand , sir . LORD RAVENSBANE Trust me , your Excellency , I will inform his Majesty of your courtesy . CAPTAIN BUGBY ( Watching RAVENSBANE with chagrin . ) On my life ! he 's lost his limp . LORD RAVENSBANE ( Apart to RACHEL . ) You said : " A great glory has descended upon this day . " RACHEL ( Shyly . ) My lord ! LORD RAVENSBANE Be sure  --  O mistress , be sure  --  that this glory is love . CHARLES My daughters , Fanny and Amelia  --  Lord Ravensbane . THE TWO GIRLS ( Curtsying . ) Your lordship ! CHARLES Good girls , but silly . THE TWO GIRLS Papa ! LORD RAVENSBANE Believe me , ladies , with the true sincerity of the heart . p. 86 MISTRESS REDDINGTON Is n't he perfection ! CAPTAIN BUGBY What said I ? AMELIA ( Giggling . ) I ca n't help thinking of flails . CHARLES ( In a loud whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your niece ? JUSTICE MERTON Not  --  not precisely . DICKON ( To JUSTICE MERTON . ) Your worship  --  a word . ( Leads him aside . ) LORD RAVENSBANE ( Whom RACHEL continues to introduce to the guests , speaks to MASTER RAND . ) Verily , sir , as that prince of poets , the immortal Virgil , has remarked : " Adeo in teneris consuescere multum est . " REV . MASTER TODD His lordship is evidently a university man . RAND Evidently most accomplished . JUSTICE MERTON ( Aside to DICKON . ) A song ! Why , it is beyond all bounds of custom and decorum . DICKON Believe me , there is no such flatterer to win the maiden heart as music . JUSTICE MERTON And here ; in this presence ! Never ! p. 87 DICKON Nevertheless , it will amuse me vastly , and you will announce it . JUSTICE MERTON ( With hesitant embarrassement , which he seeks to conceal . ) Your Excellency and friends , I have great pleasure in announcing his lordship 's condescension in consenting to regale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In various degrees of amazement and curiosity . ) A song ! CYNTHIA Gilead ! What is this ? JUSTICE MERTON The selection is a German ballad  --  a particular favorite at the court of Prussia , where his lordship last rendered it . His tutor has made a translation which is entitled  --  DICKON " The Prognostication of the Crows . " ALL Crows ! JUSTICE MERTON And I am requested to remind you that in the ancient heathen mythology of Germany , the crow or raven was the fateful bird of the god Woden . CAPTAIN BUGBY How prodigiously novel ! MINISTER DODGE ( Frowning . ) Unparalleled ! CHARLES A ballad ! Come now , that sounds like old England again . Let 's have it . Will his lordship sing without music ? p. 88 JUSTICE MERTON Master Dickonson , hem ! has been  --  persuaded  --  to accompany his lordship on the spinet . AMELIA How delightful ! RAND ( Aside to TODD . ) Shall we remain ? REV . MASTER TODD We must . LORD RAVENSBANE ( To RACHEL . ) My tassel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RACHEL My heart still wavers , my lord . But whilst you sing , I will decide . LORD RAVENSBANE Whilst I sing ? My fate , then , is waiting at the end of a song ? RACHEL At the end of a song . DICKON ( Calling to RAVENSBANE . ) Your lordship ! LORD RAVENSBANE ( Starting , turns to the company . ) Permit me . ( DICKON sits at the spinet . At first , his fingers in playing give sound only to the soft tinkling notes of that ancient instrument ; but gradually , strange notes and harmonies of an arial orchestra mingle with , and at length drown , the spinet . The final chorus is produced solely by fantastic symphonic cawings , as of countless crows , in harsh but musical accord . During the song RICHARD enters . DICKON 'S music , however , does not cease but fills the intervals between the verses . To his accompaniment , amid the whispered and gradually increasing wonder , resentment , and dismay of the assembled guests , RAVENSBANE , with his eyes fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose ; ( The golden sun was rising ) Before him flew a flock of crows:Sing heigh ! Sing heigh ! Sing heigh ! Sing  --  " Ill speed , ill speed thee , baron-wight ; Ill speed thy palfrey pawing ! Blithe is the morn but black the nightThat hears a raven 's cawing . " ( Chorus. ) p. 89 Caw ! Caw ! Caw ! MISTRESS DODGE ( Whispers to her husband . ) Did you hear them ? MINISTER DODGE Hush ! AMELIA ( Sotto voce . ) What can it be ? CAPTAIN BUGBY Oh , the latest , be sure . DICKON You note , my friends , the accompanying harmonies ; they are an instrinsic part of the ballad , and may not be omitted . LORD RAVENSBANE ( Sings . ) " The baron reckd not a pin ; ( For the golden sun was rising ) He rode to woo , he rode to win ; Sing heigh ! Sing heigh ! Sing heigh ! Sing  --  " He rode into his prince 's hallThrough knights and damsels flow'ry : Thy daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand and dowry. " ( Enter RICHARD . MISTRESS MERTON seizes his arm nervously ) CHARLES ( To CAPTAIN BUGBY . ) This gentleman 's playing is rather ventriloquistical . CAPTAIN BUGBY Quite , as it were . REV . MASTER TODD This smells unholy . p. 90 RAND ( To TODD . ) Shall we leave ? LORD RAVENSBANE ( Sings . ) " What cock is this , with crest so high , That crows with such a pother ? " " Baron von Rabentod am I ; Methinks we know each other . " " Now welcome , welcome , dear guest of mine , So long why didst thou tarry ? Now , for the sake of auld lang syne , My daughter thou shalt marry . " AMELIA ( To BUGBY . ) And he kept right on smoking ! MINISTER DODGE ( Who , with RAND and TODD , has risen uneasily . ) This smacks of witchcraft . LORD RAVENSBANE ( Sings . ) The bride is brought , the priest as well ; ( The golden sun was passing ) They stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Sing ah ! Sing  --  " Woman , with this ring I thee wed . " What makes his voice so awing ? The baron by the bride is dead:Outside the crows were cawing . ( Chorus , which grows tumultuous , seeming to fill the room with the invisible birds . ) Caw ! Caw ! Caw ! ( The guests rise in confusion . DICKON still plays delightedly , and the strange music continues. ) p. 91 MINISTER DODGE This is no longer godly .  --  Justice Merton ! Justice Merton , sir !  --  LORD RAVENSBANE ( To RACHEL , who holds his tassel in her hand . ) Ah ! and you have my tassel ! RACHEL See ! I will wear it now . You yourself shall fasten it . LORD RAVENSBANE Rachel ! Mistress ! RACHEL My dear lord ! ( As RAVENSBANE is placing the silken tassel on RACHEL 'S breast to fasten it there , RICHARD , by the mirror , takes hold of the curtain strings . ) TALBOT I told you  --  witchcraft , like murder will out ! Lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) RACHEL ( Looking into the glass , screams and turns her gaze fearfully upon RAVENSBANE . ) Ah ! Do not look ! DICKON ( Who , having turned round from the spinet , has leaped forward , now turns back again , biting his finger . ) Too late ! ( In the glass are reflected the figures of RACHEL and REVENSBANE  --  RACHEL just as she herself appears , but RAVENSBANE in his essential form of a scarecrow , in every movement reflecting RAVENSBANE 'S motions . The thing in the glass is about to pin a wisp of corn-silk on the mirrored breast of the maiden. ) p. 92 LORD RAVENSBANE What is there ? RACHEL ( Looking again , starts away from RAVENSBANE . ) Leave me ! Leave me !  --  Richard ! ( She faints in RICHARD 'S arms . ) LORD RAVENSBANE Fear not , mistress , I will kill the thing . ( Drawing his sword , he rushes at the glass . Within , the scare-crow , with a drawn wheel-spoke , approaches him at equal speed . They come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Fear'st thou me ? What art thou ? Why , ' t is a glass . Thou mockest me ? Look , look , mistress , it mocks me ! O God , no ! no ! Take it away . Dear God , do not look !  --  It is I ! ALL ( Rushing to the doors . ) Witchcraft ! Witchcraft ! ( As RAVENSBANE stands frantically confronting his abject reflection , struck in a like posture of despair , the curtain falls. ) @x The scene is the same , but it is night . The moon , shining in broadly at the window , discovers RAVENSBANE alone , prostrate before the mirror . Raised on one arm to a half-sitting posture , he gazes fixedly at the vaguely seen image of the scarecrow prostrate in the glass . LORD RAVENSBANE All have left me  --  but not thou . Rachel has left me ; her eyes have turned away from me ; she is gone . All that I loved , all that loved me , have left me . A thousand ages  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have gazed upon each other 's desertedness . Speak ! and be pitiful ! If thou art I , inscrutable image , if thou dost feel these pangs thine own , show then self-mercy ; speak ! What art thou ? What am I ? Why are we here ? How comes it that we feel and guess and suffer ? Nay , though thou answer not these doubts , yet mock them , mock them aloud , even as there , monstrous , thou counter-feitest mine actions . Speak , abject enigma !  --  Speak , poor shadow , thou  --  ( Recoiling wildly . ) Stand back , inanity ! Thrust not thy mawkish face in pity toward me . Ape and idiot ! Scare-crow !  --  to console me ! Haha !  --  A flail and broomstick ! a cob , a gourd and pumpkin , to fuse and sublimate themselves into a mage-philosopher , who discourseth metaphysics to itself  --  itself , God ! Dost Thou hear ? Itself ! For even such am I  --  I whom Thou madest to love Rachel . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? Is it Thou that peerest forth at me  --  from me ? Why , hark then ; Thou shalt listen , and answer  --  if Thou canst . Between the rise and setting of a sun , I have walked in this world of Thine . I have been thrilled with wonder ; I have been calmed with knowledge ; I have trembled with joy and passion . Power , beauty , love have ravished me . Infinity itself , like a dream , has blazed before me with the certitude of prophecy ; and I have cried , " This world , the heavens , time itself , are mine to conquer , " and I have thrust forth mine arm to wear Thy shield for-ever  --  and lo ! for my shield Thon reachest me  --  a mirror , and whisperest : " Know thyself ! Thou art  --  a scare-crow : a tinkling clod , a rigmarole of dust , a lump of ordure , contemptible , superfluous , inane ! " Haha ! Hahaha ! And with such scarecrows Thou dost people a planet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank Thee , God ! at least this breathing bathos can laugh at itself . Thou hast vouchsafed to me , Spirit ,  --  hahaha !  --  to know myself . Mine , mine is the consummation of man  --  even self-contempt ! ( Pointing in the glass with an agony of derisiou . ) Scarecrow ! Scarcrow ! Scarecrow ! p. 94 THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS ( More and more faintly . ) Scarecrow ! Scarecrow ! Scarecrow ! ( RAVENSBANE throws himself prone upon the floor , beneath the window sobbing . There is a pause of silence , and the moon shines brighter .  --  Slowly then RAVENSBANE , getting to his knees , looks out into the night . ) LORD RAVENSBANE What face are you , high up through the twinkling leaves ? Do you not , like all the rest , turn , aghast , your eyes away from me  --  me , abject enormity , groveling at your feet ? Gracious being , do you not fear  --  despise me ? O white peace of the world , beneath your gaze the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far afield , crouch  --  beautiful . The slough shines lustrous as a bridal veil . Beautiful face , you are Rachel 's , and you have changed the world . Nothing is mean , but you have made it miraculous ; nothing is loathsome , nothing ludicrous , but you have converted it to loveliness , that even this shadow of a mockery myself , cast by your light , gives me the dear assurance I am a am saved ! THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS A very pretty sophistry . ( The moonlight grows dimmer , as at the passing of a cloud . ) LORD RAVENSBANE Ah ! what voice has snatched you from me ? p. 95 THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS A most poetified pumpkin ! LORD RAVENSBANE Thing ! dost thou speak at last ? My soul abhors thee . THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS I am thy soul . LORD RAVENSBANE Thou liest . THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS Our daddy Dickon and our mother Rickby begot and conceived us at sunrise , in a Jack-o ' - lantern . LORD RAVENSBANE Thou liest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS Why , very true . So art thou . We are a pretty phantom in a glass . LORD RAVENSBANE It is a lie . I am no longer thou . I feel it ; I am a man . THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS And prithee , what 's a man ? Man 's but a mirror , Wherein the imps and angels play charades , Make faces , mope , and pull each other 's hair  --  Till crack ! the sly urchin Death shivers the glass , And the bare coffin boards show underneath . LORD RAVENSBANE Yea ! if it be so , thou coggery ! if both of us be indeed but illusions , why , now let us end together . But if it be not so , then let me for evermore be free of thee . Now is the test  --  the glass ! ( Springing to the fireplace , he seizes an iron crosspiece from the andirons . ) I 'll play your urchin Death and shatter it . Let see what shall survive ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DICKON steps out of the mirror , closing the curtain. ) p. 96 DICKON I would n't , really ! LORD RAVENSBANE Dickon ! dear Dickon ! is it you ? DICKON Yes , Jacky ! it 's dear Dickon , and I really would n't . LORD RAVENSBANE Would n't what , Dickon ? DICKON Sweep the cobwebs off the sky with thine aspiring broomstick . When a man questions fate , ' t is bad digestion . When a scarecrow does it , ' t is bad taste . LORD RAVENSBANE At last , you will tell me the truth , Dickon ! Am I , then  --  that thing ? DICKON You must n't be so skeptical . Of course you 're that thing . LORD RAVENSBANE Ah me despicable ! Rachel , why didst thou ever look upon me ? DICKON I fear , cobby , thou hast never studied woman 's heart and hero-worship . Take thyself now . I remarked to Goody Bess , thy mother , this morning , as I was chucking her thy pate from the hayloft , that thou wouldst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORD RAVENSBANE Cease ! cease ! in pity 's name . You do not know the agony of being ridiculous . DICKON Nay , Jacky , all mortals are ridiculous . Like you , they were rummaged out of the muck ; and like you , they shall return to the dunghill . I advise ' em , like you , to enjoy the interim , and smoke . p. 97 LORD RAVENSBANE This pipe , this ludicrous pipe that I forever set to my lips and puff ! Why must I , Dickon ? Why ? DICKON To avoid extinction  --  merely . You see , ' t is just as your fellow in there ( pointing to the glass ) explained . You yourself are the subtlest of mirrors , polished out of pumpkin and pipe-smoke . Into this mirror the fair Mistress Rachel has projected her lovely image , and thus provided you with what men call a soul . LORD RAVENSBANE Ah ! then , I have a soul  --  the truth of me ? Mistress Rachel has indeed made me a man ? DICKON Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiff  --  soul , Mistress Rachel , man , truth , and this pretty world itself , go up in the last smoke . LORD RAVENSBANE No , no ! not Mistress Rachel . DICKON Mistress Rachel exists for your lordship merely in your lordship 's pipe-bowl . LORD RAVENSBANE Wretched , niggling caricature that I am ! All is lost to me  --  lost ! DICKON " Paradise Lost " again ! Always blaming it on me . There 's that gaunt fellow in England has lately wrote a parody on me when I was in the apple business . LORD RAVENSBANE ( Falling on his knees and bowing his head . ) O God ! I am so contemptible ! ( Enter , at door back , GOODY RICKBY ; her blacksmith garb is hidden under a dingy black mantle with a peaked hood. ) p. 98 DICKON Good verse , too , for a parody !

Hail , horrors ; hail , Infernal world ! and thou , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Seizing his arm . ) Dickon ! DICKON Hullo ! You , Bess ! RICKBY There 's not a minute to lose . Justice Merton and the neighbors have ended their conference at Minister Dodge 's , and are returning here . DICKON Well , let ' em come . We 're ready . RICKBY But thou toldst me they had discovered  --  DICKON A scarecrow in a mirror . Well ? The glass is bewitched ; that 's all . RICKBY All ? Witchcraft is hanging  --  that 's all ! And the mirror was bought of me  --  of me , the witch . Wilt thou be my hangman , Dickon ? DICKON Wilt thou give me a kiss , Goody ? When did ever thy Dickon desert thee ? RICKBY But how , boy , wilt thou  --  DICKON Trust me , and thy son . When the Justice 's niece is thy daughter-in-law , all will be safe . For the Justice will cherish his niece 's family . p. 99 RICKBY But when he knows  --  DICKON But he shall not know . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how will he , or any person , ever know that we made this fellow out of rubbish ? Who , forsooth , but a poet  --  or a devil  --  would believe it ? You must n't credit men with our imaginations , my dear . RICKBY Then thou wilt pull me through this safe ? DICKON As I adore thee  --  and my own reputation .

RICKBY ( Curtsying , laughs shrilly . ) Your servant  --  my son ! ( About to depart . ) LORD RAVENSBANE Ye lie ! both of you !  --  I was born of Rachel . DICKON Tut , tut , Jacky ; you must n't mix up mothers and prospective wives at your age . It 's fatal . RICKBY ( Excitedly . ) They 're coming !

DICKON Fie ! fie ! Thou shalt have her . LORD RAVENSBANE Have her , Dickon ? DICKON For lover and wife . LORD RAVENSBANE For wife ? DICKON For wife and all . Thou hast but to obey . LORD RAVENSBANE Ah ! who will do this for me ? DICKON I ! LORD RAVENSBANE Dickon ! Wilt make me a man  --  a man and worthy of her ? DICKON Fiddlededee ! I make over no masterpieces . Thy mistress shall be Cinderella , and drive to her palace with her gilded pumpkin . LORD RAVENSBANE It is the end . DICKON What ! You 'll not ? LORD RAVENSBANE Never . DICKON Harkee , manikin . Hast thou learned to suffer ? LORD RAVENSBANE ( Wringing his hands . ) O God ! p. 101 DICKON I taught thee . Shall I teach thee further ? LORD RAVENSBANE Thou canst not . DICKON Can not  --  ha ! What if I should teach Rachel , too ? LORD RAVENSBANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DICKON ( Bowing . ) Flattered . LORD RAVENSBANE Devil ! Thou wouldst not torment Rachel ? DICKON Not if my lord  --  LORD RAVENSBANE Speak ! What must I do ? DICKON Not speak . Be silent , my lord , and acquiesce in all I say . LORD RAVENSBANE I will be silent . DICKON And acquiesce ?

MINISTER DODGE What said she ? DICKON This : It appeareth that , for some time past , she hath cherished revengeful thoughts against our honored host , Justice Merton . MINISTER DODGE Yea , he hath often righteously condemned her ! DICKON Precisely ! So , in revenge , she bewitched yonder mirror , and this very morning unlawfully inveigled this sweet young lady into purchasing it . p. 103 CHARLES Mistress Rachel ! MINISTER DODGE ( To RACHEL . ) Didst thou purchase that glass ? RACHEL ( In a low voice . ) Yes . MINISTER DODGE From Goody Rickby ? RACHEL Yes . ( Clinging to RICHARD . ) O , Richard ! MINISTER DODGE But the image ; what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar devil of hers  --  a sly imp , who wears to mortal eyes the shape of a scarecrow .

DICKON Indeed , sir , it was this very devil whom , but now she stole here to consult withal , when she encountered me , attendant here upon my poor prostrate lord , and  --  held by the wrath in my eye  --  confessed it all .
