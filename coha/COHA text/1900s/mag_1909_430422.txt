 | THE REVELATION OF EVOLUTION : A THOUGHT AND ITS THINKERS A MASTER-THOUGHT lives always ; it speaks forever in the echoes it evokes . We honor its conception as the Romans did Minerva sprung from the head of Jove . In it its thinker immortally lives on . For its birth we still remember long after the man himself is dead , and it is to celebrate one such centenary that so many meetings have this year been held . Yet , amid the resounding plaudits , few perhaps were conscious of what it was they cheered , nor among mankind 's conceptions how Darwin 's stood related to the rest . For the origin of species is as much a mystery as ever ; it was for bringing animate existence within universal law that Darwin 's memory is kept . It was as part of cosmogony 's master-key that the thought that led to its unlocking was great . For in truth the rise of the organic is but the latest chapter in a serial of the sky . It is the culmination to the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the least important item of our world 's eventful history , the space it fills is brief beside the aeons through which the prefatory process stretches back into the past . Threading the shorter and the long alike , a single causal chain binds both into an articulated whole : the principle of evolution . Evolution is nothing more nor less than the mainspring of the universe . Grand in its simplicity , it is the one fundamental fact on which all we know depends . From its influence nothing can escape ; for it has fashioned everything , from nebula to man . To appreciate it is to recognize that the universe was not made from without , but grew to be what @# it is from within . Not a mechanism cunningly contrived , the cosmos is an organism that includes both you and me . In view of the simplicity , the universality , the importance of the fact , the surprising thing is that it should have escaped most men 's recognition so long . For we find it through the ages realized only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it from his cradle to his grave , one is tempted to believe that the sole object exempt from its working , the one thing incapable of intelligent advance , is the mind of man himself . Certainly his selfbestowed title of homo sapiens can be only by brevet , a hoped-for honor to which so far he has but caricaturally attained . Quickness of apprehension is not his most marked trait , or he would surely have suspected the sarcasm of his scientific name . Yet , considered from the standpoint of evolution , the situation is perhaps all one could expect . Trial and error must needs have taken long to get him where he is . Pushed or prompted from the forest , primeval man stood ushered on the plains . With the opening of the prospect thus presented him , began the widening of the horizon of his mind . Through this , as much as anything , he parted company from the brutes . Search for subsistence led him to wander , and his wanderings lured perception to journeys farther still . Alone with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts perforce gravitated to the stars . Something beyond the Earth swam into his ken as he sat and watched them swing silently over- head . Not less was such communion furthered through his voyages by sea . Already the stellar courses must have been well known when the Phoenicians pushed boldly out into the broad expanse of the Mediterranean , to be guided by the Sun by day , by the constellations by night . Homer enumerates the asterisms they steered by , and it argues no mean familiarity with the heavens that they dared to be thus piloted , no matter what the season of the year . So much of knowledge led to more . We may even trace its source . Mnesarchus , the father of Pythagoras , is said to have been a Tyrian merchant , who settled finally in Samos ; and it was doubtless from sailing with him out of sight of land , through the long , cold winter nights , steering by the stars , that the boy 's thoughts were turned to thinking what they meant ? to better purpose than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Greeks reached marvelously correct ideas of the structure of the universe , considering their instrumental means . Five centuries before Christ , Pythagoras was cognizant that the Earth turned on her axis and revolved about the sun ; and his doctrines , written out and extended by his follower Philolaus , were handed down in secret , for fear of priestcraft , through the centuries that followed . Debased on purpose for exposition to the people , the memory of the truth was lost , and so it came about that that arch-mediocrity , Ptolemy , imposed upon the world , to dominate it for more than a millennium , a false earth-centred astronomy by means of an imposing book . The idea of evolution , too , had entered the keen Greek mind . Anaximander ( 611 to 545 B. C. ) taught that from a vast unbounded body evolved a central mass , our earth ; and out of the earth came life . Man , himself , he supposed had sprung from other animals , probably marine . Anaxagoras ( 450 B.C. ) conceived motion to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been gradually OF EVOLUTION 175 segregated to their present state . Cold played a part in this , and animals sprang from out the earth 's aboriginal moist clay . In Empedocles 's scheme we find spontaneous variation and the eventual survival of the fittest . While Lucretius , in his great epic on the Nature of Things , in which that brilliant poet-scientist resumed the learning of his foretime on the subject , says appositely ( Book V , 826-827 ) that the earth spontaneously brought forth life , ceasing only when she passed the bearing age . Thus did the ancients strangely adumbrate the truth . Their cosmologic building differed from that of later ages chiefly in the character of the bricks . For the physical laws on which all such structures must be founded had not yet been found . Then the long night of the middle ages settled down on man , when thought itself was blotted out . Nor did the idea of evolution come in with the dawn again of learning . Intellectually , men began anew , and took things as ready-made as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of gravitation saw interposition in the orderly arrangement of the planets , from which the comets had been left exempt , and foresaw further interposition necessary to keep them going in the future . He tells us so very explicitly in his general scholium at the end of the Principia . It was not till the middle of the seventeenth century of our era that the idea that the universe had evolved seems again to have occurred to man . Descartes ( 1744 ) led speculation with his theory of vortices , the sun and planets being due to swirls in a continuous medium pervading space . It was accepted for twenty years or more by the best minds of the day , ? Leibnitz , Huygens , and the like , ? to be finally demolished by Newton . A century later , Kant devised another origin for the solar system . It might have been superb had Kant 's knowledge of physics equaled his divining sight . He conceived a primal nebula , originally at rest , to have given birth to the sun and his cortege by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality of movement we now know to be as vain as the attempt to lift one 's self bodily by one 's bootstraps . To be commended for its daring , though , this bold modern driving of the chariot of the sun ! To Laplace , a generation later , is due the first truly scientific attempt at explanation . For it is one thing to perceive that the solar system must have grown to its present state , as a boy grows , by a development intrinsic to itself , and another to point out the actual steps of the process . Laplace in 1796 , in his Exposition of the System of the Universe , advanced a cosmogony , with the reserve of a great mathematician who realized that observation and calculation alone can give certainty of result , which dominated scientific thinkers for three-quarters of a century . At the time it was published it seemed to account for the then known facts . Laplace supposed a pristine nebula , tenuously vast , which rotated as an articulated whole because of friction between its parts . Contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condensed , till its outer parts attained such speed that they reached the limit of abandonment , and a ring was left behind . Withdrawing farther , another ring was ultimately detached , and so the process went on , each ring separating in due order of distance from the sun . These gathered upon themselves to form the planets , which , still contracting and twirling faster as they shrank , threw off their satellites in turn . A grand conception for its simplicity , but too simple to be true . The advance of science since has disclosed some fatal flaws in it , which have obliged its giving up . First : the necessary friction for such solidarity of movement is not in nature . Substitutes for this have since then been devised , but unavailingly , to save the Laplacian idea , for other flaws in it are irremediable . The solar system is not as uniform in plan as then was thought . Especially must the comets be accounted for . Laplace expressly ac- cepted them , for he considered he proved them unattached visitors other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mathematical first pointed out by Gauss ; the other , overlooking the sun 's motion space . He believed he had shown the orbits of the comets were such should mathematically be expected , those bodies come to us from wi But in the course of his analytic formations he had taken as conve a series which in reality was not , and formula had been vitiated in consequence . Gauss detected and exposed the fallacy ; then , later , Schiaparelli wrote a paper showing , on other lines , that the comets must be deemed our own ; and lastly Fabry of Marseilles , in a masterly memoir not sufficiently known , has demonstrated that were the comets not members of our solar system , hyperbolic , or unclosed , orbits among them should be very common , not one of which for certain has ever bees observed . That the precise manner of the cosmos ' growth escaped its first investigator is not strange , as it has more or less eluded every thinker since who has tried to trace it . Yet , by standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation has peered a little farther back into the past . New acquisitions in physics , though disproving hypotheses once held , have led us by so much nearer to the truth . Its history is the chronicle of the mind 's most brilliant march , which had been more than human had it not been cumbered by mistake . To miss the road at times does not preclude an eventual reaching of the goal . For science is not a chain of disconnected , successively discarded beliefs , as is sometimes popularly supposed , but itself a development growing to greater generality , and so to truth , as its horizon spreads . It is itself the archetype of what it seeks to solve . More has now to be explained than Laplace envisaged . Thus comets , now known to be part and parcel of the solar system and vagrants from interstellar  | space , demand recognition in any evolutionary scheme . Other intruding autochthones too , undiscovered a century ago , insist on disturbing the harmony of the Laplacian plan . Unconforming members , these , that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the system shows thus different and complex . The distant planets do not rotate in like sense with the near ; while their satellites all retrograde . Then , too , the last-found satellite of Saturn , and that of Jupiter as well , move contrariwise from what their sisters do . Significant it is that it should always be the system 's peripheral parts that differ from the main . Kirkwood , Roche , Trowbridge , Faye , Ligondes , and others , have met these difficulties singly or en bloc by explanations more correct than compelling . For in so many-elemented a matter the might be is other than the must . One vera causa has certainly been acquired , not subversive of , but supplementary to , what went before . For a previously unreckoned factor is tidal evolution . We owe its recognition to one almost unknown while he was living , the brilliant Edouard Roche . Ancillary , not all-directing , it has helped shape the system to its present state . At the hands of Sir George Darwin , the eldest son of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of its birth ; and at those of See , it speaks of the genesis of double stars . Certain it is that the system bears evidence of this action in the countenance it presents . Just as the moon shows us always the same face , so Mercury and Venus we now know turn one side in perpetuity to the sun , and the best seen satellites of the other planets seem to do the like to their cynosural lords . Tidal friction this bespeaks . To this cause , too , may the planets ' axial tilts , progressing from inversion to uprightness as one comes inward to the sun , in all probability be ascribed , as Kirkwood first pointed out ( 1864 ) . Without attempting here a picture of what probably took place , let me sketch a line or two of its reconstruction as they d OF EVOLUTION 177 have taken shape at midnight to one watcher of the stars . Strange to say , perhaps the latest news about our solar family has come from the smallest and most seemingly insignificant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest of its constituents and the least developed that they bear witness so well . Ask the children of a household , not their elders , if you want domestic facts . These little telltales are the meteorites , the stones which fall from heaven from time to time . Shrewdly questioned , these bits of meteoric stone and iron have a most surprising story to unfold , a tale which stretches so far back into the past as to stagger thought , and yet so fresh in their embalming of it as to seem of yesterday . Their speed and their great numbers show that they are cosmic bodies like the planets themselves , the unswept-up remnants , in fact , of what once strewed space , and out of which the planets were formed . They are thus parts of the primal nebula . But important as this is , it is not all . Through the strange fretwork of their face , like the frosting of the cold of space upon the window-pane of time , we gaze upon a state of things antedating that nebula itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known on earth . Most nearly kin to our deep minerals , their character and speed proclaim them as once part of some great solid globe placed where our sun now is , which at one time had itself been hot , and subsequently cooled . Fragments now , scattered orphanwise in space , they speak mutely of their parentage , and of the mighty cataclysm in that body whose shattering gave them birth . Parts of what went before , parts too of what is to-day , they are themselves the link in our chain of evidence connecting the present with the past , proving how we came to be . They are the tangible realization of what the philosophic seers saw with the mind 's eye down the far vista of recalled time . Had any one told Laplace that man would ever hold and handle  | parts of the very nebula from which we sprang , surely no one would have been more surprised than he . From the information afforded us by meteorites we turn to another discovery of recent date , the recognition of the spiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also known as white for their spectroscopic look . Known for long in some few instances , it is their overwhelming commonness which has lately been descried . For they prove to constitute by far the greater number of all the nebulae in the sky , and are sharply differentiated from the other class , the irregular or green . To them there is reason to believe all intermediate forms belong ; the ring nebulae being in reality spiral , and the planetary nebulae too , types both of the same process reduced to its lowest terms . Their structure speaks unmistakably of evolution , and their universality proclaims such evolution to be the inevitable procedure of the universe . Their color , white , arises from their showing a continuous spectrum , and indicates that they are composed in large part at least of solid particles , whereas the green tint of the others comes solely from glowing gas . Now , this spectrum is just what they should show were they flocks of meteorites , ? and such they undoubtedly are . They give us , therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their peculiar structure , we can infer what the process was that scattered the constituents of the once compact ball whose existence the meteorites attest . They consist of a central core from which two spiral coils unfold , the starting-point of the one diametrically opposite the other . Now this is what would happen had the original mass been tidally disrupted by a passing tramp . Tides in its body would be raised toward and opposite the stranger , and these would scatter its parts outward ; the motion due the tramp combining with the body 's spin to produce the spiral coils we see . Just as in the meteorites we have found the substances from which our solar system rose , so in these nebulae we see an evolution actually in process which may have been our own . Turning now to our solar system , we mark in it arrangements which can not be the result of chance . An orderly disposition in the motions of its parts shows that it evolved according to definitely acting laws . In some we can trace their action analytically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we already know enough to be sure that the system grew to be what it is , not that it arose as such . Every year adds something to help to point its path . Not simply the disposition of the motions , but a disposal of the masses in it has recently been recognized ? a disposal so peculiar that it calls for a mechanical basis , which we shall some day find . On this , as on other signposts of the course it took to fashion the orderly arrangement we today behold , space forbids my dwelling . But the nebular hypotheses of mechanics are only the outer portals and broad avenues of evolution . They leave us on the threshold of where the greatest , because the most intrinsic , interest begins : that strange development by which the inorganic grew into the organic by due process of change . To Lockyer we owe its far-off preface-reading in the chemistry of the stars . The dissociation of matter he thought to mark in the hottest of these suns is the point at least from which evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed proved true , but his suggestion of how and where to look for it is not by that impaired . Just as the real nebula was not as Laplace supposed , so with Lockyer 's dissociation of elements in the stars . Matter may not be resolvable in the manner that he thought , but that evolution is the inevitable concomitant of the process of cooling down , everything testifies to be the fact . Coming earthward from the stars , we can mark this causal cooling through the whole range of evolutionary development . One stage of it we see in the present con- stitution of the sun ; another in its retinue of worlds . In our great hearth-fire all substances are in their elemental state . It is too hot there for chemical affinity to act . In the major planets , where the heat is less , compounds have begun to form , but compounds of which we have no counterpart on earth . We note them by their unknown spectral bands , so beautifully brought out by Slipher , and we think they must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own world , where it is colder still , chemical combination has advanced yet further , and has been doing so increasingly since the earth began to cool . In the record of the rocks we read of eras when only the inorganic could exist . Then , as that same history reveals , the greater intricacy of the organic molecule became possible through the tempering of its habitat . The step was taken which seems to us so great but was in fact so small , the waking of the molecule to life . That its beginnings can not be reproduced in laboratories to-day is because the conditions that evolved them have themselves changed , and those conditions are well-nigh impossible of recall . In Lucretius 's words , our mother is now too old . Nevertheless , as Professor Jaggar has suggested , volcanoes , hot springs and their surroundings , the dying-out conditions of the primeval world , are the place to look for such instructive atavism to-day ; and there possibly a clue to it may yet be found . Meanwhile noteworthy experiments by Burke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to growths singularly simulative , to say the least , of the reality ; while still other very remarkable researches by Bose upon the responsiveness of metals , plants , and animals , go in another way to demonstrate them kin . Just as researches on this earth all point to the bringing forth of life by a planet as the necessary outcome of its own career , provided its physical condition be right , so has investigation in the sky . From our island home in space we may peer across to other islands voyaging through the void , and by telescopic help mark what there is going on . In very different stages we find them , of their own evolutionary career . Such diversity of itself attests a general development , for on no two were either the beginnings or the course the same . Some are youthful , some are old ; some were fairly like us at the start , some fundamentally diverse . Only where conditions are roughly similar could we expect to behold anything familiar , and even there it would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of the oneness of the whole . Now , within the last few years , research has brought to light testimony that our nearest of solar kin has had its organic history too . Upon the planet most likely to support such existence at the present moment , other than ourselves , study has disclosed features which can not be explained except as evidence of transplanetary life . Pregnant with thought this is , for it brings corroboration of the whole evolutionary process from beyond the confines of our native earth . That the inorganic should develop into the organic on a single planet might perhaps be accidental , but not on two . From Mars comes the cosmic assurance that it is Nature 's law . When now in retrospect we contemplate this growing recognition of the universe 's march , two thoughts come to us together ; one of admiration , the other of surprise . For a certain grandeur possesses us at the thought of man 's perception stretching out into the vastness of space , and by it being carried into the immensity of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and ten , and whose tenantable domain is the film-like cuticle of this small earth ; an inheritance shrinking , like Balzac 's Peau de Chagrin , year by year through his enjoyment of it . For steadily he is diminishing his supply : exterminating its simpler denizens , deforesting it of trees , and crowding it continuously more and more . That man , whose ancestors entered on all fours , should at last look 180 THE REVELATIOI  | up , then look before , and ultimately beyond , has in it force to fire imagination and clothe him with something close of kin to immortality . Side by side with this is the wonder that his awakening took so long . How man , so ingenious in what affects him , should have remained blind to the process of which he is a part , seems glaringly absurd . One had almost deemed the thought intuitive , did man not insist on testifying to the reverse . Darwin 's contemporaries refused even to consider his conception , demanding proof he had not to give , deaf to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Irishman who , when arraigned on a charge of theft , and asked if he pleaded guilty , said , " Faith , and how can I tell until I 've heard the ividence . " Logic is good , but the analogic at times does better . For there is nothing but what , by slow gradation , is turning into something else . The very world he lives in changes while he is there , and the earth he waked to as a boy , by middle age has already passed away . His very opportunity for noting was cause why he failed to see . What is oft repeated ceases to impress . Familiarity dulls perception , and leads us to accept as matters of course the daily miracle of the course of matter . His unique position as the highest product of that evolution up to date abetted his blindness . He was too self-centred to look around . The egotistic interest that nature gave him to further and perpetuate his kind grew by what it fed on , till in its overweening vanity it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think , we find him fashioning the universe about himself as core . His very fears and weaknesses receive anthropomorphic treatment at his hands , and hover round him to injure if not propitiated or cajoled . All else he finds designed to minister to his wants . The spot he stands on must be the pivot about which the very cosmos turns . The earth , forsooth , is the centre of the universe , because to have it otherwise de- tracts from his importance and minifies his fame . Around it must turn the sun , and about it revolve the stars . And all because nature implanted in him the sense of his own importance that he might the more evolve . Puppet of her contrivance , he has outdone her most sanguine hopes by taking seriously the flattery she meant for spur . The humoring of nature has its innate humor too . Out of this plane of myopic mediocrity rises now and then a man . A mutation , the biologist would call him , a sport . And the world 's sport he usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his fellows is cause for condemnation at once . All animals show the like aversion to what is not their kind . It is a well-known biologic law . The sole difference in the case of man is that mental variations are most hated by humanity , bodily ones by brutes . Only intrinsic excellence enables such mutations to survive ; the fact that they can stand alone in self-sufficiency . Now the chief distinction between this man and his mates is one so evident as at first to elude full recognition . For it is simply that he is intrinsically distinct . Not so much that his intellect is keener , nor that his energy is great , though both these are ancillary to the result , but that he sees things untrammeled by the prejudices of his time . He rises superior to the crystallized conceptions of the race . This may seem a trifling matter ; in truth it involves all . If we scan history we shall find that every age has had its dogmas in every branch of life , dogmas which have completely swayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcel of man 's constitution that this should be so . Without the balance-wheel of retarding conservatism , the human machine would run awry . Nor were such ideas blamable at the time they first took start . But not one of them but had become a debased fetish at the time of its greatest cult . Like coins that have long passed current , the face they stood for has all been worn away , though their face-value remains the same . The world that uses them as counters is a  | different world from that which gave them vogue . The quality of a genius consists in the ability to put off these shackles on reason and see things as they are . Bowing neither to custom nor authority , he perceives facts undistorted by the glasses society has self-imposed . Perspective orders thus the view ; and imagination synthesizes the survey to inevitable conflict with his time . Lamarck saw thus , and Darwin , too ; and both in their day were the abjured , not only of the ignorant , but of that lower class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facts . The fact-gatherer is a necessary factor in all advance , but for him to usurp its captaincy is like the labor-champion who claimed that labor built the railroads because it laid the rails . " Did you ever think , " said the man he addressed , " that the end attained depended on where the rails were laid ? By rising above the conventionalities and prejudices of his time , the genius attacks the problem with an open mind and gives his own fertility free scope . Had the old Greeks not been ingrained with the notion that the circle was the only perfect figure , and thus the only one that heavenly bodies could pursue , they might themselves have discovered the elliptic character of the planet 's paths . Kepler , by discarding the dogma , lit upon the law . So Darwin upset all tradition by looking it in the face . The eventual effect of such envisaging is twofold : direct , upon those capable of comprehending it ; indirect , in altering the mental attitude of mankind at large . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief function of genius is to change the world 's point of view . The point of view has more to do with comprehension than any amount of proof . We remember how Voltaire exposed the social fallacies of his time by introducing to their notice an unconventionalized soul , Candide , and narrating what befell him under the simple guidance of rationality and truth . How ill reason fared by the process , though every one professed to be governed by it , is there set forth . We all now see with Voltaire and are amused at the self-deception of two centuries ago . Yet the mass of us are just as blind when it comes to matters of to-day ; the objects have changed , the subject remains as before . ' The fact is , we believe we act from reason when reasoning shows we acted from belief . What we were taught in our earliest years is very hard to unlearn afterwards . And this is not only natural , but the expression of a fundamental cosmic law . One quality of matter is what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change of state ; if the body was at rest , at rest it stays if unimpressed ; if moving , it continues to move in the same direction and with like speed . It would go on forever in the same way , were no other force or friction to stop it . Now , ideas are just as subject to this basic principle as a cannon-ball . They require force to start them , but once started their momentum is immense . They go rolling down the ages long after the force that impelled them has been forgotten , so long since it was spent . Each century starts with the ideas it was bequeathed . To alter them is no easy task . For whether right or wrong their own inertia carries them on . Even the sun could not stop the earth in a moment . A new idea means the introduction of a new force . Now , no finite force can produce its full effect at once Time is necessary for it to tell , even were it to act unhindered . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ideas already in the field oppose it to the  | utmost of their power , with the dogged persistency of the popular precept : " Do n't push , just shove . " No wonder the newcomer finds it hard . When at last such a one has made its way we say , How simple ! forgetting that the half of genius is the ability to see clearly where others are preconceivably blind , the other half the force to set its concept going . The more fundamental the idea , the more it runs counter to current belief , and the harder for it to make headway . Neither strength nor courage is needed to profess what every one admits ; to progress needs both , opposed as it is , not only by the ignorant , but by the organized scientific orthodoxy of its time . For scientists , like other men , are prone to forget that the unaccepted of to-day is the established of to-morrow , and in their attitude toward new concepts remind one of the bashful young man who was afraid to propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That I should have a son who dared not come to the point . Where would you have been , I should like to know , had I not proposed to your mother ? " " Oh , that is quite different , " the son replied ; " you only asked mother . I have got to ask a strange girl . " Our scientific heirlooms are our mothers ; our own additions to science , the girl we have got to win . Every mother was a stranger once ? and the less near of kin , the fresher blood she brought . Especially is this the case where the new idea affects man 's vanity by lessening his self-esteem . Darwin 's ideas did both , and many of us can remember the storm of opposition they evoked . Not very creditable , as we look back upon it , to man 's intelligence , but understandable when we consider the underlying principle of inertia of mind . Perhaps no event ever brought it out more saliently , crowded with such cases as history is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here concerned . Proof , properly speaking , there was not . Yet the subversion was complete . Hardly a man of his own generation accepted his ideas ; not a man of the next but subscribed . But there is , unfortunately , a sad side to it which we shall do well to let sink into our hearts . A genius speaks to one world , only to be heard by another . The world of his own day turns a deaf ear to him , the world of the generation that comes after acclaims . The cause is none the less pitiful for being tautologic . Were he not ahead of his time he were no prophet . For a man to get the world 's ear while he is yet alive is his damning with faint praise . To be easily appreciated argues one too much a creature of the moment to outlast it long . Vox posteritatis vox veritatis . But think what this means to the man himself . Any one who has ever stood at night on some isolated mountain-top , held up unshielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his soul . Under his feet is naked rock , foothold and no more ; about him scanty air that yields the merest pittances of breath ; above , seemingly so close at hand , the silent void where shine the frosty stars amid the outer cold of space . Everything around him stands eternally inert . No sign of life , or even hint that such a thing can be , extends so much as mute companionship . Absent are the very fringes of his own existence deemed solitude below : the trees , the grass , the flowers . Only the great elemental forces exist for him , with which he has no kin , forces working out their alien ends with an indifference that kills . To oppose them all he has but his own unconquerable will . To be a pioneer in thought is to stand thus alone with nature , not for a few minutes , but for life . The isolateness of the few great minds of each generation of men is utterly undreamed of , for want of understanding , by those about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's days in a thought-world where the thinker roams alone ; to grapple with problems the very terms of which are beyond ordinary comprehension , and the solution appreciated only in years to come ; to  | contemplate in lonely ecstasy , after still lonelier despair , the revelation that comes with months and more of pondering . When some one asked Newton how he came to make his wonderful discoveries , he replied , " Simply by always thinking about them . " Consider Kepler toiling year after year fruitlessly for some ratio that should link the planet 's motions by a general law , calculating assiduously and putting hypothesis after hypothesis aside as he found it would not work , until at last , after almost inconceivable toil , he hit upon the one that would . As if this loneliness by nature were not enough , it must needs be accentuated by man . For he rises in such cases in chorus to condemn . Consider Darwin , in patient study , testing the working out of natural selection and adding fact to fact , only to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think you the denunciations of the master while living are wholly compensated by the plaudits after he is dead ? The loneliness of greatness is the price men make the genius pay for posthumous renown . To him we may never make amends . But we may vicariously atone for past stupidity by timely care not to commit the like ourselves . The truest tribute to the dead is not to praise him , but to practice the principle for which his life was great . Let us , then , free ourselves as much as may be from those blinding prejudices by which each generation seeks to better its successor . Let us be open-minded , and remember that the true regard is not to accept to-day what yesterday failed to appreciate , but to champion the advance that now is making while yet it is to-day . @#
