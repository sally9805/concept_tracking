txt Francis Hendricks of Syracuse , long prominent in the offices of the Republican Party in this State , will succeed Louis 1-7 .. Payn as State Superintendent of Insurance . Official announcement of this was made to-night by Gov . Roosevelt , who will send Mr. Hendricks 's name to the Senate next Monday night . The prediction is made that Mr. Hendricks 's nomination will be confirmed by the Senate before the adjournment next Friday . A caucus of the Republican Senators will be held early in the week , and it is believed that Mr. Hendricks will receive 2G of the 27 votes . The only Republican who May vote against the nomination is Senator Ambler of Chatham who represents Mr. 1 Payn 's home district , and it is said to-night that even Mr. Ambler may fall into line , as there is no possibility of defeating the nomination . In making the announcement that he had selected Mr. Hendricks , the Governor said : " Senator Hendricks was my first choice for the position , but on two occasions he said he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busi1 ness matters . I appreciate his acceptance very much . On Wednesday he telephoned me that he would accept . " I wish , to express my obligation to Judge Charles T. Saxton , ex-Senator Cuthbert W. Pound , and former Mayor Green of Binghamton , each of whom 1 considered for the office and to each of whom I witte concerning a possible appointment . Each of them told ins that he earnestly hoped I would get some one else to accept the office . " Judge Saxton desired to remain on the Court of Claims bench . Prof. Pound did not see how he could relinquish his chair at Cornell University . Ex-Mayor Green has business interests which would interfere with an acceptance . But cash said that he would accept if I found it necessary to name him . Judge Saxton wrote to me ? several days ago urging nee to prevail upon Senator Hendricks to accept . I have known I Senator Hendricks for a long period . We were in the Legislature together . He is an old friend of many years . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place only after being strongly urged by Senator Platt and other organization leaders , as well as Gov . Roosevelt . He has been identified with the machine , and ' when Senator Platt saw that the Governor was determined to replace Mr. Payn. even if he had to engage in a factional warfare , it is said that the State leader 's first choice was Mr. Hendricks . Much speculation is being indulged in here as to what effect the refusal of Senator Platt to stand by Mr. Payn. who for forty years has been his personal friend and political ally , will have on the State organization and also on the next cam ; paign . Mr. Payn 's friends say that they will oppose the renomination of the Governor , and that ex-Gov . Black will use his influence to bring about such a result . Some of the more radical Payn men threaten that a fight will also be made against Senator Platt with a view of driving him from his place as leader of the organization forces in the State . They say that they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-machine element in the Republican Party . and predict that the Senator 's reign as dictator of the organization is nearing its end . Should they fail to defeat Gov . Roosevelt for renomination these radicals hint at employing treachery at the polls next Fall . I Even conservative Republicans admit that they fear the Payn controversy will work to the serious disadvantage of the party ip the State . They argue that , while the friends of ex-Gov . Black and Mr. Payn might not be able to prevent the renomination of Gov . Roosevelt or force Senator Platt from his leadership . they could do great harm to the Republican State ticket next Fall . The story that Senator Platt is secretly working to have Gov . Roosevelt nominated at Philadelphia next June for Vice President finds many believers . The gossips have it that the machine leaders hope to have some delegate from a State well up on the roll call . such as Alabama . Arkansas , or California . present the name of Gov . Roosevelt to the National Convention , dwelling on his career as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NP* York 's Chief Executive . Those who hold this view say that the Governor would not be able to decline a unanimous nomination . There has been much talk to the effect that Senator Platt wants to remove Gov . Roosevelt from State politics and nominate a man for Governor . sirch as Benjamin B. Odell . Chairman of the Republican State Committee . whose loyalty to the organization has never been questioned . Mr. Payn Refuses to Talk .. Mr. Payn was in consultation with friends at the Grand Union Hotel last night . In reply to a request for his views on the Governor 's announcement of the choice of Mr. Hendricks , he replied : " Really , I have nothing to say for publication . I do n't know just what I shall do . " Friends of Mr. Payn. however , say that he realizes that he is beaten and feels more hurt than angry . While several prominent men want him to fight to the last ditch regardless of consequences , it is said by others in his confidence that he does not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . These men regard it as probable that he will retire without any further struggle . FRANCIS HENDRICKS 'S CAREER . Francis Hendricks was born in Kingston , N.
