txt Dun 's Index number for August bears witness to the moderation which aecompanies the unusual business now in progress . The most conspicuous fact is not the best proof of this . The decline in the price of breadstuffs during the month from $17.02 to $16.43 leaves little to account for in the decline of the general index number , including all commodities , from $105.21 to $102.98 , but the remnant of the decline is in fact the more significant fact regarding general trade . The decline in breadstuffs merely reflects the progress of the season and its accompaniment in an auspicious crop Outlook . The surprising thing Is not that wheat has fallen 10 cents a bushel , but that it retains its price so well in the face of a harvest which promises at worst to fall but slightly below the record , and which may set a new maximum . That the price holds so well attests the world 's need of our surplus , and holds out a promise that our exports may approximate the record of 233,000,000 bushels , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the farmers . As regards other foodstuffs , a trifltng gain in meats and miscellaneous food about balances the decrease in dairy and garden products . Clothing also is a trifle cheaper , and metals have risen from $16 . E14 to $16.78 only . This is perhaps the most significant and strangest entry of all . This is the first year to witness a production of 25,000,000 tons of iron , and it is practically all consumed . Yet the metal average is lower than it was at New Year 's . It is premature to suggest that the alteration from prince to pauper and back again , which has been the bane of the iron industry , is anywhere near its end , but there certainly is an indication of a better balance between supply and demand than existed , say , at New Year 's , 1900 , when the metal average was 818.085 , and a runaway market was in progress . Metals are not cheap now , but they remain at a level which permits their consumption , and therein lies the best hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is understood that this remark is not limited to the metal trade . Important as it is , it is inferior to the aggregation of industries which consume metals , and which would have to slow down , with hardship to laborers , if metals rose out of sight . The average commodity index is now high , if compared with the lean years from 1883 to 1901 , when it ranged usually several points below par , and never once reached 100 ; $102.98 now compares with $99.84 last year , and with $101.91 July 1 , 1902 . Recalling the uninterruptedly good times which have intervened , there is no basis for inferring anything speculative or feverish in the commodity markets . Is there any fair inference that prices are being steadied by the large aggregations of capital which are being prosecuted as public enemies ? We know that it is so in the iron trade , which is the only one in which the process can be clearly traced . If it is so in other trades as well , anything which promises a return of large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
