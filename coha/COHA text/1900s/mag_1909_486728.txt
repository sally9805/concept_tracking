- There has been no denial of the , statement , first explicitly made by the Washington correspondent of the Evemag Post , .. that President Taft intends to appoint Judge Lurton to succeed the late Judge Peckham in the Supreme Court . Indeed , the President has been avowedly conferring with members of the Senate Judiciary COmmittee for the purpose of discovering whether the confirmation of Judge Lurton would be opposed There is no objection that we have heard of except on the score of age . Judge Lurton is a Democrat , but might well be selected to succeed a Democrat His judicial record , with which President Taft 13 personally acquainted , is declared to have been honorable , and we know no reason to doubt it . But he is sixty-five years old ; and it is gravely open to question whether any man of his age should he named for the Supreme Court , especially in view of the present composition and needs of that body . Section 114 of the Federal Judiciary Act provides that " when any judge of any court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held his commission as such at least ten years , and having attained the age of seventy years , he shall , during the residue of his natural life , receive the same salary which was by law payable to him at the time of his resignation . " Later acts provide for retirement , with pension , on the ground of physical disability , short of ten years ' service . Now , of course , there is no direction here that a President shall not appoint a judge who is above sixty years of age , but it is at least a fair implication that Congress expected every Federal judge to be capable of serving ten years before retiring at seventy . We believe that when Mr. Edmunds was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate , he and his able colleagues , such as Senators Hoar and Thurman , insisted upon a strict construction of the statute ; they would not report favorably the nomination of any Federal judge upwards of sixty . The Judiciary Committee of-the present Senate , which is decidedly weak in its Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is announced that Senator Borah , who is probably the - best lawyer among the Republican members , though his name is at the bottom of the list , - has already seen the President and has agreed to waive his objection to Judge Lurton on the ground of age . It is to be presumed , therefore , that Mr. Taft can secure Lurton 's confirmation , if he makes a point of it . But that will not alter the misgivings of many persons whose only interest is in the strong personnel and continued usefulness of the Supreme Court . This conviction is not based upon a narrow interpretation of the Judiciary Act so much as upon the general principles which ought to govern , and upon the exigency which exists to-day in the Supreme Court . As a rule , everybody admits that a reasonably long service by the judges of the Supreme Court is desirable . It tends both to heighten its prestige and to give consistency and force to its decisions . If a powerful and dominating mind appears in the Court , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us say , service during a period of years will give it freer and richer scope , and leave a deeper impress upon our jurisprudence , than would be possible in a short time . And the abler the associates , of such a judge , and the longer their term of vigor on the bench , the greater will be the unity and weight of their decisions . All this is elementary , and there is general agreement that Federal judges ought to be under sixty at the time of their appointment . Historically , only six Supreme Court justices have been named at the age of sixty-one or upwards , the oldest being Mr. Lamar , who was sixty-three when appointed . The greatest actual need of the Supreme Court is the addition of one or two vigorous junior judges This is not to say that the older justices are incapacitated , or that we ought not to value their old experience . No one charges that their mental powers are unequal to their work . But there is also a physical strain put upon them , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger and more able-bodied associates . We refer , of course , to the hard labor which has to be expended upon the preparation of opinions . After the Court has decided in conference what view to take in a given case , there is need of prolonged industry in compiling precedents and examining the authorities and running down the citations in the briefs of opposing counsel , and then of care and pains in beating out the whole in a decision that shall be as lucid in form as it is masterly in substance A vast amount of this kind of work is constantly thrown upon the Court , and it is obvious that the older judges are not equal to the exertion required It is , we know , said of Judge Lurton that he is as robust at sixty-five as most men at fifty-five . But we can not disregard the law of averages in these matters . If a judge turns out in old age to be a physical wonder , we may thank our lucky stars , but we have no right in advance to count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , we have to reckon with the general expectation of life . We can not go on the supposition that every judge a President names will prove to be an Eldon And with nothing but regard , for Judge Lurton , we think that Mr ' raft would show a keener appreciation of what is lacking in the Supreme Court to-day , if he filled the vacancy with a younger man . SECRETARY BALLINGER 'S REPORT . It is doubtful if any annual report by a Secretary of the Interior was ever watched for as was that published by Mr. Ballinger last Monday . This is due not only to the importance of the matters dealt with , but to the controversy which has been raging , in the press and at public meetings , over the policy of the new Administration respecting what remains of the national domain . We have had a whole series of charges and rejoinders . Subordinates of the President have been almost literally flying at one another 's throats The dippute went such lengths of bitterness that Mr. Taft himself was finally compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the points at issue he definitely referred to Secretary Ballinger 's fOrthcoming report as a document which would cover the whole case in a way to satisfy all reasonable men . It would be too much to expect that the actual report will make an end of controversy , but it is only fair to saY that on the main question it is strong and satisfactory . After reading what Secretary Ballinger sets down about facts and policies relating to the conservation of water sources , it will not be possible longer to assert that there is a quiet official conspiracy on foot to alienate to the public harm public lands which are capable of being used to develop water power . The Secretary , of course with the President 's approval , goes so fai as to contend that such lands should never be patented to any private owners whatever  --  whether individuals or companies  --  but should be held in perpetuity by the Government . This policy , which we heartily commend , is not intended to eliminate private development of these resources . but the plan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leases , and not further to allow sale and ownership outright . Obviously , if a Water Power Trust has been , , as alleged , scheming to obtain for itself all the shores of streams in the Northwest , it must now consider its plans frustrated by the Interior Department . Indeed , so thoroughgoing is the project of control and regulation which Secretary Ballinger outlines , that we shall probably hear many cries of protest from Western Congressmen , and it may be from Western people . They will say that the terms laid down ace so onerous that no one will undertake to Meet them , and that these untouched lands will not be taken up and improved . But this will be for Congress to decide . As the President promised , the whole matter is sharply placed before those who frame the laws . to write the laws about law of the land . In the President and his Cabinet can only execute what they decree . The withdrawals of public land from entry are merely provisional , until Congress shall oetermine what is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official records show , as President Taft said they would , that no land whatever available for power sites has been restored to public entry by this Administration . The suspensory power of the Government has been duly exercised . It is now time for the law-making power to do its work . The Secretary 's report further calls upon Congress to amend the laws relating to the classification of public lands , which are now too roughly or vaguely defined . Much deception and fraud have arisen from patenting as timber lands areas which were really desired for mining . Mr. Ballinger urges that the law should be framed to describe public lands " according to their greatest apparent use , " as made evident by the studies of the Geological Survey . Far-reaching , too , is his recommendation that , in connection with coal lands , the right to mine should be separated from the title to the soil . We may also mention the Secretary 's request for an appropriation to cover the cost of surveying the railway-grant lands in national forests . He enumerates over 6,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been surveyed , : re not subject to local or State taxation . In this way , asserts . Secretary Ballinger , an " annual donation " of about $300,000 is made to these timber-land owners . He would , therefore , have Congress order the lands to be surveyed at once , and impose a lien upon them for reimbursement of the cost of the work . Outwardly and formally , then , we must conclude that the Secretary of the Interior has made a full answer to those who have been alleging that he was secretly in collusion with land-grabbers and monopolists . There is a sense , however , in which no answer has been made , and none can be made in writing . A vast amount of discretion is necessarily reposed by the laws in the Secretary of the Interior . Immense property rights are constantly coming before him for adjudication , and he may , always within the letter of the statute , turn the scale insensibly to the side of injustice or bad public policy . Hence the urgent need of having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his presence and charges of wrongdoing fall broken before him . It is to establishing a name for probity and official sternness , like Secretary Hitchcock 's , that Mr. Ballinger will need to devote his main energies , so that the people will believe that sound laws are energized in the pure and vigorous per : sonality of their enforcer . In that view , Secretary Ballinger is still on trial , as any new man in his office must be . THE COMMON . MAN 'S VOCABULARY . The gulf between life and the literature that pretends to mirror life is something we are always aware of , and something we always wink at We speak of Kipling 's India . But competent authorities tell us that not only do British administrators in India behave milts differently from Kipling 's heroes  --  which we might have guessed for ourselves  --  but they talk differently . People who know the Far West assert that the cowboy 's language is not Alfred Henry Lewis 's . People who know Alaska assure us that the English tongue in the Yukon Valley- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chimmie Fadden 's dialect is a highly polished elaboration of the real Chuck Conners . All this is familiar enough . What is not so commonplace is the difference between the way in which the literary man misrepresented life a hundred or even fifty years ago , and the way in which he does it now . To talk like a book in Jane Austen 's day meant something quite different from talking like a book in Richard Harding Davis 's . Once upon a time " affectionate and ever dutiful sons " wrote to their " beloved and honored parents . " Nowadays , if we may take the novelist 's word for it , " yours in haste , T. " writes to " Dear Pop " for a fat remittance A hundred years ago , as to-day , the scribblers have , as a rule , been false to the spoken language of life . One hundred years ago they rose above the vernacular . To-day we generally sink below it . The present hour has supplied us with two striking examples of how the common man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all facts , Death . Among the twenty men who were rescued after a week from the St. Paul 's mine at Cherry , Illinois , was an Italian , Joe Peggatti , who had drafted the following last testament , addressed to his wife : This is the fourth day we have been down here . That 's what I think , but our watches stopped I am writing in the dark because we have been eating the wax from our safety lamps I also have eaten a plug of tobacco , some bark , and some of my shoes I could only chew it I hope you can read this I am not afraid to die 0 , Holy Virgin , have mercy on me ? I think my time has come You know what my property is We worked for it together , and it is all yours You have been a good wife May the Holy Virgin guard you I hope this reaches you some time and you can read it . It has been very quiet down here , and I wonder what has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Samuel Howard was not so fortunate as Joe Peggatti . Rescue for him came too late ; his body was found in the second level of the mine , and with it a diary which he seems to have kept up until the last moment of consciousness . Some of the entries run : H I am dead give my diamond ring to Mamie Robinson . The ring is at the post office . I had it sent there . Henry Caumicent can have the ring I have home in my good clothes . The only thing I regret is my brother that could help mother out ' after I am dead and gone I tried my best toget out but could not . . . To keep me from thinking , I thought I would write these few lines . . . . Sixteen to 1 P. M. , Monday . The lives are going out I think this is our last . This is indeed simplicity of style , the simplicity which comes upon man in the face of ultimate facts . But its simplicity is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce Joe Peggatti 's or Samuel Howard 's last words to a mixture of slang , blasphemy , and ejaculatory heroics ; reduce him , that is , from a man thinking upon himself and Fate to  --  what is the favorite phrase ? ? a brute beast with his foot in a trap . Take the ordinary American in his normal condition , and nothing does him more injustice than the strong mixture of slang , expletive , and primitive vocabulary with which the literary man endows him . Actually , your farmer , clerk , or commercial traveller knows the meaning of long words from the Latin , likes them , and uses them , probably with greater frequency than the college professor outside of his classroom . The college professor says , " I missed my chance , " where the man in the subway says , " I overlooked the opportunity " ; the professor says , " Billy worries me , " where the man in the subway says , " Billy causes me anxiety " ; the professor says , " I bought myself some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L , completed my purchases yesterday . " Professor , artist , and literary man in revolt against the old conception of a book-language strive and attain the limit of baldness in expression . The tendency is emphasized by the literary tradition that high social standing goes with more or less complete inarticulateness . A real Bronx street-cleaner has been overheard saying to a fellow street-cleaner : " You are old enough to have conquered your timidity . " How many college professors would let fall a phrase , like that without feeling very priggish for five minutes thereafter ? Whether the cultured classes profess simplicity because it 's the right thing socially or because it 's the language of the Bible , novelists should not overlook the fact that butchers and grocers say " desire " for " want , " " precisely " for " just , " " magnificent " for " great , " and " substantial " for " a good deal . " If we need further proof we find it in the newspapers written for the masses . There is no stinting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your great popular tribunes . As a nation brought up on much oratory from the platform and the press , we naturally incline to the long , orotund word . As a nation of traffickers , we incline to the commercial traveller 's ideal of style , which takes the same direction Our cultured classes are under the influence of rugged British usage , which says " The Twelve o'Clock Sunday Closing Bill , " instead of " An Act for the Regulation of Sunday Traffic in Liquors " ; and says , " I am quite sure we can put you up , " instead of " Plenty of accommodation for every one , Bill . " It is greatly to be desired that Literature and the Drama should take notice of this fact .
