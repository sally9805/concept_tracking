txt The first section of the funeral train reached Canton at 11:20 . The climax of the great demonstration of sorrow that had been observed all the way from Pittsburg began at Alliance , eighteen miles from Canton . There the half-masted flags were bordered heavily with black , and it seemed as if every man , woman , and child was at the station . A big white streamer ten feet wine was across the main street , lettered heavily in black , " We Mourn Our Nation 's Dead . " The church bells were tolling dolorously . Then came the last half-hour 's run into Canton . Mile by mile , the approach was marked by growing evidences of deep personal affliction . Flags that had often waved a welcome to Mr. were now lowered in sorrow . Farmers and country folk generally seemed to have suspended work altogether ; the schools were dismissed , and the entire population was ranged along the track in sorrowful silence . The straining faces showed that the people took this mournful home-coming as a personal bereayement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if fathers . and mothers and sisters were watching for a glimpse of the casket that held their own loved one . At Maximo the country stores were heavily draped , and the townspeople packed the little station . Now the train was at Lewisville , only six miles from Canton , and soon the shops o ' the dead President 's muchloved native city were dotted - along the way For the first time the sun , which had been behind heavy black clouds , threw its rays on the gathered throngs and lighted up the sombre emblems of grief , and the entry into Canton was made in the bright sunshine . The sight was profoundly impressive as the funeral train chew into the little station at Canton at exactly neon . All about the station and banked deep in the surrounding streets were the friends and neighbors of the martyred President , while drawn up hack of the station were long lines of militia men at present arms . Immediately In the rear of the station , at the foot of Tenth Street . was Troop A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance of the line of march clear . THE CITY IN MOURNING . Up this street , soldiers , at intervals of ten feet , with difficulty restrained the solid wall of people . Canton had suddenly become a city of 100,000 , and the entire pop'elation was in the streets . The station ; tself was cleared , a company of soldiers of the Eighth Ohio keeping the platform clear . Opposite , over the heads of acres of people , on the wall of a big manufacturing establishment , was an enormous shield thirty feet high , with a black bordered picture of President in the centre . The local committee headed by exSecretary of State William R , Day and Judge Grant , were on the platform . All about were the black symbols of mournng . The approach of the train was unheralded . No whistle was blown , no bell was rung . At the mere sight of the train the people who had been waiting there for hours were greatly affected . Women sobbed and men wept . For a full minute after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his committee moved slowly down the platform in front of the line of soldiers to the catafalque car and waited . Suddenly Abner , in deep black , his face tense and drawn , appeared in the vestibule of the car next the one containing the body , and a moment later Dr. Rixey appeared , half carrying a frail and broken form . It Was Mrs. , arrayed in the deep , mourning . Beneath the heavy blac Veil she held her handkerchief to her eyes , and her slight figure shook convulsively . Gently she was lifted from . the car , and , supported by Dr. Rixey and Abner , was practically carried to a carriage inwaiting at the east end of the station . The door of the carriage was closed , and Mrs. was driven hurriedly to het. ' forlorn home , in North Market Street , which she-had left only two weeks ago with her-distinguished husband in the full vigor cf manhood. , Binghatri then gave directions for the removal of the . casket from the car . The Coffin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a broad window at the side wag unscrewed and removed . While this was going-on the. - floral pieces inside were carefully lifted out and placed upon the ground at the- side of the track . When all was ready the soldiers and sailors who had accompanied , the bony ail the way from Buffalo emerged from the car and took up their places . The soldiers trailed their arrnsat their sides and the sailors held their drawn cutlasses at their sides .

The sad procession was ham in full uniform , a bow of crepe at the hilt of his sheathed sword . Following , and immediately preceding the casket , was the local committee , headed by Judge Day . Then came the soldiers and sailors . Slowly , they moved down the platform to - the turn at the western end of the station , where the President and Cabinet stood  --  etathey reached the head of this line , a clear : - .. drawn bugle call sounded a silvery requiem .

All were attired in the full uniform of their ranks , The shrill notes of the bugles had given. the first sign to the waiting multitude outside the station that the casket was P.11 --  I proaching .

When the casket had been con- t signed to the hearse , three mounted trump- : ? ' ' , eters gave signal for the melancholy pro- - ' - ' 1 .. ? cession to move . A moment later the - el , sound of " Nearer , My God , To Thee , " ? ? 4 floated through the air . as the ' Grand. -  - -  1 Army veterans with their band swung into line and took up the march toward the Court House . THROUGH THE STREETS . Through Tenth Street and then to Cherry and Tuseara was , the solemn pageant:movea between solid masses of people , banked from curb to store front , crowding the housetops and filling every window . Turning into Market Street , the main thorough- : 4 , - 1-are of the city , the procession moved un- ?

After the Grand ' Army men came the Cleveland : troop , in their brilliant uniforms of Aus , .. trian ** with tall bearskin shakos ' f. ' topped by white pompons . From the , hilt of every sword streamed a long band of ' crepe , and the tiny silk guidon was topped with a long black streamer . Immediately following the mounted ; troops came the . hearse , bearing its flag-covered : a burden . was the sight that sent iv , e hush along the dense , long lines of him/tent-1 iii ty stretching for a mile away to the Court r House . As the casket passed , every head 1 was ' bowed and every face evidenced the , e great personal grief which had - come upon i the community . Immediately following the hearse came the carriage of Vresident Roosevelt , who rode with Commander Cov , les and Secretary Gage . Thy carriage of the other members of the Cabinet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public life sere lined out for half a mile . Back of them marched the National Guard of .

As the head of the procession reached the great square of the city the miiita ! * ranks swung about , forming solid fronts , facing the approaching hearse . As it was ? riven to-the curb the bearers stepped from their places alongside and again took , up their burden . Before the eyes of the vast concourse filling the square the casket was tenderly raised and borne up the wide stone . steps leading to the entrance of the Court use . The strains of " Nearer , My God , ta hee " were still sounding as the flagdraped coffin disappeared within the building . President Roosevelt alighted from his catringe and took the arm of Secretary  --  Gage . The other Cabinet officers joined them at the curb . and then . two by two . with bowed heads , they moved in solemn procession up the steps- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayors of many other cities . and . President of the CommissioniTs of the District of Columbia followed . while after them came Senators Hanna . Fairbanks , Burrows . Kean. and the other public men who were on the train . THE LAST FAREWELL . In striking contrast with the sombre garb of the civilian mourners were the brilliant uniforms of the officers high in the military and naval service who followed them into the Court House . Major Gen. Brookemarched at the head of the representatives of the army , which included Major Gens . Otis and . Among the conspicuous figures of the naval service were Rear Admiral Crowninshield , Rear Admiral O'Neil , Rear Admiral Kenney , and Brig . Gen. Heywood , Commander in Chief of the Marine Corps . With the notes of " Nearer , My God , to Thee " following them faintly through the doorway , the body bearers bore the coffin into the rotunda of the Court House a-little before 1 o'clock . The hall where the body lay in state in Canton had been handsomely decorated for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , the crape being gathered into folds at each corner of the rotunda . A single chandelier gave light . Beneath the cluster of electric lights stood the catafalque . Moving slowly , with short steps , the cofr fin was borne to its support . The bearers swung slowly around . so that the head lay to the east . The silk banner that was flung over the casket was drawn back , the wreaths which rested upon its head were eemoved , and the coffin lid was taken off . Word was quickly passed to President Roosevelt . atd. followed by the members of the Cabinet . he stepped briskly- into the hall . He glanced down as he reached the . casket , halted for the space of a breath . and went on . The members of the Cabinetfollowed him one by one . Twenty feet beyond the casket the hall branches to the right and left . aid as the . President reached the corner he halted , inf. : certain which way to turn . An usher at once directed him toward the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage , which bore him at once to the residence of Mrs. Elizabeth Harter . The Cabinet officials , most of whom also will remain at Mrs. Harter 's home , were driven away immediately afterward . After the President had gone officers.of the army and navy , headed by Lieut . Gen. Miles . Gens . Otis and Brooke . who walked together . passed out and entered their carriages . Objection was made by one of the army officers to the bright light shed by the electric light full on the face of the dead President , and a desire was expressed that , the light be dimmed . The chandelier was too high to reach . and delay of fully ten minutes ensued while search was made for a chair . One was finally discovered , and the light at the base of the chandelier-was extinguished and other electric light . globes on the chandelier turned off . The result was a decided advantage , the light : being ample , was much softer and - more in keeping with the occasion . A KINSMAN 'S GRIEF . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Templars , ' Canton Commandery No. 38 , had asked the priviReproduced with permission of the copyright owner . Further reproduction prohibited without permission . lege ' of posting a sentry over the casket while it lay in state . Charles Oberly , a business man of Canton , was the first Knight Templar to take his post at the head of the casket , and ' throughout the afternoon the guard was relieved ' every thirty minutes . At the foot of the- bier stood , at parade rest , -a National Guardsman of the Eighth Ohio Infantry . Ore.the right a Sergeant of Infantry , and on the left , a sailor . stood , with his hands clasped over the hilt of his cutlass . Four detachments of militia were marched into the hall and drawn up in a line , reaching from the entrance on the south to the bier . Another line stretched from the bier to . the place where the hall diverged , and down each side hall were other lines. - Strict orders were given to see that- there was no delay as ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything was ready for the public to , enter , Jdseph Baxton .. uncle of Mrs. , an aged man bowed deeply with the weight of years . entered from the east hall . and passed up to the casket . He , for fully two minutes gazing into the ' face - of his distinguished kinsman . He then passed slowly down the hail , - his head bowed low . his lips twitching convulsively . A few final details were arranged , and then the door was opened to the public . Two little girls were the first to approach the casket . Directly behind them was a tall , powerful man with a red mustache . As he gazed into the casket he caught his breath in a quick , sharp sob that was audible in every part of the hallway . He then gave way entirely , and weeping bitterly , passed out . Many of the people . as they looked upon the face of their dead friend whom they had seen but two weeks ago in full health , caught their breath at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they had expected it would be . and the sight that met their eyes shocked them greatly . IN THE COURT HOUSE . Throughout the afternoon this human tide pressed steadily forward to the bier . Four abreast , in double line , without a moment 's halt , the people hurried by the casket . and then , with tear-stained faces , passed out of the darkened chamber into the bright sunlight . In the line were represented all stations in life , all ages , all conditions . At one moment an old man , bent and withered , who had known " Mother " , tottered up to gaze ' upon the silent features . He was followed by a man of middle-age , who had gone to school with Mr. . Over on one side was the Knight Templar who had marched beside him in parades . All who came had some recollection of personal relation with the man lying there cold in death . Fathers brought their children and held them over the bier for a fleeting glance at the upturned face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight its little Mind could not comprehend . Toilers came from - the factories , and , dinner pails in band , trooped by the bier of him whom they called their benefactor and their friend. - Now and then knots of school children hurried past , awestruck at the gloom of this chamber of death . Often the guarding soldiers were compelled to step forward and gently restrain a hand that sought a blossom from off the flowerdecked casket . It was plain that a great flood of emotion surged in the hearts of these sorrowing people , Strong men made no concealment of their grief , their tense faces and tearful eyes telling of the sense of personal bereavement which had come upon them . Many women wept , and during the afternoon one young girl gave way to her feelings by loud wails which re-echoed through the darkened corridors . As the people hurried by they gave expression to suppressed exclamations of anguish at the sight of the pinched face lying there in the coffin . It was not the face they had known so well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not retained in their minds that picture of manly vigor which they knew so well . Many of his nearest friends refrained from looking upon the face , preferring to preserve the memory of him as in life . A COMRADE 'S TRIBUTE . Late in the afternoon an aged man , leaning upon two crutches , which he managed with difficulty , appeared at the door through which the people were making their exit . He asked the sentry to allow him to enter , and when the soldier refused , saying that he had received orders to allow nobody to enter through that door , the 41c1 ... man stood back the picture of woe . In it short.time he again ' asked the young sentry in pleading tones to allow him entrance through the doorway , saying that in his feeble condition he was not able to stand in the line which at that time was extending fully a- mile from the entrance . " , I fought in his regiment during the war , " ' he said , " and I just want to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -a remembrance of the time I saw him last . " " Take it in , " said the sentry , and the ' veteran hobbled into the hall . When he got inside he had more trouble , and was compelled to explain his errand several times . Finally the line passing the coffin vas stopped long enough to allow the old man to step to its side for a glance into the coffin , and to lay his tiny flag on its glass front . Then he turned back with the crowd , hugging the now sanctified flag tightly beneath his coat . At one time a group of school girls approached the casket . There were six of them , and they came three abreast . One in the forward row leaned over for a look , and disengaging from the bosom of her dress a scarlet geranium , laid it gently on the top of the wreaths that already rested there . The others followed her example , and although the sentries had orders to permit nobody to place anything upon the coffin or to touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girls were allowed to remain , and they were still en the top of the coffin when it was carried through the door on its way to the cottage . IN THE DESOLATED HOME . All through the afternoon the crowd passed the catafalque approximately at the rate of 100 every minute , making in the five hours in which the body lay in state , a total of 30,000 persons , practically a number equal to the population of Canton . When the doors were closed at 6 o'clock the line , four abreast , stretched fully one mile from the Court House , and people - were still coming from the side streets to take their places in line . At 6 o'clock the doors were closed to the public , and preparations made for removing the body to the residence . Canton Commandery of the Grand Army of the Republic acted as escort , and there was no following . Arriving at the house the escort formed in line in the street , presenting arms while the coffin borne by the body bearers was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor , where it will remain until it is removed to the church to-morrow afternoon . Guards were posted around the house to-night , and a number of sentries were placed in the front yard .
