 |p1094  THE great question that is of absorbing interest in aeronautics just at the present moment is the consideration of the relative merits of the dirigible balloon and the aeroplane when each is examined as to relative size . From a military , naval , sporting and commercial point of view this question is one that brings the whole subject of aeronautics into review , its history as well as its future . Every great development is usually invented in peace and tried in war , to be ultimately perfected after its weak points have been found out by the hardest use possible . It is difficult to tell whether the perfection of the rifle was due more to its use in war or to its use in sporting and hunting . It will also be hard to determine whether the governments , thru their army and navy officers , will do more to perfect the art of aerial navigation than private individuals for their own personal pleasure and scientific interest , or hope of ultimately making money . To my mind , the clearest way to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is lighter than air , and the aeroplane or flying machine , which is heavier than air , is to compare the former with the automobile and the latter with the motor-cycle . The air ship can be made large , as Count Zeppelin has so clearly proven , and can be made much larger still . Calculations exist , and have lately been shown , for airships from two to four thousand feet in length , with proportionate diameters and speeds of great rapidity . Such great ships as these would carry wheat from out West to Europe without transfer from car to boat and from steamer to car again , for it would have over the destination and discharge the cargo by gravity , simply opening the bottom hatches and letting the contents of the hold run out thru pipes into bins prepared for the purpose . Such large dimensions as these are probably more the result of mathematical calculations than any practical experience , but we must credit the largest ideas possible when investigating the limits of any subject in any one direction . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the surface increases only as the square , the air ship becomes much more efficient as its size increases ; the step from the " Robert Fulton " to the Mauretania " ( " Archaic , " " Titanic , " new ships of the White Star ) is probably no greater and more probably not nearly as great as will be taken in the same period of time in the development of this form of navigation , and we will compare the Santos Dumont with the " Cosmos " or the " Jupiter , " " Mars , " or any of the large air ships of the future which will sail around the terrestrial sphere like satellites . On the other hand , let us see what the future of the aeroplane will be . It would seem to go quite in the other direction , from the large size machine built by Sir Hiram Maxim , of 36o horsepower and correspondingly large wing surfaces and great weight . Mr. Langley 's machine had only 52 horsepower , and the French machines are built with hardly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " built at Hammondsport , had less than 40 , and the most successful machine yet built by the Wright brothers has a maximum of only 32 horsepower , not all of which is necessary to fly , and their early machine had a maximum of only 22 and used in flight little more than 16 . The surfaces of their machine are 40 feet wide and 6 feet deep , and the machine carries two persons , while the latest type of machine , not yet given to the public , as it is stated by Mr. Herring , its builder , is still smaller , being only 20 feet from tip to tip , and with narrow surfaces only 3 feet deep , altho the engines are more powerful , consisting of two of 20 horsepower each . The machine is made so it can be operated and kept in a very small space . Going one step farther in this direction , to the machine which is the limit of power flight , or consists of only the propeller and engine , or direct lift machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably find it the smallest of them all , as the structure and weight must be con/ centrated in the motor in order for it to have sufficient power to directly lift itself and operator into the air , and proceed just as the small beating-wing birds do , by their strength , in contrast to the larger soaring and flapping-wing birds . This seems clear , that the dirigible is drifting toward large sizes with large carrying capacity , and even robbing the aeroplane field , because all must use plane surfaces for rudders and to assist in keeping them from pitching when high speed is to be obtained ; while the aeroplane is being made as small as possible , altho speedy , and they probably will exist in very great numbers . If many persons are to be carried they will be accommodated by individual machines or sev eral of those which may be arranged to carry only a few each . From the military and naval point of view the two forms complement each other most perfectly . The dirigible is admirable for frontier defense and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extensive radius of action , in the largest sizes equalling the steaming radius of battleships . On account of its ability to drop explosives on vessels and to detect submarines and mines and operate over the water , it has great value in co-operation with naval vessels and fleets . The aeroplanes will be most useful in a scouting capacity , and easily transported to the vicinity of the enemy or the country to be surveyed ; they can rise and skim close to the ground , giving every facility to the officers in command to examine and ascertain where roads exist and what other natural conditions may be seen , while from a greater bight the enemy 's caps may be observed , with their formation and resources . If they are equally equipt with aerial machines , a battle may be fought in the air , altho these excursions would probably take place unawares , and it would result in a mutual desire to escape attack , as is the case with troops of cavalry which are sent out to feel the enemy 's position . The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air line without reference to roads will make it unexcelled for carrving dispatches , and it was suggested by Colonel Templar , formerly head of the Aeronautical Corps of the British Army , that the commanding officer might even lead his troops from a superior position in an aeroplane . No doubt the side which will have such an instrument will have a most decided advantage . the outlook from the side of sport and commercial interest is more distant , altho many sportsmen and amateurs are looking with longing eyes , and wishing for the time when they may enter the " motorists ' paradise " ? the realm of the air ? where there are no speed limits nor obstacles , no narrow or crowded roads , and no dust ; he will have to be very quick to run down birds or other flying things , altho Mr. Wright said that they often would run down and pass over meadow larks which were startled and tried to fly away from them while they were making their early tests at Dayton , Ohio . The extent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the aeroplane , may be suggested when it is considered as possible for an aeroplane to loop the loop successfully , and turn in any direction , and attain speeds of over one hundred miles an hour with little difficulty . The dirigible will , no doubt , come into the hands of the amateur first , altho there are many aeroplanes even now abroad operated by sportsmen , and even built for the sporting and scientific interest alone , which is sufficient reward in itself for solving the problems which come up . It will be necessary to have club grounds or to obtain the use of public places to make trials in , as a large . level space is required , and facilities for keeping the crowds in check , whose interests are so strong that they often do not realize the necessity of allowing the aviator freedom to land without fear of injuring any of the spectators . The ease with which the officers who were taught to operate the Baldwin dirigible at Fort Myer this summer learned their lesson speaks well for the simplicity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when refinements and comforts can be added , so that men of wealth may enjoy the pleasures of sailing thru the air at will , they will not be slow to . avail themselves of the equipment necessary for this most delightful of sports and inspiring occupation . As wireless telegraphy has made its place among the methods of communicating thought , and can do some things which no other methods can do , namely , reach ships at sea without competing with
