 | Few questions of international interest have called forth so much discussion during the past fifty years , or given rise to so many conflicting opinions as that of determining the political status of maritime canals . The Suez canal had been constructed and opened to the commerce of the world for several years before the diplomatic aspects of the problem attracted any very wide attention . In the case of the American canal , on the other hand , the diplomatic complications have preceded and in a measure deferred the work of construction for half a century . The recent Hay-Pauncefote Treaty , which was a complete surprise to the public on both sides of the Atlantic , has revolutionized the situation , superseded the older discussions of the question , and invested the subject with new interest . Five years ago no one could have foreseen that the course of world politics was soon to draw England into such close relations with the United States that she could gracefully surrender the rights she had so insistently adhered to in all previous discussions of the question and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the case . The Hay-Pauncefote Treaty can be regarded in no other light than that of a friendly concession on the part of England of rights which she indisputably held under the Clayton-Bulwer Convention . But , while , so far as accomplishing the immediate object is concerned , the HayPauncefote Treaty is a triumph of diplomacy , it can scarcely be regarded as a triumph of the principle of international law which it professes to embody , nor as a permanent adjustment of the canal problem . The treaty professes to preserve " the general principle of neutralization " established in Article VIII of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty , but its provisions ignore some of the essential elements of neutralization as that term is generally understood . The term " neutralization " is new , and its exact significance in international law is not readily determined . While the principle  | page deleted  | conventional neutrality , not terminable by volition of the state which accepts it or upon which it is imposed . In this sense Switzerland , which had been forced by Napoleon from her historic policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was declared a neutral state by the Congress of Vienna and placed under the collective guaranty of the Powers . The same principle was extended to Belgium in 1831 , and to the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg in 1867 . The treaty by which Luxemburg was neutralized provided expressly for the demolition of the fortress of the City of Luxemburg . The same status was imposed upon certain of the Ionian Islands , Corfu and Paxo , when they were annexed to Greece in 1864 . The treaty declares that " as a necessary consequence of the neutrality which the Ionian Isles are thus to enjoy , the fortifications constructed in the Isle of Corfu and its immediate dependencies , having no longer any object , shall be demolished . " At the Berlin Conference of 1884-5 , when the Congo Free State was established , Mr. Kasson , the delegate of the United States , proposed that the principle of neutralization be extended to the Basin of the Congo . As the greater part of this territory was held in protectorate or ill-defined sovereignty by the powers forming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action to the extent proposed by Mr. Kasson , but they agreed that in the event of war between any of the signatory powers on any question not connected with the Congo territory they would all use their influence to secure from the belligerents declarations neutralizing for the time being their African interests . The Geneva Convention of 1864 extended the principle of neutralization to persons and things , exempting from attack or capture surgeons , nurses , ambulances , and field hospitals . It follows from a study of the foregoing cases that neutralization implies : ? ( 1 ) A formal act or agreement . It is a matter of convention constituting an obligation ? not a mere declaration revocable at will . ( 2 ) It implies a sufficiently large number of parties to the act to make the guaranty effective . ( 3 ) It implies absence of fortifications . The mere existence of fortifications would impeach the good faith of the parties to the agreement . ( 4 ) It implies certain limitations of sovereignty over the territory or thing neutralized. ( 5 ) It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this it differs from ordinary treaty stipulations terminated by war between the contracting parties . A treaty establishing neutralization is brought into full operation by war . When we come to extend the same principle to waterways , however , we find the conditions to be altogether different . The first and most fundamental difference is that states have acquired by international usage and prescription rights and interests in the territorial waters of other states which they have no claim to exercise in respect to land . Secondly , armies and implements of war are absolutely excluded from the territory of neutralized states , while neutralized waterways are by design open to the innocent passage of warships , not only in time of peace but also in time of war . Thirdly , the warfare of the future will in all probability be confined more and more to the sea , thus enhancing the strategical value of waterways and canals which are adjuncts to the high seas as well as increasing the temptation to appropriate them for national purpose . The battle for the freedom of the high seas has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modified form to navigable rivers . The Treaty of Vienna ( 1815 ) laid down the general principle that the navigation of all rivers separating or traversing different states should be entirely free , from the point where each river becomes navigable to the point where it enters the sea . Certain specific rules were adopted and applied to the Rhine and to other rivers of Northern Europe . The free navigation of the St. Lawrence , while claimed as a right by the United States , rests as a matter of fact on the reciprocity treaty of 1854 and the treaty of Washington of 1871 . This extension of the principle of Mare Liberum to navigable rivers can hardly be called neutralization . It is merely for commercial purposes and rests on treaty stipulations that are terminable by var . The Treaty of Paris of 1856 not only extended the same principle to the Danube , but went a step further . In view of the difficulties of keeping the Danube open to navigation the river was placed under an International Commission charged with the duty of clearing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy complete neutrality . The neutralization of the Danube was further secured by the treaties of 1865  | and 1878 , the latter of which provided ( Article 52 ) : ? " All the fortresses and fortifications existing on the course of the river from the Iron Gates to its mouths shall be razed , and no new ones erected . No vessel of war shall navigate the Danube below the Iron Gates with the exception of vessels of light tonnage in the service of the river police and customs . " It is evident that this sort of neutralization which excludes war ships is a very different thing from the neutralization of a canal constructed in part for the accommodation of ships of war . Akin to this are the various treaty stipulations governing the use of the Black Sea . Until 1774 it was the practice of the Porte to exclude all ships from the Black Sea . After 1774 war ships only were excluded . Great Britain and other powers recognized this " ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire . " The restriction only slightly modified has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1856 , 1871 , and 1878 , all signed by the great powers of Europe . Hence these restrictions are binding , but they rest solely on treaty stipulations and not on the common law of nations . Article XI of the Treaty of Paris ( 1856 ) declares : ? " The Black Sea is neutralized : its waters and its ports , thrown open to the mercantile marine of every nation , are formally and in perpetuity interdicted to the flag of war , either of the powers possessing its coasts , or of any other power . " Exceptions were made in the case of small ships in the service of the legations , and a separate convention between Russia and Turkey provided for the maintenance of small naval forces on the Black Sea by both those powers . Article XIII of the same treaty declares further : ? " The Black Sea being neutralized according to the terms of Article XI , the maintenance or establishment upon its coast of military-marine arsenals becomes alike unnecessary and purposeless . " The term neutralization has likewise been applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain limiting their naval forces on the Great Lakes . While this arrangement has proved highly satisfactory and saves the enormous cost of armaments , it can hardly be called neutralization , since the treaty would be abrogated by war . Straits connecting high seas are more analogous to canals than any other waterways , yet even here the analogy does not carry  | page deleted  | spective canals , thus giving them something of an international character ; ( 6 ) in the Suez case the peculiar position of Great Britain in Egypt gives her practically a much greater voice in the control of the canal than any other power , while in the case of the American canal , the United States by virtue of her long declared policy with reference to the American continents claims a dominating influence in any canal that may be cut through the Isthmus . The Suez Canal has never been wholly divorced from the Egyptian question . Since 1840 Egypt has occupied an anomalous position among the powers of the earth . In that year Mehemet Ali , whose brilliant conquests threatened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious career by the intervention of England , and the status of Egypt was definitely fixed under guaranty of the Powers . Egypt was acknowledged as a vassal state of Turkey , under the hereditary rule of Mehemet and his descendants . In 1856 a firman was issued by the Viceroy Said Pasha giving de Lesseps power to form " La Compagnie Universelle du Canal de Suez . " Article XIV of the Concession declares that the canal and its ports shall be open forever as " neutral passages to all ships of commerce " without any distinction , exclusion , or preference of persons or of nationalities upon payment of regular tolls . Work was begun in 1859 and the canal opened with imposing ceremonies in 1869 . The attitude of England towards de Lesseps ' scheme had been one of uncompromising hostility . Lord Palmerston had used all the influence he could exert through his representative at Constantinople to prevent the concession . English engineers had declared the undertaking impracticable and the British press had predicted that the canal would be a failure commercially . No sooner had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizing its importance in world politics , saw the necessity of gaining control over it , or at least of preventing its passing under the exclusive control of any other power . The financial embarrassment of the Khedive Ismail , who squandered the revenues of Egypt in the extravagances of his court and in ill-considered public works , gave England an opportunity to gain a large measure of control over the canal , which Disraeli was quick to seize . The purchase by the British Govern- ment of the 176,602 shares held by the Khedive ( Nov. 25 , 1875 ) for 4,000,000 pounds marks a turning point in the history of the canal . It made England the largest shareholder and gave her an effective voice in its control . The French government had made inquiry as to whether Great Britain would object to the sale of the Khedive 's shares to a French company . Lord Derby in a dispatch to Lord Lyons November 20 , 1875 , replied that while all the credit of the undertaking rested with the French nation , three-fourths and nearly four-fifths of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that since the canal formed so important a link in their line of communication with India and Australia the arrangement most satisfactory to the British government would be that the canal should be placed under an international commission . In 1877 , during the war between Turkey and Russia , de Lesseps made a formal proposition to the British government for securing the complete neutralization of the canal in peace and war under guaranty of the Powers . The British government declined this proposition but at the same time insisted on the absolute immunity of the canal . Lord Derby notified Russia " that an attempt to blockade or otherwise to interfere with the canal or its approaches would be regarded by Her Majesty 's Government as a menace to India and as a grave injury to the commerce of the world , and that on both these grounds , any such step . . . would be incompatible with the maintenance by Her Majesty 's Government of an attitude of passive neutrality Her Majesty 's Government will expect that the Porte and the Khedive will on their side abstain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures likely to injure the canal or its approaches , and that Her Majesty 's Government are firmly determined not to permit the canal to be made the scene of any combat or other warlike operations . " The continued extravagances of Ismail Pasha involved the finances of Egypt in hopeless ruin , and led in November , 1876 , to the appointment of two Comptrollers-General of Egyptian finance ? one English and one French . This was another step in handing Egypt over to the foreign powers . The deposition and exile of Ismail followed in 1879 , brought about largely by the threatened intervention of Bismarck for protection of German interests ,  | though German interests were very small relatively . The native Egyptians now became restive under the burden of foreign influence and dictation . The Arabs also resented the preferment of Turks in the public service . " Egypt for the Egyptians " became the cry , and Arabi Bey the leader of the dissatisfied element . In this situation Mr. Gladstone 's Government took a firm stand against intervention or foreign aggrandizement , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not sought a control in the affairs of Egypt , but the logic of events soon compelled him to accept what Disraeli had bequeathed . Arabi 's outbreak began with the massacre of Alexandria June 11 , 1882 . At this critical juncture when England decided to bombard Alexandria , France showed a weak hand , and following the example of the other powers withdrew her naval force from the harbor , leaving England to act alone . In August , 1882 , General Volseley 's expedition reached Egypt . Wolselev seized the line of the canal and held it in the name of the Khedive in spite of the protest of de Lesseps that the canal had been neutralized . The British government paid no attention to this unilateral guaranty and the other powers as well as writers seem to have approved this action . Arabi 's forces were soon overpowered and he himself exiled . England was thus left mistress of the situation in Egypt and she had no thought of letting the opportunity slip . Russia would have given Egypt to England , if she could thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the powers of Europe generally . In explanation of England 's position Earl Granville , January 3 , 1883 , addressed a circular despatch to Paris , Berlin , Vienna , Rome , and St. Petersburg : ? " The course of events has thrown upon Her Majesty 's Government the task , which they would willingly have shared with the other Powers , of suppressing the military rebellion in Egypt , and restoring peace and order in that country . The object has happily been accomplished ; and although for the present the British force remains in Egypt for the preservation of public tranquility , Her Majesty 's Government are desirous of withdrawing it as soon as the state of the country and the organization of proper means for the maintenance of the Khedive 's authority will admit of it . " Granville then proposed that the freedom of the canal be guaranteed by  | page deleted  | final ratifications were exchanged at Constantinople and the provisions of this now celebrated Convention are for the most part well known . The Convention declares that the canal shall be open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace , to the merchant vessels and war ships of all nations , whether belligerent or neutral ; but no act of hostility is to be committed in the canal or within three marine miles of either end ; the entrances are not to be blockaded , and the stay of belligerent ships of war is limited to twenty-four hours ; belligerents are not to embark troops or munitions of war within the canal or its ports . Twenty-four hours must intervene between the departure of hostile war ships . Article X of this Convention provided that the foregoing provisions should " not interfere with the measures which His Majesty the Sultan and His Highness the Khedive , in the name of His Imperial ? Majesty , and within the limits of the firmans granted , might find it necessary to take for securing by their own forces the defence of Egypt and the maintenance of public order . " The British delegates at Paris had accepted this article only on condition that the clauses in italics be omitted . The omission of these clauses would have left the Khedive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than of his nominal sovereign the Sultan , free to call in British forces whenever he saw fit . The other delegates , however , insisted on the retention of these clauses and the final draft was accepted by the British delegates with an important reservation . At the last sitting of the Paris Commission , June 13 , 1885 , Sir Julian Pauncefote announced that the British delegates felt it their duty to formulate a general reservation as to the application of the treaty in so far as its provisions " might fetter the liberty of action of their Government during the occupation of Egypt by the forces of her Brittonic Majesty . " This reservation , which in view of the continued occupation of Egypt by British forces must still be taken into account , seems to have been overlooked until attention was called to it by the British government during the recent war between the United States and Spain . July 1 , 1898 , Mr. Davitt made inquiry in the House of Commons as to whether the delay of the Spanish warships at Port Said was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Curzon , the Under Secretary for Foreign  | Affairs , made answer : " The provisions of the Suez Canal Convention to which the honorable member refers have never been brought into operation . The question of the duration of stay of foreign vessels at Port Said is primarily for the decision of the hgyptian Government , and there has doubtless been good reason for the course adopted in this case . " This rather surprising statement was further elucidated a few days later in answer to another question . July 12 , 1898 , Mr. Bowles inquired whether the Convention of 1888 was still in existence and in operation . Mr. Curzon replied : " The Convention in question is certainly in existence , but , as I informed the honorable member in reply to a question some days ago , has not been brought into practical operation . This is owing to the reserves made on behalf of Her Majesty 's Government by the British delegates at the Suez Canal Commission in 1885 , which were renewed by Lord Salisbury , and communicated to the Powers in 1887 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the neutralization of the Suez Canal can not be regarded as complete ? certainly not yet as absolutely effective . When we come to consider the numerous agreements in regard to an Isthmian Canal , we find that they all contemplate neutralization . In Article XXXV of the Treaty of 1846 with New Granada ( now Colombia ) , the United States guarantees " positively and efficaciously " to New Granada " the perfect neutrality " of the Isthmus , though nothing is said of inviting the guaranty of other powers . This feature was , however , embodied in the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1850 , which after establishing the general principle of neutrality for all waterways through the Isthmus at whatever point , provides that the canal " shall also be open on like terms to the citizens and subjects of every other state which is willing to grant thereto such protection as the United States and Great Britain engage to afford . " The contracting parties further engaged to invite the adherence of friendly states to the convention . Likewise Article XV of the Treaty with Nicaragua of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend their protection to all such routes of communication as aforesaid , and to guarantee the neutrality and innocent use of the same . They  | also agree to employ their influence with other nations to induce them to guarantee such neutrality and protection . " In the British treaties with Nicaragua ( 1860 ) and Honduras ( 1864 ) the same principle is adopted in substantially the same language . Into the intricacies of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty and the controversies to which it gave rise ( now happily ended ) it is needless to enter . Mr. Blaine , thirty years later , declared that the treaty had been " misunderstandingly entered into , imperfectly comprehended , contradictorily interpreted , and mutually vexatious . " Unfortunately Mr. Blaine seems to have been obtusely regardless of the fact that the controversies to which he referred had long been settled , while he was raising an entirely new issue in his efforts to secure a modification of the principle of neutralization , about which there had been no misunderstanding . Mr. Blaine expressed the hope that Great Britain would " concede certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Frelinghuysen went a step further and pronounced the treaty to be " voidable at the pleasure of the United States . " He did not venture , however , to declare it " void , " great as was his desire to have it out of the way . Both Blaine and Frelinghuysen approached the subject from the wrong point of view . Their arguments were disingenuous , to say the least , and were without logical consistency or moral force . At any rate , so far from bringing about the desired changes in the treaty , their only effect was to strengthen the British government for the time being in the determination to hold us the more strictly to the terms of the Convention . Later Mr. Olney , in a review of the situation , declared : " Upon every principle which governs the relations to each other , either of nations or of individuals , the United States is completely estopped from denying that the treaty is in full force and vigor . If changed conditions now make stipulations , which were once deemed advantageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in ingenious attempts to deny the existence of the treaty or to explain away its provisions , but in a direct and straightforward application to Great Britain for a reconsideration of the whole matter . " It was precisely in this spirit that the Hav-Pauncefote Treaty was negotiated . The original draft of that treaty ( February 5 , 1900 , ) provided for a neutralized canal and adopted rules sub- page deleted  | sion deliberately omitted from the revised treaty leaves the United States free , by implication certainly , to fortify the canal in case of emergency . Such would seem to be the British view of the treaty , as expressed in a memorandum by Lord Landsdowne ( August 3 , 1901 , ) communicated to Mr. Hay through Lord Pauncefote . He says : " I understand that by omission of all reference to the matter of defence the United States government desire to reserve the power of taking measures to protect the canal , at any rate when the United States may be at war , from destruction or damage at the hands of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to deny that contingencies may arise when not only from a national point of view , but on behalf of the commercial interests of the whole world , it might be of supreme importance to the United States that they should be free to adopt measures for the defence of the canal at a moment when they were themselves engaged in hostilities . " In the fourth place , the omission of the clause " in time of war as in time of peace " leaves the United States free , by implication at least , to modify or suspend in time of war the rules governing the use of the canal . These modifications of the Convention of 1888 are a distinct departure from the principle and practice of neutralization . It is rot probable that the United States will resort to fortifications . Expert military opinion seems to be opposed to them Col. Peter C. Hains has stated very emphatically : " An adequate defence of a fortified isthmian canal can be made in no other way than by providing a navy of sufficient power to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our command the canal needs no fortifications . " Admiral Dewey said in an interview : " Fortifications ? Why , of course not . As I understand it , the canal is to be , and should he , a neutralized commercial pathway between the two great oceans . To fortify it would simply result in making it a battle ground in case of war . Fortifications would be enormously expensive , and ought not to be erected . Our fleets will be a sufficient guarantee of the neutrality and safety of the canal in time of war as well as in time of peace . " The fact that the conditions of the two canals are so similar and that the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty professes to adopt the Convention of 1888 as its model would seem to point to the conclu- sion that the status of the two canals will ultimately be the same . It is evident from the facts brought out in this paper that England and the United States have pretty much their own way in regard to the Suez and American canals respectively . Whether their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military control can be tested by experience alone . The majority of writers on the subject are strong advocates of neutralization and this principle seems to be in line with the general tendencies of international law . But the question as to the future status of the American canal at least is more or less speculative . The facts of the case are that we are about to build a canal which will be a most vital point in our line of defence . In case of war with any power other than England , England 's attitude being what it now is , the canal would probably be a source of little danger . But in the event of war with England the treaty would go to the winds without the guaranty of other powers , and the canal would undoubtedly be the center of attack . Since this is a possible contingency the construction of a canal adds to the already imperative demand for increased naval strength . But war with England , we hope , is a contingency very far removed , and we look forward with confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between England and the United States which constitute the highest guaranty of the political stability and moral progress of the world .
