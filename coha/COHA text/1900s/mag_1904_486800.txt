Word comes from Iowa that the Republicans of that State are to organize paraders for the campaign under the title of " Knights of the Big Stick " The idea is , of course , to brazen out one of the objections to President Roosevelt . There have been instances where a term of reproach has been defiantly taken up and worn as an ornament , but never anything quite like this latest " Iowa idea . " Here is a great agricultural State , sown with schools and dotted with churches . Its senior United States Senator , Mr. Allison , is the great economizer at the head of the Committee on Appropriations . He has been supposed faithfully to represent his constituents in standing for thrift and peace Yet we see the most sedate and moral among them  --  at least , men asserting that they are such  --  ready to embark on a madcap policy of huge expenditures leading to war . Either that , or their proposal is a foolish trifling with the greatest national concerns , in itself almost as unworthy and menacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say this , because we believe there is a profound and needed truth in a sentence of the " Appeal to the Nations " issued by the Peace Congress on Saturday . It is the one calling upon intelligent people everywhere to " arouse themselves to a finer and more adequate conception of their rights in the determination of the foreign policies pursued by their governments , that they may no longer be involved in foolish and ruinous wars with other Powers . " Here is indeed the fens et origo of modern wars . They are made not by the people , but by diplomats . They spring not from race jealousies or international hatreds , but from the negotiations , the exigencies , too often from the diseased pride or the political ambitions , of Foreign Secretary or President . Relations between nations are subtly inflamed and secretly poisoned by those in charge of their foreign policy ; the people are left in the dark , all unknowing , when suddenly the announcement is made of a strained and acute situation , the press sounds the trumpet , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds itself at war , it knows not how or why . That is an exact description of some of the most terrible of recent wars . The Boer war was made in the office of Colonial Secretary Chamberlain . He kept not only the English people , but even his own chief , Lord Salisbury , practically in ignorance of the dangerous path he was treading , and they ? saw not that it led over a precipice until it was too late to draw back . No one can follow the diplomatic negotiations preceding the war between Japan and Russia without perceiving that it was the dictators of foreign policy who brought on the countless woes we have seen . It was true of Russia , at any rate , that her people dreamed not seriously of war , were averse to it , and went into it finally with unconcealed regret and reluctance . They furnished a grim illustration of the power of a haughty or unscrupulous man clothed with great but passing authority , to Plunge a mighty nation into mournful disaster . Such a danger is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of their form of government . We have no autocracy , but we have a President vested with enormous Powers . They are greatest of all , and most perilous because most vague , in precisely the region of foreign policy . Stevens , in his ' Notes on the Constitution , ' cites a private conversation he had with ex-President Hayes , in which that experienced man pointed out the possibilities of the indefinite " war powers " in the hands of a reckless or ambitious President . A Caesar or a Napoleon , if so minded , could easily run his course under them How imminent the peril of their abuse may he , with the people all unwitting , President Roosevelt showed us in his dealings with Colombia a year ago . In reality , he went to war with that country , of his own volition . Not one of his learned defenders who have talked so much of his Constitutional right to " recognize " the unhatched republic of Panama , has ventured to touch upon Mr. Roosevelt 's order to prevent Colombian troops from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubted act of war . If the chivalrous President had not picked out an emaciated invalid to beat with his stick , a bloody conflict would at once have followed ; and he alone , without act of Congress , by no mandate of the people , would have been responsible for the desolating consequences . As it turned out , Colombia being too weak to resent our defrauding and bullying , Mr. Roosevelt was simply responsible for one of the meanest and most dishonorable acts that ever stained our diplomatic annals The moral of the " Appeal to the Nations " is not that foreign policy should he determined in mass meeting That is not intended by the advice to keep a more jealous eye upon its conduct . It is impossible to strip our Presidency , for example , of its great powers in international relations . But with the great rowers should go great prudence , large sagacity , restraint , gravity , a knowledge of the law and a willingness to abide by it Let us not think of abolishing the powers , but of getting men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a President who recklessly swings his club among all the breakables of the Foreign Office , let not a sober people fail to rebuke him , at the first opportunity , for what is either his incredible levity - in an exalted station , or else a recklessness which can only be called criminal . If they show that they are ready lightly to condone Mr. Roosevelt 's beginnings of mischief , they can not complain if , with a popular election as his ostensible warrant , he should let his dangerous policy bring forth its perfect work In that case , the Iowa farmers and church-going merchants would look in vain for the peale in which their truest interest he s , and would find the Big Stick , of which they propose to make a campaign jest , coming down in sober earnest , but upon their own heads . THE WAY TO SEEK PEACE . It is a remark of the great Roman historian that it is easier for evil-disposed men to agree in promoting war than it is to unite those desirous of peace . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday . With the aims of that body we are in the heartiest sympathy . Its deliberations have been , for the most part , admirable in tone , and its resolutions went straight to the duty of saving the nations , not only from insensate war , but from being crushed to the earth by insensate armaments in time of peace . Still , when it was a question of following up sound doctrine with individual application , there was a division of opinion and a strange hesitancy in pressing truth to its conclusion . The Congress was willing to seek peace by commendable generalities , but apparently not to pursue it by an unflinching rebuke of those who are seeking war . The report on the " reduction of armaments " thanked President Roosevelt for his promise to summon another Hague Conference , and expressed the opinion that its " first act should be a plan for the arrest and ultimate abolition of armaments , " which the previous Conference had declared to be " a crushing burden on the whole world " Excellent , said one delegate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something practical . If we are to disarm , let Messieurs the Armors begin ' Accordingly , he introduced a resolution setting forth that , whereas no European country has the intention of invading an American country , there is no need of suspicion against our neighbors , and there is no necessity for the increase of our naval armaments . " Instantly there was heated objection One of those retired generals who usually furnish the bellicose elethent in peace congresses. took the fiJor to protest against such a reflection on the Government of the United States . He " stood there as an old soldier , " etc , to say that a huge American navy meant the upholding of the Monroe Doctrine , and that meant peace . So the resolution was voted down . This convenient lugging in of the Monroe Doctrine as an excuse for arming to the teeth , is an artifice which has been worn thin by too much use . If no foreign nation took a step which threatened violation of the Doctrine , even when we had no navy worth speaking ot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the determination were to have swollen armaments at all hazards , and that the need of sustaining the Monroe Doctrine is simply a pretence . In itself , at any rate , the argument will not bear examination . If a big fleet is our sole bulwark of peace , then we ought already to he at war , since our navy is far surpassed in strength by that of Powers who , according to President Roosevelt , are prevented from attacking us only because they fear us . All this is to turn things upside down , and to convert security into a reason for distrust This whole conception of the Monroe Doctrine as a great guarantee of peace that keeps us constantly in dread of war , and compels us to endure the burdens of war even when nominally enjoying the blessings of peace , is so absurd that it almost seems as if Pope had foreseen it when he wrote in the " Dunciad " of the place " . . . where Folly holds her throne . And laughs to think Monroe would take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hollow It will not bear the weight of a good history . The facts make it collapse . This cry is simply a variant of that of ambitious rulers in all ages Napoleon III had no Monroe Doctrine , but he had the Empire " L'Empire , c'est la paix . " But everybody knows now what a barefaced lie that was . The display of might provokes rivals ; it does not intimidate and certainly does not conciliate them . If enormous armies and great naval strength insure peace , why are Russia and Japan fighting ? Take the case of Germany today . Why all these international jealousies on her account ; why the irresponsible talk in our navy that " we shall have to lick Germany next " ; why the organized campaign of the newspapers and military experts in England to bring on a war with Germany ? Simply because Germany has a navy , strong already , and to be made stronger . But for that , it is certain , we should not hear from so many quarters Delenda est A70- 7,7 , annia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory , should have greatly increased the chances of peace . has , in fact , diminished them . We look for peace , and lo ! a sword It is necessary to think clearly and speak frankly about this matter . Peace does not depend upon fear . It goes with good will and mutual respect . Threats are a vain thing for safety . The nations willnot embrace each other at cannon 's mouth or bayonet 's point . Peace kept by the stronger ? What is it that has made the history of the Anglo-Saxon race so painfully near Wendell Phillips 's description of it as " a drunken revel of blood " ? The law of the strong which is , not peace , not forbearance , but aggresmon and bloodshed . We must clear our minds of this cant about the needless multiplication of the engines of war being really a peace measure . That is not their real design ; that will not be their actual effect , unless history needs to be rewritten and human nature is radically changed from what it always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congresses be if they boldly utter them War is a game which kings would not play if their subjects were wise , and it is also , as Shelley tells us , " the statesman 's game " ; so that it is the duty of those who make and unmake statesmen  --  namely , the people who have to pay the taxes and furnish their bodies as food for cannon  --  to insist by voice and pen and vote that , war , and the huge armaments that lead to war , shall be kept out of their thoughts and plans . CONFUSION IN WISCONSIN . It would have been hard for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to hand down a decision which would have less influence on the political situation than will that of October 5 . The outsider , no less than the citizen at home , has longed for the chance to say , atter a judicial review of the Republican split , " At last the situation is clear . Now both sides know where they stand . " As a matter of fact , the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Democrats have promptly declared that the election of Peck for Governor is now certain , while the Republicans , with equal manifestations of delight , assert that there is no longer any doubt of the State 's electoral vote for Roosevelt . Wisconsin thus joins that extraordinary Troll of States which the Republicans claim for the national ticket , but concede to the Democrats on State issues . One thing , at least , can be assumed ' no considerable number of the men who burned their bridges behind them last spring and have taken part in the Stalwart campaign during the summer , will vote for La Follette now It is questionable if many of them ever intended to support even their own respectable third ticket . Those who did , now that the right to the name " Republican " is taken from their nominee , can with clearer consciences vote for the Democrat . If the decision had gone the other way , there would have been at least a sentimental obligation to vote the ticket pronounced " regular , " though among the La Follette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Federal crowd " which they might have gratified by " knifing " the national ticket . In much of the discussion of the Wisconsin complication , ( critics have failed to ? realize how overwhelmingly Republican the State was to start with The percentage of Republican " scratching " which would elect Herrick in this State , would hardly attract attention in Wisconsin . La Follette was first elected Governor an 1900 by a plurality of 103 , - 745 out of -a total vote cast of only 441 , - 900 . In 1902 , with a vote but little more than one-half as large , he had 47,599 votes more than his - opponent . The ratio of Republican to Democratic votes in his first election was about as n to 7 . In 1902 it was about 4 to 3 . Thus , if we figure upon , the 1900 returns , fully one-fifth of ' the Republicans must go over ' to change the result , while on a basis of the 1902 figures the proportion must be about one-sixth . Nobody knoWs the exact numerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than a fifth of the Republican party . It elected only a little less than half of the delegates to the last State convention . It has the support of a majority of the Republican papers of the State and the services of most of the old party " war horses . " The railroads and the manufacturing interests are with it . Counting as a Stalwart every believer in Republican policles who is for any reason opposed to Gov . La Follette , the faction - cannot have been very much weaker numerically than that which supported the State Administration . Yet possible danger to the national ticket may come from the very strength of the faction which the national convention recognized . Say that 20 per cent . of the Republicans must vote for Peck to elect him . Only a mere handful of ' these need take the trouble to mark their ballots for Roosevelt electors to make the national ticket safe . But ' suppose two-fifths of the Republicans leave La Follette , and the Democratic Governor gets an overwhelming majority . Then the electoral ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolting Republicans vote split tickets and mark every Roosevelt elector separately . In fact , there Will be a good number of " fair-minded Democrats " who will vote for La Follette and Parker electors . He would bg rash indeed who attempted prophecy on the data at hand , yet there is certainly no reason for abandoning hope either for a Republican Governor or Democratic success ' on the electoral vote . The local campaign is now under way , and it shows that in one State , at least , the charge of " apathy " is unfounded . Men who concede the truth of many of the ' Stalwarts ' charges are supporters of La Follette ; men who believe an sill of the Governor 's measures joined in the " bolt " last spring . M. G. JefIris , the presiding officer of the " rump " convention , fired the opening gun of ' the Stalwart campaign in ' Milwaukee the other clay . As the Sentinel put it , " For the first time Since ' he began his campaign of vilification and inisrepresetnaition tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . La Follette hayQ been met and refuted from a Republican platform by ' a Republican speaker . " His specch dealt almost wholly with the charges against La Follette as an administrator . He dwelt on the shortage in the State Treasurer 's office , the high tees charged the Prudential Company by the Insurance Commissioner for an examination . He described the increase in State expenses ; denounced La Follette 's political methods , as in the use of game wardens to look after his interests ; charged him with defaming the good name of the State , and with haying secret understandings with the railroads and seeking faVors from them while fighting them openly . But as to the measures with which La Follette is identified , half the shots tit no mark . La Follette wants a primary law . Mr. Jeffris was himself opposed to it , yet he pointed out that the Stalwarts were willing to extend the direct primary to 1,100 offices , and joined in submitting to the referendum the more comprehensive bill . On this , the allegation - against the Governor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Follette wants a railroad commission , partly elective and ? partly appointive . The Stalwarts want it to be entirely elective . La Follette wants the railroads taxed on an ad-valorem basis . So do the Stalwarts ; in fact , they trace the origin of the plan to Senator , Quarles . One sees - how issues cross each other and personalities collide in this remarkable ' Wisconsin . campaign . PROGRESS OF PRIMARY REFORM In the present status of the direct-nomination discussion in this country , general arguments on the theory should give place to study of experiments and the working out of safeguards against - the incidental evils . Primary reform is receiving attention in a number of States this year . Oregon is to make the first trial of a direct-nomination law passed last June . In Wisconsin the most comprehensive act of this kind ever proposed in a Northern State will be submitted to the voters . In Illinois , Charles B. Deneen , the Republican candidate for , Governor , is strongly advocating legislation along the same line , and declares that if he is elected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished , he shall consider his administration a failure . Minnesota and Massachusetts have , within the last fortnight , nominated candidates by the direct primary . - The Minnesota primaries have been - followed by the usual criticisms , which point out three objectionable features interference with one party 's nomina- , tions by members of the other , undue advantage to men whose names are widely known ; and the display of petty prejudices . The St. Paul Globe asserts that the voter who would use the blanket ballot provided by the old primary law to vote for candidates of the other party , now , under the amended law which requires a public declaration of party allegiance , " lust as unblushingly demands a ballot of the party to which he does not belong , and does the same thing . We have violated the principle of secrecy of the ballot , " it concludes , " without any gain whatever . " The Minneapolis Journal applies the second criticism pointedly to the overwhelming victory of the extreme " stand-patter , " Congressman McCleary . Seventy-five per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it says , " and with a decided dip at that . " There was a sharp fight against his renomination . Yet the opposition vote was only a few hundred . " The people of the Second District sacrificed their political views in a political campaign for the personal benefit of a man they knew and liked . " A defeated candidate spoke of another weakness , namely , that " a candidate has small chances of winning unless his name ends with a ' son . ' " This is the same difficulty that was met in the aldermanic primaries of Boston last winter , where the leaders could not get the Democratic voters to nominate any candidates who did not have Irish names . It was promptly pointed out , to the discredit of the primary law , that the notorious " Doc " Ames , whom the most brazen of bosses would hardly dare to offer for an elective office , and who probably would not have had a vote in an open convention , came in third with 5,000 votes in one of the Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note that , by this same primary , the Republicans nominated for Mayor D. Percy Jones , the man who , as president of the aldermen , took hold and cleaned up the Minneapolis city government when Ames ran away . The direct primary , in short , is neither a failure nor a panacea . When the issues are clearly defined , and the electorate is interested and conscientious , its advantages over the convention are so obvious that there is little to be said on the other side . But when the campaign is listless and there is nothing particular o vote about , the nominations which it makes are no better , and may be worse , than those which an enlightened and sagacious leader would dictate . As people become accustomed to the direct primary , it may work better . Voters will perceive that the same judgment is necessary in the primary as in the election itself . Meanwhile there are details deserving attention . The most serious difficulty in practice has been to prevent one party from interfering with the other 's nominations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his party allegiance at the polls . There has been strong objection to this in both States , and conscientious men have refused to vote on account of it . One reason for the general satisfaction with the workings of the direct primary in the Southern States is that this trouble is almost entirely absent . It is the practice in many localities to allow any white man to vote in the Democratic primaries . Oregon 's new law requires the voter to enroll at the spring election in order to take part in the fall primaries . There is some embarrassment just now because the law was passed after the spring election and no one had the chance to enroll . But the general principle is. that of the law in New York , which demands enrolment for the primaries so long beforehand that the contests in the party will not ordinarily have shaped themselves . The framers of the law which will be submitted to the referendum in Wisconsin sought to avoid the declaration of party preference , and at the same time discarded tine blanket ballot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks a bundle of ballots , one for each party important enough to have a column on the regular election ballot . He will mark only one of these , but will fold them all , and , passing out , deposit the marked ballot in one box and the unmarked ballots in another . The inclusiveness of the law may be its strength . It applies to the Governor and all State officers , county officers , members of the legislature , Representatives in Congress , United States Senators , and party committeemen . It is believed that every voter will take an interest in the contest for some one of these positions , and will therefore not throw away his vote purely to embarrass the other side . Another interesting feature of the proposed Wisconsin law is that relating to party platforms . It provides that the candidates for State offices and for the Legislature shall meet on the fourth Tuesday of September , and there adopt the platforms of their respective parties . The theory of the convention system is that the party first lays down its principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In its immediate workings this law seems to put men above policies , though undoubtedly the campaign preliminary to the primary will bring out the issues sharply enough  --  when there are any . THE SPANISH WAR CLAIMS . Few except those directly interested care any longer about such far-off , forgotten things as the claims of American citizens against Spain , growing out of the Cuban war . Of course , they were one of the reasons we alleged for going to war with Spain . The spectacle of American residents in Cuba being done out of property in amount from $25 , - 000,000 to $50,000,000 was one that finally broke down our patience . We fought and conquered Spain ; and , in the treaty of peace , our Government agreed to take over and settle by itself all these claims . That done , it proceeded to do Its own citizens out of their property more unblushingly than Spain herself . This may seem a hard saying , but its substantial truth will not be questioned by any one who has taken the trouble to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , with ex-Senator William E. Chandler as president , it has taken positions completely at variance with the official attitude of President McKinley on the same subject , not to speak of speeches and reports in Congress . The report of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , - for example , in support of the joint - resolution practically declaring war , said that " much " of the $50,000,000 of property in Cuba belonging to American citizens had been " destroyed , " and added that the claims already on file in the State Department amounted to $16,000,000 . Will it be believed that , after all that , and after this Government had bound itself , by Article VII . of the Treaty of Paris , to " settle the claims of its citizens against Spain , " making its assumption of these claims one of the reasons for demanding the raiiiippinee as inaemnity , ins LOIELLI1/6 -- sion has taken a view of our liability which practically throws these claimants out of court ? Such is the fact , however . By a majority vote ( two out of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a general rule " that Spain was not responsible for damages caused by " an armed insurrection beyond control . " It also has decided that " concentration and devastation " ( the very things about which the American people were crying to Heaven in 1897 and 1898 ) " are legitimate war measures . " The legal result of all this is to put the burden of proof upon the claimant , to show , not merely destruction of his property , but also that the Spanish officials had the power , and did not exercise " clue vigilance , " to prevent its destruction . This will naturally be impossible in nine cases out of ten ; and the inevitable result will be to leave hundreds of outraged American citizens without redress . - We are not saying that the opinions of the Commission , in the matters referred to , are not good international law. - But this Government was bound , in decency , not to take advantage of them . We deliberately waived them in advance . Concentration legitimate warfare ? But President McKinley distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On December 6 , 1897 , he declared that " it was not civ-ilized warfare . It was extermination . " He repeated the opinion in almost the same language in his war message of April 11 , 1898 . But Commissioner Chandler sardonically puts all this aside . He writes with characteristic cynicism in his opinion . " The President had not then seen and probably did not anticipate the concentration and devastation by United States troops under Gen. hell in the Philippines . Possibly if he had supposed that , in addition to arousing just national indignation in order to bring on war with Spain for the liberation of Cuba , he was announcing a new principle of international law , and making a finding of facts happening in war which should be conclusive and binding upon United States courts in all future time , he would have withheld or moderated the soul-stirring utterances with which he began a great war for the freedom and independence of a new nation . " Equally strong was the commitment of this Government to the view that these large claims were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for going to war , but a valid set-off , after being assumed by this country , to the demand of indemnity that we made upon Spain . Secretary Hay was almost tearful when he telegraphed to Paris : " Surely , Spain can not expect us to turn the Philippines back and bear the cost of the war and all claims of our citizens for damages to life and property in Cuba without any indemnity but Porto Rico ! " That is to say , we insisted upon taking the Philippines because we were going to pay these millions in claims of our own citizens . Then we turn about and +r , , , , 1 1 , , , , , . Maury , in his dissenting opinion , puts the case with cruel exactitude : " The United States , with satisfaction thus delivered into its hands by Spain , is a trustee of that satisfaction for the holders of the claims which it thus forced Spain to admit and settle , and its representatives should not be permitted now to defeat them before this commission as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly inconsistent with those taken by it when Spain was a suppliant for peace on any terms  --  grounds that , in my judgment , go far toward making mockery of Article VII of the treaty and of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States prohibiting the taking of private property for public use without ' just compensation . ' " Clearly , these injured Americans would have been better off if we had never gone to n ar with Spain to redress their injuries . As against the Spanish Government , the Administration at Washington would undoubtedly have pushed their claims with vigor , and it would have demanded the payment of every penny . But when its trusting subjects came to ask that their losses be made good by their own Government , which had solemnly covenanted to do so , they find it swallotang its own words , repudiating its own President , and driving them away empty-handed . Well , at any rate , it is not a very powerful argument for war . A peaceful tribunal could not have done worse by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly undertaken for their relief , now mocks at their calamity . GERMANY , ENGLAND , AND RUSSIA . Foreign observers who have watched with alarm the intense partiality of the English press and public for their Japanese allies , find renewed cause for uneasiness in the determined attacks upon Germany now appearing in Imperialist newspapers. - The London Trines returned to the assault the other day by printing an account of a secret agreement between Russia and Germany in regard to Far Eastern matters . This is said to have been reached during the negotiations for the recently concluded commercial treaty between the two countries . While the anonymous correspondent is not able to give the exact terms of the new understanding , he is certain that it " secures for Russia Germany 's support in the ultimate settlement of the terms of peace with Japan . " The quid pro quo for Germany is a free hand in carrying out the Emperor 's scheme of Welt-Politik in China " along the lines of least resistance " Just how malevolent this Machiavelian policy of the schemers in the Wil'helmstrasse is can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is crammed with enough terrible nightmares to please even our sensation-seeking naval jingoes . Far from having designs upon this country , as our Navy Department wiseacres would have us believe , " Calchas " knows by divine inspiration that the one - aim and object of the German nation is the destruction of England on land and sea . ' I lie friendly meeting of the sovereigns at Kiel is loftily waved aside . The neighborly visit of the German squadron to Plymouth was nothing less than an armed reconnoissance , enjoying " inexplicable opportunities for the study of cur coasts and fortresses . " These facilities should be restricted at once , while the English fleet should prepare , . " with Japanese foresight , " " consciously , thoroughly , and with increasing vigilance , " to meet the deadly enemy on the North Sea . The real aims of Germany , according to this prophetic soul , are so multifarious as to beggar description in a mere newspaper article . Suffice it to say that Germany intends to carve out a " yellow India " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would direct Russia 's attention to India and Persia after the Czar 's exhausting defeat in Mantchuria , to weaken England ; that she would make permanent the antagonism between the British Empire and Czardom ; that she would force France into the Dual Alliance or make her drop the entente cordiale , etc. , etc . In short , the history of diplomacy does not record more deep-laid schemes , more subterranean and world-shaking policies than are here credited to the Kaiser and his counsellors . At The repeated official denials from Berlin the Times scoffs persistently . Although the new commercial treaty between Russia and Germany has not been published , and many German newspapers fear that it is less favorable to their interests than they had hoped , the Times knows that Berlin . dictated its own terms and that Russia will obtain a loan from Berlin bankers in return . The semi-official press , it condescendingly explains , has received its orders from the Foreign Office , but to carry ' them out is forced to " grossly misrepresent " the original statements of the Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Times , but it neither adds to that journal 's prestige nor aids the cause of European peace It is , of course , true that Germany is in a position to profit by the Russian embroilment in the East . She has already profited . The serious Russian pressure on her Eastern frontier has necessarily been relaxed by the departure of troops for ' the East , her shipyards and factories are working overtime to complete Russian contracts , and her merchants and steamship line 's have been quick Ito pick up the business which the Japanese themselves have had to give up for war reasons . Above all , the revelations as to the military and internal weaknesses of Russia have strengthened the hands ' of the ' German Fortign Office . The progress of events has made the Russian Bear a more welcome ally since it has become plain that his claws are not nearly so sharp as had been feared . But the fact remains that a large portion of the German public is quite as averse to any binding alliance with Russia as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friction of the past six years . The great bulk of the nation would welcome any readjustment which would relieve it of the tremendous military burdens it now believe 's necessary . And the bitter results of the Bismarckian colonial ventures are no encouragement to empire-building in China , even if that country should fall to pieces . The extra military expenditures such a course would involve would be most distasteful and burden-. some . At the same time , the German Liberal papers have been , quick to point out that there are grave internal problems and urgent reform 's crying out for adjustment ? " our people'sfreedom needs developing , " one newspaper puts it  --  and that their solution will be advanced the minute the fear of war in the East is removed . Far from there being any danger that good relations with Russia would make for a reactionary and ' absolutist policy , it is contended with much weight that the opposite would be the case in both countries . But all this does not lend so much as a color of truth to the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of a fixed intention to pull Russia 's Eastern . chestnuts out of the fire for her . So important a newspaper as the Allegememe Zeitungresents the suggestion that Germany should follow M. de Lanessan 's proposal of mediation . Obviously , such a move would immediately expose her to French and English criticism Of course , the English anti-German press conveniently forgets how warmly it applauded the Anglo-German agreement , and how universally the world recognizes the Kaiser 's notable influence in behalf of European peace . But nobody ever doubted that Imperialism walks hand in hand with insincerity and inconsistency .
