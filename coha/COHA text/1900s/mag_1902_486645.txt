SIR ? In the interests of realism , may I offer a caution to American writers who have occasion to describe the speech of uneducated Englishmen ? The efforts made on this side of the Atlantic to represent the Cockn6y 's misuse of " le " are almost invariably grotesque failures , for the reason that no notice is taken of the difference between accented and unaccented syllables . For instance , the editor of a Boston magazine has lately been giving an account of his experiences in the London streets on Coronation Day , and he makes his policemen say , " Hit 's a Yank just harrived , " " Hit 's against herders , " " You 're one of those Hamerican newspaper chaps . " Now if any policemen really spoke m this fashion they were undoubtedly Americans , even though they lived in London , for no one but an American speaks so slowly and with such a lack of vocal inflection as to be able to take breath before an unaccented syllable . " Herders " is good Cockney , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress falls , but every other example of the superfluous " h " in these three quotations is an evidence of the reporter 's deficiency in exact observation . In the sentence I have just written " haspirate , " " hevery , " " hother , " " hevidence , " and " hobservation " would be possible to an uneducated Englishman ; an American jour-. nalist would attribute to him also " hexample " and " hexact , " and in this would certainly be wrong . The London policeman himself could tell him that " h " is used for " hemphasis . " ? Yours faithfully , H. W. H. Notes .

It was in Boston that Samuel Lover landed in September , 1846 , on his sole visit to this country , and a six-volume reissue of his works is appropriately made in that city by Little , Brown &; Co . Mr. James Jeffrey Roche contributes an introduction more biographical than critical ; but then , Lover is a writer whom one can not approachein a critical mood , so attractive is his genial personality . He is wholly in character in his modest preface to the volume of his Poems , which ' descend to a non-singing age ( as compared with his ) . He has occasion there to explain the difference between songs made for singing and others  --  like Byron 's , Milton 's , even Shelley 's , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramas form another volume , the ' Legends ' a third , and the chief novels eke out the remainder of the set . There are frontispiece illustrations , including a portrait , and some of Lover 's own designs are found in the ' Legends ' Perhaps the most interesting thing in Mr. Roche 's story is the fact that a daughter of Lover 's is still living , the mother of our well-known conductor and composer , Victor Herbert , whose musical gift greatly surpasses his grandfather 's , and of a half-German actor , who hands down another trait of Samuel Lover 's versatile talent . This edition is handsomely got up and brand new . ' The Struggle for a Continent ' ( Little , Brown &; Co ) is an abridgment of Parkman in one volume , which has been made by Dr. Pelham Edgar of Victoria College , Toronto . It would obviously be fatuous for an editor to take Parkman 's facts and compress them in his own words . According to such an arrangement , altogether too much would be sacrificed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgar employs the alternative method of condensation . The passages chosen are cited in the ipsissima verbs of the original , and connecting links of narrative , placed within brackets , are supplied by the editor . The source of each excerpt is carefully noted , and , as a rule , the passages are sufficiently long to do the author justice . It may be doubted whether one who was unfamiliar with the general history of New France would be able , even with the aid of Dr. Edgar 's connecting links , to seize all the main features of the struggle by mastering the contents of the present volume . Few readers , however , will fail to have some preliminary knowledge of the subject , and those who are unable to buy a complete set of Parkman 's works will find these selections much better than nothing . The appearance of the book is attractive , and the text le accompanied by numerous half-tone illustrations . The Rev. Edgerton R.

It is somewhat strange that among the many who have had to do with travel in the wintry north , no one has yet written such a book . To do it well would be no trifling task , and when well done it would be not only interesting to the curious reader , but a solid contribution to ethnology and the psychology of domesticated animals Unfortunately , the book under consideration is little more , than pleasant gossip about a few particular Newfoundland dogs or mongrels . Some of the stories are very remarkable , and yet are told in a way that leaves one questioning how much that is not canine-has been unconsciously attributed to the beasts under discussion .

Larisun 's ' Hwot iz the Sol ? Haz the Dog a Sol ? ' ( Ringoes , N. J. ; Fonic Publishing House ) , is a discussion in the form of a colloquy between the author and his students regarding the life principle Like all the later writings of this estimable physician and instructor , it is printed in the phonetic type devised by himself , together with some syntactical and verbal eccentricities soon mastered and not thublesome . Indeed , one quickly learns to read the strange page fluently The argument embraces something of Dr. Larisun 's autobiography having a psychological aspect , and introduces other experiences of a kindred nature . His ante-Darwinian idea is that the Creator , in order to differentiate the species , " created the primordial life-principle of the members of every species different " ; and " the psyche of an animal of some species possesses faculties which are not parts of the psyche of animals of other species " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia ?

In fact , the scope of the book does not-extend back of the eighteenth century .

We can not particularly congratulate Miss Jane Barlow upon her last work , ' The Founding of Fortunes ' ( London : Methuen &; Co. , New York . Dodd , Mead &; Co. ) , as a novel . As a delineator of the ways of speech of the less English-educated of the people of Ireland , the author is inimitable In this respect the present book falls behind none of its predecessors . But the story does not run smoothly , and the characters are somewhat wooden . It impresses us as the work of one who has lived more in her own thoughts than in the world , and still one wonders how the language likely to have been used in circumstances such as she has probably never experienced , strikes the reader as so true to nature Occasionally , we have come upon passages not easy to understand , e. g. , page 101 : " Hanmer became aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them ' Seth the sort of uncommonness due to an impersonal attitude towards things in general , quite compatible with a most strenuous grasp of practical affairs , but not with a voluntary subjection to irrelevant trivialities . " The book is written in a sympathetic spirit towards the position in which large numbers of the peasantry of Ireland find themselves . We can heartily commend to all instructors in English a little volume entitled ' Freshman English and Theme-Correcting in Harvard College ' ( Silver , Burdett &; Co . ) . It is the joint production of C. T. Copeland , lecturer on English literature , and E. M. Rideout , instructor in English . Their own literary skill is attested by the readableness of their exposition , in which a pleasant humor finds a natural vent . Thus , at the close of the course " English A , " freshmen are asked to pass judgment on it ; and our authors , following their practice of quoting examples of illustrative productions , give one which pronounces it " dull and uninteresting . " Their comment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouraging to instructors because , when compared with any of the writer 's earlier work , it shows a distinct gain in structure . If he has got nothing else from his practice , he has learned to complain more effectively . " The first fortnightly theme elicits an autobiography , of practical use to instructors ; the three-hour talks are contrived to range from composition into ethics  --  to the advantage of the students , as witness the admirable extract from Dean Briggs on page 27 . Daily themes , translation , letter-writing , fiction are the chief instrumentalities , together with pastiche , or the doubtful discipline in deliberate imitation of stylists Poetical drill hardly exists , we judge . The authors rightly think that Harvard 's experience is profitable for smaller institutions , for classes and for individuals . For the excellent revision of Cotton 's seventeenth-century translation of " Montaigne " ( Scribners ) in four fine library volumes , readers are indebted to the indefatigable Mr. William C. Hazlitt , whose labors have consisted chiefly in the correction of numerous errors of detail , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version . Cotton 's slightly archaic diction and phrasing unquestionably bring out the flavor of Montaigne 's style with a smack that would disappear in a conventional modern dilution . Mr. Hazlitt consequently has confined himself to improvement , and has nowhere , so far as we have observed , completely recast a telling sentence . Familiar essays , such as those on Books , on Some - Verses of Vergil , on a Custom of the Isle of Cea , etc , are very faithfully represented here . In the " Apologie de Raimond Sebond " we note a number of changes that give greater coherence to involved meanings ; but the translations of classical quotations occasionally err in the direction of excessive paraphrasing . M. Hippolyte Buffenoir 's ' Les Charmettes et J.-J . Rousseau ' ( Paris . Paul Cornuau ) is a provincial 's account of a visit to the home of Mme. de Warens .

The November Century opens brilliantly with a series of seven color pictures , by Maxfield Parrish , illustrating various features of " the great Southwest . " An " open letter " from Mr. Parrish makes an interesting comparison of the color effects of Southwestern scenery with those of New England The atmosphere of Arizona and New Mexico has not moisture enough to color the light as it passes through , and give the gilding and richness often seen in New England , nor is the intense blue of the New England sky seen in-the Southwest .

The packer 's side of the recent high prices for beef is given at some length , and apparently accepted by the writer , though he does not attempt to deny or conceal the power for evil in such combinations and the necessity for official supervision and restraint .

Gordon 's reminiscences of the civil war , and a series of articles on the various departments of the Unite &; States Government , are the most notable announcements for the coming year . ? An interesting announcement comes from Mr Edward Dalziel , the last surviving member of the original and once famous firm of wood-engravers known as the Dalziel Brothers , whose firm autobiography we lately reviewed . Few names are as prominent in the history of English illustration in the " sixties . " It was chance , perhaps , that produced just at the right moment a distinguished group of artists willing and eager to work in black and white : Rossetti , Holman Hunt , Millais , Sandys , Boyd Houghton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . But the Messrs . Dalziel gave them the necessary encouragement , not only by engraving their work on wood as well as it could then be engraved , but by giving them , in the first place , the commission for the work . The engravers were thus brought into close and often delightful relations with the illustrators , and the Memoirs of George and Edward Dalziel showed how much interesting material remained in their hands as a result of this friendly business relationship . Shortly after that book appeared , Mr. George Dalziel died But before his death he had planned , with his brother Edward , the publication now announced It consists of a limited edition of India-paper proofs of Millais 's drawings for the Parables of Our Lord , one of the Dalziel books now most valued by collectors Millais contributed twenty ' drawings to the series , and when the volume was produced in 1864 the Dalziels had fifty proofs of these drawings pulled on India paper , but , for one reason or another , never issued them to the public , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are reproduced in facsimile twenty letters from Millais , touching upon the ' Parables ' and other work he did for and with the Dalziels . " We feel , " they say , " that the criticisms and remarks made in these letters furnish another proof of what is very dear to us  --  that a competent wood-engraver , with favorable surroundings , was capable of satisfying to the fullest extent , in his reproduction , the competent draughtsman . " The competent draughtsman , it is true , sometimes thought differently , and , in the case of Rossetti , said so very plainly . But still , there can be no question of the fine and important work done by the Dalziels . Nor can it be denied that Millais 's masterpieces are to be found among his designs in black-and-white , and that in this medium he never did anything to surpass the ' Parables . ' The volume is issued privately from the Camden Press in London , and the price is ten guineas . ? A very interesting pamphlet on ' Ancestor-Worship and Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Prof. N. Hozumi of the law department of the Imperial University of Tokio , gives an inside view by a native of the forces which have made Japanese civilization . The learned barrister treats of ancestor-worship in its origin and as the chief factor in primitive man 's social life . In Japan he notes three kinds of worship  --  of imperial , clan , and family ancestors . In his third division , he looks at the subject in relation to the modern codes of law , discussing in this light the Government , Constitution , the people , the house , marriage , divorce , adoption , dissolution of adoption , and succession . He holds that the worship of the imperial ancestors is the national religion and the basis and sanction of the Constitution of 1889 , and that " the influence of European civilization has done nothing to shake the firm-rooted customs of ancestor-worship . " The little book is terse in style and informing in content ; yet , after all , it is a curious illustrae tion of mental inversion , as showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a barrister ; can equip a judicial critic or historian . As matter of fact , it can not be proved , as asserted on page 12 , that " the primeval religion of the country " was ancestor-worship ( at least in the sense of the Chinese or modern Shinto system ) ; or that Japan has any history " that dates back more than two thousand five hundred years " ; while , as simple matter of fact , the once highest Department  --  that of Worship ( Council of Gods and Men ) ? was abolished a generation ago , and the people 's representatives in the Imperial Diet have voted down every attempt of I be Conservatives to restore it . Despite the family consultation and expressions of filial regard in the graveyards , both custom and sentiment in regard to the political nature of ancestor-worship are weakening . The steady trend of the nation is in the direction of democracy . Outside the palace , all the functions of government are in the line of secular order and justice . deleted list Mr. Berenson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism is , on the whole , more interesting than the first . It contains nothing so daringly fantastic as his creation of " Ammo di Sandro , " but , on the other hand , it contains what we are inclined to think the greatest real achievement of modern connoisseurship  --  the taking from Perugino , and the giving to Lo Spagna , of the Caen " Sposalizio . " Whether or not the picture was really painted by the latter artist we neither know nor greatly care , but that it was not painted by Perugino , and that it was the imitation rather than the original of Raphael 's " Sposalizio , " seems to be proved . Mr. Berenson 's talent for criticism , as distinguished from connoisseurship , is shown to the best ad vantage in the article on Renaissance churches . The unimportance of the questions with which the modern connoisseur often deals is as noticeable in the rest of the volume as in the former collection , and the reason of it is indicated in the concluding paper , on " The Rudiments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time , " was written more than eight years ago , as the first section of a book on the Methods of Constructive Art Criticism ' " ; but the abstract discussion of method was abandoned in favor of a concrete example , and Lorenzo Lotto was selected as the subject , " more for his excellence as an illustration of Method , than for his actual achievements . " The result was disappointing , for , says Mr. Berenson , " although this work , in a special introduction , in the introductory paragraphs to each chapter , and here and there throughout , speaks of Method , yet , to my no small astonishment , not a single reviewer of either the first or second edition has made the slightest reference to the general theory on which the book is based . " Either Mr. Berenson 's memory plays him false , or he did not see the review of the first edition published in these columns , for his method and his manner of applying it were much more interesting to us than his subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not , with Mr. Berenson , give it a big M ? is , however , welcome and worth a little discussion . It begins with the statement that " the materials for the historical study of art are of three kinds : ( 1 ) Contemporary documents , ( 2 ) Tradition , ( 3 ) The works of art themselves . " And these three kinds of materials are taken up seriatim . Documents , Mr. Berenson contends , really prove nothing . A contract may never have been carried out , or may have been only partially carried out , by the artist who made it ; a signature may have been forged or attached to a work really executed by pupils . Such a description of a work of art as will serve really to identify it is impossible , as the description would serve equally well for a bad copy as for the original . In fact , " in no case adduced is the document lie art sufficient proof by itself of authenticity or authorship . The document always needs to be confirmed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even less value , and " in no case is it to be pitted against documentary facts or the scientific deductions of the connoisseur . " We are left , then , to the conclusion that the only means of determining authorship is by the study of the works themselves . " Connoisseurship is based on the assumption that perfect identity of characteristics indicates identity of origin . . . . To isolate the characteristics of one artist , we take all his works of undoubted authenticity , and we proceed to discover those traits that invariably recur in them but not in the works of other masters . " Here is the initial difficulty . If documents and tradition are of no worth , how can there be any " works of undoubted authenticity " to examine ? Connoisseurship is left with a free hand to examine everything , and should , logically , accept nothing . It might divide works of art into groups , each group presumably by the same hand ; but it has no right to put names to them . That there ever was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in his clearing away of all other material than the work of art itself , Mr. Berenson has left connoisseurship in the air , with no foundation whatever . However , recognizing somehow that authentic pictures exist , what are the characteristics we are to look for ? " Types , general tone , composition and technique " are ruled out as characteristic of schools rather than individuals ; we must examine the details , " bearing in mind , to start with , that the less necessary the detail in question is for purposes of obvious expression i. e , the more unimportant it is , the less consciously will it be executed , the more by rote , the more likely to become stereotyped , and therefore characteristic . " Hence we have a series of tests which rank in nearly inverse ratio to their importance : " The most applicable : the ears , the hands , the folds , the landscape . " The less applicable : the hair , the eyes , the nose , the mouth . " The least applicable the cranium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human figure , the architecture , the color and the chiaroscuro . " But these tests are more applicable to insignificant artists than to great ones , because the great ones are more likely to be imitated or copied . So we have this statement in " The value of those tests soloed come nearest to being mechanical is inversely as the greatness of the artist . The greater the artist , the more weight falls on the question of quality in the consideration of the work attributed to him . " Here is the reason , very clearly stated , why modern connoisseurship concerns itself so largely with attributions which may possibly be true if important , for the " sense of quality " can not be taught or reasoned about : it is just what artists have always judged by , though'sneered at for so judging . The more important the question to be solved , the less aid " Method " gives in its solution , and the more we fall back on that personal artistic sense which existed before " Method " was heard of .

Though not to be taken too seriously as reproductions , these color plates are exceedingly dainty and attractive . The best we can say of Lord Ronald Sutherland Gower 's book on Reynolds is that he has chosen for illustration many comparatively unknown pictures by the master , some of which seem never before to have been reproduced , that he has generally used photographs from the paintings , and not engravings , and , where engravings are used , has clearly stated the fact ; and that he has published for the first time Gainsborough 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest , the text is of the usual , somewhat inconsequent , " year by year " kind , and contains some blunders and some strange extravagances of criticism ,
