 | There can be little question that the tendency to overproduce cotton has been chronic since shortly after its production on a large scale was made possible by the invention of Whitney 's gin . The tremendous extent of the territory in the Southern States available for cotton raising , the possibility of splendid profits , always in view but oftener as mirage than as reality , and the force of very strong custom among the people , white and black , have been , and continue to be , responsible for this frequent oversupplying of the market . The record-breaking proportions of the crop of 1904 , now being marketed , put powerful emphasis upon this phenomenon , which a year ago was almost entirely obscured in the public mind by the fortuitous shortage of the few preceding crops . A year ago the cotton consuming world was anxious over the possibility of a decreasing supply ; and many people in the American cotton belt professed a solicitude for the preservation of the South 's monopoly of the cotton output , then in a fancied danger through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the pendulum of public opinion swings from time to time , not always moderately but often to extremes ; and thus it has swung through the whole of a century . On the one hand , the South is said to have apractical monopoly of its great staple ; on the other , it is clear that for no long period have the people of the cotton belt enjoyed as much prosperity and comfort through that monopoly as certain other peoples have had who possessed no such striking natural advantage . The case is fairly comparable to that in the Texan oil fields recently exploited . Through either mistaken or unfortunate management the great majority of the participators in the industry have failed to secure an adequate return upon their capital and labor employed .  | The history of prosperity and adversity in cotton production has been somewhat similar to that in tobacco and rice production and in certain mining industries ; but the scale has been larger , the dependence of the people greater , and the vicissitudes more striking . A sketch of the early period will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes , splendid for those times , were made by cotton planters ; and the prospects were bright for the increase of prosperity . But from the time of the embargo to the end of the second war with Great Britain , in 1815 , the foreign market was largely cut off and the prices fell so low that some of the planters feared the complete ruin of cotton as a staple . Upon the return of peace and the reopening of commerce the prices of cotton ranged so high for several years in succession that a veritable mania for cotton raising spread over the land , and people by tens of thousands , rich and poor , flocked into the Southwestern country , into all the fertile districts from Georgia and Kentucky to Western Lousiana , and later into Texas , in the hope of securing quick prosperity through the production of the fleecy staple , A graphic picture of the situation in 1826-7 was drawn by a traveler who made a journey from Charleston through Augusta and Montgomery to New Orleans and thence to Huntsville and Nashville . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Georgia newspapers of the time . In part it reads as follows : " When I took my last walk along the wharves in Charleston , and saw them piled up with mountains of Cotton , and all your stores , ships , steam and canal boats , crammed with and groaning under the weight of cotton , I returned to the Planters ' Hotel , where I found the four daily papers , as well as the conversation of the boarders , teeming with Cotton ! Cotton ! ! Cotton ! ! ! Thinks I to myself , I 'll soon change this scene of cotton . ' But , alas ! how easily deceived is short-sighted man ! Well , I got into my gig and wormed my way up through Queen , Meeting , King , and St. Phillip 's streets , dodging from side to side , to steer clear of the cotton waggons , I came to the New Bridge Ferry . Here I crossed over in the horse-boat , with several empty cotton waggons , and found a number on the other side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I continued on , meeting with little else than cotton fields , cotton gins , cotton waggons ? but the wide , the unbounded prospect lay before me ! ' I arrived in Augusta , and when I saw cotton waggons in  | Broad street I whistled ! but said nothing ! ! ! But this was not all ; there was more than a dozen tow-boats in the river , with more than a thousand bales of the cotton on each , and several steamboats with still more . And you must know that they have cotton warehouses there covering whole squares , all full of cotton ; and some of the knowing ones told me , that there were then in the place from 40,000 to 50,000 bales . And Hamburg ( as a negro said ) was worser , according to its size ; for it puzzled me to tell which was the largest , the piles of cotton or the houses . I now left Augusta and overtook hordes of cotton planters from North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia , with large gangs of negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the cotton land is not worn out . ' " . . I continued my journey passing cotton fields ; till I arrived at Holt 's Ferry , on the Oconee , where I saw three large pole boats loaded with bales of cotton , twelve tiers in height . From thence I went to Milledgeville , where I found the prevailing topic of the place , ' What an infernal shame it was , that such a quantity of virgin cotton land should be suffered to remain in the possession of the infernal Creek Indians . ' I moved on to the westward , crossing Flint River , and from thence to the Chattahochie found cotton land speculators thicker than locusts in Egypt . But from Line Creek to Montgomery ( 14 miles ) the land is nearly level ; the fields of one plantation joining by a fence those of another ; and all extending back from the road farther than you can distinctly see ; and the cotton pretty even , and about as high as the fences , and has the appearance ( as Riley says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have , almost all of them , overplanted ; and had not more than one-half their cotton picked in ; each plantation has a cotton gin . I next came to Montgomery , which I found overstocked with cotton , and no boats to take it away . From Montgomery I went to Blakely , and on my way , saw many cotton plantations , and met , and overtook , nearly one hundred cotton waggons , traveling over a road so had , that a State prisoner could hardly walk through it to make his escape . And although people say that Blakely is done over , there was not a little cotton in it . From there I crossed over to Mobile , in a small steamboat loaded up to the top of the smoke-pipe with cotton . This place is a receptacle monstrous for the article : look which way you will you see it ; and see it moving ; keel-boats , steamboats , ships , brigs , schooners , wharves , stores , and press-houses , all appeared to be full . " And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all of the western cotton belt . This tremendous activity led at times to the spoiling of the market . In 1839 , for example , there was a great fall in cotton prices , and a fearful panic throughout the belt , which entailed severe depression for half the following decade . Then the world 's demand gradually gained once more upon the supply , and the  | price rose by 1850 to ten or eleven cents where it remained fairly steady for ten years of prosperity. * The hard times of the forties were forgotten , and cotton was again enthroned as king without any rival pretending to share the devotion of his subjects . This mighty king was expected to render overwhelming aid in the war of the sixties and secure victory for the South in its battle against the world . The outcome is notorious . After the war cotton was for a decade or two of necessity again the chief reliance in Southern industry . And again the old habit of complete dependence upon the staple tended to grow in strength . The low prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promoted some diversification of industry ; but the high prices of 1902-4 have revived the mania , and now the fact is emphasized that , as of old , the South is securing relatively little advantage from its natural and unique source of wealth . While cotton prices are low and tend to remain very near the cost of production , the cotton producers continue to be obliged to pay abnormally high rates for most of their supplies , and through the protective tariff and the pension policy of the United States government , the South must continue to pay its enormous annual tribute to the sections which control the federal government . There is clearly a grave problem to be faced ; and suggestions for its solution ought to receive consideration , even when they contemplate a radical departure from current practice . II . The American cot ton belt has a combination of advantages for cotton production which is unequalled in any other part of the world ; and the American output in its relation to the world 's demand is by far the greatest factor in fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the South has , within limits , a potential monopoly of the product . Among its advantages are : 1 . A very broad expanse of territory , and the best climate in the world for cotton production ? a warm and extended growing season with a specially long and fine autumn for the harvest . And it has plenty of rainfall for cotton culture , which renders costly irrigation unnecessary . 2 . It has cheap labor in large  | amount . This is needed in economical cotton production , because the gathering of the crop is too tedious to justify the employment of high-priced labor . 3 . It has an efficient managing class . These expert plantation managers are essential in maintaining a system of organized industry and for the utilization of the cheap labor , rhich would otherwise be costly on account of the ignorance and unreliability of the negroes . This combination is unparalleled in the world ; and in spite of the efforts of European governments for the past half century to promote cotton culture in Asia and Africa , it appears highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the cotton supply . There are many districts in the world which could make large amounts of cotton at a cost of , say , fifty cents a pound ; but very few indeed can produce more than they now produce at less than twenty cents . And below that price the only severe competition which an American cotton producer need fear is that of the other American cotton planters . The American cotton growers alone can spoil their market ; but they can do it with the greatest ease ; they have done it in many seasons gone by , and bid fair to continue indefinitely in the same practice . Let us see why this is so . A very important feature in the situation is the fact that the world 's demand for cotton is much less elastic than the supply . People want about as many clothes and ships as many sails one year as another : the demand for cotton , while constantly tending to increase , is relatively steady . But the supply fluctuates through a wide range . Not only does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planters , but the weather conditions , to which the crop is extremely sensitive , differ enormously , and not at all at the planters ' will . The fact that three-fourths of the world 's total market supply is grown in one geographic province intensifies the importance of the weather and increase the variability of the output . The demand being fairly steady and the supply quite variable , the market is nearly always either under supplied or over supplied . A normal relation is very hard to maintain , and a normal price is a thing in the realm of pure conjecture . The price has ranged all the way from four cents to a dollar a pound and back again in the last seventy years ; and it has played between six and a half and seventeen cents within the last twelve months .  | These considerations bring out the fact that cotton production is in very large degree a speculative enterprise : it has many of the features of a lottery . And by its influence through a long period of time it has fostered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of high profits if the local crops be good and the general prices high , it obscures the more probable prospect of very moderate gains or positive losses . In this way there is exerted a constant tendency toward the production of too great a supply of cotton , which ruins the market and diminishes or destroys the legitimate profits of the planter . This keeps the planters poor and keeps the whole community poverty-stricken along with them . And , what is quite as bad , it makes the income of the community extremely uneven and uncertain from year to year . Fickleness of income , whether with individuals or great bodies of men , is a most demoralizing factor , promoting a disposition to squander the resources in hand and let the morrow take care of itself . When men can not reckon what next year will probably bring , they naturally cease to plan that far ahead , and the happy-go-lucky disposition must prevail . A certain degree of stability is essential for the promotion of thrift , sobriety and foresight . Fickleness in the returns from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the development of other resources on a scale correspondingly large . It thus appears that if the world should make efficient demand for all the cotton the South could produce , it would not be wholesome for the cotton belt to devote its whole energy to raw cotton . But the world does not demand as much raw cotton as the American producers can supply . The world 's demand is too small to justify the employment of all the cotton belt land and labor in the one industry . In last analysis the cotton problem is a labor problem , and the special need for Southern prosperity is the need of keeping the surplus labor out of the cotton fields . To secure a long succession of fat years this surplus labor must be invited out , if the invitation be effective ; driven out , if compulsion be necessary . The pressing need is that of other attractions with satisfactory remuneration for labor . We should not hold fast blindly to ancient custom , but seek throughout the world for advantageous ideas and apply them to Southern needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a splendid resource , but as a sole reliance it brings the people more injury than good . The fundamental problem is to raise other enterprises , great and small , to an equal or higher level than that of cotton production in their attractiveness to labor , and thus secure the double benefit of adding new resources and at the same time checking the cotton output and increasing the remuneration therefrom . It is hardly necessary to enlarge upon the advantages to accrue from the diversification of industry , and especially the development of manufactures . The excellent conditions which now prevail in and around the manufacturing centers which have already arisen , and the effect of that movement in raising cotton prices in the past few years are sufficiently convincing object lessons . But this movement should not be checked , as it now threatens to be , by the fresh competition of the cotton fields in the demand for labor. * The benefits are cumulative , i. e. , the larger and more numerous the manufacturing towns , the greater the demand for truck and dairy supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for educational improvement , and the better the opening for progressive spirit . And , by the way , an increase in general comfort and enlightenment must needs bring a lessening of race friction and crime , for when there 's plenty of good things to go around , people are not prone to quarrel . Is this utopian condition possible of achievement and how ? It is suggested in various quarters ( by men whose memories are short ) that the banks in the cotton belt be organized into a cotton-holding trust and thus drive prices up . But that very project was tried in 1837-9 with the most disastrous results . A somewhat more hopeful method is urged by the Cotton Growers ' Association , recently organized , which is holding meetings in many counties , at which the growers resolve to keep their remaining bales off the market and reduce their acreage for the coming year . This may now achieve more success than a similar effort in the nineties , but its effect can be no more than temporary . Men can not be deterred from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless new openings be made which promise to be equally or more inviting . Industrial  | experiments and education ought to and doubtless will in the long run promote the diversification of industry and the improvement of the general welfare , but without some special stimulus that work promises to be slow in the South . These are the well-worn remedies , discussed with vigor from time to time for many years past , and thus far with little but spasmodic result . If the current of progress in the Saxon race in general be likened to the flow of a mighty river , that of the plantation States of America may perhaps be compared to the surge and recession of the waves on the seashore ? advance from time to time , but little genuine progress . If at first sight this appears unfair , let a comparison be made of the status of things at the present time with that in the days of William Byrd and Alexander Spotswood , or of George Washington , James Wright , and the Lowndes and the Pinckneys , or of Wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ante-bellum cotton regime . This relative lack of progress in the South may perhaps be explained without discredit to the South . But explanation and justification are not satisfying when progress is demanded , when a remedy for depression is the need of the times , and a preventive of hard times the need of the future . In economic concerns no man may remold conditions at will , nor prophesy developments with much accuracy or confidence , but in view of the general needs of the Southern situation and the inefficacy of time-honored methods , a new suggestion which may serve as a thesis to attract criticism and arouse thought may be well in place . Let us therefore consider the advisability of a tax on cotton production and a bounty on cotton manufactures and other industries of promise in the cotton growing States . III . To oversupply the market is easily accomplished by the American cotton producers . In fact it is only through voluntary restraint that oversupply is to be avoided . Land is superabundant , the weather can be counted on when a succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor at hand than the world demands at a remunerative price in the cotton fields . But if cotton is superficially too attractive to labor , some recourse ought to be found by which to offset this superficial attraction  | by more substantial ones in other directions . The great problem is that of deterring the surplus labor from joining the rush and bringing general distress . If no more than enough labor is devoted to cotton , the producers and the country get the benefit of monopoly prices . But if too much labor be employed , the monopoly is ruined and hardly anybody is benefited but the consumers , and they in an infinitesimal degree . With firm resolution and concerted action it would appear possible for the State governments of the cotton belt to protect the cotton-raising industry from cut-throat competition by taxing its product , and to promote other industries at the same time by devoting to their aid the proceeds of the cotton tax . It is one of the very obvious , though paradoxical , truths of finance that a tax on mortgages does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raising of the rate of interest it is shifted upon the borrowers . Likewise a tax on a monopolized commodity would in the average case , by decreasing the output , raise the price so that the producer would in the long run be relieved of all the burden of the tax and even probably receive an actual surplus income considerably greater than the amount of that tax . Imagine for a moment , as a somewhat radical application of the policy , that all the governments of the cotton States had recently imposed a tax of one cent per pound on all cotton hereafter raised and ginned in those States , and at the same time offered a large part of the proceeds of that tax as a bounty upon certain other selected industries , and let it be understood by the people that the purpose of the measure was the reduction of the acreage , as a patriotic enterprise , and the promotion of the general welfare . It is not unreasonable to suppose that such enactment would cause the withdrawal of , say , twenty per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise be employed therein . The twenty per cent . decrease in the labor would probably cause a reduction of about twenty per cent . in the output . Reckoning from the course of past fluctuations a decrease of twenty per cent , in the output would cause an increase in prices of much more than twenty per cent . ; perhaps as much as forty or sixty per cent . This would of course mean a handsome increase in the net profits of the cotton producers . And by  | means of the tax and bounty system this benefit would at once be distributed throughout the whole community . Meanwhile the laborers withdrawn from cotton production because of this measure would be profitably employed in other industries ; and the product of their labor would he in large part an additional clear gain to the commonwealth . Let this be kept up for a number of years , and the cotton belt might well experience a gradual revolution in industry by which cotton growing would become merely one of several great industrial resources and would rank as a unique and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliance , and a poor one , for keeping the wolf from the door . For beneficial results , indeed , it would probably not be necessary to unite all the cotton States in this policy . If only a few of the greater ones acted in accord ( upon the advice , we will say , of a joint commission ) the benefits would still be great . A reduction of twenty per cent . in acreage in three or four of the large cotton States would decrease the total American output by half that percentage , and would raise the price materially . At the same time the use of the proceeds of the tax , in promoting manufactures , etc. , in those States would substantially increase the resources and wealth of their people . And even if a single great cotton State tried the plan without the cooperation of its sisters , the hope of benefit from the diversification of industry and the increase of resources would not be unreasonable . The simplest method of administration would be to levy the tax at the ginneries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bounty to any factory in the State upon its presenting evidence of having worked up into cloth the bales upon which the tax had been paid . It might be a wholesome modification to give the full drawback only to new mills , say for the first ten years of their operation , and reduce the bounty given the old mills to one-half the rate of the tax collected . If it be feared that a tax of one cent a pound would cause too great a disturbance of industry , a lower rate of tax might well be adopted instead . After the payment of the bounty on cotton manufactures , the surplus proceeds of the tax might be advantageously devoted to bounties upon the manufacture of furniture , the raising of hay and cattle , and upon other industries which give promise of  | successful development under such a stimulus . And a large part of it could be devoted with excellent results to the improvement of education and other great public purposes . But whether this specific remedy of tax and bounties be applied is a minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other to diversify industry at the South and counteract the tendency to spoil the cotton market by overproduction . And the present epoch , while the people are freed from debt through the virtue of short cotton crops , and are their own masters , ? the present is the time for study and action leading to the end in view . We have had enough depression this year to emphasize the need of preparing in fat years for the lean ones which are liable to follow ; and the lesson should be eagerly acted upon . Let us keep on building factories , and take away all the profit we can from the outside districts , which are parasites upon the South , and let us plant more orchards and vineyards and broad fields of varied crops ; let us raise the best sorts of grasses and forage crops , and cover the land with lowing herds and thrifty creameries . In a word , let us follow the example of England , with her wool ; France , with her wine , and New England , with her fisheries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special advantage through which to secure wealth for a complete and rounded and self-reliant industrial system . Such must be our objective ; the ways and means of reaching it must be an ever-present problem .
