 | The autobiography of Andrew D. White , recently issued from the press of the Century Company , is the story of a career that holds out encouragement to all who hope for better things in American political life . It is an account of early training that has borne ripe fruit , of wealth that has been wisely expended , of ability that has won its just recognition . Scholar , educator , diplomat , Mr. White belongs to a class of men not so numerous as we might wish , but of whom for the very reason of their scarcity , we are the prouder . These reminiscences told in a style at once simple and captivating not only disclose to us an ideal career of the scholar in politics but they shed much light upon historic events in which Mr. White , to the great advantage of his country , participated . The two volumes before us possess therefore great historical as well as personal and literary value . They take us into many lands , into the presence of many important personages and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were broad and the threads of the narrative lead now into the realms of scholarship , now into the realms of politics , religion , diplomacy , art , education . Born in a town of central New York , dignified by the classic name of Homer , young White received his earliest education in that vicinity , attending eventually an academy at Syracuse . That his education began early is evident from his confession that while he recalls distinctly events of his fourth year , he holds " not the faintest recollection of a time when " he " could not read easily . " His school days at Syracuse were the times of stirring discussions on the slavery question , and so the young boy added to the formal instruction of the academy classes the advantages of listening to the debates of such anti-slavery leaders as Phillips , Garrison , and May , and to the lyceum lectures of such famous men as Mark Hopkins , Whipple and Emerson . The originality  | and independence characterizing Mr. White 's later career , when as President of Cornell University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new path in the educational world , totally different from that which the sectarian colleges of the country had for ages been following , seem to have marked him even as a college student . Possibly the original impulse of hostility to narrow sectarian education arose from his own experience in a sectarian college , Mr. White 's original hope had been " to enter one of the larger New England universities , " but the influence of an ardent high-church Episcopal rector to whom the young man was sent for the finishing touches of his preparatory course induced his father to place him in an Episcopal college of Western New York . The moral influence of this institution , however , was evidently more nominal than real , and the sincere , frank nature of the boy revolted against the life of the college . Many years later Mr. White can still write : " I have had to do since as student , professor or lecturer with some half dozen large universities at home and abroad , and in all of these together , have not seen so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little Church college , ' of which the especial boast was that owing to the small number of its students it was able to exercise a direct Christian influence upon every young man committed to its care . ' " One year was the limit of endurance , when , in spite of parental remonstrance , the young man fled from the college and took temporary refuge with a former instructor . Eventually in 1851 Mr. White entered the sophomore class of Yale College and the early unfulfilled hope was realized . At Yale even in a class that included among its members several who later achieved considerable distinction , such as Stedman , Davies , Smalley , and Shiras , young White distinguished himself . Here , as in the larger activities of later life , he showed a breadth of interest and sympathy that led him to seek and win honors in varied fields of college life . Literary prizes , the Clark , the Yale Literary , and the De Forest , he won , but his scholarly instincts did not prevent him from actively participating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of diplomacy , it is interesting to note that the subject of his De Forest prize essay was " The Diplomatic History of Modern Times . " Apparently the young man had not formed any definite notion  | about his future career except that he expected to return to college after graduation to give himself " especially to modern languages as a preparation for travel and historical study abroad , " but opportunity interfered and sent him abroad at once , instead of back to college to study modern languages . Governor Seymour , of Connecticut , the newly appointed minister to Russia , invited both Mr. White and the latter 's intimate college friend , Daniel C. Gilman , later to become first president of Johns Hopkins University and first president of the Carnegie Institution , to accompany him as attaches . The invitation was accepted , and accordingly in December of 1853 these two college friends started for Europe , going first to London and then to Paris . Mr. White did not at once proceed to St. Petersburg , but while the minister and other members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remained in Paris to thoroughly familiarize himself with the French language , to increase his knowledge of history and in other ways to prepare himself " for later duties " Living in the family of a French professor where English was an unknown , or at least an unused tongue , listening to lectures at the Sorbonne and College de France by such men as Laboulaye and Arnould , enjoying the French drama at the Theatre Francaise and the Odeon , and stimulating his interest in the French Revolution by visiting the sites of its famous events , Mr. White must have spent the time in the French capital to excellent advantage . Finally , in the fall of 1854 , at the earnest request of Minister Seymour , he tore himself away from Paris , going to St. Petersburg by way of Cologne and Berlin . Thus early did his diplomatic experiences begin . It was an interesting period of Russian history when the young attache took up his duties at St. Petersburg . The Crimean War was in progress and Mr. White 's duties as interpreter brought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to have made the most of such opportunities . While performing the work connected with his position in the legation , he did not neglect his reading and studies . Gibbon , Guizot , the preparation of an article on " Jefferson and Slavery , " ( later published in the Atlantic Monthly ) , occupied his spare time . The Autobiography contains a graphic description of the death and funeral of Czar Nicholas I. and of the ceremonies connected with the accession of  | Alexander II . But Mr. White was evidently resolved to build a good foundation , for in a short time he gave up the attractive post at St. Petersburg in order to devote himself to further study at the University of Berlin . Here he heard lectures by such men as Van Raumer , Ritter and Ranke . His characterization of Ranke is interesting and one can not forbear to quote : " The lectures of Ranke , the most eminent of German historians , I could not follow . He had a habit of becoming so absorbed in his subject as to slide down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling , and then with his eye fastened on the tip of it , to go mumbling through a kind of rhapsody , which most of my German fellow-students confessed they could not understand . It was a comical sight ; half a dozen students crowding around his desk , listening as priests might listen to the sibyl on her tripod , the other students being scattered through the room in various stages of discouragement . " Leaving Berlin in 1856 , Mr. White traveled in Italy , and in the summer of the same year returned to America . In the fall of the next year he took up his duties as professor of history at the University of Michigan . The two leading motives of his life ? diplomacy and education ? have now been sounded and we shall not attempt to follow further the chronological development of his career , but simply direct attention to three or four of the important phases of his life . As a scholar and man of letters Mr. White devoted himself chiefly to history , and his election as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of membership in the Royal Academy of Sciences in Berlin recently conferred upon him , are an indication of the high success which he has attained in the field of scholarship . The natural bent of his mind towards historical studies is evident from the sketch of his early education already given ; wealth fortunately opened the way for the gratification of his historical tastes and for the thorough , broad preparation he so wisely gave himself . Mr. White 's sympathies as a student of history centered largely in subjects , principles , and the development of institutions . History appealed to him in its broader aspects , rather than in its narrower , specialized forms . It is not the investigation of minute points , but the study of the great movements of human history ; not unrelated episodes , but events in their causal relations , that were the goal  | of his historical studies . It was not history as a narrative of events , but history as an interpretation of principles , that captivated his interest . To him history became " less and less a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfolding of humanity . " As a student at Yale it was Guizot 's " History of Civilization in Europe " that attracted him ; the reading of the same author 's " History of Civilization in France , " he considers an epoch in his life , and his own chief work as an historian is not the narrative of a period , but the story of a great conflict of principles extending through many periods ? the Warfare of Science with Theology . One of the great defects of the specialized scholarship of modern times is undoubtedly the failure of its disciples to appreciate the relation between scholarship and life , but Mr. White has not fallen into this pit . Lover of books though he is , he has not become bookish ; ardent scholar though he is , he has never failed to view scholarship in its true perspective . His early training and the activities of his later life saved him from this danger , which has fossilized many a scholar . While studying and teaching , he has almost constantly been taking an active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Revolution , he was talking at the Hotel des Invalides " with old soldiers , veterans of the wars of the Republic and of Napoleon , discussing with them the events through which they had passed ; " while continuing his studies in modern history at St. Petersburg , he was observing , at the close range of an interpreter , Nesselrode , the last survivor of the great diplomatists of the Napoleonic period : while on leave of absence from the University of Michigan , he was taking a most active part in the politics of New York as a member of the State Senate . Thus , while studying , teaching and writing history , Mr. White has been helping to make history , and it is therefore not surprising that his lectures were permeated by a spirit that attracted students . They flocked to hear him , and left his lecture room not only with facts in their note-books but with inspiration and enthusiasm in their hearts . Writes one of these students who has himself achieved fame as a historian and now holds a chair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt if ever young man spoke more effectively to young men . Full of the life and warmth and color of his own ardent nature , pictorial in their  | correctness , glowing with an ethical passion , which his broad and generous culture saved from all taint of bigotry , such words of fire I have not known in any other lecture room . " The testimony of another who heard him when he began his work at the University of Michigan is no less enthusiastic : " His instruction in history was a genuine revelation to those who had been accustomed to perfunctory text-book work , and the hearing of dry , colorless lectures . The exceptional excellence of his instruction consisted largely of the spirit which he infused into his students . He had in a remarkable degree the rare gift of seizing upon the most important principles and causes and presenting them in such a manner as to illuminate the whole course of events with which they were connected . He not only instructed , but what was even more important , he inspired . While he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university was pursued with so much enthusiasm by the mass of students as was that of history . " Mr. White studied and taught history with an ulterior motive . He began his work as a professor of history , not so much because he was interested in the past , per se , but because he wanted to aid in training up " a new race of young men , who should understand our own time and its problems in the light of history . " More highly than historical subjects themselves , he prized the opportunity , through them , " to promote a better training in thought regarding our great national problems . " As an educator , Mr. White 's great monument is , of course , Cornell University . It is true the man whose name the institution bears shared in the labors and responsibilities of its founding ; he and others have made larger contributions to the university endowment than has Mr. White , and succeeding presidents and faculties have greatly extended the scope and usefulness of the institution , but all have built on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may justly be regarded as the founder of this great institution of learning , but intellectually , White was its founder . Cornell University existed in the mind of Mr. White years before a fortunate combination of circumstances made the realization of his plans a possibility . It was an idea born of the dreams and enthusiasm of youth , matured during European  | travels and the professional experience at the University of Michigan . While teaching at Michigan he began to plan the ideal university he would found in New York ; and when , during these years of dreaming and planning , George William Curtis paid him a visit , the young professor of history dreamt aloud to the man of letters . Speaking in 1868 , at the founding of the university , Curtis described in interesting terms the educational plans of the Michigan professor . They were talking together one evening and " There , " said Curtis , " in the warmth and confidence of his friendship he unfolded to me his ideas of the great work that should be done in the great State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the greatest State there should be the greatest of universities ; in Central New York there should arise a university which , by the amplitude of its endowment and by the whole scope of its intended sphere , by the character of the studies in the whole scope of its curriculum , should satisfy the wants of the hour . More than that , ' said he , it should begin at the beginning . It should take hold of the chief interest of this country , which is agriculture ; then it should rise , step by step , grade by grade , until it fulfilled the highest ideal of what a university could be . ' Until the hour was late the young scholar dreamed aloud to me these dreams . " A decade later the dream was realized . Space does not permit a detailed account of the founding of Cornell University . It was while Mr. White was in the Senate of the State of New York , serving as chairman of the committee on education , that circumstances cleared the way between dreams and reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1862 the federal government had made a most generous grant of land to the States for technical and industrial education , but it seemed likely that the advantages expected from the grant would be dissipated in New York by a division of the endowment among several instititutions . Mr. White saw the danger and resolved to combat it . His efforts , strange to relate , brought him into conflict with the very man who was to work with him in founding the great university of Central New York . Ezra Cornell , " a tall , spare man , apparently very reserved and austere , " chairman of the committee on agriculture , favored a division of the fund between two institutions . But White protested vigorously and exerted  | himself to the utmost to prevent such a division . There was nothing bitter or personal in the differences between White and Cornell . Both were too sincerely anxious to accomplish a great good to permit their divergent opinions to entirely estrange them . In fact , in their general purpose to do something for the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not surprising that eventually their views harmonized and Mr. Cornell not only agreed that the land grant should not be divided , but promised to add several hundred thousand dollars of his own in order that an entirely new university might be founded . The university was new in more senses than one . Not only was it a newly founded institution , but the principles which were to determine its character were essentially new . Cornell University was one of the pioneers in a new educational movement in the United States . It was among the first institutions to adopt ideas and methods entirely different from the prevailing theories and practice , but which have since become well-established principles . Cornell was founded in the age of transition between the sectarian colleges of the past , with their prescribed courses and iron-bound rules , and the new , unsectarian institutions of the present , with their elective courses and elastic rules . Mr. White himself determined almost entirely what the plans of the new institution should be ; while Mr. Cornell dealt with the financial difficulties presented by the undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educational clauses of the university charter , and , after much urging , became the first president of the institution . A man of broad , progressive views , he planned an institution that has indeed fulfilled the needs of the hour . As is so frequently the case , however , only in spite of many obstacles , and in the face of strong opposition from those wedded to the old ways in education , did he push through to success the ideas for which he stood . Entire freedom from sectarian control , recognition of the value of technical and industrial training , fuller recognition of the importance of the sciences , equal educational opportunities for both men and women , are the foundation principles upon which Cornell was built . The diplomatic services of Mr. White cover a long period , and they brought him into positions of great importance and controlling influence . At intervals from 1854 , when he began his  | experience in diplomacy as an attache of the St. Petersburg legation , to 1903 , when he resigned from the German embassy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . In 1871 , when the question of the annexation of Santo Domingo was arousing keen discussion , President Grant sent him as one of the commissioners to that island . In 1879 he went to Paris as a commissioner to the exposition ; from 1879 to 1881 he was minister to Germany ; from 1892 to 1894 , minister to Russia ; from 1885 to 1896 , a member of the Venezuelan Commission ; from 1897 to 1903 , ambassador to Germany , serving during that time also as president of the American delegation at the Hague Peace Conference . It is a long record , and we can refer only to a few important phases of his diplomatic career . By personal temperament , as well as by education and training , Mr. White was admirably fitted to be a successful diplomat . Hisappointments came to him quite unsought ; indeed , many of them came as surprises to himself , and more than once he gave up these positions in spite of strong protests from the governmental authorities . The desire of a Democratic President , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petersburg was a high tribute to the value of his services . The crowning work of Mr. White 's diplomatic career was , perhaps , his mission to Germany , including his work at the Hague Conference . He went to Germany at a time when many perplexing problems threatened to disturb the relations between the two countries and to make the life of the ambassador anything but pleasant . " It was with anything but an easy feeling , " he tells us , that he sailed from New York in the spring of 1897 . Chief among the causes of irritation was the tariff controversy , and it seems to have been approaching a climax when he arrived at his post of duty . While German manufacturers were in vain attempting to scale our tariff wall , American farmers were selling their products in Germany at prices which were driving German goods out of the market . Small wonder was it , therefore , that a very hostile feeling grew up in the German empire against Americans , and that Air . White found " but two newspapers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassing questions also arose . The protection of troublesome , naturalized American citizens , the Samoan difficulty ,  | the relations with China , and especially the unfriendly attitude of Germany in the Spanish-American war , kept Ambassador White busy pouring oil on troubled waters . Even the war-cloud seemed at one time to cast its ominous shadow over the two countries , but thanks , largely , to the fine tact and diplomatic skill of the ambassador , the cloud blew over , and the relations between Germany and the United States are today on a much more friendly basis than they have been in many years . It is true the tariff cloud is again visible on the horizon , and it will be interesting to see what course events will take when Germany begins to enforce her new schedules . The cultivation of a better understanding between Germany and the United States ever lay near to Mr White 's heart . This he made one of the prime objects of his official and non-official labors , both in this country and abroad . In formal diplomatic negotiations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars , business men , in season and out of season , he has labored to bring the two countries together . At the Hague Conference , as president of the American delegation , he strove for the exemption of private property from capture on the high seas and for some definite advance toward international arbitration . At the allotted three-score-and-ten Mr. White withdrew from active work in the diplomatic service , but the loss of the Department of State has been a gain to the world of letters . The publication of these reminiscences and of sundry articles in the magazines seems to indicate that the years yet remaining in this most useful life are by no means to be devoted to ease and idleness .
