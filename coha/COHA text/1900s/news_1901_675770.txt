txt While some 10,000 people were celebrating President Clausen 's decision to remove the Spate pay chairs from the parks last night , Mr. Spate and his counsel were taking measures to prevent Mr. Clausen from carrying out his Intention . In order to do this an injunction was obtained from Justice of the Supreme Court , and this injunction will be served on President Clausen and the other members et the board early this morning . In his application for the injunction Mr. Spate says that he has already spent $21 , - 000 in getting his chairs ready for the parks , and that he wilt lose this money if President Clausen 's plans are carried out . In his affidavit Mr. Spate also declares that on April 16 last , in order to promote the public enjoyment of the parks , he entered into a contract with the Park Board for a period of five years from April 1 . DOI , agreeing to pay *500 a year for the privilege of placing chairs in the parks . He was to maintain a sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was entitled to charge 3 cents for plain chairs and 5 cents for armchairs to each person using them . He says further that the Board of Park Commissioners is to meet at 11 o'clock this morning and pass a resolution revoking his contract , which he asserts they have no right to do . On this application Justice granted the preliminary injunction and made the order returnable at 10:30 A. M. Mcnday next . Until that time Mr. Spare Can continue renting his chairs , providing no other injunctions are obtained . It was understood last night that another injuneMu was being prepared by a newspaper . This is directed against both Mr. Spate and the Park Board , and if granted would tie un the question of rental of the chairs until the validity of the contract was determined . CHAIRS WELL PATRONIZED . Despite these legal proceedings and the public announcement of President Clausen that he had decided to rescind the contract . the Spate chairs did a better business yesterday than on any day since they were placed in the parks . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbance there at any time . This was partially due to the fact that the chairs were not distributed In long rows . Instead of this they were placed in large yiles , with policemen conveniently near them . When a Arson wanted to rent a chair the attendant would take it from the pile and place : t whereever the patron desired . The attendante in Madison Square reported the sale of th.uble the number of tickets sold on any previous day . The chairs were particularly well patronized last night during the anti-chair celebration near by . The celebration hail been arranged by The New York Morning Journal , which supplied a band and elaborate fireworks , as well as speakers . In a way Police Commissioner Murphy aided this celebration of the supposed victory over President Clausen and Mr. Spate . The original intention was to hold the et  --  lebration in Madison Square , and it was so advertised . A permit was asked for and refused by President Clausen on the ground that it wet for advertising purposes . It was explained that the only permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during campaigns , and that these were issued sparingly . Commissioner Murphy was appealed to , and he said that he had no power to issue a permit for a meeting in the park , but that he had jurisdiction in the streets g. " .0 feet away from the park . This was taken as a hint , and an application was made to him for a permit to meet on Fifth Avereie below Twenty-third Street . He promptly granted it , as the point was outside the limit of the Park Board 's jurisdiction . The stand was erected , and it was here , within a short distance of the Spate chairs , that the celebration was held . Dr. W. J. O'Sullivan acted as the Chairman of the meeting . In his speech insopening the meeting he said , in part : The fathers of this Republic formulated the guiding monition that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty . ' The great Democratic organization of this city has faithfully adhered to both the letter and the spirit of this axiom . and we are assembled here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate its recognition . " As you are aware , under our present city charter , the heads of the various municipal departments after the first six months of their installation can not be removed from their publeo office except rot ' cause sufficiently grave to warrant charges of malfeasance in office . The heads of the various municipal derartments today are independent of our chief municipal executive , and each act of theirs is done solely on their own responsibility . " When the Park Commissioner , Mr. Clausen. undertook to introduce into our parks the system of renting chairs , he undertook an experiment which was sub:feet to public approval or disapproval . This system which you have justly condemned , has been tried in the larger cities of Europe and been successful . What the Park Commissioner overlooked was the fact that in introducing into our democratic city a European idea which inclined to a class distinction , he was antagonizing a fundamental proposition upon which our free institutions rest . It was a serious error of judgment on his part , and he has shown his good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most decisive . " I bee to assure you that the organize= tion of Tammany Hall has been opposed to this innovation from its inception , and from its great leader to some of its humblest members , many efforts have been made to convince the Park Commissioner that he was in error its Introducing such an innovation in the parks of our city . " ? THE POLICE PRECAUTIONS . The other speakers were Julius Harburger , Gen. James R. O'Beirne , James 0113. - pr , and J. S. Crosby . Each one of the speakers advocated the rights of the people in controlling the parks . When one of the speakers said , " You may not know it , but you have a moral right to go there to the Fifth Avenue Hotel and stay without paying " some of the crowd looked in the direction of the hotel and acted as if they would like to try that plan During this meeting Capt . Flood of the Tenderloin Station was on hand with a large force of policemen . When the band had played its last piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly deployed a number of his men along the-edge of the park fronting toward the place where the meeting had been held . These men were ready to turn aside any concerted effort on the part of the crowd to destroy the chairs . At the same time the Captain had assigned one man to each chair on the walk . It seemed as if every person who had listened to the speaking had business on the walk where the chairs were placed . as at least two-thirds of the/people passed along that way to their homes . " Move on . " " Please go along quietly , " were the words said over and over again by the policemen who backed tip these requests by a very persuasive swinging of , their clubs . There was no outbreak at any time , and after the crowd had viewed the innocent green chairs they dispersed . After the main crowd had gone away and the extra policemen were called in a few individuals attempted to wreck some of the chairs , but they were aeon driven away .

Mr. Spate , in speaking of the trouble last might . said : " The recent statements in the news41apers bearing on the question of pay ' =chairs in the public parks have been so mis ; leading that it seems necessary that the ? facts should be set forth in the light that I view them .

When my project was unfolded to him , and the liberal feature of allowing a seat all day in any park for 5 cents was fully explained , after months of mature thought and deliberation to perfect the details , the contract was made . " It is obvious , however , on account of the recent turmoil , that people did not wish to go to the parks and be mixed up in scenes of disorder , or if they- availed themselves of the new privilege be subjected to a running torrent of profane abuse and impudent language from the crowds of idlers that have been permitted to gather .
