? Ys : have before us now , on Cromwell , Carlyle 's Lile and Letters , Mr. Gaiiilinehs history Of the period , the last voltithes of Mr. Lecky 's history , and Mr. Morley 's Lqe ; to which distinguished list should be added the historical chapters of Mr. Afasson 's Milton , which , put together and expanded in parts , might be found the best historic mirror of the time . " barest thou wed the Heaven 's lightning . then ? " ejaculates Carlyle , speak- int ' Cromwell 's slaughter of the garrison of I ) rogheda . Sage of Chelsea , we dare not ; see should be upsetting the balance of our historical judgment . There was sure to be a recoil from Carlyle . " Dry-as-dust " was sure to have his own again . Dry-as-dust was , of course , indispensable and inestimable . Yet if there has been a man of transcendent power who has done great things for his kind , though far from being " godlike " he may be altogether fallible , human admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , retort that Dry-as-dust 's minute criticisms of character and motive were idiosyncratic , and probably had no surer basis ( hairthe hero - worshiper 's rhapsodies of ail-.iration . Carlyle has also the advantage of treating history with perfect breadth and freedom on its comic as well as till its serious side . The admission of humor into history is the unique stroke of his genius . Oliver 's character is a very interesting Study in itself as a remarkable combination of power with flue tenderness chide ( you totally wanting in the character of Napoleon . To his power there could be no stronger testimony than that of his arch-enemy Clarendon , in whom admiration visibly struggles with haired . " ' I 's reduce three nations , which perfectly hated him , to an entire obedience to all his dictates ; to awe and govern those nations by an army that was undevoted to him and wished his min , was an instarIM of a very prodigious address . But his greatness at home was but a shadow or the glory he had abroad . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , or the Low Countries , where his friendship was current at the value he put upon it . And as they did all sacrifice their honor and their interest to his plc : - sure , so there is nothing he could have // demanded that either of them would have denied him . " Clarendon goes on to mention the t WO instances of his protection of ! lie Protestants in Savoy and Languedoc . That the three nations " perfectly hated " Cromwell and that the army " was 1111- d , oled to him " are the ideas of Mr. 1 vile . But it is certain that Cromwell 's ? kes ? ii was shown in bending to his Will and using in his service men like Monk , itrogidli. and Whitelocke , who had no atbielitnent to his person or to his cause . The steward of Cromwell 's lionSeholkl , writing after his master 's death , says , " His temper was exceeding fiery , as I have known , but the flame of it , kept town for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie was naturally compassionate towards objects in distress , even to an effeminate measure , though God had made hint a heart wherein was left little , room for any fear but what was due to Ilimself , of which there Was large proportion . A larger soul , I think , has seldom dwelt in a ' louse of clay than his was . " Cromwell 's Gamily affections were strong , and show themselves in his letters at the most critical periods of his life . The death of a favorite daughter was one of the things that brought him to the grave . Cromwell 's character had for its basis religion , and of the most enthusiastic kind , commencing with a dark spell of spiritual wrestlings with evil . A good key to it is the Pilgriln : n Progress . In every crisis of his wonderful life Oliver evidently was upborne by the belief that he was in the hand of God . He ever trusted in divine guidance , and found support in prayer . In this respect a greatly softened counterpart of him has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Cromwell 's faith was of a very simple k inm I , and would not have been out of place at a camp-meeting . He was , of course , utterly uncritical . He believed in the literal inspiration of the whole of Scripture . Ile drew no distinction , unfortunately , between the Old Testament and the Ness . His enthusiasm was not free , norwas it possible that it should be free . from fanaticism . In his language there is often an unctuousness which offends our skeptical taste . But of his sincerity there can be no doubt . Of that we have proof in the death-bed scene , as well as in the transport of supreme exaltation when the sun rises on victory at Dunbar . here were 41 the Revolution two InOvemelds , distinguishable though blended , the political and the religious ; resistance to the usurpation of Charles , alol resist:Mee to the ecclesiasticism of Laud ; tiro allied powers of reaction . Cromwell belonged to the religious movement , while Pym . and still more distinctly the highly secular Martin , belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind in judging of the consistency of Cromwell 's course when Ike had risen to power . amt especially of his apparent willingness to : Weep ! the title of king . Ile was never a political revolutionist . At the outset , at all events , he would have been control with a really constitutional monarchy , provided there was freedom of religion . Nor was he ever an enemy to aristocracy , though it was With the democracy that his lot as the leader of the independents was cast . Ile avowed that he honored a real gentleman . To the Levellers be was utterly opposed . 011 the other hand , the two movements being blended as they were , Cromwell was a politician and a partner in the ideas and counsels of Pynd Hampden , and the other political leaders of the party . We have him in the long ' Parliament taking part in debate with great vehemence of manner , with unpolished language , and an untunablc voice , yet with effect . Napoleon was a soldier before he was a statesman , and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a statesman before he was a soldier , and in government preserved his statesmanlike and constitutional tendencies and ideals . Cromwell 's education had not been high , though he had spent a year at Cambridge . his standard of education was very modest , comprising only a little his- tory , geography , and mathematics , a small measure , probably , of the last . But he was no Muggletonian enemy of secular science and learning . On the contrary , he respected them both . He saved the Universities from the fanatics who would have destroyed them . He made himself Chancellor of Oxford , and gave it a set of heads under whom it had its only period of intellectual activity and usefulness to the nation between the Middle Ages and the reforms of the last century . Ile appreciated college culture , and tried to draw young men of promise from the Universities to the service of the state . To extend academical culture to the North , he founded the University of Durham . It was not likely that a man who took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It appears that Cromwell was out - generated by Leslie , who had learned his science in the Thirty Years ' War , and would have been defeated by him at Dunbar had not Leslie 's hand been forced by the demented enthusiasts on his side . Not much generalship of the higher kind , in fact , was shown either by the Parliamentary or the Royal commanders . Cromwell became a supreme leader of cavalry at a time when the cavalry was the important arm , t1M infantry being a weak combination of the pikeman with the musketeer who carried a clumsy weapon with a ponderous rest , and depended on the pikeman to shield hint from the horsemen . Cromwell ? always had his troopers well in hand , and his charges were effective . He seems also to have made good use of artillery . Ruined castles , at least , are always said to have been battered by Cromwell . But his grand services in the war were the spirit which he brought to it and the insight which led Idin to replace the " tapsters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were full , with religious yeomen qualified to cope with the fiery valor of the Cavalier . He brought , too , a hopefulness which no reverse could quell , and which burned in him like a pillar of fire . Finally , unlike Manchester and other half-hearted 01111-manders , he saw and acted on the con. viction that the only way to sure peace was decisive victory . Without him unquestionably the Parliamentary raise would have been lost . Clarendon has done Cromwell the justice of saying that he was not a man of blood . He certainly was not . He voted for the death of Strafford , who is now an object of interest and pity . But there could be no doubt that Strafford , after passing from the patriot ranks into the place of favorite and minister of autocracy vacated by Buckingham , had conspired against public liberty , and raised an army in Ireland by arbitrary methods for the purpose of making the king absolute . He was proved to have avowed his design at the Council Board . Mr. Gar-diner 's interpretation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laud in their correspondence as denoting merely thorough-going devotion to the king 's service , will surely not bear examination . What did Strafford mean by saying that he " wished Hampden and others to his likeness were whipped into their right senses " ? For the execution of Laud , a needless act of cruelty when the old man was powerless and a captive , Cromwell was not responsible . It was the act of the Presbyterians . But Liberal writers who show their philosophy by patronizing Laud should remember that they have not , for writing against Prelacy , been whipped , branded , had their tongues bored , and been sent to confinement for life in a lonely fortress . Land , let it be noted , was the innovator . Ile tried to force his mimic Catholicism on a nation which before had been Protestant ? as the position of the communion table the churches showed . Charles tried to force autocracy on a nation which under his father had been Parliamentary , using a prelatical church , according to his own avowal , as an instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolition ; the English Revolution Was one of resistance to reaction . // There can be no doubt that Cromwell for that age , humane in war . At Worcester he risked his Own life in riding forward to persuade the Scotch to accept quarter . We have him after being twice Una ! on by the Clubmen still forbearing Iii fill upon them , and imploring them to 4k/terse . The exception , and about tie darkest stain on Cromwell 's memory , is r ! II ? slaughter of the garrison of Drogheda . The feeling of English Protestants towial the Irish Catholics after the Ulster massacre of 1641 war that of the Britkli toward the Sepoy mutineers after the massacre of Cawnpore . The war of the 1 , IT5 and religions in Ireland had been waged with fiendish ferocity on both sides . The Papal Nuncio Rinuccini triumphantly reports that after a victory won by the Catholics no prisoners had been taken . The law of war in those days , and indeed , theoretically , even in the ilays of Wellington , was that a garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not entitled to quarter . Cromwell 's temper , as Maidstone says , and as more than once unhappily appeared , " was fiery , though the flame of it was for the most part kept down by his moral endowments . " In this case it was not kept down . Cromwell had led the third storming party in person when two had been repulsed , and Radajos and San Sebastian can tell how fierce are the passions which the storming of a city sets on fire . Cromwell did not thank God for the massacre , as some who rave against him would have us think ; he thanked God for the victory , and excused the slaughter on the ground of just retribution and necessary example . The execution appears to have been confined to the soldiery and some friars who were trumpeters of the rebellion . The armies of Alva , Parma , and Tilly , put citizens of cities taken by storm , as well as the garrison , to the sword , and sacked the cities . For the slaughter at Wexford Cromwell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the victorious soldiery and the citizens , the citizens having provoked resentment by their drowning of Protestants nail their piracy . Cromwell 's proclamation on landing in Ireland assuring all non-combatants of impunity and protection was the first nitre of humanity heard in all those years . Its promise was strictly kept and sternly enforced against any attempt al outrage ; whereas Rupert 's Cavaliers marauded at their will and sacked a captured city . Another and very different occasion on which the " flame " of Cromwell 's temper broke out and was not controlled by the moral endowments was the turning out of the Long Parliament , the " Rump , " as it was then called , and had in fact beemne . That assembly contained some very able and very noble men , but it was a party oligarchy without eredeniiids , hopelessly unnational and odious to the Puritanism militant of the army by which the victory had been won , and to the people at large . Some of its members were corrupt , and their corruption tainted the body . Its finance was confiscation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous though , on the whole , triumphant war with the Protestant Commonwealth of Holland . It had to depart , and it bad made it clear that it would not depart of its own accord . But the contumely with which Cromwell expelled it was in every way a mistake , and sowed his future path with thorns . He had served it , he had accepted rewards and honors at its hands . He owed it at least a decent funeral . He appears to have had difficulty in winding himself up to the striking point , and , tints wound up , to have lost his self-control . The want of command of language which appears in his speeches may have helped , in his convulsive effort to express himself , to carry him farther than he meant to go . Something of that kind happened to Wellington in his calamitous declaration against Parliamentary Reform . The error , at all events , was great and disastrous . It was stamped by Bradshaw ; s dignified protest . But the greatest error of Cromwell 's 312 The Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in this he showed himself a main of - blood . There was in him not a particle of the Terrorist , or of the passion for regicide which slew lice helpless king of France . He had been provoked ; no doubt , by ( iha ? lesis double dealing , but he did not hate him ; On the contrary , lie was well inclined to him , and had wished to come to terms with him . Himself brimming with family affection , he had been touched by the sight of Charks with his children . Ile was impelled to the fatal aet by what seemed to him fell necessity , and by the uncontrollable wrath of the army against the king whose perfidious machinations , while Ice was treating with the Parliament for a settlement , had rekindled civil war , invited Scotch invasion , and brought them and their cause once more into the extremity of peril . It was at the prayer-meeting of the soldiers at Windsor , before they marched against Hamilton , that the king : s doom was really pronounced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England brought Charles to the block , and his offense surely was capital , though its punishment was most ill-advised . The death of the captive king set the king free and absolved the monarchy ; it put inexpiable blood between the regicides and a great part of the nation ; and flunkeyism , far from being sickened as Carlyle says it was , flourished on the martyrdom , and has continued to flourish on it ever since . The success of Eihon IMNilike was the proof . On the other hand , to compare the tribunal to a drum-head court-martial is surely unfair . Nothing could be More solemn than the trial ; and the government by which the trial was held , though revolutionary , was then the supreme power of the nation . There was /milling of the levity and monkeyism which diss graced the trial of Louis XVI . It may be added that the treatment of the king 's children at the hands of the regicides presents a striking contrast to the infamous assassination of the poor little Dauphin . Carlyle is right in saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers of Jean Jacqties . Cromwell 's motive in putting lice king to death can hardly have been to open his own way to the throne . Three months afterwards his eldest son was married to the daughter of a private gentleman , alter some rather anxious negotiations about the settlement . Richard can hardly have been regarded by his father as possible heir to a crown . As he rose , he would feel that he was rising . He said himself , " No one rises so high as he who knows not whither he is going . ' ' But after Naseby , and shortly before his utterance of those memorable words , he was seriously weighing in conferences with the Elector Palatine a proposal for transferring himself and his victorious veterans to the battlefield of GfrIllaal . A civil war should close with amnesty and settlement . That the war of the American Revolution closed , not will amnesty , but with the expulsion of the . Loyalists , and the consequent foundation by them of a hostile nation , is slur on the humanity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to exert his influence , as Hamilton did , on the right side . Cromwell 's crowning victory at Worcester Was followed by an amnesty , though one not so full as it ought to have been , or iis every sign of Cromwell 's general disposition warrants us in believing that it would have been had the decision rested with hitn alone . Master of the state after the expulsion of the Long Parliament , Cromwell showed that he did not aim at military deSpotism , by calling the Barebones Parliament , or the Nominative Parliament , as it is more rationally termed , all assembly appointed partly by the Independent chiirches , partly by the officers ; an attempt apparently to install that government of Puritan worth for which Harrison and the ultra-religious party of the Revolution yearned . The Barebones Parliament showed itself practical by set- The Great Puritan S13 fi ? , on foot social reforms which have been adopted in later days . Unit it showed it-elf Impractical in attempting at once ilisebablishment of the church and abolition of the Court of Chancery .

Unlike the Rump , it had a docent funeral . then cantle the Instillment of Government , which , if it was not the work of trinnwell , who seems , in truth , not to have been much of a builder of constitutions or sit attentive as he might have been to forms of polity , must have had his approbation . It is in a measure a republican counterpart of the old constitution with king , Privy Council , Lords , and Commons , omitting the House of Lords . The place of the king is taken by a Protector for life . elected by the standing Council of State , which takes the place of the Privy Council . Vacancies in the Council of State are filled by a mixed process of election and nomination , Parliament 11211117 six , out of whom the Council is to choose two , and present them to the Protector , who is to appoint one . There is a single House of Parliament , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipating the Reform Act of 1832 . The Protector is invested with the general prerogative of the king , domestic , and in dealings with foreign nations ; but his legislative veto is limited to twenty days , and his disposal of the forces , military and naval , a very vital ' mint at this juncture , is to be with consent of Parliament , if Parliament is then sitting , otherwise with that of the majority of the Council of State . There are safeguards against intermission of Parliaments suggested by the anti-Parliamentary action of Charles I. There is a special provision , tlielated by the necessities of the time , for the maintenance of a standing army of 10,000 horse and 20,000 foot , by a revenue not to be taken away or reduced without the consent of the Protector . Mr. Morley in his Life of Cromwell seems inclined to regard the dismission of forms of government as stale and trivial . Yet forms of government are surely important , and seldom has such a union of intelligence with experience been brought to the discussion its was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their work is at least a vigorous attempt at combining authority and stability with responsibility on an elective basis . It has long lain forgotten and mouldering in WhiteleKtkeIs But at the pass to which Democracy has now come , with organized deinagogism , party government , and the caucus , those who are seeking a way of escape from revolution on the one hand and reaction on the other may not disdain to glance at the Instrument of Government . The struggle between the Protector and the Parliament , which filled the greater part of the Protectorate , has not been depicted by any intelligent observer , but its general nature is clear . The parkin Parliament which sought to keep all power in the hands of the elective representatives of the people might ; weal with force to general principles , the assertion of which had been the object of the civil war . It is easy to sympathize with men who had been fighting for a high ideal even when they were practically ruining their own cause and doing their best to set their own heads on Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they represented the nation . They were the representatives not of the nation , but of a party ; all who had fought for the king having been excluded from election , while even of those who had not fought for the king a great part were not republican . Had they succeeded in making themselves supreme they would have at once come into collision with the body of the people . The Protectorate alone had any pretension to being national or any chance of gradually reuniting the divided and distracted nation . The tug of war seems to have been rather on the subject of the control of the army than on any of the political clauses of the In- deleted material Is speak of Cromwell 's treatment of I he Irish nation is a misuse of language . Them was no Irish nation .

The feeling of the Protestants , both Irish and English , against the Irish Catholics after the rebellion and massacre of 1641 , as was said before , Was like that of the British against the Sepoy mutineers . The Saxon after a murderous struggle had won the lard , and Cromwell could no more have taken it from him and given it to the vanquished Celt , had he been so minded , than he could have made the Shannon run back to its source . The Adventurers who had advanced money for the war on the security of rebel lands to be confiscated , and the soldiers who had received their pay in land-scrip , claimed their respective dues . The transplantation of all the Irish land - owners to Connaught , though not perhaps carried out with the full rigor of its first conception , was a cruel and hateful measure . But fell experience had shown that if the two races were mingled , one would rise and massacre the other , a catastrophe nearly repeated in 1688 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped they might be drilled into settled industry and respect for law . In all this Cromwell was not his own master , nor specially responsible . The acts were those of the Parliament . Cromwell gave Ireland peace . He united her to Great Britain , thus raising her from the condition of a despised and oppressed dependency to equality with the other kingdoms , and at the same time bringing her murderous factions under Imperial control . He sent her a kind and wise ruler in the person of his son Henry . He sent her a vigorous law-reformer in the person of Chief Justice Cook , saying that he would use her as a blank paper whereon to write reforms from which professional prejudice debarred him in England . He gave her free trade with England , a boon absolutely essential to her industry , to her prosperity , to her civilization . Religious liberty and equality he could not give , though his own inclinations were always evidently on the side of toleration . The mass was not only idolatry in Protestant eyes , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation in allegiance to a hostile power planted on the flank of England . But Cromwell " meddled with no man 's conscience , " which was something in the days of the Inquisition , and recusancy laws were not extended to Ireland . Clarendon bears witness to the material results . He says that " all this transfer of the lands was done and settled , within little more than two years , to that degree of perfection that there were many buildings raised for beauty as well as use , orderly and regular plantations of trees , and fences and enclosures raised throughout the kingdom , purchases made by one from the other at very valuable rates , and jointures made upon marriages , and all other conveyances and settlements executed , as in a kingdom at peace within itself , and where no doubt could be made of the validity of titles . " Cromwell had solved the Irish question . Not in the way in which under happier stars it would have been solved at the outset , but in the way which after so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably have been final had he lived longer . Here again his work was undone , and the results were the blight which fell on Irish prosperity , the renewal of the war of races and religions in 1688 , the Penal Code , the famines , the agrarian war , the rebellion of ' 98 , and the Irish question which has distracted the councils of the United Kingdom ever since . The place which Cromwell , as the chief of England , or rather of the Com- 316 The Great Puritan momvealth of England , Scotland , and Ireland , in his foreign policy sought for his country was the lemlership of Protestant Christendom in its antagonism to the Catholic /Hover . This policy has been said to have been belated , the treaty of Westphalia having put an end to wars of religion . Of that Cromwell was not likely to be a bad judge . Protestants were being persecuted in Savoy and to some extent in France . The Inquisition and the Jesuit were still at work . Louis XIV and James II were still hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gustav/is Adolphus . Clearly , also , there was a part for any great Christian power to play in putting down the Barbary Pirates . It has been truly remarked that in Cromwell 's aims the interest of his country went always hand in hand with that of his religion . The two in his time , as in the time of Elizabeth , were still , though it might be less manifestly , connected . his war policy was of has day , and is no model for ours . " Nobody , " said Bacon , " can be healthful without exercise , neither natural body nor politic ; and certainly to a kingdom or estate a jest and honourable wards the true exercise. ? It was , moreover , literally true that there was no peace beyond the Line . All who presumed to use the freedom of those waters were , in virtue of a Papal grant . treated by Spain as pirates . There was , in fact , a permanent state of war apart from any special declaration . Cromwell was following the track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now would be those of buccaneers . Spanish ingots were no doubt very welcome to his needy exchequer . But the nobler motive , that which launched the fiat of intervention in favor of the persecuted Savoyards and Huguenots , was always there . Jingoism can not point to Cromwell as its forerunner . Cromwell was no more like the Jingo than Milton 's sonnet on the Massacre in Piedmont is like the effusions of the Jingo bard . The wisdom of Cromwell 's choice of the French alliance has been impeached on the ground that the real danger . a , in the sequel appeared , was that of Freitoli not of Spanish , domination . But the do . cay of Spain was not then visible , inn was the danger of French ascendancy apparent . There would , in fact , have been no danger of French ascendancy hail Eng . lish policy continued to be animated tic the spirit of Cromwell . It was by /lie treasonable subserviency of the Stuarts to boas XIV that the French /11011:111q , , , was raised to its formidable height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made on Europe , and the commanding influence exercised by him , beset as he was at home by littlest ties and danger , of every kind , ( larendon 's reluctant : oh naration and Nlazarin 's enforced complaisance bear witness . Nor is it doulofff that the heart of has people was with him . " It is strange how everybody do now- , days reflect on Oliver and commend what brave things he did and made all the neighbour princes fear him . " So oars the Royalist Pepys in the Stuart days of shame . Those words also seem to indicate that the hatred of Oliver 's memory , while it is assumed to have been universal , was really rather the sentiment of the higher class , which controlled the organs of opinion and the pulpit , than that of the lower classes , which are usually dunk . At all events , there can hardly have been among the people a very bitter recollection of government by the sword . Never was the state better served in peace or war than it was served under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the members of the Council of State . The Protector fearlessly employed men like Broghill and Monk who could be useful to the public without thinking too much about their attachment to himself . The whole machinery of bas government seems to have horn good . A spy system is an unpleasant necessity , but a necessity in tins case it was , and it was curiously efficient .

Still mi ire was it shown in grappling with mu-Mo. and with mutiny of such soldiers as bk . Most of all , perhaps , was it shown in Ili , : perfect self-possession and devotion to his public work in face of the constant ibinger of assamination , a peril which has shaken souls unshaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was upborne by his religion . Of ( iiromwell 's colonial policy Ban- says : " English history must judge of Cromwell by his influence MI the instiunions of England ; the American coloobis remember the years of his power as the period when British sovereignty was for them free from rapacity , intolerance , and oppression . He may be called the benefactor of the English in America ; for he left them to enjoy unshackled the liberal benevolence of Providence , the freedom of industry , of commerce , of religion , and of government . " Had this policy been afterwards pursued there would have been no rupture , no war of the American Revolution , no war of 1812 . Roger Williams , and a few spirits of the Dawn , as well as a few thoroughgoing freethinkers and iconoclasts like Martin , had embraced the idea of complete separation of the church from the state and perfect freedom of religious opinion . But England was not vet ripe for disestablishtnent . The nation as a whole still craved for a national religion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was renouncing its allegiance to God . The Presbyterians , now in fact the predominant sect , were as persecuting as any Prelatist or Papist . They had framed an Act of Parliament punishing anti-Trinitarian heresy with death . Toleration was intensely odious in their eyes . By the Instrument of Government the Christian religion contained in the Scriptures was to be " held forth and reconu mended as the public profession of those nations . " But to the public profession held forth none were to be compelled by penalties or otherwise , but endeavors were to be used to our them by sound doctrine and the example of a good conversation . Such as professed faith in God by Jesus Christ , though differing in judgment . front the doctrine , worship . or discipline publicly held forth , were not to be restrained from but protected in the profession and exercise of their religion , so that they did not abuse this liberty to the civil injury of others and to the actual disturbance of the public peace on their parts ; provided that this liberty were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as under the profession of Christ held forth and practiced licentiousness . Tittles were to be maintained till a better and less contentious provision could be made . A national establishment with toleration outside it was the general principle afterwards adopted in the Toleration Act of William III . Cromwell 's establishment comprehended all Trinitarian Protestants of whatever denomination . Within that circumscription the title to the ministry recognized by his ' priers was not dogmatic , but personal . Nor does it appear that Anglicans in opinion were excluded so long as they forbore to use the Anglican liturgy . Baxter , who was a Royalist and anti-Cromwellian , allows that the Protector 's Commissioners " put in able and serious preachers W110 lived a godly life of what tolerable opinions so-ever they were , so that many thousands of souls blessed God . " Thus the people gained , as far as at the flair was possible , that for which Cromwell himself had taken up arms , 111111 which in his eyes was the great object of the civil war . Atnong tolerable opinions were not reckoned Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not only religious , but political : Anglicanism hostile to the Commonwealth ; Roman Catholicism hostile to all Protestant Governments . But Anglicanism , as we /nay gather from Evelyn 's Diary , en- 318 7'he Great Puritan joyed generally a large measure of conni Vance . Nor does it appear that the treatment of Roman Catholics was so harsh as it had been under former governments . Archbishop Usslier was highly honored by Cromwell , who gave him a public funeral , and there are some symptoms of a kindly feeling on the part of the Protector himself toward the old Church of the nation . Cromwellian comprehension seems , at all events , to have effectually ousted Prelacy from any scat which it may have had in the heart of the people . " 1 and Lieutenant Lambert , " says Pepys , " to West-Minster Abbey , where awe saw Dr. FreWen translated to the Archbishopric of York .

" The most arbitrary act dime by the Protector was the temporary institution of Major-Generals . This was clear disregard of law , and could be justified only by the state of the country seething with insurrection , both of Royalists and Levellers , which threatened a renewal of civil war . The moral censorship which was combined with the military and fiscal functions of the Major-Generals is probably said with truth to be traceable to Cromwell 's own mind and to mark the path into which he wished to lead the nation . We see here the Puritan ideal . Bear - baiting , bull - fighting , and cockfighting were put down , not because they gave pleasure to the spectator , but because they were wrong . Horse-racing was generally forbidden on account of the dangerous crowds which it drew , but permitted when the attendance was safe . Cromwell himself was very fond of horses . There was everywhere a raid upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and vagabondage in general . Puritanism abolished the church holidays , Christmas , and May games , unwisely and to its own undoing .

On the whole , probably the extent of the Puritan war on cakes and ale and the annoyance it caused ally decent liver have been overstated . Pepvs , who was a voluptuary as well as a Royalist , shows no marked sense of escape from a yoke . What probably hurt the feelings of the masses more was the sight of arbitrary power in the hands of men of their own class . But Cromwelfs social policy no doubt was doused to prove the difficulty of raising general morality to a higher plane . Govermuent by the sword is the grvai - est. of evils . Government by the sword the Protector 's was in the sense thud the army was provisionally used to uphold the settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was administered by the ordinary judiciary . Nor did the government in any ordinary case set itself above the law . In cases of con spiracy and insurrection a High Court of Justice was formed , but it was Most respectably composed and followed the rules of evidence ; nor has the justice of its sentences been in any case impeached . This was better than packing juries , which would have been the alternati , dd unless the enemies of the settlement urn to be allowed to overthrow it , murder the head of the nation , and renew the civil war . The discipline of the soldiery was perfect . No serious case of outrage is recorded . It was with the highest compliments that the army was disbanded at the Restoration ; and its veterans were noted for their good conduct in the callings to which they returned . Let this be contrasted , say , with the repressive action of the Directory after the French Revolution . It is admitted by the severest critics of the Protectorate that there was no more interference than was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the re et opposed to Cromwell 's principles , ttnell as Hobbes , Cleveland , and D'Averant , soon found themselves secure , and tarried on their work freely under his rule . In dealing with old political comrades vim had been estranged from him and plotted against him , the Protector showed himself always mindful of general sympathy and former connection . Settled and essentially conservative though Parliamentary government , with veil , social , and legal reform , and the largest attainable measure of religious freedom , made up the Protector 's home policy , while his foreign policy was one of national greatness combined with Protestant leadership in Europe . Though the robes of Monarchy are too gorgeous , Democracy need not go naked ; nor , ruled as we are by our senses , is it desirable that it should . The second and grander installation of the Protector was a model of republican ceremonial , thoroughly significant and impressive without being overdone ; the true medium between the gaudy coronation of George IV and Jefferson , as the legend represtmts him , hitching his horse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been stately without being lavish , its entertainments consisting largely of music , of which Cromwell was very fond . It was also admirable in contrast with litany royal courts before and after it in presenting a picture of domestic purity and love . The offer of the crown was made by the party , no doubt very large both in Parliament and the country , which desired a settled government , and saw the best hope of it in a return to old names and ways , together with the lawyers whose forms were all monarchical . The immunity , secured by the old statute , for adherence to a king de facto against the legal vengeance of a Restoration , had also great effect . Nor , as has already been said , was there in Cromwell 's political principles anything repugnant to consti tutional monarchy with a free church . But the veto of the companions in arms to whom he owed his position was decisive . The substitution of nomination for election in the succession to the Protectorate practically made the Protectorate hereditary . Had Cromwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been a sort of counterpart of the Stadtholderate of I lolland . To the questions Why did Cromwell fail ? the answer is that Ise did not fail . He failed at least only as Gustavus Adolphus had failed on the field of ImIzen . Worn out with care , broken by the death of his favorite daughter , he died before his hour . There can be no doubt that the Protectorate was taking root . It was supported by multitudes who , careless of form and title , wanted security for stable government and freedom from a recurrence of civil war . Cromwell 's glory and his ascendancy in Europe fired the national heart . Evens the nobility were beginning to be reconciled . The purchasers of crown , church , and confiscated lands formed a powerful interest bound to the government from which their titles were derived . In the army and navy , both of them victorious , there was no sign of disaffection . The Protector was preparing hopefully to meet Parliament again . The chief difficulty was finance , which can hardly overthrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently deemed the Protectorate firmly founded , and would have nothing to do with Charles II . Richard , poor creature as he was , succeeded amid general acclamation , and the Royalist rising under Booth was easily put down . Could Richard have mustered courage to act on Monk 's advice and cashier the mutinous officers , perhaps had Monk himself been in Richard 's place , the Commonwealth of England , Scotland , and Ireland , with the Protectorate , might have lived . But the turbulent ambition of the chiefs of the army brought on a military anarchy , and it was from the military anarchy , not from tine Commonwealth or Protectorate , that . the Restoration was a recoil . Of course forces before suppressed ? Royalism proper , dislike of military government , dislike of Puritan austerity , jealousy of plebeian rude -- found vent and helped to bring on the reaction . The death of Cromwell before his hour and without a worthy successor was simply one of the critical accidents which baffle 011/ ' attempt to create a science of history .
