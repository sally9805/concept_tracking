txt Fire of an unexplained origin was discovered , In the First Methodist Episcopal church of Oak Park shortly before midnight , and for a time it seemed that the structure would be burned . The Cicero , the ' llidgeland , and the Oak Park fire departments responded to the alarm and by prompt work kept the damage at $500 . The church has been undergoing repairs for the last six weeks and the new interior finishing was badly damaged by the smoke and water . The floor and west wall of the building suffered from the flames . The janitor of the church said that in his belief the fire started from a lighted cigar left in the building by one of the workmen . Others said that this theory was not tenable , as no workman had been in the church for several hours previous to the fire .
