 | THE Western world has waited so long for China to rouse from her sleep of centuries that an impression has obtained that she would never awake . It is not surprising , then , that there should be a disposition to overlook the psychological moment ( if under such circumstances it may ever be accurately determined ) , when the decisive change takes place . Yet I venture to suggest that , aided by the perspective of coming years , the future historian will fix this turning-point for China somewhere among the years from 1900 to 1906 . It is perhaps too much to say that China is already fully awake , but it is certain that she has opened her eyes and is taking notice of what is going on in the world about her . In attempting to analyze the forces now struggling for mastery with the hope of in a measure determining the course upon which this vast and unwieldy ship of state is setting , it becomes necessary to examine them somewhat in detail . These forces may be roughly classified as external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign influence , and the internal forces those inherent and susceptible of development in China herself . Since the external forces are immediately responsible for the existing transformation , and certain to be very influential in shaping its course , they may well be considered first . It is not necessary , in this connection , to trace the course of foreign influence in China from the advent of the first European along through the sometimes disturbing episodes which have attended overzealous missionary labors and more or less grasping commercial exploitation . While the effect of these conditions has been subtle and farreaching , external political pressure is the direct power that is forcing China into the path of modern progress , although its most obvious manifestations are along commercial and industrial lines . So persistent and determined has this pressure been that it must by this time have accomplished the partition of the empire and its division into sections , each the scene of a system of special exploitation , had it not created , by calling into play the usual international jealousies . its own check in what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while China has as yet managed to preserve a sort of national autonomy , she has not been able to escape the influences which have been planted deeply and ineradicably in the social and political life of the empire , and which are certain to bear revolutionary fruit . To get at the effect of these external influences , and the probable results upon the future of the Far East , it is necessary to scrutinize some of the principal elements and the methods employed to introduce and advance them . Americans are not accustomed to consider political forces in connection with the struggle for foreign trade . Consequently , notwithstanding that appreciation of this question is growing with the expansion of our commerce and the recognition of its importance to our internal industrial situation , it is difficult for the average American to realize the extent to which the diplomacy of other nations carries its efforts to advance the private interests of their nationals . In no part of the world has this method been carried to such extremes as in the Far East . There an apparently innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political design in disguise , while a mild and seemingly inoffensive diplomatic note or treaty may contain the genesis of some far-reaching commercial scheme . In the Far East diplomacy stalks its political prey under cover of commercial and industrial enterprise , while commerce and industry strike at competition through open or surreptitious diplomatic wire-pulling . So closely are the two interwoven that it is often very difficult to distinguish one from the other , if indeed they are ever entirely separated . Foreign enterprises in China , as well as in most Far Eastern countries , are conducted under the terms of what are called " concessions , " which @#  | are practically analogous to our public franchises . Owing to the peculiar relations between the provincial and imperial administrations in China , the securing of a concession is almost invariably a difficult and complex matter , even when foreign diplomatic opposition is not encountered . The necessity of gaining the support or passive assent of a long line of provincial and petty local officials , as well as that of the Imperial Government at Peking , creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassinate a project . As a consequence , it has become almost impossible to secure any important concession without gaining for it the passive support of other foreign legations in Peking by a reciprocal arrangement of some kind . Americans are familiar enough with this process at home ; but our interests in the Far East have usually been compelled to make such headway as they could without much diplomatic assistance , even while encountering at every hand the hostile machinations of rival projects supported by all the influence their respective governments can exert . Of all the foreign concessions which have been made to cover and advance far-reaching political designs in China , and have at the same time exerted a tremendous and permanent influence upon the social , industrial , and political life of the nation , the railways undoubtedly take first rank . It is probable that the first railways planned for China were conceived as purely commercial projects , as the art of conquest by railroads had not then reached its later stage of development . And the earlier opposition which was encountered sprang principally from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , at least so far as popular feeling is concerned , the character and extent of such opposition was greatly exaggerated , and was largely the result of , if not entirely created by the antiforeign propaganda stimulated by reactionary official classes . At any rate , such opposition to railroad construction as still remains in China is entirely political , and any analysis of it must of necessity touch the mainsprings of the evolution which is creating the new China . In attempting to get at the determining forces which developed the prevailing system of conquest by railway in the Far East , one is inevitably drawn to the time when the Trans-Siberian Railway began to press for an outlet through Manchuria . By what schemes , promises , threats , and bribes this concession was secured by Russia will probably never be fully known . It marked the beginning of the struggle for railway " concessions " in the Far East . European chancelleries at once saw the true significance of the project , and promptly acted upon the hint . English , German , French , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even an American concession entered the field . To follow the diplomatic intricacies involved in the introduction and urging of these various projects , extremely interesting as it might be , is not possible here . The Chinese Government , awakened by this time to a partial realization of the true import of some of the demands , exerted all the art of its devious diplomacy to retard and avert them . Under the circumstances , it had only one effective means of obstruction : to play the various powers against each other . But the pressure was too strong to be long resisted by a belligerently impotent nation . However , since they found themselves powerless to stave off the inevitable , Chinese statesmen displayed remarkable ingenuity in preserving among the foreign powers a balance of interest calculated to maintain the political equilibrium of the Chinese Empire . It was not until Russia , feeling the need of an outlet to Port Arthur after she had secured a lease of that port , and desiring to extend her railroad south from Harbin , was compelled to make common cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shantung , and Manchurian concessions were secured . Nor was this done without some diplomatic side-stepping , which introduced Belgium as a joint mover with France in the Peking-Hankow project . The introduction of Belgium was a clever move , designed to allay the growing apprehension of China . It was pointed out that Belgium was not a military power and , consequently , could not be assumed to have aggressive political aspirations in China . Some of these concessions , too , took the form of a contract to build and operate the railways under an agreement by which China could in time purchase and take over control . This shows that China was becoming wary . And in this spirit , undoubtedly , the American concession was conceived whose check-  | ered history I will not attempt to trace here until the Chinese Government finally purchased it back from the promoters . Enough has probably been said , coupled with the now general knowledge of the uses to which the Russian and German railways have been put , to demonstrate the peculiar significance to China of even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of the railway concession , even American projects are now regarded with suspicion and some distrust . But the law of compensation operates here as elsewhere , and out of all this beneficial forces are gathering strength . No matter what reason led to their introduction , or the uses to which they have been put , the railroads have come to China and are there to stay . I think it probable that during the next twenty years more miles of railway will be built in China than in any other part of the world ; and while foreigners may assist in providing the capital to finance this tremendous industrial evolution , the prime movers will be the Chinese themselves , who will insist , as far as they are able , upon retaining substantial control . This disposition supplied the real force which led to the reclaiming of the CantonHankow road , and it is safe to say that hereafter no important commercial or industrial concession will be willingly granted by the Chinese Government in which Chinese capitalists are not interested , or in which the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equitable conditions , especially if public utilities are involved . The reason is that the Chinese have discovered that railroads are convenient and valuable in the development of the country . In bringing about this remarkable change in sentiment the Imperial Railways of North China is largely responsible . Originally projected by an Anglo-Chinese corporation as a means of communication between the sea and some coal-fields , this railway has been gradually extended until it has attained important dimensions , with plans for greater extensions well under way . While it employs foreign administrators in a majority of the more important positions , the road is principally owned and operated by Chinese . But the main thing which impresses the Chinese is that the road is extremely profitable . This was the one thing needed to give an enormous impetus to railroad building in China , and it has now been conclusively established . Wealthy Chinese in all parts of the empire are now willing , even anxious , to invest in railroads . In fact , a disposition to exclude foreigners from these enterprises is growing , and would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present make the foreigners a practical necessity . One of these conditions is the absence of native institutions capable of financing undertakings of such magnitude . The financial system of the country is in a chaotic state , and while there is at present a feeble effort toward reform , no great progress need be expected for many years . But the more essential reason lies in the fact that as China is now governed there is no real legal security for the property of Chinese subjects , should it become the object of either the rapacity or enmity of high officials . Of course , a liberal application of bribes in the form of " squeeze " can usually command protection ; but Chinese capitalists are coming to realize that the " squeeze " method is too elastic and uncertain to be satisfactory when applied to great interests , whose prosperity may depend upon the stability of their debentures in the financial markets of the world . So under existing conditions an enterprise composed almost exclusively of Chinese capitalists will organize as a foreign corporation for personal and business reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the co-operation of foreigners . Aside from railway , mining , and other industrial enterprises which have , by stepping outside the customary course of development of foreign commerce in China , created a peculiar relation of their own , there is the great volume of foreign trade which can not be overlooked in any estimation of external influence . In respect to her general foreign commerce , China 's position is now singular among the great nations . Foreigners can do business within the empire only at certain places , designated as " treaty ports , " which are administered under what are termed " extra-territorial rights . " While these ports seem to be comparatively numerous , they are really very limited when the vast extent and population of the empire is considered . To-day in China a foreigner requires a passport to travel away from the treaty ports , and if he does so without one it is largely at his own risk . But even under @#  | these handicaps foreign trade has grown to enormous proportions , and considerable foreign populations have settled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign concessions at Shanghai , Tien-tsin , Hankow , and other places is really astonishing , even to one who has kept in touch with the Far East in recent years . The influence exerted by the planting of these modern cities permanently in China is tremendous , incalculable , and ineradicable . From them radiate to the remotest parts of the empire commercial and industrial connections inseparable from the life of the people and indispensable to the future progress of the country . And , fortunately , the character of the foreign population is steadily changing for the better . There has been a time , not so very remote , when the China coast was the dumping ground for the derelicts of Europe and America , and when even respectable foreigners residing in China were animated by the chief purpose of getting all they could out of the country regardless of the effect of their methods upon the natives . But the time has already come when such persons and methods will find their opportunities limited in China by the same forces that limit them elsewhere . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government defective rifles and cannon of one calibre and ammunition of another calibre for them ; when worn-out machinery can be unloaded upon the Chinese as the latest and best , and when dwarf locomotives discarded by the New York elevated railroad can be used to equip a Chinese trunk line . This is all finished . The China of to-day has no more use for such things than has the United States . The European or American with a bunco game on a big scale might as well stay at home . His chance of working it will be fully as good there as it is in China ; perhaps a little better . But to the young Westerner who knows how to do something useful and is willing to do it , to the business concern which has something valuable to offer upon reasonable terms , this wonderful country beckons and will reward . One is somewhat at a loss , in turning from external to internal forces in the transformation of China , in which class to place the Japanese influence . That this is a vital factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nationality , it must be convv China 243 sidered an external element ; but in its broader , more elementary aspects it already displays tendencies , at least to me , to become associated more with the internal forces at work within the empire . Different as the two peoples are in many ways , they have and will retain characteristics which bring them in some respects nearer to each other in thought and incentive than either can approach any Western people . That there should be at present a flush of Japanese influence , perhaps out of proportion to its real carrying power , is only natural . Personally , the Chinese , as a rule , do not like the Japanese , and vice versa . But , aside from the control of what has been Chinese territory and provides a powerful political leverage , the foundations of Japanese influence are being too solidly and carefully laid to fail to accomplish some of the purposes for which they are designed . Since it is evident that the Japanese can reach the Chinese in a way Western nations can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitate in many of their phases , a study of some of these methods and purposes , in so far as they have progressed , may develop something of significance . In this it will be better to leave out of consideration that part of China where Japanese military control has established peculiar conditions , and confine myself to that greater part of the empire where the interests and influence of Japan may be still assumed , hypothetically , to be analogous to those of other powers . It so happens that the year just ended has given a significant demonstration of certain internal forces operating within the new China , which bear incidentally , even directly , upon some methods of the extension and use of Japanese influence . I refer to the so-called boycott of American goods . I was in China from the time this extraordinary movement first attracted serious attention until , after many ostentatious diplomatic burials , it reached the end of its utility and was permitted to dribble out so far as direct manifestations are concerned ; and I took more than ordinary pains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in America , where , if its true origin and import is but imperfectly understood , it has served to call attention to a matter of considerable importance ? the treatment of  | Chinese who attempt to visit the United States . This phase of the incident has been so fully discussed that it need not be mentioned particularly , except to permit me to express the opinion that our usage of certain classes of Chinese who wish to pay us a friendly visit would be more characteristic of a nation of barbarians than of a great and progressive republic , and should be corrected in the interest of the future of our trade in the Orient if ethical considerations have no weight . But the so-called boycott had a more far-reaching significance than the issue raised by this question , and deserves a more careful elucidation than it has yet received in this country . An extremely interesting and important development of the last few years in China is the unusual growth and change in character of the native press . Until recently the native newspapers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the official classes , and have exerted small influence upon the political life of the nation . Now this is entirely altered , and the manner of the change is significant . In an article previously printed in this magazine I called attention to the application of a press propaganda concerning Far Eastern affairs throughout the West , in various interests , and particularly to the activity of Japan in this respect . While Japan has , in this matter , merely copied a well-established formula long and successfully used by England in the advancement of her imperial policy , she has given another striking exhibition of her adaptability by discovering and putting into operation a new and original extension of the method . This is nothing less than its application to the native press in China . Peculiar conditions have made this comparatively easy . I have mentioned the " extra-territorial rights " under which the foreign concessions of all treaty ports are governed . Translated into practical adminstration , this means that China has no legal jurisdiction over foreigners , and only partial jurisdiction over Chinese who reside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So a vernacular newspaper , operating under a foreign charter , may be published in any treaty port subject only to the laws of the foreign nation where the charter is secured . This means , for instance , that a Chinese newspaper printed in Shanghai by a British or Japanese cor- poration is subject only to the publicity laws of those respective countries ; and it is not possible for the Chinese Government to apply a censorship . So such papers , which circulate only among the Chinese , are as free to criticise the acts of the Chinese Government and officials as is the press of New York . It is true that outside the foreign concessions the Chinese Government may exercise its authority to suppress the circulation of such papers , but attempts to do so have usually proved to be impracticable , resulting only in the punishment of a few coolies who sold the papers , while the publishers rested secure in extra-territorial immunity . Thus we have a despotic government which can not control to any appreciable extent publicity within its domain , for treaty ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly created . It requires no argument to demonstrate to Americans the political and social possibilities involved in this situation . These newspapers are already a power , and are stirring latent forces among the people which have never before been touched . I do not think I shall be accused of exaggeration when I say that control of this tremendous force of publicity , in its primal application to the mental processes of onethird of the inhabitants of the earth , hitherto cut off from and indifferent to its influence , is of extraordinary importance to the future of the Far East and to the whole world . And when I say that there is positive evidence of the existence of a systematic and well-developed plan of Japan to control and manipulate this force , or at least a predominating section of it , it will be seen that I broach a matter of some significance . While in China recently I was presented by a person in close touch with the progress of events in the Far East with a list of twentysix vernacular newspapers believed to be either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them are operating under Japanese charters , although the more important ones are . Several are printed in cities outside the extra-territorial jurisdiction , which limits , but by no means obviates their usefulness . While I have no means of accurately verifying this list , I have good reason to think it is substantially correct . It is likely that political considerations prevented all or a majority of these newspapers published in  | treaty ports from being chartered in Japan , for it could hardly be expected that rival interests would overlook such a coincidence , but the advantages of such charters to japan are obvious . Take , for instance , a Chinese newspaper printed in the foreign settlement of Shanghai under a Japanese charter . This means that the publicity laws of japan apply to its publication ; ergo , the Japanese Government can exercise the same supervision over it as it does over newspapers printed in Japan . The methods adopted in controlling the policies of these newspapers are as varied , subtle , and difficult to trace as are similar methods in England or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstantial evidence not apparent to laymen , but easily discerned by the trained journalistic eve . But let us see what these papers are doing . While this systematic effort to influence popular opinion in China , and through it governmental action , preceded the beginning of the war between japan and Russia , it did not receive its real impetus until after the war had commenced . The issue was then drawn , the fight begun , the necessity urgent . Leaving out of consideration those questions which apply chiefly to the issues of the quarrel between Russia and japan , which consisted largely of special arguments amply published in America , we may rather devote attention to matters concerning Western nations in general . Early last year there began to appear in certain Chinese vernacular papers articles which may without exaggeration be termed antiforeign in trend . These articles were so cleverly handled that for some time they attracted little attention . Indeed , their antiforeign animus was usually carefully stowed away in the body of an article just enough in its main expressions . Germany was generally made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany 's conduct in China has been such as to make her very vulnerable , and her policy is extremely unpopular with some other foreign powers , a fact that not only tended to blind the Western press as to the fundamental import of the propaganda , but was calculated to induce wide reproduction of it . To illustrate what I mean , let me recall an incident which occurred last spring . This happened before the shift of Germany 's diplomatic attitude at Peking . A Chinese official of some importance , while travelling on the German railway in Shan-tung , was insulted and subjected to indignities by a petty German railway employee . He complained to the central government at Peking , which made representations to the German Government . The situation at the time practically compelled the German Government to take the matter up ; with the result that the railway employee was dismissed and an apology made to the insulted Chinese . Naturally the incident was widely commented upon in both the foreign and native press . In this connection my attention was called to the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese interest , and I secured a number of translations . Their general tone was so identical as to leave little doubt that the same mind conceived them . To reproduce one in full would be interesting , but a brief resume must suffice . The details of the incident would be narrated in , on the whole , a fairly correct manner , although the critical mind could easily note an artful emphasis upon those passages dealing with the severe treatment of the Chinese official . The article would then proceed to draw certain inferences from the incident , pointing out the growing tendency to aggression of foreigners in China , and their habitual indifference to the rights of the Chinese in their own country , with a reference to and warning of what might be expected to happen in the future , unless the spirit of foreign aggression was checked . But the kernel would be cleverly ensconced in the concluding paragraphs , which would contain some incidental references to the unselfish efforts of Japan to free China from the foreign yoke . This cracker on the whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the casual foreign reader ; but would , nevertheless , and was obviously designed so to do , leave the impression in the mind of the Chinese reader that China must look to Japan for relief from such oppressions . This subtle and insidious revival of the antiforeign agitation had progressed for some time before the boycott of American goods cropped up . However , it had not escaped notice . Several of the more conservative British journals published in China had entered mild protests against the tenor of some articles which appeared in the native press , and cautioned moderation in language ,  | which clearly showed the existence of a sus picion as to the real influence at work . Germany and Russia were the chief targets for these attacks where some specific ground for complaint was needed , but other Western nations came in for a touch now and then , with the single exception of England . It is the plain truth that , except in regard to our exclusion laws , the dealings of the United States Government with China have been marked by unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon that America had come to stand almost apart , in Chinese eyes , from the other powers in her relations to the Far Eastern question . This was the situation when the boycott showed its head . The exact origin of this peculiar movement is somewhat obscure . There are several well-defined theories , of which the one ascribing it to an effort on the part of a rival to discredit the Chinese minister in Washington has as much plausibility as any . Taking this or any similar view of its inception , it is certain that the movement was not expected by its promoters to get beyond an academic stage , sufficient definitely to accentuate it without producing any serious consequences . Then , at the proper moment , the thing would be adjusted with a flourish of diplomatic trumpets , to the credit of certain high officials . Mr. Conger , formerly United States minister to China , brought considerable ridicule and criticism upon himself by early expressing the opinion that the boycott was simply a flash in the political pan and would amount to nothing . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ordinary experience and standards . He erred in failing to consider the new element internally operating in China , and which was quickly injected into the boycott movement . This element was the Japanese influence , operating through that part of the native press manipulated in the interests of Japan . I have been able to discover no satisfactory evidence to show that the boycott movement , in its original form , was created by this influence . But the manipulators of the propaganda in the native press were apt to grasp the opportunity . Here was provided ready to their hand a two-edged sword , slashing at American interest and prestige on one side , while cutting directly into all white foreign influence on the other . To trace the movement minutely through its uneven course , its seeming lapses into inanition , its curious revivals in many places and many forms , its persistent , steady progress at all times under governmental ban and official condemnation is not possible here . Passing through Shanghai on his way to take his post at Peking , Mr. Rockhill , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guild leaders that the boycott was merely a sporadic affair and was already abandoned . High officials at Peking promptly disavowed the whole matter , and promised energetic measures to suppress it , but it somehow continued to make headway . It is a great mistake to regard this boycott as a spontaneous expression of popular sentiment in China , called out by our exclusion law . The whole thing was carefully and systematically worked up by artificial stimulation , and indirect political pressure of a kind entirely new to China , until it assumed the outward form of a popular movement . Nor is it impossible to detect the chief means employed , and trace them with reasonable assurance to their source . The chief agency employed in the extension of the boycott agitation was , naturally , publicity . Several channels were used ; newspapers , placards , and cartoons being the principal ones . In the course of several months hundreds of thousands of placards , pamphlets , and pictorial caricatures were circulated throughout the empire . I have seen a large number of these publications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cartoons usually represented a Chinese being maltreated by a white man , presumably an American , although no particular pains was taken to preserve national identities in many of them . How these posters were circulated was at first hard to discover . Naturally , the provincial and local officials were anxious to keep their skirts clear , fearing retribution in some form , and pretended to , and in many instances did prohibit the distribution of boycott circulars and cartoons . But a convenient agency was found . Within the last few years thousands of Japanese , many of them Buddhist priests , have gone to China and are now scattered to the remotest parts of the country , where other foreigners are seldom , if ever , seen . Some estimates place the number of these Japanese now in China as high as fifty thousand , although this is probably a mere guess . @#  | However , it is certain that thousands of Japanese tradesmen and commercial agents have settled in various remote parts of the empire , adopting the life of the people and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live or engage in business outside the treaty ports , it will be perceived that considerable present and prospective commercial advantage promises to accrue through this condition , which will not be shared by other nations . Dismissing this phase of the matter , there is good reason to believe that these Japanese were instrumental in furthering the circulation of the boycott propaganda . In fact , many instances where they did so are positively known . As time passed and reports of the spread of the movement in the interior began to reach the foreign population centres , it became known that many of the placards and cartoons circulating outside the established sphere of foreign contact were of an absolutely incendiary character , couched in the same general antiforeign spirit that the " boxer " movement took root in . A movement so wide-spread and sweeping could hardly fail to leave tangible traces , and this one planted some pretty deep footprints . To carry on such a systematic campaign required organization and central direction . It also required money . The printing bills alone rain into a large sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonable estimate placed the expense in that district alone at between one and two thousand dollars a day for printing , bill posting , renting of halls for meetings , speakers , and other incidentals connected with publicity . Someone provided these funds ; someone directed their application . A brief review of conditions in Shanghai , which was the centre of the agitation , may shed some light on the matter . The movement was ostensibly carried on by the commercial guilds and presumably supported by the better class of Chinese merchants , who were supposed , through their guilds , to provide the money to keep up the agitation . But as the movement progressed it became evident that it did not have the support of the merchants , although many were constrained outwardly to array themselves with it . It soon became known that the agitation was backed by an element entirely out of real sympathy with the merchant guilds , and the human agency princv China 247 cipally employed was a class of Chinese generally spoken of as the " Japanese students . " Within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan to be educated along certain lines , and many are now back in China in the employ , openly or surreptitiously , of the Japanese Government . They form a mobile and intelligent element perfectly adapted to certain political uses in China 's present stage of development . They were the active agitators , and from their ranks the principal speakers were drafted , to address the numerous meetings that were held . I attended some of these meetings , and while I can not understand Chinese , I was able with the assistance of an interpreter to follow what was done . These meetings were invariably " packed " by the agitators . On several occasions Chinese who had been educated in America and who desired to present fairly the American side of the matter and point out the futility of such a movement were shouted down . Not only this , but surreptitious intimidation was resorted to . Chinese who deprecated the movement , and this class embraced nearly all the prominent and influential merchants throughout the empire , received threatening letters , and in some cases were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agitators . When the boycott , by the " packed " action of some of the guilds , was put into effect in Shanghai , nearly all the big Chinese compradors and merchants went to their American associates and told them that while they were very much against the boycott they were compelled to obey the mandate of the guilds . Nor is there anv sound reason to doubt that this attitude was sincere , for the longer the boycott continued the more it demonstrated that , although it might effect some casual detriment to American commerce , it was wreaking great and immediate harm to Chinese interests . An illustration or two will make this clear . For instance , a large Chinese piecegoods house which deals extensively in American cottons has for years put out certain " chops , " or brands , of its own . The goods are partly made in America , partly in England , while a considerable quantity is manufactured in a Shanghai cotton-mill owned almost entirely by Chinese . All these goods are assembled in the godowns of the firm and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Such commercial methods are common throughout the world . When the boycott was instituted this particular " chop " was blacklisted , with the result that it not only affected English-made goods , but actually boycotted goods made in Chinese mills by Chinese workmen . Another instance is that of a great American corporation which has included a number of English and German factories in its organization , retaining the English and German trade-marks . It so happens that this concern , which does an enormous business in China , operates in the Orient under a British charter . It so happens also that the brands of goods which are chiefly sold in China come from the British and German factories , having had a large sale in this region at the time they were consolidated with the American firm . All the goods sold by this corporation were boycotted , with the result that the real industrial loss fell upon England and Germany . Such cases might he multiplied ad infinitum . As the movement extended to the consumers it developed another unexpected tendency . Chinese purchasers found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they evinced a disposition to eliminate the possibility of error by refusing to buy any foreign-made goods , thus threatening many merchants with ruin . All of which merely again demonstrates the well-known fact that a general commercial boycott is a many-edged sword and will cut the hand which attempts to wield it . So it was , and must have been , that such a movement as this boycott , under the conditions possible to apply it , could only be detrimental to commercial classes in China ; and the assumption that it was supported and encouraged by this class is as destitute of fact as it is of rational incentive . Of the newspapers printed in Chinese under Japanese charters , the principal one is published in Shanghai under a title which translates into the " Eastern Times . " It is managed and edited by a Japanese brought over from japan for the purpose , and there is scarcely any reason to doubt that its policy is directed from Tokyo , or rather , as has been openly asserted in Shanghai , from the Japanese consulate . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boycott , " and set it on its feet again just as it was beginning to totter , its centre of operation apparently became the office of the " Eastern Times . " This paper actively took up the agitation , and the other vernacular papers published in the same interest throughout the country promptly followed suit . This is no matter of deduction or conjecture . It had been officially announced by the Shanghai guilds that the boycott had been suspended until the United States Congress could meet to consider the matter , and the American consul-general in Shanghai had received positive assurances to this effect . In other words , the movement , in its original form , was dead . But the new agitation quickly took root and was soon found to be making headway . Naturally , the policy of the " Eastern Times " did not escape notice . Its attitude became so flagrant and offensive that Mr. Rodgers , the American consul-general , called the attention of the Japanese consul-general to the matter . The fact that the paper was published under a Japanese charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , disclaiming personal responsibility and expressing regret at the tone of the newspaper , and intimating his intention to interpose an official check . It may be that he really intended to do this ; but a few days afterward he was recalled to Japan and a successor put in charge . Suffice to say that the " Eastern Times " did not alter its policy . On the contrary , it became more aggressive and offensive in urging it . It even went so far as to select a date , July loth , when the boycott was to be carried into effect . For some time before July 2 oth , the " Eastern Times " printed daily in large type , " Six Days until the Boycott Begins , " etc. , altering the words from day to day to suit . Meetings were organized , and the city flooded with posters and placards containing the same reminder as the " Eastern Times " daily displayed . Suddenly , almost mysteriously , the agitation revived ; and from then progressed steadily along the lines I have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times " the boycott promptly went into effect . It had not progressed far , however , before certain antiforeign aspects the movement was assuming became too serious to longer dally with . A meeting of the foreign consular body in Shanghai was held , at which it was agreed to take joint action  | to suppress the agitation . The shoe had begun to pinch other toes than American . Certain newspapers which had been directly stimulating the movement switched their attitudes overnight , and roundly denounced the boycott and the influences ( though not specifically ) behind it . Not to , to further into details , this action struck the knell of the movement so far as active agitation is concerned . It had never made any practical headway away from Shanghai . From then it was merely a question of how long it would take for the movement to die out . This is undetermined as I write this . for its mutterings can still be heard in places . And it is generally admitted that the past few months have brought a noticeable revival throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means antiwhite sentiment . It may be that we shall have to seek the ultimate results of this unusual incident in the future . The actual detriment to American commerce has been slight . But the fact that new forces exist in China with the power and will to injure American and European interests is a fact to which the Western world can not afford to be indifferent . It probably should be stated in this connection that I have information of the recent establishment of three Chinese newspapers in the Russian interest , two in the German and one in the French . Several have long been edited indirectly in the British interest . Turning to purely internal evidences of the awakening of China , they may be found on every side . And while foreign and quasiforeign influence will be deeply felt in the forthcoming transformation , the fundamental factors are to be found in the people and country ; for whatever political manifestations attend the evolution , these will always remain the chief elements with which they must be worked out . After several visits to China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal disorder , and war , I confess to a sincere liking and admiration of the Chinese people . This is no sudden or sentimental impression , but rather one which has evolved gradually from an originally adverse predisposition . In so far as any general characteristics can be associated with a race it seems to me that the Chinese are industrious , reliable , law-abiding , good-humored , capable , and tolerant . These are good qualities , and intelligently @# w China 249 directed in the path of modern progress can not fail to accomplish great results . In the prevalent Western conception of the Chinese there are , I think , several radical errors . One is that they are adverse to modern improvements ; another that they have no military capacity ; another that they are incapable of playing a significant part in the political regeneration of the nation owing to absence of a national spirit . Without pausing to discuss these propositions in detail , I will ask if these things could not have been said , with a considerable semblance to truth , about Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of the Japanese people then than they are of the Chinese people to-day . The Chinese as a people have never been averse to modern progress , except as their government has incited them to be , and used its authority and influence to keep them as they were . And this is true , I think , of the history of all peoples . Take the matter of railroads in China . For many years , or so long as the official classes circulated among the people fantastic reports about the foreign steam monsters , so long as they were taught to believe that the passage of a railway would be a desecration of the graves of their ancestors , the people were bitterly hostile to the building of such roads and were easily incited to attack surveying parties and the like . But no sooner had the railroads , in spite of these artificial difficulties , been built and put into operation than the people literally swarmed to use them . Local railway passenger traffic upon fully established roads in China has to-day no parallel except in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only this , but the Chinese are rapidly arriving at the point where they will be practically able to dispense with foreigners in the operation of their railroads . The entire northern division of the Imperial Railways of North China had not , the last time I travelled over it , a single white employee . Station agents , train dispatchers , conductors , guards , locomotive drivers , road inspectors , etc. , are all Chinese . It will be a revelation to many Westerners to make a stop at Tong-shan , where are the principal workshops of this railroad , and where with Chinese workmen the company is building its own locomotives , all its own rolling-stock , pump machinery , and similar necessities . Here foreigners still superintend the more  | important branches of the work , and will probably do so for some years to come . But , as in Japan , even this is a transitory condition . The impulse acquired by modern industries in China within the past ten years is really remarkable . At Wu-chang the Chinese are making modern rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all kinds of factories are to be seen from one end of the country to the other . And the universal opinion among foreigners who have had experience with them is that the Chinese are naturally capable in all branches of skilled and unskilled labor , and learn readily and willingly to operate modern machinery . It no longer astonishes one in China to see a Chinese electrician come to fix the electric lights or the telephone , do his work quietly and quickly , and go about his other business . The common thing now is to see wealthy Chinese going about the foreign concessions in their motor-cars , driven by native chauffeurs . Even the new woman has made her appearance . Recently I saw the young daughter of a high official riding a bicycle through a street in a foreign concession , attended by a servant on another wheel . Nor are these superficial demonstrations ; but signs of real import . I do not hesitate to express the opinion that among peoples to-day none is more disposed to take up new and improved methods than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressions created by the natural aspects of the land as one travels for days through fields of waving grain and growing crops , by thousands of villages and numerous large cities , on one of the new trunk-lines or along one of the great rivers . All this has been described many times , although it is only lately that Westerners have begun to look upon it all with eyes toned to appreciation of its inherent industrial and commercial possibilities . And evidences of a coming national rehabilitation , should China be permitted to retain her political entity , are not lacking . The influence of Chinese educated abroad , and who are now coming home to live in large numbers , is beginning to be felt in the political life of the empire . While the actual accomplishments of the reformers , such as Wu-ting-fang 's recent revision of the code of punishments , by which the abolition of the " thousand cuts " was wrung from timid conservatism , are often more likely to cause a smile than invoke serious belief in them as an indication of progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army now exists largely on paper , except in the north , but it will come . Arrangements to secure the services of thousands of Japanese officers are now under way . Personally I see not the slightest reason to doubt that the Chinese will make excellent soldiers if they are properly armed and trained . They possess courage and capability in plenty . All they require is efficiency , and that can be gained by proper effort . Entrenched conservatism is being hustled on all sides , and can not long withstand the new forces at work . The sending of commissions to study conditions and methods in foreign countries is a sign of the new era . In fact , the political and social construction of China is peculiarly favorable to a comparatively rapid and easy transition . The old China will die hard , but it is doomed . In the great new future that is coming to this old country two elements will struggle for supremacy . One will be the forces inherent in the Chinese people coupled with such assimilative influence as Japan will be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more advanced civilization of the West . Neither will entirely win the battle , but one or the other will finally point the way . I am no very serious believer in what is called the yellow peril ; not owing to any trust in the motives or influence of Japan , and not only because I have great faith that the star of destiny still hangs over the West ; but because I believe that under any favorable circumstances the good sense and sound character of the Chinese will vindicate themselves . In respect to the yellow peril , it is interesting to recall what a Chinese official of progressive tendency recently said to me : " The future contains no yellow peril for Europe or America , " he remarked , " but it does contain one for Europeans and Americans in Asia unless your nations and people learn to treat Asiatics with more consideration . " This is the voice of the new China , and it is to be heard and considered .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
