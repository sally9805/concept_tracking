It would be hard to be critically more perverse than this , do Dryden and Pope flow from Milton or Waller ? Again , it introduces a totally incongruous matter to include the ballads in this volume Surely , the ballad of Percy and Douglas , which moved Sidney 's heart like the sound of a trumpet , belongs not here , but with the Elizabethans Other incongruities might be pointed out , but after all , we do not look for homogeneity in an anthology Mr Braithwaite has brought together a mass of beautiful and characteristic poems , some of them little known , and the publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat binding In the latest of his anthologies , E V.

In his " Last Days of Charles II " ( Henry Frowde ) , Dr. Raymond Crawfurd has made a most interesting contribution not only to what he calls the " medicine of history , " but to history itself . The last illness and death of Charles II have been described frequently and minutely But , however interesting and picturesque these narrations have been , Dr. Crawfurd justly declares in his preface that no historian appears to have described the events with any approach to accuracy , while the only considerable medical authority who has written on the subject has confirmed the errors of historians by giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong conclusion The present author has based his account largely on the interesting and authoritative statement of the case and its treatment written by Sir Charles Scarburgh , first physician to Charles II , which is still preserved in the library of the Society of Antiquarians at Burlington House This he reprints in an appendix , both in the original Latin and in translation From it , from a mass of contemporary authority , and from his own medical knowledge , he reconstructs in minute detail the progress of the case with all its attendant circumstances , arriving at the conclusion that Charles 's death was clue to chronic granular kidney accompanied by urmmic convulsions Such a conclusion has much value to the political historian , since previous accounts have not merely confused the subject , but have often left " the impression that the darker suspicions of the time regarding the King 's death were not wholly without foundation No less interesting than the story of the peculiar circumstances attending this last illness is the account of the treatment of the case The list of remedies and prescriptions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cure or relieve the unfortunate patient , give a vivid picture of seventeenth-century medicine A pharmacopoeia which included sal ammoniac , Jesuit 's bark or cmchona , as well as bezoars ( a concretion found in the stomach of an East Indian goat ) , and spirits of human skull , made from the skull of a than who died a violent death , marks the transition from medimval to modern medicine in striking fashion Illustrated with portraits of Charles II and his physicians , King and Scarburgh , with reproductions of Charles 's effigy and a mask drawn from it , the little essay makes a most interesting study , well worth reading . A clear and readable essay on Lincoln expanded from a popular address given in New York city on Lincoln Day , February 12 , 1900 , forms the body of George Haven Putnam 's " Abraham Lincoln , the People 's Leader in the Struggle for National Existence " ( G P.

Its readers will have much more to learn if they care to pursue the subject further . But they will have nothing to unlearn . Dr. William Newton Clarke 's elaborate and thorough treatise on " The Christian Doctrine of God " is followed quickly by pdrsonal narrative of his changing views regarding Holy Scripture during his ' long life as a Christian pastor and teacher . The new volume is entitled " Sixty Years with theBible : A Record of Experience " ( Charles Scribner 's Sons ) . With entire frankness , in which mistaken opinions and inconsistent judgments are recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from quiet confidence in an infallible rule of doctrine to critical use of a partial record of an ' expanding religious life . This is not the story of a series of catastrophes or cataclysmic illuminations . Dr. Clarke moved very slowly toward his goal , and kept sure hold of his faith through the entire process . Nevertheless , the change from his early attitude toward Scripture to that from which he wrote his latest volume is nothing less than revolutionary , and in Dr. Clarke 's treatment it appears absolutely necessary . It is difficult to see how any one can find him at fault at any point for yielding to the newer views , as they appeared before him , and equally difficult to believe that hiS high reverence for the Bible from his present position is unfounded . This frank recital of his experience will serve admirably as a guide to less thorough and discerning mi nds .

An admirable series of photographs of the temples of India is given in the National Geographic Magazine for November .
