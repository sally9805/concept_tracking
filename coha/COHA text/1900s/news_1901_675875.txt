txt James Hill , President of the Great Northern Railway , was yesterday elected President of the Northern Securities Company , the new **27;289;TOOLONG corporation , through the medium of which the late financial unpleasantness in the Northwestern Railway field has been definitely disposed of . The Directors of the new company were also elected and their names made public . The Board of Directors of the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy met , according to their programme as announced last week , in Chicago , but owing to a misunderstanding of telephonic instructions from this city adjourned without taking the prearranged action of electing certain new Directors , the names of whom were printed in these columns last week . Statements were also made by the represeatatives of the various interests showing that the scope of the settlement is even wider than was at first supposed and that a great part of the credit for the successful disposition of the whole matter is due to the personal efforts of J. PierponteMorgan , On the Stock Exchange the announcement caused profit taking which resulted in declines all along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been discounted . After the general announcement of Wednesday afternoon further details were awaited with the keenest interest in Wall Street and in railroad circles . But while many rumors were circulated nothing definite was learned about the terms of the settlement until near the close of the Exchange , when the composition of the Board of Directors of the new company was announced by Mr. Morgan himself . DIRECTORS OF TT-TF : COMPANY . The names of the Directors in the order in which they appear on the official list are : John S. Kennedy , D. Willis James , Samuel Thorne , James J. Hill , E. T. Nichols , George F. Baker , Robert Bacon , George W. Perkins , Daniel S. Lamont , E. H. Harriman , Jacob H. Schiff , James Stillman , W. P. Clough , George C. Clark , and N. Terhune . Of these men six may be considered as representatives of Great Northern interests , three represent the interests of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , and three more stand for the Harriman interests . Two are distinctly representatives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thorne , who was President of the Pennsylvania Coal Company , which now belongs to the Pennsylvania Railroad . is regarded as representing Eastern interests . It is , however . considered a difficult matter to draw lines which will divide this board according to the various interests which make up the Northern Securities Company . It may be stated on the authority of representatives of these interests that it would be a misconception of the purposes and objects of the new company and the ' aereement , under which it was originated , to make an attempt to draw a circle around each particular interest having a delegation in the company . On the contrary , the scope of the settlement is , according to the words of a member of the Harriman faction , a much broader one . It was the Intention , " he " to formulate an agreement under which all the interests , instead of remaining separate and distinct could be moulded into one , in order to secure an absolutely harmonious co-operation and unity of purpose . With this object in view every possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also to questions of territory and traffic . As a result an agreement has been reached which carries the idea of unity of interest to the most advanced point which has yet been reached and which assures - pie ultimate supremacy of this idea of railroad management over any other that has been advocated " Some people have made the point that the Government of the United States should take over all the railroads after they had been brought as closely together as possible . We , for our part , would be perfectly willing to turn over to the Government the securities of all the railroads we control on the same terms on which the Governmen now buys back its own bonds . " Regarding the exact division of the stock of the new cornoration , no official statement was made . It appears , however . froth a simple computation of the exact holdings of the Union Pacific interests in Northern Pacific commcn stock that their share will be about $82.549,000 . The amount of Northern Pacific , common stock held by the Union Pacific is $37,000.000 . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - 687.500 of the new bonds convertible into stock . The total amount of stock . therefore , which they will turn into the new company will be about $71.687,500 , for which they will receive 115 per cent . in the new company 's stock . or $82.549.000 . As their holdings in Northern Pacific preferred stock were $41.000.000. for which they will receive cash at the rate of 100 plus 1 per cent . extra dividend . the Union Pacific interests practically receive a bonus of $7.500.000 in cash . which , added to the new company 's stock which they will receive . makes a total of $90,000,000 , all of which will be free assets as the convertible 4 per cent Union Pacific bonds issued to Purchase the Northern Pacific stock will not . be retired . they being sufficiently secured by other assets . HILL-MORGAN INTERESTS . The Hill-Morgan holdings of Northern Pacific common stock are about $43,000.000 , entitling them to an additional subscription of $40,300,000. making a total to be turned into the new company of $83.300,000 in common stock . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new company 's stock , the Hill-Morgan interests would receive about $95.000.000 for their holdings in Northern Pacific common stock . The remaining $246,000,000 in the new company 's stock will go to the holders of Great Northern stock . a large part of which is held personally by Mr. Hill , while the remainder is owned by his glose personal friends . But while the Union Pacific 's interest in the new company is , therefore , not quite 25 Per cent. , their interests in the management of the Burlington are safeguarded by a one-half interest in that company , guaranteed , so it is understood , by a specially organized voting trust . It is understood that in due time application will be made to list on the Stock Exchange the $400,000,000 of stock of the Northern Securities Company . Sales of the stock to the amount of 500 shares were made in the outside market at 110 , and at the end of the day 10914 was bid for the stock Many bids were also made for the new 4 per cent . convertible bonds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , will not be traded in , so it was authoritatively stated yesterday , but they will at once be converted into common stock , and as such turned into the . new company . Some speculation was indulged in yester .. day by Wall Street as to how far the exchange of securities ' would ' disturb the money market . A banker familiar with the situation stated that , in his opinion , the consummation of this deal would not disturb the money market at the beginning of the year as the amount of cash required would not be large . This is due to the fact that a considerable amount of the Northern Pacific preferred stock is held Great Northern interests , which will make exchanges of securities in the same manner as the Union Pacific . EFFECT ON STOCK MARKET . I A Sharp Break in Prices Due Largely to Professional Selling  --  Hopeful of the Future . The response of yesterday 's stock market to the formal announcement of the settlement of the Northern Pacific controversy , which since May last has been regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing to holders of securities who had looked for an outburst of speculative enthusiasm to follow upon the official confirmation of the settlement . Instead of prices advancing on the Stock Exchange , they declined  --  declined sharply , Union Pacific , which is expected to benefit most by the settlement , scoring the greatest decline of any active stock on the list , at one time breaking over 4 points from the high figure , and closing with a net loss of 21/2 points on the transfer of 195,000-shares , practically one-fifth of the entire market transactions . Of the other important stocks that also broke the most conspicuous were St. Paul , which at one time showed a loss of 3% points , closing with a net decline of 2% ; Atchison , which at one time lost 2% points and closed with a net decline of lye Missouri Pacific , which broke from the high figure 3%*oints and closed at a net loss of . lee ; Great Northern preferred , whose extreme loss was 2% and whose net decline was 11% , and Southern Pacific , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other net , , losses as American Sugar , 11/ ; Baltimore and Ohio , 11% ; Brooklyn Rapid Transit , 1% ; Canada Southern , 2% ; New Jersey Central , 2 ; St. Paul preferred , 2 ; Big Four , 2 ; Lackawanna , 5 ; Delaware and Hudson , 2y , ; General Electric , 3 ; Iowa Central preferred , 2 ; Metropolitan , 1% ; North American , 114 ; Pere Marquette. 4 ; St. Louis Southwestern preferred , 2 ; Tennessee Coal , 1% ; Union Pacific preferred , 2 , and Western Union , 1% . Moreover , as a matter of fact , these declines do not represent in full the real heaviness of the market , for in not a few of the stocks set out above the final figures were a point or more above the low prices at one time recorded , the late rallies being due in part to covering , by sh.ores and. - in part to supporting ordrs placed in the market by the larger Financial interests . Te the public generally these declines came in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer of affairs in the financial district the market 's action was certainly no surprise . It was , in fact , pointed out that the news had been discounted . For two weeks the market had been advancing in expectation of the settlement which was finally perfected . Yesterday , assured through the news announcements that the Northern Pacific embroglio was a thing of the past , the public came down to the Street eager to buy stocks , Chicago operators who had accumulated at least 100,000 shares of various stocks in anticipation of the announcement , various local operators and pools that had purchased two or three times as much in like anticipation availed themselves of the opportunity to dispose of their holdings at a profit . They also put out short lines , in the hope of dislodging the shares bought in the early trading by the public . Thus it was that by 1 o'clock the market broke sharply , early buyers and others who had held in expectation of a rise hastily rushing to sell . Yet representative bankers and brokers in Wall Street declare that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is declared ? of the community of interest idea in the Northwestern railroad field are among the most farreaching developments that have ever come to pass in the railroad world and , are bound eventually to affect most favorably not only the railroads themselves , but their securities , and , consequently , the holders of those securities . It is declared by parties in interest in the matter that one effect of the understanding arrived at will be to insure stability of rates o ; i the part of the roads concerned by eliminating aggressive competition in times when business may be slack and traffic is most desired ; that another effect will be to do away with expensive transportation service , particularly in the passenger departments ; that still another effect will be an equitable division of territory and traffic ; while , finally , as a result , the revenues of the several companies will be the better maintained and their stockholders in consequence benefited through the reasonable assurance of the maintenance , if not the increase , of dividends where dividends now are paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But beyond all this Wall Street asserts that this settlement is but a forerunner of other agreements yet to be worked out among the great financiers and railroad men of the country . It is declared that in due time it will be found that all other roads which might in any wise disturb the new Northwestern relations  --  whether they be St. Paul , Wisconsin Central . Northwest , or Chicago Great Western  --  will be joined in a larger agreement , perhaps by the purchase of stock , perhaps otherwise ; and that the same principle of harmony will be worked out in other systems in other parts of the country
