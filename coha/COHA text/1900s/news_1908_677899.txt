txt It is not to be assumed that the currency measure outlined in our columns yesterday morning as the one the Senators most interested think the best that can be had will go through without criticism or amendment . On the contrary ; there is strong feeling as to several points involved , and the feeling happens to be semi-sectional , so that we may be sure that it will find expression in debate and quite possibly on roll call . And this is the more likely since the thing sectional feeling will rally for is , properly guarded , a thing that . sound economics sustains , namely aneffectively protected bank currency based on and measured by commercial transactions , On-sales of grain or cotton or tobacco , or any other staple and durable commodity of general use and value . As to this phase of the subject there will necessarily be much discussion in due time . Meanwhile it is to be remarked that the plan outlined by the various Senators and reported in our columns has one feature which is practically undisputed and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain . The measure in effect replaces Clearing House certificates by National banknotes . That is to say , it legalizes a mode of relief in times of stringency which has heretofore been used to great advantage and has become , in the corn-plc a. conditions attending our commercial organization , almost indispensable , but which is entirely extra-legal and is accompanied by very unfortunate circumstances . The issue of Clearing House certificates has in the past amounted inevitably to a partial or complete suspension of currency payments by the banks . and-when this has occurred it has naturally disturbed and very- nearly interrupted altogether the process of exchanges between cities in which the issues were used and other parts of the country . No such consequence can ensue from banknotes issued in place of the certificates , though the banknotes in the long run depend for the most part on precisely the same security as that provided for the certificates . The use of the notes would not be limited , as is the use of the certificates in most cases , . to the settlement of balances between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes wouV provide currenoy as needed , or fp : a considerable part of actual needs . In short , they would do all the good the certificates can possibly do and much more , and they would not bring , about the difficulties inseparable from the employment of certificates . Our own judgment , as our readers are aware , is that the Clearing House certificates are a precious resource , without which it - would. - be ? quite impossible to get on in our present situation , but which can greatly be improved . While we should get improvement from the measure outlined , we are convinced that the country needs and can now get much greater improvement by providing for a currency actually answering to the legitimate requirement of business . The certificates have in the past answered to certain extraordinary requirements . They have done so awkwardly and at excessive cost in many ways . This measure will reduce the cost and make the plan work much more smoothly . That it is in no sense a comprehensive measure of currency reform is manifest .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
