" Cruelties were committed here and there , " said President Roosevelt on November 19 , at Memphis , in his glorification of the Philippine war . Almost while he was speaking , the shame-faced War Department was admitting one flagrant case of torture by men wearing the American uniform , which it had hitherto indignantly denied . The killing of a Catholic priest , under exquisite torture , by Capt . Brownell is now " frankly " conceded by that gentleman and soldier . He omitted to report the occurrence , since it was really so trivial This is triumphantly adduced as a complete justification of Secretary Root . If his subordinates do not report their misdeeds , how on earth can he find them out ? His warrant for asserting that the cruelties charged were never committed is thus seen to be official ignorance  --  and how extensive a basis that may be , the full proof of the murder of Father Augustine now makes clear . How does he know that there have not been dozens of similar cases ? Mr. Roosevelt affirms that - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he know that other Captain Brownells are not killing natives by torture , and forgetting to report the trifling incident ? This crushing exposure , for which the thanks of the country are due to Messrs . Schurz , Charles Francis Adams , and other Anti-Imperialists , shows that there is at least something rotten in the system of army intelligence . With this frightful case of ignorance of what has been going an in the army brought home to him , Secretary Root ought to be more chary about certifying officially to the " unexampled humanity " of our troops in the Philippines The latest dispatches from the Philippines tell us that the continued fall of silver has paralyzed business and caused an unexampled crisis in the financial administration of the islands . Ten days ago , $2.50 of silver would buy one dollar of gold . Now $2.60 is required , and the prospect is that there will be further decline in the value of the white metal before the end of the present week . The situation could hardly be worse , but it can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better currency . The ' principal cause of the decline of silver during the past six months has been the exportation of that metal from China to India to buy sterling exchange for the payment of the periodical war indemnity of the former country . On account of the disarrangemeat of trade due to the " Boxer " rebellion , it became impossible for the Government to obtain bills on London from mercantile sources in sufficient amounts to meet the payments . Thus it became necessary to call on the mandarins of the provinces for fixed sums of money in silver dollars , which were converted into bullion and shipped to Calcutta . The latter is still the principal consuming market in the world , for , although silver is no longer coined in India for private individuals , it is still in large demand for Purposes of ornament and the arts , and is still bought by the Government for coinage into rupees as a currency subsidiary to gold . These purchases from China have lessened the demand for silver in London by no less than ? 1,300000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest drop in the price of silver seems to have been due to a movement for the adoption of the gold standard in the Straits Settlements . It seems impossible for Congress to avoid legislation on the subject of the currency in the Philippines . The present difficulty is greater than that which confronted us during the last session , because the decline of silver is greater , but it is not insurmountable . The plan proposed by the Conant Commission is still practicable . That plan contemplated that there should be a Philippine silver coin corresponding in size to the five-franc piece , which should be coined on Government account only , and be legal tender for fifty cents in the gold money of the United States ; that this coin should be divided into one hundred parts , called centavos , so that the smallest coin should be equal to one-half cent of our money ; that the silver and other subsidiary coins should be kept at par with gold by limiting their quantity and also by redeeming them in gold on . demand  --  the redemption fund to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silver bullion . Contracts previously existing would be settled on the previous basis , and the Mexican silver dollar now in use would continue to be legal tender until a specified date . Although valuable time has been lost , it is not too late to carry this reform into effect . The price of silver declined 34d. per ounce during the twenty years in which the discussion was going on for the reform of the currency of India . The decline since that time has been only 13d. per ounce . The same degree of intelligence which served India when the reform was forced upon her Government , will be available and alike successful in the Philippines if Congress takes up the subject in the proper spirit . The letter of President Ramsey of the Wabash Railroad , published in connection with an increase of 10 per cent , in the wages of his employees , directs renewed attention to the very remarkable movement of the past fortnight in this direction . On November 13 the Pennsylvania published the announcement of an all-around 10 per cent . increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three days by similar announcements for the Pennsylvania 's Western lines , for the New York Central , the Lake Shore , the Erie , the Reading , the Wabash , and other companies . Most of the railways in the further West have already made similar wage advances ; so that it may be said that within a very brief period the scale of payment for railway labor has been advanced throughout the country . This recent sudden movement , which follows other general advances  --  mostly made , we believe , during 1900 ? has two sufficiently obvious explanations . It is a recognition of the present higher cost of living and of larger industrial profits , but it is also recognition of the fact that , in its present mood , labor 's demands must be granted in whole or in part . There has been trouble very lately with the laborers on several of the great Southwestern systems ; traffic was delayed , and for a week or two railway managers were greatly disturbed over the prospect The coal-strike episode , and the aggressive attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . With business offered now in excess of facilities for  --  transportation , and with still heavier traffic in view when the full crop movement is under way , it is not surprising that railway-wage advances should have been granted in all directions , even before the pressure of demand had become really urgent . But there are other valid reasons for better wages for the railway hands . The railways have been prosperous , during the past year , to an unexampled degree . In spite of the failure of last year 's corn crop , earnings from traffic have continued to increase ; the net receipts of 100 American railroads , daring the first eight months of 1902 , footing up $8,500,000 more than in the same period last year , and $55,000,000 more than in 1899 ? a gain of no less than 45 per cent . A great number of the companies have increased their dividends ; others have made indirect payments to shareholders through issue of new stock at prices far below the market . The housesmiths , the plumbers , the roofers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work in Mr. George W. Vanderbilt 's house because his contractor is likely to employ one painters ' union rather than another . Not one member of the boycotted Brotherhood of Painters has yet entered the building , and the general strike is ordered in behalf of the Amalgamated Painters ' Society , which also has had no part in the work . But the contractor , as the song has it , is " an intimate friend of an , intimate friend " of the wrong union ; that makes his work " unfair , " and the strike will follow him wherever he builds . It is interesting to recall the reason why the Building Trades Council is using the general strike to exalt one union and destroy another . The Amalgamated Painters ' Society , about a year ago , struck for increased wages . The Brotherhood of Painters were willing to work at the old scale and filled the places of the strikers . It was not a case of " scab " labor against h union , but of two unions differing on a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one for all and all for the one that makes the highest demands , for the Brotherhood of Painters , which plain people will think acted within its rights , has been constantly attacked . Some two months ago , for example , the redecorating of the White House was delayed because of this quarrel , and now a large number of workmen in other trades than painting are suffering present loss of wages on account of what might be called a " future-perfect " contest , between two kinds of organized painters . This is not quite a literal fulfilment of Mr. Gompers 's gloomy prediction that the unions must mend their ways or they would be fighting each other in the streets , but it does show that there are as many degrees of " unfairness " as there were of Touchstone 's lie . Vice-Chancellor Stevenson 's preliminary injunction , granted in New Jersey against the so-called Prudential-Fidelity merger , brings to at least a temporary halt one of the most remarkable plans in the whole recent movement of corporate combination . This style of merger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of perpetuating present controlling managaments , even than the Northern Securities or Steel Corporation experiments . Mr. Morgan outlined , last spring , the theory of these two last-named combinations ; it was , to create for the amalgamated company a capital so large that no outside interest could afford to buy up control . The Prudential-Fidelity combination would make change in control impossible , even were capital available sufficient to pay two or three times over for the capitalized value of the companies . Briefly stated , the situation is that two joint-stock companies exist , controlled at present by the same interest  --  the Prudential Insurance and the Fidelity Trust . Under the proposed plan , the capital of the FidelityTrust is doubled , the new shares being bought chiefly by the Prudential Inshrance Company . With the money obtained by this sale of stock the Fidelity undertakes to buy a one-half interest in the entire stock of the Prudential . The circular of the Prudential 's president , announcing the plan , observed : " While by this arrangement the Prudential Company will control the Fidelity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will own a majority of the capital stock of the Prudential , . . . the Prudential will forever be the dominant factor , as , of course , it should be . . . . The consummation of this arrangement insures the continuance of the present management of the Prudential . " This it unquestionably does ; for the Fidelity Trust 's majority stock would always be voted by the present Prudential management , and , in turn , the majority stock of the Prudential would always be voted by the Fidelity . We are fully aware of the feeling among managers of corporations which has encouraged many of these self-perpetuating contrivances . With enormous amounts of loose capital in the hands of rival bankers , no board of management has felt secure in its seat . The ousting of the Louisville and Nashville 's conservative controlling interest by a ring of stockjobbers , using borrowed money , has frightened existing managements throughout the country . But every protective scheme contrived to exclude the dangerous outsider from control will apply with equal facility , in a conceivable case , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point , Insurance Commissioner Cutting of Massachusetts . replying to the Prudential directors , says very pertinently : " The minority stockholders would have absolutely no chance of winning individual stockholders to their side to make a majority , no matter how convincing their arguments , no matter how bad the mismanagement or corruption , or how unworthy the managers so long as they steered clear of indictable offences . " There is in all this no reflection upon existing managements ; but existing managements are made up of human beings who are mortal , who , under the scheme proposed , would name their own successors , and who might make grave mistakes in such selection . We freely admit the dangers created by the free-booting capitalists of the Stock Exchange ; but We regard the remedy proposed as infinitely more dangerous than the disease . Raising State revenues by means of indirect taxation is evidently to become popular in many States . Wisconsin is sure , under the lead of Gov . La Follette , to revise its tax laws this year , with a view to shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders of corporations . And now the matter is being considered in Illinois , where a movement , centring in Chicago , is on foot which seems likely to result in the holding of a Constitutional convention for the express purpose of empowering the Legislature to abolish the direct tax altogether , and establish a system of corporation taxation sufficient to provide all the necessary revenues for- the support of the State government . An interesting feature of the movement in Illinois is that it carries with it an avowed advocacy of the principle of local option in taxation . In fact , this is the principal argument which is being used in Chicago in favor of holding the convention . It is urged that , with the abolition of the direct State tax , the State as a whole would lose its interest in the form of taxation in a given community . the State Board of Equalization would no longer be necessary , and matters of valuation and scope of taxation could be regulated locally in the best interest of the city or town involved . Among the plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under consideration for increasing the State 's indirect sources of revenue , are a renewal of the small recording tax on mortgages , a readjustment of the inheritance . tax with . a view to increasing its revenue-raising power , and a readjustment of , the liquor-license law so that a larger part of the tax shall be retained by the State . The hope is again expressed that the mortgage-recording tax may prove acceptable , if not wholly satisfactory , both . to those who believe in mortgage exemp , tion and to those who do not . Doubtless such a tax would be welcomed 1 the former class , for they showed themselves ready to accept it last year . But not so the latter . The mortgage-tax bill last year was smothered through the influence of " up-State " legislators who. believe in vigorous taxation of mortgages . They were not deceived by the-recording tax , which they regarded as . practical exemption . Perhaps , however , . they may prove more pliant this year . New problems are raised by the suggested readjustment of the inheritance-tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter has been largely due to the amount of revenue which it brings yearly to the various localities of the State . The success of a change on the lines proposed would be at best doubtful . Yet the need of more revenue , , to the extent of at least $5,000,000 , is imperative if the abolition of the direct State tax is to be permanent . The Legislature of Vermont has acted . with amazing promptness on the high . license bill which is to reverse the . historic policy of the State on the liquor question . Except for minor modifications , which will be settled in conference of the two houses , the new law is com- : plete . It will be referred to the people early in the new year . Probably few-Legislatures would have learned their own mind so quickly on a matter of such importance . This high-license and local-option measure has several interesting features . It adopts the excellent **25;133;TOOLONG plan of an annual referendum on the licensing of saloons ; it sets a minimum fee of $500 for a general license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and a - maiimum fee of $1,200 , finally , it grants a fermented-liquors license at $250 . The working of this last provision will he watched with interest , because it has proved almost impossible in practice to establish the theoretically desirable distinction between places where light drinks are sold , and those where ardent spirits are dispensed . A fanciful feature of the bill is an anti-treating clause . The complete conversion to the local-option idea of a State which has long been given over to the hypocrisies of statutory prohibition should do much to strengthen the case of genuine excise reform . The Birmingham ( Ala ) ) Age-Herald of November 11 , hits the nail on the head in its comment on an attempted lynching affair in the neighboring town of . Anniston . Fortunately , in this case , the troops were called out by the Governor , and were available in time to prevent the mob from putting to death a negro who had not been identified , who had not committed any crime in Anniston and was not " wanted " there  --  except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words are those of the Birmingham paper . " Lynching bees , " it says , " have become the pastime of the rougher element of a community . They seize upon each and every occasion for that purpose . Excitement is what they want  --  pastime , recreation . For such a state of things a moral revolution is necessary . The better citizens of Anniston appealed to the mob in vain , and such scenes will occur until a public sentiment is created that will put them down . " A moral revolution is wanted , but where is it to begin ? Who is to put it in motion ? Preaching does no good . Editors can accomplish nothing by mere writing and printing . Nothing except the administration of law and the punishment of lynchers by death or long terms of imprisonment will ever put an end to the practice of lynching . The announcement that the cruiser Philadelphia has been condemned by the navy 's Chief Constructor is of great interest as showing the perishability of the modern war-ship . The Philadelphia was built in 1888 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fourtean years , minus many months spenl. at navy-yards for repairs , of which she has required not a few . Now she must be stricken from the navy list , according to law , because it would require more than half of her value to repair her once more . She has long been known as a " lame duck , " and is now chiefly valuable as an object-lesson , having cost in her short existence about $2,000,000 . Had she been a wooden ship , she would , with anything like proper care , have lasted very much longer , as is shown by the presence on the navy list of such veterans of the seas as the Lancaster , built in 1859 , and the Enter prise and Essex , which date from the seventies . Another interesting vessel of the " new navy ' which is about to disappear is the dynamite cruiser Vesuvius . Who does not remember the terrifying stories of the volcanic effect of her dread projectiles which came to us from before Santiago in June , 1898 ? The Spaniards were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like many another tale of the Caribbean , these yarns proved merely that romance had not passed from the globe , and now the Vesuvius is to be sold for a song , being not even available as a plebeian torpedo boat , while admittedly a failure for her specific purpose . It is eloquent testimony to the prosperity of the Canadian Northwest that the Grand Trunk Railway is plaiining to extend its line to the Pacific . The new road will pass far to the north of the Canadian Pacific , and will open up a region the wealth of which in agricultural and forest products is only beginning to be realized . Whether the project will be favorably received in Parliament remains to be seen . There has been considerable prejudice against the Grand Trunk because it uses Portland , Me. , as its chief Atlantic terminal , rather than a Canadian port , and the members from the Maritime Provinces have made this a long-standing grievance . There may also be some feeling against an eventual competition with the heavily subsidized Canadian Pacific . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious advantages of the new transcontinental line . All the Canadian railways , including the Inter-colonial , which is owned by the State , are prosperous , and if the Dominion should oppose the attempt to reach the new territories from the east , she must expect to see them reached from the south . This would mean the diversion of Canadian freights to American lines on a tremendous scale . So the Grand Trunk extension seems to be equally desirable from the point of view of railway and of national strategy . Obviously , the United States Will be an incidental gainer from a sea-water terminal only a little to the south of the Alaska boundary . That the English Education Bill could be passed only by a vigorous application of the closure was foreseen from the first . It has at last completed the committee stage under closure " by compartments , " and now it is hoped to bring the bill to a vote in a fortnight . Of course , the Liberals make the most of the closuring of the remaining clauses , but it is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather more than forty days has been inadequately debated . Mr. Balfour told the Commons recently that the Crimes act of 1897 was closured after fifteen days in committee , and the Home Rule bill of 1893 after twenty-eight days . The real grievance of the present Opposition , Mr. Balfour failed to admit , namely , the clumsy drafting of the bill . Frequently , the Ministry has seemed to be in doubt as to the meaning of its own measure , and the bill certainly invited that mass of amendments which have so unduly protracted the debates . The bill will become law soon . In fact , the Opposition , since its failure to secure the Irish members , has had much of the random quality of a debating society in committee of the whole . Important concessions to Nonconformists , and a provision by which the County Councils may delegate their educational duties to sub-committees , should do something to reduce initial hostility to a measure the workableness of which remains wholly problematical . There will be opposition in the Lords , but it will probably prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of influencing public opinion at home  --  by having his views explained in foreign newspapers of standing . One such statement appeared , the other day , in Paris . The latest journal to be favored is the Vienna Neue Freie Presse , which recently contained an apology for his attitude in regard to the revision of the tariff , now the foremost question in Germany . His position was stated to be that of a " Constitutional Statesman " ever bowing to the will of the majority  --  a figure of speech which Bismarck frequently found of use , and frequently abandoned in favor of the " prerogatives of Emperor and Government , " when he was in open opposition to a parliamentary majority . Von Bulow , according to this statement , is certain that , if the tariff boat is wrecked , the boatman will yet survive , and there seems to be some ground for his belief , in view of the fact that his recent disastrous defeat has left him still at the helm . Upon the question whether the boat will sink or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw much light . The Chancellor is doubtless still hoping , but in the eyes of many observers he is hoping against hope , for his craft is waterlogged already . It is attended in its course by the dislike , distrust , and enmity of the common people , who rightly see in the tariff bill heavier burdens for themselves , that the land owners may profit .
