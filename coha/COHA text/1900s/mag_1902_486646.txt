Messrs Scribner announce ' Bookbinders and their Craft , ' by Miss S. T. Prideaux , in a limited edition , and ' A Literary History of Persia from the Earliest Times until Firdawsi , ' by Edward G. Brown , lecturer in Persian at the University of Cambridge The ' Poems You Ought to Know , ' which have been running for some time in the Chicago Tribune , are being gathered into a book with the imprint of the Jamieson-Higgins Co , of that city The ' History of John Decastro ' and his brother Bat , commonly called 01 , d Crab , is to be reprinted by the Irwin Press of Pittsburgh , Pa. , nearly a century after its first appearance in London and Boston in 1815 . The Century Company adds to its pretty series of booklets in Elzevir form Tennyson 's ' In Memoriam , ' with an mtroduction from the ' Victorian Poets ' of B. C. Stedman ; ' Selections from the Thoughts of Pascal , ' translated by Benjamin E. Smith ; Sheridan 's ' The Rivals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These little volumes are bound in stamped leather and contain each a portrait of its author . A very pretty rubricated title-page has been devised by Messrs . Scribner for a handy edition of Stevenson 's ' An Inland Voyage ' ; the cover is less well conceived . The letterpress is bold and handsome , and a few photographs of scenery and buildings . by James B Carrington , enhance the value of the text In the decoration accorded by Dodd , Mead &; Co. to their new edition of Mr Mabie 's ' Under the Trees , ' there is also a good title-page , with figures , and several plates in the same vein , by C. L. Hinton , whose work is graceful if not strong . The greenish border designs  --  continuous , not repetitious ? from the same hand , appear to us an excess of illustration . They cast , if we may pervert the poet a little , the author 's thought in a green shade . Mr. Mabie furnishes an introduction for ' A Book of Old English Ballads , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards , and as he has something to say about the neglect of chronological arrangement , he seems to , have had some hand in the selection . This opens with " Chevy Chace. " and includes . " King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid , " " Barbara Allen , " three of the Robin Hood-series , " The Twa Corbies , " " The Nut-Brown Maid , " " Sir Patrick Spens , " with . twice as many more Some of Mr Wharton 's headpieces are felicitous and truly decorative , the full-page pen-drawings , on , the contrary , are ineffectual , and contrast unfortunately with the print of the ballads themselves The defect extends to the cover in red and green The introduction to Mr. Joseph B. Gilder 's ' The American Idea as Expounded by American Statesmen ' ( Dodd , Mead &; Co. ) is from the pen of Mr. Carnegie It takes a hopeful view of our democracy in spite of what he hopes 19 the temporary aberration from American first principles since " our late President was swept , against his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of the Fathers of the Republic .

Washington , John Quincy Adams ( in " the Monroe Doctrine " ) , Lincoln , Webster , Lowell on Democracy , Cleveland , Hoar on free speech , are some of the historic expounders here brought together . The New Amsterdam Book Co. have launched a series of 16mo reprints , " The Commonwealth Library , " inexpensively got up , but clear of print , including thus far the Lewis and Clark already noticed , in. three volumes . and now Alexander Mackenzie 's ' Voyages from Montreal to the Frozen . and Pacific Oceans ( 1789 and 1793 ) , ' in two volumes , with a portrait of the author , and Matthew Arnold 's ' Literature and Dogma , ' also with a portrait .

' The general title proves , to be a misnomer , for while there are numerous extracts from the writings of well-known scientists of high and sometimes of the first order , none of these deserves the style of " masterpiece , " as few fragments could . But mixed up with these textual quotations we have much popularizing of science in articles by Mr. Iles himself and by others possessed of greater scientific training , but still not first-hand authorities The series will be useful , but it is too pretentious . Without commenting on them in detail , . we can recommend to teachers both Prof. J. M. Hart 's ' Essentials of Prose Composition ' ( Philadelphia : Eldredge &; Bro. ) and the third book of Gardiner , Kittredge and Arnold 's ' The Mother Tongue Elements of English Composition ' ( Boston Ginn &; Co . ) . Each abounds in illustrations of style , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Professor Hart again , displays his fondness for Hawthorne as an exemplar . The triple authors add supplementary exercises and exhibitions of common errors , with a glance at punctuation , and a chapter on English prosody . Few recent diplomatic episodes have caused more discussion than the alliance of Italy with Prussia before and during the war of 1866 . Many attempts have been made to convict the Italian Government , and especially its head , Gen. La Marmora , of lack of faith towards Prussia . The negotiations have just been reviewed from first to last in Senator Luigi Chiala 's ' Ancora tin Po ' Pit di Luce sugli Eventi Politici e Militam dell ' Anne 1860 ' ( Florence : Barbera ) , a work which seems to exhaust the subject . Written with Senator Chiala 's characteristic frankness , it presents many important in-edited letters , besides , his inside knowledge of the transactions , and the impressions which his intimacy with many of the leading Italian public men enabled him to form at first hand . He has effectually silenced Bernhardi and other accusers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaved loyally in all her dealings with Prussia . Incidentally , the hook is indispensable for any one who wishes to understand the diplomacy which made Prussia mistress of Central Europe and undermined Napoleon III . The Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College , volume 38 , is devoted to a " Discussion of Variable Stars in the cluster e Centauri , " by Solon I. Bailey . This is the first portion of an elaborate study of variable stars in clusters undertaken by Professor Bailey . In all , 19,050 stars have been examined , and the area covered by the examination is 58 square degrees . The area in which variables were actually found , however , was only 1.4 square degrees , and the remarkable announcement is made that , in a region covering only one thirty-thOusandth part of the - whole sky , have been found more than five hundred ' variables , nearly as many as are known to exist in the remaining region . It also appears that in one cluster , Messier 3. one star in seven is variable , while in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume is made up of several chapters in which are described the sequences of comparison stars , observations of the variables , the elements of the variables , and a detailed study of four variables . There are numerous reproductions of photographs of clusters showing variables , and six plates showing light curves The diamond and carbon product of Bahia is decreasing , writes H. W. Furniss in the Consular Reports for October , notwithstanding fabulous wealth awaits development  --  simply from lack of intelligence " In my trip , which included the greater part of the diamond section I could not find or hear of a person or company working with modern machinery or tools or using modern methods . " The absence in Berlin of that cloud of dusty smoke so frequently observed in our cities is due to three facts , according to Consul-General Mason .

Before he can assume such a charge he must be taught the theory and practice of economical , scientific firing , by which the coal is distributed in such manner and quantity over the grate surface as to secure the most perfect combustion of its volatile elements . " In the Geographical Journal for October is an account by Oscar Neumann of his journey through southern Ethiopia to the Sudan , one of the most interesting parts of Africa yet to be explored . In the course of it he passed through five different zoological regions and " was able to collect more than 1,000 specimens of mammals belonging to about 140 different species , " of which sixteen are new This is the greatest zoological collection which has ever come to Europe from Africa at one time . He found a curious system of fortification prevailing in certain South Ethiopian kingdoms .

" In the capital of one of these kingdoms there was a Thursday market which " is visited by nearly twenty to thirty thousand persons " The address of Sir T. H. Holdich at the Belfast meeting of the British Association on " Some Geographical Problems " was a strong plea for better geographical education in England . It needed the bitter experience of the South African war to teach English administrators and English generals what the United States , Germany , Russia , and France have long known and acted upon , that " the cheapest , the quickest , the surest , indeed , the only satisfactory method of regulating the progression of public works , the development of commerce , the proper recognition of the frontier boundaries , the administration of justice , and the military control of a large and growing colony , or of a long stretch of military frontier , is to be armed with a Perfect summary of what that country contains in the shape of a geographical map " He stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of geographical terms , " the Royal Geographical Society had in preparation a ' geographical dictionary , and he expressed the wish that there might be " homogeneity in spelling " An illustration of the need of this is to be found in this number of the Journal .

The principal articles in Petermann 's Hitteilungen , No. 9 , are on the earthquake in Guatemala on April 18 , 1902 , by Dr. Karl Sapper , and on the place names of the Eskimo of Smith 's Sound , by Dr Robert Stein , with an accompanying map Stein embodies the results of his investigations during a two years ' residence in the Sound region .

" Dr. Karl Dziatzko , head librarian of the University of Gottingen , has recently extensively investigated the question whether , in the ancient world of literature , there ex isted anything like copyright . The problem was forced upon his attention by the recent large papyrus finds , there being already three hundred of these containing portions of Homer alone The supplement to the Munich Allgemeine Zeitung , No 193 , reporting on these researches , states that , as might have been expected , no such right existed in the ancient world on anything like the scale of the modern . No law has been found protesting the rights of the writer , no matter in which of the two ways his books were multiplied , by the book-trader or by private enterprise . Everybody could have copies of any work prepared at his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the effect that he who , against an author 's will , was the first to offer a book for sale , could be subjected to the process " injuriarum actio " But , after copies had once been made and circulated , then the special right of the author came to an end . Sometimes an author would make changes in his books in order to render it impossible for dealers to sell their mireimed copies . Another peculiarity of ancient publication methods was the fact that such a thing as the circulation of a writing privately , or , as the Germans say , as " manuscript , " was unknown . Even works written for private circles at once became public property  --  which worked mischief to certain authors under the tyranny of several Roman eimper o The issue and continued maintenance of the Japan , Register , a M.-lingual magazine published semi-monthly in Tokio , which has reached its third volume , recalls attention to the important question whether the Japanese  --  to say nothing of the Chinese  --  wild ever give up their ideographic writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrister-at-law , Mr. Masujiraa , conducts the Japan Register , which , in English and Sinico-Japanese ( that is , in mixed Chinese square character and the kana script ) , discuises events and themes of con , temporaneous interest most congenial to literary and scholarly people . There is certainly no sign that the Japanese will give up their ideographs ' within this present century , at least . In adopting Occidental civilization , they have put their Sinico-Japanese style and script to a severe test which has been most creditably borne . Called to express to an Oriental people the thoughts elaborated by European minds during many centuries , it has shown aptitudes undreamed of . It is not only an instrument of enormous merits , enabling a Japanese to express every shade of meaning from the columns of a European newspaper , but its use during more than fifty years ' contact with the modern West has demonstrated the enormous capabilities of the Japanese language . " The existing written language of Japan is immensely superior to colloquial Japanese as a terse and precise instrument of thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , script and " hooks and eyes " of speech it joins the Chinese ideographs , which are almost matchless for the tone and shadings of thought . The Japaieese portion of Mr. Masujima 's Register shows how much can be done in the simplification of the written style and in blending the classical and the colloquial , which are now the particular and pressing problems to be solved . The articles , editorials , critiques , and translations are of excellent selection and proportion . ( The publication office is No. 14 Yamashita , Cho , ' Yokohama . ) One of the chief purposes in the organization of the International Association of Academies of Sciences , effected about two years ago , was to furnish a medium through which an international exchange of manuscripts for scholarly research could be brought about The Royal Academy of Sciences in Madrid , although invited to membership in the new association , did not respond , and important literary documents torn Spain are accordingly still almost inaccessible to foreigners Now , however , the Government has itself taken steps to meet the wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of the great - libraries of Spain a detailed set of rules and regulations controlling such an exchange of literary treasures with foreign countries . These make it possible for scholars of other lands to secure any manuscripts and other documents from Spanish collections save those of exceptional value ; but this permission is confined to countries which extend similar courtesies to Spanish scholars , and the borrower is also compelled to make a money deposit , the amount of which is to be determined by the direbtor of the library from which the loan is made We have received from Messrs . C. F. Libbie &; Co , Boston , the catalogue of a remarkable collection of books in American genealogy and New England history which on November 11. and following will be sold for the estate of our old associate , the late William H.

Genealogies predominate , but the collection of Bostoniana is of exceptional richness , as might have been expected from a leading founder of the Bostonian Society . ? It is a far call from Chevy Chace to Lexington , from Harry Hotspur to the officer whom Halleck , by a curious slip , called a " younger son , " a " Major of Dragoons " ; from the Percy of romance to the Percy of the days of George III .

They are carefully edited by ' Charles K. Bolton , Librarian of the Boston Atheneum . The old Duke of Northumberland , father of the writer , was a strong opponent of the Ministry and its measures and treatment of the American Colonies . His son , the writer , was , above all , a soldier devoted to his profession and desirous of success and advancement in it . The letters relate principally to affairs of the time , but it is pleasant in one of the earliest to find a tribute to the great charm of New England independent of all time . On July 27 , 1774 , Percy writes : " With regard to the climate , it is ten times more inconstant than in England . " His admiration of the country about Boston is expressed in words strong enough to satisfy the most devoted friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public men and measures are those of an intelligent but prejudiced young aristocrat . He could see no good in the leaders of American sentiment or in the people in general . " They have not the least Idea of either Religion or Morality . " On April 20 , 1775 , after meeting the Rebels , he had learned that " whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob , will find himself much mistaken . " The letters contain short accounts of the day of Lexington and Concord , and of the battles of Bunker Hill , Long Island , and White Plains , in all of which , except Bunker Hill , Percy took an active part . The letters were well worth printing , though their interest is largely due to the personality of the writer . ? The reverence which is felt for the memory of Father Marquette has of late years been illustrated in many ways Sculpture has been invoked to commemorate his services , and his deeds are thus recorded in national centres like Washington and Chicago . His daring and sincerity have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin seem to owe a special debt of gratitude , the sense of recognition is widespread among other States of the Middle West , and may be expected to appear at any time . Under these circumstances , the public is likely to welcome the short biographical sketch entitled ' Father Marquette , ' that has recently been published by Mr. R. G.Thwaites ( Appletons ) . It is ' the work of one who has long been perfectly familiar with the geographical explorations and the missionary services of the Jesuits , besides having shown a special interest in the career of Marquette . A ( Sufficient account of the Indians , the Jesuits , and Marquette 's companions is given , but the book is a real biography , and centres in the deeds of the Father himself . As between Marquette and Joliet , Mr. Thwaites finds it impossible to do more than divide the praise of discovering the Mississippi , but he will not admit that the merits of the priest fall below those of the civilian Marquette , too , it was who left the record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the reputed portrait that was discovered in Montreal five years ago . If we ever had any doubt in the matter , we must now express a strong individual opinion against the authenticity of this picture . An account of its discovery will be found in volume 71 of the ' Jesuit Relations ' ( p. 400 ) . In conclusion , we may Mr. Thwaites 's final estimate of Marquette : " Others of his order , in America , were doubtless greater than he , suffered more acutely , spent more years in the service ; but popular imagination in America has perhaps more generally centred upon the hero of this tale than upon any of his fellows . He was , in truth , a man of action as well as of ideas ; a true explorer as well as a scholastic ; a rare linguist , a preacher of undoubted capacity ; gifted with unusual powers of mastery over the minds of fierce savages ; and his ' saintly character will long remain an inspiration to men of every creed and calling . " ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court Ibife under the Plantagenets ' ( Dutton ) , which was originally published in London twelve years ago In some ways this book reminds one of ' The Merchant and the Friar , ' by Sir Francis Pal-grave , wherein Marco Polo is brought to England and made to converse with Roger Bacon on topics of public interest . Mr. Hall 's ' Court Life ' is less conversational than the ' Merchant and the Friar , ' but in both cases an attempt is made to render popular . the study of medieval life . The English Constitution , under several of its aspects , is also a subject which both books have in common , although the action of the one is laid in the twelfth century and that of the other in the thirteenth Mr Hall 's book being already well known , we need not criticise it at any length . On the whole , it is inferior to ' The Merchant and the Friar ' in sprightliness , and it has the further misfortune of being so written that it does not exactly suit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the working of the Exchequer and other matters connected with the administrative system of the Plantagenets , and he has also a marked sympathy for the social side of the national life In this book , however , he is not technical enough for the student of constitutional detail , and not light enough in touch for those who are fond of historical novels Still , we must not drop out of sight Mr Hall 's precise aim . " I have attempted in this book , " he says , " nothing less than the delineation of living characters and the description of existing institutions at a given period of a typical reign . " The design is ambitious , and even though success may be but partial , the attempt was worth making . We must also add with emphasis that this book contains a great deal of curious information , and may be used by the judicious teacher to qualify the dryness of lectures on constitutional history . ? The reader of Dr. Karl Federn 's ' Dante and his Time ' ( McClure , Phillips &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a hopeful sign , that such a book should have been made in Germany , for it presents the results of much study not in the form of the heavy dissertation dear to German scholars and their disciples , but in a series of popular essays , which are readable ' throughout and often abound in striking suggestions . Dr Federn attempts to reconstruct the world into which Dante was born in 1265 , its political , religious , and social conditions , and the immediate history of Florence . He traces the decay of the antique and the coming of the medieval ideals , the conflict between Church and State , the rise of modern poetry ; and , being a German , he emphasizes , perhaps unduly , the Germanic elements in the new order which superseded the ancient . It is important to have this side properly presented , although we may not accept all the conclusions which Dr. Federn reaches . To claim Dante as of Germanic origin . on the assumption that Alighteri is simply the Italian for the old German Aldiger  --  which itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning ' the ruler , of the spear ' " ? is fanciful Whatever Dante 's remote ancestors May have been , he is the most em-German master in literature . But this is a slight point , which we cite merely to show the possible eccentricity of a pro-German treatment of the subject In the last third of the book , Dr Federn gives ' a summary biography of Dante and a criticism of his work . Here , also , there is much to commend  --  enthusiasm , opinions formed at first hand , flashes of insight . Dr. Federn does not dissect a literary cadaver , but tries to impart to his readers what a living force he has found in Dante . He writes most convincingly when he is least " psychological " ; witness his statement that , as " there are things which nobody can paint without having gone through , " Dante could never have described " the sinful love of Francesca and Paolo so touchingly " if he had not been guilty of the like himself ! We shudder to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shakspere must have committed before he could draw Lady Macbeth and Macbeth , Iago and Iachimo , and the other villains of his plays . But , to sum up , the general drift of Dr. Federn 's book is so interesting that it can be honestly recommended . There are few Dante-lovers so learned that they will not find in it some fresh suggestions ; and the average reader will derive from it much valuable information , clothed in a vivacious style .
