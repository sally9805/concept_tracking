OF all the parts of speech the pro- noun is the most exclusive . Into its circle aliens are never allowed to enter , no matter how reputable their character , how pressing their claims , how desirable their presence . Nouns and verbs may be introduced into a living tongue with little perceptible limit save the choice or caprice of those using it . Almost the same statement might be made about the other parts of speech , if we reckon the article among the adjectives . But nothing like this can be said of the pronoun . It silently but effectually bars the door against all intruders . In the course of its history it may lose some of its forms . But if they go , their places are never filled . The most urgent demands of perspicuity , convenience , or conciseness can not induce the pronoun to add a new member to its scanty family . For this condition of things there is , however , satisfactory reason . The introduction of a new pronominal form means a good deal more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts only upon the expression ; but the former affects the grammar . Now it is not true , as Archbishop Trench asserted , that no creative energy is at work in the later periods of the history of a language . The accession , however , of a new inflection always meets with a hostility for which I there is ample justification . In a language possessed of a literature words can be taken into the vocabulary with little restraint . Its traditions are not affected by such action , nor is its efficiency impaired . But the introduction of a new grammatical form partakes of the nature , of revolution . If such should come into the speech on a very large scale , we might or we might not have a better instrument of expression ; we should certainly have a different one . Every cultivated tongue is therefore bound for its safety to resist strenuously any action leading to a result of this sort . The intruder must be recmired to fight its way to acceptance . That additional pronouns are needed in our speech is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an accuracy which will permit no misconception of the meaning by hearer or reader have any notion of the shifts to which the writer is compelled to resort to save his meaning from ambiguity . Take as an illustration the following simple sentence : Henry goes to John 's house and there sees his son . Whose son is it that is seen ? The sentence leaves us in doubt . It may be Henry 's , it may be John 's . The signification can be made clear , if the former is intended , by adding own to his . But if the latter is meant , this easy method of relief is not at our command . To escape from the uncertainty no resource is left save that of repeating the proper name , or of employing some phrase which requires the sacrifice of fineness of expression to precision . This is one of the simplest and most easily remedied of scores of doubtful sentences whose ambiguity is due to the fact that our language lacks another pronoun of the third person . It is a poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the best way it can with the burden which the hostility of this part of speech to the introduction of new forms compels both speaker and writer to carry . Once only in the history of literary English has this barrier been broken down . Once only has a new pronoun been added to this exclusive family of words . To bring about the result , however , there was a conjunction of favorable circumstances , which is never likely to occur again . As it was , the new form was received at first with little favor ? almost , indeed , with positive aversion ? though it presented itself for admission at a time when entrance was far easier than it has been at any period since . True , we have no printed records of the struggle which then went on . Those were not the days when linguistic likes and dislikes found their way to the press . Periodicals and newspapers there were none . Discussions of usage were confined to conversation . But we do not need the testimony of modern experience to feel confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furiously . For the forces which are always at work in a living language were just as potent then as now , and the feelings aroused would be just as bitter . It is almost needless to say that the allusion is to the word its . The success of this parvenu , as it has been called , in forcing itself into the society of its betters must have attained in the eyes of some men of the past the dignity of a linguistic disaster . They could not have failed to recognize in its triumph another sure sign of that coming ruin of the language , in the misery of foreseeing which many persons spend hours of intense enjoyment . It is therefore worth while to recount fully , for the sake of the lesson it imparts , the story of its introduction . This has never been told but briefly . It is still more worth while to bring to attention the various agencies which COMblued to make the acceptance of the form possible . It is to be noted , in the first place , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , a cockneyism . This one fact has had more influence upon the fortunes of the word than all other agencies combined . The neater pronoun of the third person was originally not it , but hit . The latter etymologically correct form maintained itself in the standard speech down to the sixteenth century . But even then , whenever it appeared , it must have been generally looked upon as a mere survival of a generally abandoned usage . Even by the beginning of the thirteenth century the initial h had begun to be dropped in writing , as it previrmsly must have been dropped by many in pronunciation . Doubtless there were men in those days who saw in its disappearance evidence of influences that were then corrupting the speech . Their forebodings had justification to this extent . Had it not been for the dropping of the h , its would never have made its way into the language . The tendency to discard the aspirate , once begun , kept on increasing . By the time the reign of Elizabeth was reached it had become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save as it was retained in the dialects , especially those of the North . Another agency now came forward to pave the way for the introduction of its . His had been the common genitive of both he and hit . Of the two it was and originally must have seemed nearer to the neuter nominative than to the masculine . But when in the course of time the progress of what we call cockneyism had caused the initial It to disappear from hit , the condition of things underwent a complete change . The possession of the same vowel i could not save its genitive for the neuter pronoun . For the consonant is always more dominating than the vowel in speech , and the aspirate is the most dominating of the consonants . It always makes its presence or absence felt . When it was lost both to sight and memory by its disappearance from hit , consciousness was also gradually lost that there was or ever had been ally close connection between the genitive his and the nominative it . For a time this perhaps did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neuter genitive would occasion little or no annoyance or perplexity , so long as the influence of the original grammatical gender continued to exist . In accordance with that noon. , for illustration , was in our earliest , speech masculine , sun was feminine , and wife neuter . Accordingly , if stone and stream and ware and month and earth were masculine ? as they all were ? there was no sense of incongruity in applying his to these or to other objects without life . But when grammatical gender gave way in our tongue to gender based upon the real distinctions of sex or of sexlessness , a new disturbing element was brought in . The old order of things no longer worked satisfactorily . Objects without life were henceforth all regarded as neuter . His , now more closely associated with he than with it iu form , became still more closely associated with it in meaning . It was felt to belong strictly to persons , and a sense of inappropriateness began to prevail when it was made to refer to things . The operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech a problem of peculiar difficulty . It is interesting to observe how long the language struggled with it and how reluctantly it accepted at last the solution which was finally adopted . Before resorting to this expedients of all sorts were tried . The conservative element clung long to the use of his as the genitive of it as well as of he . Even to a late period in the seventeenth century such an employment of it is occasionally found . It was enabled to maintain its ground largely in consequence of its retention in the translation of the Bible , the work then most widely circulated and most diligently read . Not , however , that his is the only form there found occurring . The authorized version , in fact , discloses several of the methods taken at that time to avoid it . It was certainly not the business of those concerned in the final revision of 1611 to meddle with the newfangled monstrosity of its , which had just begun to perk its head in the face of the linguistically pure . Still , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the later revisers were disturbed , like the writers of the age generally , by the incompatibility between it and his . A variation but no improvement was afforded by the occasional employment of her . But from the outset this was felt to be as unsatisfactory as the use of the masculine genitive . Various other methods were resorted to in order to get out of the difficulty . One of the most common of these was the employment of thereof and of it . Two distinct illustrations of this practice can be found in the account of the building of the ark of the covenant . In the twenty-fifth chapter of Exodus the directions for making it were " that two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof . " In the thirtyseventh chapter of the same book we are told , after the ark was made , that " two VoL . CXVI ? No C93-47cubits and a half was the length of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and a cubit and a half the height of it . " The language has never given up using these two methods of expression , but it has distinctly curtailed the extent of the employment of both , more especially oftkreof . There was still another method fried . To avoid the reference of iris to an object without life the translators in one instance resorted to the use of it itself as a genitive . There was nothing new about the experiment . It had been tried long before there was much apparent need of it . But with the growth of the feeling of the inappropriateness of the reference of his to impersonal objects , the employment of the simple it as EA possessive seems to have gone on increasing . It is , at all events , found not infrequently in the sixteenth century and in the early part of the seventeenth . For illustration , Ben Jonson 's play of The Silent 1Von-tan was brought out in 1609 . A single speech in it made by one of the principal characters contains it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly led to such frequency of employment . This , however , does not seem to have been the case generally . Perhaps it never was so when the pronoun was united , as it often was , with own . In the solitary instance found in the Bible this combination exists . In the twenty-fifth chapter of Leviticus mention is made of that portion of the harvest " which groweth of it own accord . " About fifty years after the appearance of the authorized version it was here changed to its . The introduction of the latter form into this passage marks the practical termination of the struggle , yet to be considered , which had been going on for more than half a century . There was yet another method resorted to of dealing with the problem . To replace the neuter his the definite article was employed , sometimes with own , sometimes without it . Thus in the very passage of Leviticus just cited , the phrase " of it own accord " of the authorized version appears in the Bishop 's Bible as " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have been favored more particularly by those familiar with the classics . " A fair stone , " writes Ascham in his Schoolmaster , " requireth to be set in the finest gold , or else it loseth much of the grace and price . " " It is the manner , " says Bacon , in his Advancement of Learning , " to scandalize and deprave that which retaineth the state and nature by taking advantage upon that which is corrupt and degenerate . " This use of the , though originating at a much earlier period , never met with wide acceptance . It did not accord with the genius of the language . None , indeed , of these expedients for overcoming the difficulty were found satisfactory . To some one of them we might have come to be reconciled at last by long-continued use but they all strike us now as distinctly clumsy , when not objectionable upon other grounds . The language , in feet , was floundering along helplessly , casting about for some method of relieving itself from what was felt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration which led some unknown person to hit upon the expedient of adding the termination a to it . The new form thus developed fulfilled all the conditions required . Its final letter was the common ending of the genitive case . It was so close in form to the nominative that not even the dullest could mistake its meaning . The memory of the man has perished who , contemplating . the difficulty of the problem , first found for it this simplest and happiest of solutions . From a linguistic point of view he has a right to be entitled the Great Unknown . But though we can not be sure of the name of the originator of the term , its first recorded appearance in print belongs to the year 1. ? 98 . There it occurs in the Italian-English dictionary of John Florio . It may be that the compiler himself was the inventor of the word ; but it is fairly certain that it must have been for some time in colloquial use before it was admitted within the sacred precincts of a dictionary . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , often unconsciously , by a language to escape from a situation which is felt to he unspeakably oppressive . It might accordingly have been expected that as soon as this easy method of getting rid of the burden was presented , the new term would meet with instant and universalacceptance . Its simplicity and effectiveness would alike recommend it . The wonder would be that an expedient so simple and so satisfactory had not been hit upon long before . Had the newcomer been a noun or a verb , there is no question as to the favor with which it would at once have been received . But the pronoun has all the feelings of an aristocracy . Here as elsewhere it maintained its attitude of repugnance to the admission of any stranger into its select circle . It took over half a century for this intruder to overcome the hostility felt towards it . The reluctance with which writers of highest rank admitted it into their productions is of itself evidence enough of the doubt and coldness with which it was at first viewed . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but imperfectly ascertained . All that can easily be found about its reception at the outset is the statement that its does not occur in the authorized version of the Bible , published in 1611 ; and that in the thirty-six plays which make up the folio of 1623 it appears but ten times . Of these ten instances , it is to be added , five belong to the Winter 's Tale and two to The Tempest , both plays of late production in Shakespeare 's career . Coming down the seventeenth century it is found but three times in the poetry of Milton Yet the majority of the nearly thirty thousand lines he composed appeared either in or after 1677 ; that is , sixtyseven years after its had made its first known appearance in the language . To these details something of an addition can be made . Though not sufficient to set forth clearly the full history of the struggle which went on , they bring out distinctly the hesitation with which the word was received by authors of the first rank . Without their cooperation it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tongue . Some of the facts are rather surprising . Bacon died in 1626 . So far as I can discover , there is not a single instance of the employment of its in his works . It assuredly does not appear in his Essays . where one would expect to find it , if anywhere . The final revision of these came out in 1625 . If trust can be put in the results of an examination made long ago , but not since verified , Ben Jonson 's first use of the term is in his play of - 17o ( pone , brought out in 1605 and published in 1607 . ? Afterwards it occurs in a few of the other plays ? about half a dozen times in all . In Bartholomew Fair it is found twice . This was produced in 1614 ; but though Jonson lived until 1637 and wrote six plays after the date just mentioned , its does not appear in any of them . An examination of his other writings might reveal a different state of things ; but one gets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in years the scholastic instinct grew upon him , and rendered him averse to taking the slightest liberty with the established speech . When he wrote his English Grammar he seemed to be unaware of the existence of the new pronominal form . At all events he did not deem it worthy of mention , On the other hand , though Milton was so sparing of the use of its in his poetry , he was far mere liberal in respect to it in his prose . His employment of it varied considerably . In some of his treatises not a single instance of it can be found ; in others it occurs but once or twice . In two of the four divorce pamphlets it appears mere frequently than anywhere else . In the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce it is met with five times , in the Tetrachordon eight . Much of his production came out during the last seven years of his life , when its had - firmly established itself in the speech . Yet this fact did not lead Milton to look upon it with any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volume containing nearly one hundred thousand words and yet using its no more than once . But this was just whet Milton did in his History of Britain published in 1670 . Yet the form at that time was so generally in use that its recent origin had come largely to be forgotten . Dryden on this very point furnishes a striking illustration of how a man of genius can manage to exhibit ignorance of the grammatical history of the tongue of which he is a master , when the change which had taken place had been going on before his eyes . In a piece published in 1672 he could accuse Ben Janson " ef ill syntax , " because he had used his instead of its in the following line : Though heaven should speak with all his wrath at once . There is one further point which the history here given brings out sharply . The introduction of its has done something more than add a convenient pronominal form to the speech . It has largely revolutionized the structure of the sentence . A single illustration out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently clear . In Macaulay 's essay on Milton its occurs just forty-four times . In all the works of Milton himself it occurs a little over thirty times . In the fewer than twenty thousand words which make up the single production of the former writer this one pronoun is found much more frequently than in the nearly seven hundred thousand words which constitute the sum of what the latter employed in all his writings , whether in prose or verse . The difference between the usage of the past and of the present could not well be conveyed in clearer and more expressive terms . The account given of the introduction of its presents a picture of the struggles unconsciously made by a language to free itself from a situation which it felt to be unendurable . A problem differing in detail , but essentially similar in character , exists before us to-day . We can get some conception of the trouble which beset the minds of our ancestors in regard to the use of his as the genitive of it by that which affects the minds of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which . But while the difficulty is in some respects the same , there is unfortunately no such easy way out of it . Luckily the words stand on a different footing . In consequence , the embarrassment caused by employing whose as the relative to an antecedent without life is by no means so annoying . To understand the nature of the problem existing in this ease , and how it chanced to arise , it will be necessary to give briefly a few facts in the history of the particular words concerned . Roth who and which are by origin not relative pronouns but interrogative . In the early period of the speech there was little thought of employing either in the former capacity . Who is so found , indeed , but such employment of it i3 infrequent . These interrogatives were brought in later as relatives , mainly , it would seem , for the relief of that , which was staggering under the numerous burdens laid upon it as a demonstrative , a relative , a conjunction , and at times as an article . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least on any noticeable scale . It was followed by the oblique cases of who , and finally by the nominative itself . The movement in this direction began in the twelfth century ; but it was not till the sixteenth that it was fully completed . For a long time which could have as an antecedent either a person or a thing . The opening of the Lord 's Prayer has made this once widely prevalent usage familiar to us all . Who , as a relative , did not often have en impersonal antecedent ; but it did so occasionally . The processes that are always going on in language prevented the continuance of this state of things . The disposition arose to restrict one of these relatives to a personal antecedent , the other to an impersonal one . But at this point arose the difficulty . Which , having dropped all its original inflectional forms , was left without a distinctive genitive . Nothing , in consequence , remained for it to do but to adopt whose . This form was originally the genitive of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neuter as it was a masculine . But while the former of its nominatives went over unqualifiedly to a relative use , the latter did so but partially . In consequence what would have been its functions fell to which . So long as this latter relative referred to persons as well as things , no sense of impropriety would be felt in using whose as its genitive . It was almost after the fashion of his as a neuter while grammatical gender prevailed . But with the growth of the disposition to restrict which to antecedents without life there sprang up a repugnance on the part of many to consider whose as having anything whatever to do with it . This dislike apparently made no public display of itself until the outbreak of grammatical sensitiveness that took place in the Tatter half of the eighteenth century . Dr. Johnson in his dictionary had definitely stated that " whose is the genitive of which as well as of who , and is applied to things . " But the authority of thegreat lexicographer did not overbear the convictions of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thought , linguistically pure . The most eminent authors were held up to sternest condemnation for their guilty practice of using whose as a relative to an impersonal antecedent . As all the dead had done it , and as all the living were continuing to do it , there was no escape from the conclusion that they were distinctly inferior to their censors in the knowledge of propriety of speech . There is no doubt , indeed , that at the present day the use of whose as a relative referring to objects without life presses heavily upon the hearts of many , as once in a somewhat similar situation did his . Nor is there any question that it would be comforting to us all if for this ' . pronoun a simple and satisfactory substitute could be devised . But there is no hope of introducing a new member into this most exclusive of grammatical families . The form of the word which does not allow of the possibility of a genitive inflection that would please anybody , still less everybody . There remains for us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which . Against the latter no purely grammatical exception can be taken . Always possible , often useful , it is at times , however , both ineffective and unsatisfactory . Occasionally , it is distinctly objectionable on account of the clumsiness of construction it causes by the separation of the relative from close connection with its antecedent . Hence , while a valuable associate to whose , it will never be allowed to supersede it . We can feel confident that for the future as in the past the latter will continue to prevail as the genitive of which . There is another and somewhat bread field of expression in which the indisposition of this part of speech to receive accessions , with the consequent penury of forms caused by it , leads to several perplexing situations under which the language labors . We have a number of words and phrases in our tongue which require the employment of a pronoun that does not exist . As representatives of this class can be taken each and every , with the combinations into which they enter . The peculiarity about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards meaning they are plural . Consequently the construction , according to sense , is always coming into conflict with the construction according to strict grammar . One of these expressions ? everybody , for instance ? may be used to bring out the point distinctly . It is desired , for example , to make a statement to the effect that at some specific gathering all persons present had seen there those whom they knew well . With the employment of the word just selected grammatical difficulties at once arise and the troubles of the writer begin . Three ways are open to him in which he can overcome them after a fashion ; but not one of them answers fully all the conditions existing . In the first , the masculine form can be made to represent both itself and the feminine . Consequently such a sentence as the following could be framed : There everybody met his friends . Women as well as men would be included under his . Though never really satisfactory , this was once the preferred usage . For a time it served the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps frequently . But there has been for a good while past a distinct dislike to this construction . One result of the increasingly important part that the female sex plays in life and literature is the growth of a repugnance on the part of the feminine element to have its identity merged in the masculine . Subconsciousness of the injustice of it has now passed over into full consciousness that under this form of expression its claims are not really recognized . Hence , while women may use it , they do not like it ; and men have come to share largely in the same feeling . Another way out of the difficulty was devised . To satisfy the claims of both sexes resort was had to two representative pronouns . The sentence previously given would accordingly appear in the following shape : There everybody met his or her friends . But such a form of expression pleased no one . It was felt to be formal , to suffer from that stiffness which is always sure to manifest itself when naturalness of expression is sacrifired to mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clumsiness , it was subject to exception on other grounds . In words with feminine terminations , like heiress or heroine , the fact of sex is indicated , indeed , but it is not made obtrusive . When , however , we have distinct contrasted forms , as in " his or her , " it is lifted into an undue and almost aggressive prominence , where there is neither desire nor occasion to make it prominent . Hence this particular usage , while serviceable in certain documents , and acceptable always to the devotees of strict grammar , is usually detested by everybody else . A third way out of the difficulty there is , and it was long ago taken by the bolder spirits . This was the construction according to the . sense . The plural pronominal forms were used to correspond to the idea of plurality existing in the singular subject . Hence men said in the sentence quoted , There everybody met their friends . Examples of this usage can be found abundantly in authors of high reputation ; but those given here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single one . This writer is Jane Austen . She is chosen not for her eminence , but for her sex . For , as a general rule , highly cultivated women speak and write the language not only with more naturalness , but with greater scrupulousness and purity than the corresponding class of men . Examples from their works are in consequence more convincing . Here are two or three taken out of many . " It is very unfair , " says Miss Austen in Emma , " to judge of anybody 's conduct without an intimate knowledge of their character . " Again , in the seine work , the remark is made that " they say everybody is in love once in their lives . " In Mansfield Park she observes that " nobody could command attention when they spoke . " These examples ? which might be multiplied from numerous other authors ? are sufficient to indicate the attitude of those who adopt the third course . Every one can see that the problem is a very pretty one as it stands , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of it will ever be found .
