txt Another Wrong Gas Bill . The impossible has eventuated . The gas company has made a mistake in its bill and deliberately cheated itself . During December my wife and I put up a job on the company . We figured that by going to the opera three nights a week we could save enough on our gas bill to pay for our opera tickets . That being the case , of course the price of the tickets came out of my wife 's household money . Alas ! when the December gas bill came in it was just the same as ever . My wife was mad and blamed the company . Even my offer to refund the price of the opera tickets failed to placate her , so I agreed to read the meter myself and keep tabs on the bills . When the time for the January reckoning came I consulted the meter and made a note of its record . The bill has now arrived , and it was several hundred feet short . My wife is happy , but some poor devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard time when his error is discovered .
