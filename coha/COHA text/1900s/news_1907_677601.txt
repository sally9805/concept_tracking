txt Fire started in the big house-furnishing store of Sheppard Knapp &; Coo at Sixth Avenue and Thirteenth Street , at 10:45 o'clock last night , and it midnight had burned out that part of the store from 105 to 107 Thirteenth Street . By that time the flames had swept from the basement through the five floors , and out through the roof . This old building was but one of the three sections of the Sheppard Knapp store . A long L extended through to Fourteenth Street , with an entrance there . The fire , which was in the basement of all three sections , reached the first floor of the L , doing considerable damage . The main section of the store adjoined the old building on Thirteenth Street and faced on Sixth Avenue , thus constituting the corner of the whole store . The fire was kept down cellar there , though great damage was done by smoke and water as in the L. On one side of the Fourteenth Street L is the furniture store of Cowperthwait &; Co . This firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the L is 's Hotel . Little damage was done there . By 1 o'clock the fire had been stopped . The damage was estimated at 000,000 . This high figure was given on account of the expensive character of some of the Turkish and Oriental rugs and carpets . The firemen were impeded in their work on the Sixth Avenue side by openings which have been made for the construction of the tunnel . Some of these openings were boarded over , while others were simply inclosed . That left little room for the engines on Sixth Avenue . The fire was discovered in the basement of 105 and 107 West Thirteenth Street by Special Officer Cox . By the time the first fire apparatus arrived the flames had mounted to the third floor . Chief Croker arrived , and a second , third , and fourth alarm were sent in . The surface car lines on Sixth Avenue and Fourteenth Street were soon tied up . Shortly after that tha trains on the elevated line also had ta stop . The firemen mounted the elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines were thick with cars filled with theatregoers . By midnight they had massed up on all three lines for blocks . A great many of the passengers ' , left the cars to watch the fire , The crowd grew so big that the police reserves of all the nearby precincts were sent to keep the sightseers out of the way of the firemen . Just across the street from the burning building is the Fourteenth Street Theatre , where a company was presenting Laura Jean Libbey 's " Parted on Her Bridal Tour . " When the engines began to arrive on the scene with clanging bells " Parted on Her Bridal Tour " was in its last act . The clangor outside drowned the threats of the villain and the sound of dripping tears from the persecuted heroine . The management of the theatre at once notified all present that they might as well stay and see virtue triumphant , as there was no danger . The doors were manned , so that the house could be emptied in a few minutes if it was necessary .

Shortly after 11 o'clock the elevated railway people were ordered to turn the power from the Sixth Avenue line . The currents furnished by the Spring Street and the West Fifty-third Street power houses were promptly switched , leaving the entire Sixth Avenue elevated line below Fifty-third Street dead . It happened , fortunately , that when the currents were switched every train was at a station except one , which came to a halt a few hundred feet south of the Fourteenth Street station . The passengers made their way to the station . Return tickets good for forty-eight hours were given out to passengers . No more fares were accepted for the Sixth Avenue line . The traffic was diverted at Fifty-third Street to the Ninth Avenue line , all trains marked Sixth Avenue coming down Columbus being sent on down Ninth Avenue .

At 12:80 o'clock the fire insurance salvage corps broke through the doors of the Cowperthwait store on Fourteenth Street and covered the stock with tarpaulins . Capt . O'Conner of the Charles Stre:k Police Station was of the opinion that the fire had been started by an incendiary , Two of his men , when they ran toward the old building on Thirteenth Street when the fire began , found that a door yielded to their touch , and a man ran out . of it . They let him go , thinking he was a night watchman . Thomas J. O'Brien , Assistant Superintendent of the Sheppard Knapp Company , said that no watchman was employed by the store . No one had keys to the building except the proper ** and the head of the delivery department , he declared , and he was sure that if the police saw a man run out of an open door when the fire started , the runner was an incendiary . $500,000 TO AMHERST .
