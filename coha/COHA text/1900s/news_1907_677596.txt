txt The case of Mrs. AniSia Louise De Massy , charged with the murder of Gustav Simon , the wealthy blouse manufacturer , last year , went to the jury at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon , and at 11:42 o'clock last night the twelve men returned with this verdict : " We find the defendant guilty of manslaughter in the first degree , with a recommendation for mercy . " As the woman was going out of the courtroom , Charles Le Barbier , her coun-1 sel , spoke to her in French , saying , in effect , that the verdict might have been worse . " Out , " she answered . Mrs. De Massy , whose composure during most of the trial has been remarkable , showed a decided loss of it last night a few minutes subsequent to the pronouncement of the verdict . It seemed that the meaning of it all took a long time to become clear to her . And when the time came for her to answer the questions as to her age , occupation , and so on she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third time , and finally spoke in a hoarse whisper that could not be heard three feet away . From 8 o'clock until 5:20 o'clock nothing was heard from the jury . They asked for no further instructions . They wanted to see no one . At 5:20 o'clock they went out to dinner , staying until a little after 8 o'clock . Jury Oat Nearly Nine Hours .. No word came from the jury room until shortly after 11 o'clock , when the men sent word that the presence of Justice Blanchard was desired . He was sent for . Lawyer Le Barbier and Assistant District Attorney Ely were already waiting . At 11:42 the jury filed in and faced Mrs. De Massy . She looked calmly at them , but not all of them looked at her . She bowed pleasantly to all who looked at her . The jury was asked if it had come to a verdict , and the answer was yes , and then It was read . The defendant appeared to be calm . Mr. Le Barbier asked that a poll of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdict that had just been read by the foreman was theirs . They answered yes . Still Mrs. De Massy seemed not to realise what had happened . The Bible was brought . She was asked to tell the whole truth in answer to the questions that should be asked . Her nerve seemed to be just leaving her . " What is your age ? " was asked . It could be seen that she was trying to make her lips move . It seemed that her throat was parched . Three times she tried , and then came the hoarse whisper . Justice Blanchard said that he would pronounce sentence next Thursday morning at 10:30 o'clock . The maximum penalty Is twenty years . Her Lawyer 's Charges . Mr. Le Barbier commenced his summing up at 10:15 o'clock yesterday morning . He spoke for an hour and a half end subjected Policeman Wersawzsky and the witneses who had testified to meeting Mrs. De Massy on the stairs after the shooting to a severe arraignment . " These jugglers of the truth , " was the phrase employed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! , Shiller , and Kohler , and again he referred to Solomon Shiller and his employes in the millinery shop on the fourth floor of the building in which Simon was shot as " that contingent of volunteers from the fourth floor . of G04 Broadway , who came here , whether for a consideration or not , I do not care . " The lawyer called the attention of the jury to the fact that there was no real motive shown for the crime , and then commenced an analysis of the evidence given by the State 's witnesses . He pointed out what he termed vital contradictions in this testimony . The evidence given by Simmons , the negro who testified that he had known Mrs. De Massy to have a revolver , Mr. Le Barbier characterized as the " crowning piece of infamy in this case . " " And Ow we come to that great detective , Wersanzsky ! That policeman who , though eleven years on the police force , tells you that he never bought a cartridge in his life . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by the testimony as to the finding of a box of cartridges when the life of a woman is at stake ? Do n't be so gulled . When they find that they can not connect this woman with a revolver , they ' planted ' this box of cartridges in her room  --  manufactured evidence . And when you put aside the lying in this case you find it absolutely destitute of evidence . " The lawyer asked the jury to note that Policeman Rogan , who was first on the scene , was out called by the prosecution , and in closing he scored the methods which he declared were in vogue in the District Attorney 's office . " It is not up to us to solve mysteries , " he concluded . " We who have been put through the third degree are fighting for life here , and are here only to satisfy you gentlemen that this defendant did not do this dastardly deed . " I have followed this case too long and too closely to believe the manufactured evidence served up by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman committed murder . Give me the head of St. John the Baptist , said Salome ? I do n't care where you get it , give it to me , she insisted . So says the prosecution  --  give me the manufactured evidence to prosecute and convict in this ease , and I will gull the jury . I say that the people of this county do not want convictions on testimony such as that . " People 's Demand . In his summing up Mr. Ely hastened to reply to Mr. Le Barbier 's charge declaring that it had become a common thing for counsel to cry police conspiracy ' and manufactured evidence , and in this way to poison the minds of the jury . " The District Attorney 's office seeks no laurels by convicting innocent persons , " he protested . " The people demand no victom . They want no sacrifice . But they do insist that violators of the law be brought to justice and punished . " Following the Assistant District Attorney 's speech , Justice Blanchard adjourned court until 2 o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge . He warned the jury that all the evidence was circumstantial , but added that this was as good as direct evi dence . After quoting the law of murder and manslaughter and instructing the jury in finding a cerdlct , Justice Blanchard told the jury that if they decided that some of the witnesses testified falsely they could discard such evidence in its entirety . and that the . presumption of innocence : ffollowed the.defendant from the moment of her was , arrest until.her , , , gui , lt . declared
