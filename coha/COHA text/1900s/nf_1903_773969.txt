txt CHAPTER III THE CARE OF THE DINING-ROOM DAILY CARE LAY a fire ready to light , then brush up the hearth , wipe the andirons and brass-work about the hearth with a dry cloth . Sweep the rugs with the carpet sweeper , and rub over the hardwood border of the floor with a dry cloth or a long-handled dust mop . Dust each article in the room thoroughly with clean cheese-cloth , being careful to take up the dust rather than scatter the same . Have the windows open meanwhile , and shake the cloth out of a window occasionally . Put fresh water into vases of flowers , and lay the table . After a meal is finished and the table cleared , roll the tablecloth over the pasteboard made for the purpose , and lay it aside . Remove all crumbs from the floor and rug , open the windows and air the room , then adjust the window shades and leave the fireplace in order . Airing the room after each meal should never be omitted . IO The Up-to-Date Waitress WEEKLY CARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roll small rugs , to be brushed outside . If the rug under the table be too large for care outside , push the table from the rug into one corner of the room . Over the table spread a calico cover or cotton sheet kept for this purpose . Upon this set the dishes from the sideboard and the ornaments from the mantel , and cover closely . Take down draperies that are easily removed , and hang them in the open air . Close all doors and drawers to cabinets , closets , etc . Cover the chairs or remove them from the room . Cover clock and pictures . Remove the brass and steel from position , and clean the fireplace . If there are registers in the floor , lift them out , and set on a newspaper spread upon the floor . Wipe the pipes leading from the registers to the furnace , as far as you can reach , with a cloth slightly dampened . Put the registers back in place , and shut them , to keep out the dust when sweeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows . The Up-to-Date Waitress Sweeping and Dusting Sweep the rug thoroughly , and with the nap , taking short strokes . Roll up the rug , and sweep the floor with a long-handled bristle brush . If the rug can be taken out of doors , spread it , nap side down , on the grass , and beat with a rattan made for the purpose . Then sweep this side . Turn the rug , and sweep the other side with the nap . Small rugs may be hung on the line , and the dust be beaten from them with the rattan . Avoid shaking rugs by the ends , which are thus easily injured . With a soft brush , such as is used by painters , brush the dust from the windows and doors , going over all mouldings and edges , the outer sill of the windows , etc . Tie a bag , made for the purpose ( of Canton flannel or similar material ) , over the broom , and brush the ceiling , the cornice , and the walls downward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows , and finishing a second time . The hearth , having been properly brushed when the floor was swept , is now ready to be washed , and the brass and steel may be polished , and replaced . 12 The Up-to-Date Waitress Cleaning 7'i/es If the fireplace is finished with tiles , wash these with a soft cloth in soap and water , and polish with the following preparation : five pints of boiling water , two ounces of laundry soap , one ounce of sal-soda , half a pound of wax , and an equal volume of turpentine . Shave the soap and wax very fine . Add the water , and stir over the fire until the ingredients are dissolved . Then add the soda . Remove from the fire , and stir until cold . Then store in a covered vessel . When ready to use , gently heat a cup of the mixture . Remove from the fire , and gradually stir into it a cup of turpentine . Use this to clean and polish tiles or marble . Washing Glass and Windows First rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a soft , dry cheese-cloth , to remove dust . Then wash with a soft cloth wrung out of warm water , in which has been put a little liquid ammonia . Wash every part of the glass . Rub dry with a clean , soft cloth , and polish with tissue paper or a piece of chamois skin . If one is willing to take time to remove all traces of z3 The Up-to-Date Waitress whiting , this substance with household ammonia will clean glass very quickly . Mix the whiting to a thin paste with equal measures of ammonia and water . Rub this over the glass , and , when dry , remove the whiting with a soft cloth , and polish with tissue paper . Care of Hard-wood Floor The floor has been swept with the bristle broom , and the dust taken up . If the rug has been removed for cleaning , the quantity of dust in the room should be very small . Now wipe the floor with a dry cloth or the dry dust mop . If there are spots on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to remove the spots , or they may be rubbed with a cloth wrung as dry as possible out of warm water . Either the turpentine or water will destroy the polish of the floor ; this must be restored by the use of a weighted brush . The weighted brush is a broad , flat brush , on which is fastened a loaded top . The brush has a long handle ; by this the brush is pushed back and forth until the original polish is restored . Woollen cloths or carpet may take the place of the weighted brush ; but of course , in this case , the work will be more tedious . 14 The Up-to-Date Waitress Care of Bristle Brush , Dust Mop ( Soft Cotton String ) , and Weighted Brush The weighted brush needs to be kept free from oil and perfectly clean . As it is used infrequently , it should be covered at ' once after use with a cotton bag . Two or three times a year cleanse thoroughly . To half a kitchen pail of lukewarm water add three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let it remain half an hour . Then lift up and down in the water , and rinse in clear cold water . Let it dry slowly in a current of air . Shake the dust mop every time it is used . Twice a month soak in water to which a little household ammonia has been added . Then rinse in warm water , and dry in the open air . Wash the bristle brush in the same way , but do not let the water come up over the top of the brush . ! ' o restore the Polish on the Dining-Table , Sideboard , or Side Table Rub the table top free from spots with a soft cloth and furniture polish . Occasionally take some convenient time to thoroughly repolish . Powdered pumice-stone or rotten-stone , with 15 The Up-to-Date Waitress linseed or paraffin oil , haircloth , felt , and linen cloths , are needed for this purpose . A " rubber " is a help in this work , and may be made at home . Cover a piece of hard wood eight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide with several thicknesses of cotton batting . Over this fasten several thicknesses of old cotton cloth , and finish with several thicknesses of old linen . The felt or haircloth is used first , and this should be five or six inches square . Mix pumice-stone with oil to a thin paste . Spread this over a portion of the table top , and rub gently with the felt or haircloth , using first a circular movement . Then rub across , and at last with the grain of the wood . Renew the liquid paste as needed to obviate any friction , and add oil as well as paste , if the haircloth or felt does not run smoothly . Continue the rubbing until the whole surface has been gone over . Polish with the second piece of haircloth or felt until the surface is dry . Take equal parts of oil and turpentine . Wet a soft cheese-cloth in these , and go over the whole surface . Then leave the table for about an hour . Then sprinkle the surface with fine tripoli or rotten-stone , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil . Wipe off the tripoli with the grain of the wood and with a very soft cloth . Give the final polishing with the " rubber . " Pow dered pumice-stone is very satisfactory for use on ordinary pieces of furniture , but for very fine and handsome pieces tripoli is preferable . Haircloth , such as is used in stiffening coats and dresses , or pieces of felt cut from old hats , are quite as satisfactory as the felt purchased from a painter , for the former may be burned after use , while the latter , being expensive , needs be washed with care , and put aside for future use . I'o finish Dusting Remove coverings from clock , pictures , chairs , etc . Shake these in the air , fold neatly , and lay them aside in their proper place . Then dust each article with care . In removing the dust from over the doors , windows , etc. , avoid the use of a feather duster as much as possible . A step-ladder makes possible the use of a soft cloth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When the room is again in order , if there be time before the preparations for the next meal are begun , the brass of the fireplace may be polished . 77 The Up-to-Date Waitress Cleaning Brass Brass and copper are cleaned very easily with acids ; but , unless the acids are completely and immediately removed , the surface tarnishes again very quickly . Perhaps , all things considered , the use of salt and vinegar for cleansing , followed by polishing with rotten-stone or tripoli and sweet or linseed oil , will be found as satisfactory as any of the means commonly employed . i . Mix salt with vinegar or oxalic acid . 2 . With a soft cloth wet in this mixture rub the surface until the tarnish is removed . 3 . Wash the brass in clear water , and wipe dry . q .. Polish with rotten-stone , whiting , or tripoli and sweet oil , using a woollen cloth . s . Finish polishing with a dry , soft flannel . // CARE OF THE PANTRY THE care of the pantry includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal . 2. " " fruit , relishes , bread , cake , cheese , crackers , etc. 3 .

I " " turpentine f THE PANTRY AT MEAL TIME When a meal is announced have the pantry in perfect order , with each article in its appropriate and accustomed place . The plates for roasts 20 The Up-to-Date Waitress 6 ? 63 ' and other hot dishes should have been standing in the warming oven or hot closet from twenty minutes to half an hour . Put the dishes for salads and ices in the refrigerator just before announcing the meal . Reserve convenient and commodious places for the bestowal of dishes of food , of silver and china , brought from the dining-room . Retain these places at every meal for the purpose selected , as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table appointments . CARE OF FOOD LEFT FROM A MEAL Do not send choice platters containing food to the kitchen . Remove food that is not to reappear on the table in the same form to plates kept for that purpose and send these to the kitchen at once . Do not leave any food standing around in the pantry . Do not throw slices of bread back into the stone jar in which the loaves are stored ; keep them in a separate receptacle . ' Wrap little cakes or parts of loaves of cake in waxed paper and store in a tin box . Return confectionery and salted almonds to original boxes , wrap these in paper , and store in a drawer or closed receptacle . Wrap cheese 2I The Up-to-Date Waitress closely in paper , then in tin-foil and then store in a cool , dry place . Return olives to original brine ; add salt and water , if needful to cover , and set aside in the refrigerator . Return milk and cream to jars , put in the same or fresh stoppers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pantry refrigerator except such as will be sent to the table without further cooking . MAKING READY FOR DISH WASHING 1 . Scrape all bones and refuse from the plates into a large earthen receptacle kept for the purpose and remove this to the garbage pail at once . Wipe out the dish with a soft paper or old cloth , which may be burned , then wash the dish with soapy water and rinse with hot water . 2 . With a bit of bread wipe off the plates , platters , and bowls , or , water being plenty , rinse these with cold water and wipe out the bowls of spoons with the bread . Dispose the coarser ware in piles , but under no consideration should pieces of choice china and glass be piled one above another . 3 . Put silver knives , forks , tablespoons , teaspoons , and steel knives in separate pitchers of 22 The Up-to-Date Waitress lukewarm , soapy water ; do not let the handles of the steel knives touch the water . Fill cream and milk pitchers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turn the contents of the tea and coffee pots into a fine drainer in the sink , and fill the pots with hot water . q .. Take up any crumbs that may have been dropped on shelves or floor ; wipe off the shelves , where the dishes have stood , and the floor , if anything has been dropped upon it . WASHING DISHES Have one pan filled with moderately hot , soapy water and another with clear hot water . Change these waters often . Wash the dishes in the first water and rinse in the second , wipe glass at once , set china to drain on a grooved , hard-wood drainer that is inclined toward the sink . Never wash dishes with a cake of soap lying in the water . WASHING GLASS Wash the glass , one piece at a time , using a soft brush as needed . Great care must be taken with the pans , towels , cloth , and water 23 The Up-to-Date Waitress used in washing and wiping glass . If glass be scratched in any way , even slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break at that point . One grain of sand , such as is often seen in the bottom of a pan in which lettuce or spinach has been washed , has been the occasion for the loss of many a piece of fine glass . Glass that is deeply cut is not easily dried ; the moisture remains in the crevices . Bury the glass as soon as dried in a box of fine boxwood or basswood sawdust ( sawdust from woods of a resinous nature , as pine and spruce , is not suitable for this purpose ) . Let the glass stand half an hour or longer , then remove from the box , and brush with a soft cloth or chamois . Spread the sawdust out to dry , then set aside to use again . WASHING AND CLEANING SILVER Wash the silver after the glass , reheating the water or taking a fresh supply . Have plenty of soap in the water . Use the soap shaker to make the suds , and on no account let a cake of soap remain in the water . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the drainer 24 The Up-to-Date Waitress ( a grooved hard-wood plank sloping toward the sink ) and wipe dry as soon as possible . If any of the silver has been tarnished with eggs or similar substance , wet a little sifted whiting with ammonia or alcohol , diluted with a little water , and apply this with a soft cloth , and let the silver stand on a paper to dry , then rub off the whiting with a soft cloth and polish with a second cloth or chamois . About once a month clean all the silver in the same way , using a soft brush for chased and ornamented pieces . WASHING CHINA Several cups , saucers , or small dishes may be put into the pan at once . Make sure that each is empty , lest the dishwater be spoiled . Rinse each one as washed , and set it to drain ; then , when all are washed , the first piece will be ready to wipe . Wash the larger dishes one at a time . Change the water often . Too hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause the finish to crackle . Avoid having more than one kind of china in the pan at a time . Breakage results from a commingling of dishes of different sizes and shapes . 25 The Up-to-Date Waitress WASHING STEEL KNIVES AND CARVERS After washing the blades of steel knives , scour them with Bristol brick or sand soap ; apply this with a woollen cloth or a cork moistened with soap or water . Wash and rinse the blades in moderately hot water ; wipe the handles with a soft damp cloth , and rub the blades with a soft dry cloth until they are perfectly dry . Use only lukewarm water in caring for carvers . CARE OF TEA AND COFFEE POTS Unless special care be needed , it is probably best to clean and dry tea and coffee pots when making ready to wash dishes . Never , on any account , put soapy water into these receptacles . Turn the contents into the drainer in the sink , which should be fine enough to keep back coffee grounds , wash with clear water and a cloth used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cloth to clean crevices , rinse with boiling water , wipe dry , and set aside . Remove discolorations from the inside with the article generally used to cleanse the material of which the pots are made , as whiting wet with ammonia or dilute alcohol for silver , china , of stone ware . Fill agate-lined pots with boiling 26 The Up-to-Date Waitress water to which a generous teaspoonful of salsoda has been added ; let stand on the back of the gas range half an hour , then wash with clear water as above . CARE OF TEAKETTLE After each meal empty the teakettle and dry it . Once a day wash thoroughly , scald with boiling water , and wipe dry . This insures a clean kettle and fresh-drawn water for the making of tea and coffee , which is the principle use of a teakettle in the pantry . CARE OF CRUMB TRAY , BREAD TRAY , SALTS , ETC . Wash and wipe the carafes , all trays that have been used in the dining-room , as also the outside of the oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week these will need more particular attention . For external cleaning see care of silver and cut glass . CLEANING CARAFES , OIL AND VINEGAR CRUETS Cleaning Carafes Put two level tablespoonfuls of rice , two or three pieces of sal-soda as large as a hickory 27 The Up-to-Date Waitress nut , and a cup of warm water into the carafe , cover the top with several thicknesses of old linen or with a towel folded several times , bring the ends down around the stem , and surround the whole with the hand ; then using both hands shake the bottle vigorously , to insure the friction of the rice upon every part of the glass . When the bottle is thoroughly cleansed , pour out the water , retaining the rice , put in a cup of warm water , cover and shake as before , then turn out both rice and water and rinse thoroughly with clean water , changing it once or twice . Wipe dry with a soft cloth . Cleaning the Vinegar Cruet Clean in the same manner as the water bottle , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cleaning the Oil Cruet Use the sal-soda and water first , to remove a part of the oil , then add the rice , and finish as above . CARE OF DISH TOWELS , ETC . Wash in hot , soapy water all salad cloths , dish towels , dish mops , and dishcloths that have 28 The Up-to-Date Waitress been used ; wash these in the order mentioned , scald in hot water , rinse in cold water , shake and snap out , then hang in the open air to dry . Once a week , after all are washed , add a little borax to the water and let the linen scald half an hour , then rinse in two waters . When dry , dampen , and after some little time iron smoothly , and when well aired put each variety in its proper place . CARE OF SINK , ETC . Wash out the sink , to leave it absolutely free of grease ; scour the faucets , dipper , hand basin , or whatever utensils are kept at the sink . Leave each and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong solution of sal-soda ( one cup to five quarts of water ) down the sink pipe and follow it at once with a profuse flushing with hot water . With this care , if dishes be properly prepared for washing and dishcloths be discarded before they become linty , the sink should always be in good condition . If the drain pipe should become clogged , a plumber should be sent for . A strong solution of sal-soda , even of lye , may be used as long as the pipe is open and the waste running , but , when the pipe is 29 The Up-to-Date Waitress really clogged , the lye is apt to settle around the joints , injure the plumbing , and prove an obstack when the plumber is called upon to remove and clean the trap . CARE OF REFRIGERATOR A refrigerator for the special use of the waitress will be found in few houses , but if the family be large or one that entertains much , the quality of the service will more than compensate for the first outlay . The waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . A pan that needs to be emptied each day , set beneath to catch the waste , is far preferable to the dangers that lurk in a common drain pipe . The main points in the care of the average refrigerator might be summarized as below . Some of the new refrigerators are so made that they can be kept in perfect order at all times without regard to the ice supply . 1 . When anything is spilled on the shelves , wipe it up thoroughly and immediately . 2 . Once a week , when the supply of ice is low , wash the racks , shelves , and every pail of the inside in hot soda-water , rinse in boiling water , and dry the movable parts in the open 30 The Up-to-Date Waitress air . Wash out the waste pipe with soapsuds , then with hot soda-water , and finally rinse with boiling water . For the waste pipe use a cloth on a wire or rod , that the work may be thoroughly done . 3 . When every part is thoroughly aired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refrigerator is thoroughly chilled , it is ready for use . CARE OF GAS RANGE As but little or no cooking is done upon the gas range it will be a very simple matter to keep it clean . In keeping articles hot in a double boiler or similar receptacle , have the flame turned low , to avoid both the boiling over and the quick evaporation of the water . Wipe all parts of the range daily with a soft cloth and keep it dry . Occasionally it may need blacking and polishing . When alcohol lamps are used to keep water , milk , etc. , at the proper temperature , or for making tea and coffee , change the wicks occasionally . If Sternau lamps be used , fill the lamp through the central opening , and on no account light the lamp until this opening has been covered with its proper cap . // STYLES OF SERVING MEALS PERHAPS the best way to give directions for serving a meal is to present a representative menu , and tell how to get it before those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " mention is made of two distinct styles of serving meals , the English and the Russian , also of a third style , " the compromise , " which emphasizes the best points of the other two . RUSSIAN SERVICE When a meal is served after the Russian fashion , all the responsibility of supplying food to those at table falls upon the attendants . It follows , then , that , where this fashion is adopted , a full staff of trained household employees is needed , if the wants of those at table are to be properly supplied . Dinner is the meal for which this formal service is best adapted , and even at dinner it should not be carried out 32 The Up-to-Date Waitress in its entirety unless there be more than one waitress for each eight covers at table , since nothing appears upon the table save the centre-piece ( at dinner , a bonbon dish or two is allow-able ) and the articles that compose the individual covers . All food is served " from the side " ; i , e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions , to the left of those at table , for each to help himself ; or , made ready on individual plates , it is set down before each individual from the right . ENGLISH SERVICE The English style of service breathes hos-Mpitality rather than formality . It allows of per sonal attention , on the part of those sitting at the head and foot of the table , to the needs of those about them . The food is served " from the table . " The meat or fish just as it is taken from the oven or kettle , except for its garnish , is set down before the ? " head of the house , " who carves it and selects the portion desired by each . Place also is found upon the table foa one or two vegetables , which are served b ) some one at the table . Bread and butter , pickle ; and relishes , are also given a place on the table 3 ? The Up-to-Date Waitress But , save relishes , etc. , only one course appears at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise style of service is , as its name implies , a " let down " from the formality of the Russian service and a " let up " to the arduous duties expected of the head of the house at a table served after the English fashion . This style of service is largely practised at luncheons and " little dinners , " and should be the favorite style , where one has a cook proficient in giving those final touches to a dish that remove it at once from the realm of the commonplace to that of the artistic world . It is also the style of service usually employed in houses where but one or at most two maids are kept . // SERVING BREAKFAST , ENGLISH FASHION REPRESENTATIVE BREAKFAST MENU figure The Up-to-Date Waitress this cover spread the damask cloth , having the fold of the cloth exactly in the centre of the table with opposite edges of the cloth at uni-form distances from the floor . At the centre of the table place a dish of fruit , a growing plant , or cut flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place for each individual at the beginning of a meal are designated " the cover . " The plate , of breakfast size , and the cutlery are set half an inch from the edge of the table . The decora-tions of the plate should face the sitter at the table . At the right of the plate and near it lay a knife , the cutting edge towards the plate . At the right of the knife lay a dessert spoon for the cereal . On the left of the plate lay a fork of breakfast size with tines turned upward . At the point of the knife set a tumbler of water , and beside it another for milk . At the point of the fork set a small plate for bread , hot muffins , and butter , and across this lay a small knife or " spreader . " At the left of the fork lay a nap-kin , above the plate a dessert spoon , above this a fruit napkin with a finger-bowl beside it . Be-tween each two covers dispose salt and pepper sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The end of the table ( side if round ) farthest from the drawing-room door is the head of the table . The opposite end is the foot of the table . The reason is obvious , when we think that the host enters the dining-room first and the hostess leaves it first . Above the cover at the foot of the table set out the required number of coffee cups and saucers , ? a large tray often holds the whole coffee service and the dishes belonging to " the cover . " Near these dispose coffee spoons on a flat dish , the cream-jug , and a bowl of cut sugar . In front of these place , if needed , stands for hot milk and coffee . Two minutes before breakfast is announced fill the glasses with water , and set butter and cold bread upon the bread plates . Set also on the table an extra supply of these two articles . The family now being seated at table : ( t ) Set the dish of grapes before the head of the table , and lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bring in each hand a plate from the sideboard , and set one down between " the cover " and the grape dish . 37 The Up-to-Date Waitress ( 3 ) When it has been made ready , take it up and set down the second plate . ( q . ) Put the filled plate down , from the right , upon the breakfast plate of the one for whom it was made ready , and , taking another plate from the sideboard , return to the head of the table . ( s ) Take up the prepared plate and set down the other , and so continue until all have been served . When this course has been finished , take out , first , the dish of grapes , then , setting the finger-bowl upon the fruit plate , take out plate , bowl , and spoon together , one set in each hand . Now bring in the cereal in a covered dish on a tray . Set the dish down before the head of the table , a tablespoon at the right of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops of water ( condensed steam ) , ? and take it on the tray to the serving-table or pantry . Return with sugar and cream ( if these were not in place at the beginning of the meal ) , then return with a cereal dish or saucer in each hand or on a tray . Set one down between " the cover " and the cereal dish , and when it is made ready 38 The Up-to-Date Waitress ( with cream and sugar as desired ) , replace it with the second dish , and carry to him or her for whom it was prepared , setting it down at the right . Individual preferences and the time that can be given to serving and clearing away a meal have to be considered in connection with many points of table management . Many prefer that the cereal dish be presented upon a breakfast plate , and that both together be substituted for the plate in " the cover . " This calls for more dish washing ; but it has its advantages , especially when the cereal has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server may lift the dish to the tray , according to preference . The cereal course finished , the cereal dish is first removed , then the sugar and cream , and , lastly , the individual dishes , one in each hand , or two side by side on a tray . All piling of dishes is to be avoided , in any case . Now replenish the glasses with water , and pour milk for those who desire it . Set the platter of Hamburg cakes and the dish of potatoes before the head of the table . Lay a small carving knife at the right of the platter , a tablespoon beyond and nearer the platter , a carving fork at the left of the platter , and a fork at the 39 The Up-to-Date Waitress right of the potato dish . Set the dish of hot muffins on the table . Bring two warmed plates . Set down one between the meat platter and the cover . When filled , take up with the right hand , set down the plate in the left hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . Take back a plate in the left hand , and substitute it for the plate made ready to serve . Set this down before the one next in order , and in this manner serve all upon one side of the table and then those upon the other side . Pass the muffins and the bread . Supply butter , if needed . When the coffee is ready , set the cups down at the right of those for whom they are especially prepared . Pass the marmalade to the left , that those who wish it may help themselves . The marmalade may be placed on the bread-andbutter plate or on the breakfast plate . The waitress has now more opportunity to look about and see what is needed by any one ; and butter , muffins , bread , or the potato dish , may be passed to the left of those in need , that each may help himself . Keep the glasses supplied with milk and water . Luncheon and dinner are served after the same general plan . At dinner , the roast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the table , and the soup , salad , and sweet course from the opposite end of the table . The same holds good at luncheon , save that a roast is not given place in the menu . POINTS TO BE REMEMBERED IN SERVING ALL MEALS I. The room must be in order , clean , free from dust , and well aired . The temperature should be about 7o ? F. a . The linen should be immaculate , the china and glass glistening , and the silver well polished . 3 . The plate marks the centre of each cover . q .. Allow at least twenty-five inches in length ? thirty is preferable ? for an individual " cover " at table . 5 .

Knives are placed at the right , forks to the left of the plate ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tines of the forks and bowls of spoons are turned upwards . 7 . Plates , knives , forks , and spoons are set half an inch from the edge of the table , and are 41 The Up-to-Date Waitress disposed in the order of use , the first used farthest from the plate . 8 . In passing a tray to the left for a guest to help himself let the tray be held low enough to be reached with ease . 9 . When one at table is to help himself from a dish , as of vegetables , passed by the waitress , before the dish is passed the waitress puts the spoon into the dish in such a manner that a spoonful can be readily taken out . If the dish be a salad , the spoon is set in the dish at the right and the fork at the left . Io . Warm all dishes for hot foods and chill those for cold food . To warm , rinse in hot water and dry , or set into the warming oven . I I. Fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thing before announcing that meals are served . 12 . Fresh knives and forks should not be put on the table during a course , nor laid on the clean plate to be set down before one at table . POINTS TO BE REMEMBERED IN SERVING MEALS AFTER THE ENGLISH STYLE 1 . The food is served from the table . 2 . Save relishes , bread and butter , and such 42 The Up-to-Date Waitress articles as pertain alike to all courses up to the sweet course , only one course appears at a time upon the table . 3 .

See page 68. // SERVING DINNER , RUSSIAN FASHION DINNER being a formal meal , we select it as the one best adapted to illustrate the Russian manner of serving ; i. e. , from the side . This is not only the most elegant , but the simplest style of service , for the waitress , or other attendants , pass everything . When it is desired to serve dinner from the table ( English style ) , follow out the general plan given in the preceding paper for serving breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service to the required meal . Directions for serving soup from the table are given at the close of this chapter . LAYING THE DINNER-TABLE FOR RUSSIAN SERVICE Lay the table according to the directions given in preceding chapter on English service until it comes to the arranging of the " covers . " 44 The Up-to-Date Waitress For these use a plate of dinner size . Place a dinner knife at the right of the plate , cutting edge towards the plate , and beyond this , the spoon for soup . This may be a table or dessert spoon , or a round-bowled soup spoon . If raw oysters or clams are to be served , lay an oyster fork across the soup spoon , or beyond it , to the right . When canapes take the place of oysters , a small fork takes the place of the oyster fork . On the left dispose the forks in order of use , just as on the right , the utensil to be used first being farthest from the plate ; as , fork for fish , entree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to occupy the space allotted to a cover , forks for additional entrees , and the forks and spoons needed for the dessert service , are usually passed when needed . At the left of the forks lay the napkin , a roll or piece of bread between the folds but in sight . Occasionally we see a roll laid on the top of the napkin , but a partial covering with the napkin is preferable . Near the point of the dinner knife set the glass for water , and beside this the glass for Apollinaris or charged water . Or , if wine be served , the glass for water is set nearly in front of the plate , the glass for sauterne at the tip of the soup 45 The Up-to-Date Waitress spoon , and that for sherry between the three , forming a half circle . Back of these , forming a second half circle , with the sauterne glass as the first in the circle , place the glasses for champagne and Burgundy , to accompany the roast and game , respectively . Place salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each two covers . The floral decorations , and the candelabra or candlesticks , placed symmetrically upon the table , complete the laying of the table . We will suppose that the table is laid for six covers , and that the following menu is to be served by one waitress . No wine is included in the menu . REPRESENTATIVE DINNER MENU Oysters . Brown-bread Sandwiches . Consomme . Pulled Bread . Olives . Celery . Baked Turbans of Fish . Potato Diamonds with Peas . Cucumber Salad . Sweetbread-and-Mushroom Croquettes , Asparagus Tips . Roast Turkey . Cranberry Jelly . Mashed Potato . Fried Egg Plant . 46 The Up-to-Date Waitress Roman Punch . Broiled Fillets of Venison . Red Currant Jelly in Rice Cups . Chicory Salad . Macedoine of Fruit in Jelly ( Individual Moulds ) Whipped Cream . Bonbons . Salted Almonds . Coffee . With everything ready beforehand , a welltrained waitress , seconded by a cook with whom she works harmoniously , can serve this meal with ease and celerity . With a larger number of covers an extra maid in the pantry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow the waitress with the accessories of the dish she is serving ? as the pulled bread , olives , and celery served with soup ? will tend to smoother and shorter service . ANNOUNCING THE DINNER The oysters on the deep shell , lying on plates of crushed ice with a quarter of a lemon in the centre of each plate , are in place upon the service plate at each cover , and the glasses are filled with water , when the waitress , stepping to 47 The Up-to-Date Waitress the entrance of the room where the guests are assembled , says , " Dinner is served . " When all are seated , she passes the brown-bread sandwiches to the left of each in turn , beginning on the right or left of the host , at pleasure . This course finished , the plates are removed from the right , one at a time , beginning with the one first served . These plates , as are all soiled plates , are deposited in the pantry . When more than two maids are in attendance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water after the guests are seated . SERVING THE SOUP The waitress now brings in two plates of soup , one in each hand . The plate in her left hand is set down upon the serving-table , the other is set down upon the service plate of the guest sitting on the side of the host opposite the one served first with sandwiches . The second plate of soup , brought from the servingtable , is set down , from the right , before the guest next in order . Two more plates of soup are brought in as before , and this routine is repeated until all are served in order , the host being served last . The pulled bread , olives , 48 The Up-to-Date Waitress and celery are now passed upon a tray to the left of the one first served with soup , who helps herself to what she wishes . The service or place plate now comes into use as the receptacle upon which these articles are placed . At dis cretion , the bread may be passed first , and be followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SIDE AT WHICH DISHES ARE SET DOWN AND PRESENTED Note that dishes are set down and removed from the right of the individual served , and that dishes from which one is to help himself are presented at the left hand . The reason for this is obvious , when one tries to reverse the pro cedure . When presenting a dish hold it low enough to enable the guest to help himself with ease . REMOVING THE SOUP PLATES When this course is finished , step to the right of the one first served , take up the soup plate , leaving the other plate in position , and carry it to the pantry . Continue in order until all are removed . 49 The Up-to-Date Waitress SERVING THE FISH ( xst ) The fish may be served in one of two ways : First , the " turbans " may be disposed on a large platter with the sauce around it , the whole handsomely decorated , and the diamonds of potato upon another platter , neatly garnished with parsley . Carry a warm plate ( or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the right or left of the host , and continue in order ; then carry the platter of fish , on a folded napkin laid on the flat of the hand , to the right of the one first supplied with a plate . Place a turban of fish and sauce upon the plate . Repeat until all are served . Then serve the potato diamonds in the same manner . SERVING THE FISH ( 2d ) Have the fish plates prepared in the pantry , a turban of fish with sauce and diamond of potato on each . Bring two plates from the pantry ; set one upon the serving-table , and carry the other to the first individual to be served , and set it down from the right upon the place plate . Return for the second plate , and , when this is set in place , bring in two more 5o The Up-to-Date Waitress plates prepared as before , and so continue in order until all are served with this course . In ideal service , with several maids in attendance , but one plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in each hand , are brought from the pantry , set the one in the left hand on the sidetable , then transfer the one in the right hand to the left hand before setting it down before the guest . SERVING THE CUCUMBERS Bring six chilled plates of small size to the serving-table . Set one of these plates to the right of the glass of water at each cover , beginning with the guest to whom fish was first served . Then , carrying the salad bowl , with a spoon in the bowl , on a folded napkin laid on the flat of the left hand , go to the right of each guest , and dispose half a dozen slices of cucumber and a little dressing upon each plate . If any guest signifies that salad is not desired , pass quietly on . The cucumbers are eaten with the fish fork . A separate fork is not necessarily provided for a salad served with fish , roast , or game . It is always supplied for salad served as a separate 51 The Up-to-Date Waitress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time or one in each hand . SERVING THE ENTREE The entree of croquettes with asparagus tips may be disposed on individual plates , and set down with the right hand upon the service plate as the fish is taken up with the left hand . The retention of the service plate gives oppor-tunity to eat the celery or olives that may still be upon this plate . If preferred , empty plates may be set down as the fish plate is taken up ; and , when those are all in place , the croquettes , surrounded with the asparagus , may be carried to the right of each guest upon the flat of the hand , and thus be served from a large and handsomely gotten up dish . SERVING THE TURKEY AND VEGETABLES Bring in two dinner plates holding turkey . Leave one on the serving-table . Then , going to the right or left of the host ( begin the courses , alternately , on the right and left ) , take up the service plate with the croquette plate upon it and set down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service and 52 The Up-to-Date Waitress croquette plates for the dinner plate until all have been served with turkey . Bring in the dish of potato ? a spoon pressed down into it ? on the flat of the left hand , a folded napkin between the dish and hand . Go to the right of each in order , beginning with the first one served to turkey , and place a " helping " of potato on the plate . Serve the giblet sauce , egg plant , and cranberry jelly in the order given and in the same manner ; noting quickly the quietly spoken disinclination of a guest to be served to any dish . Now , if needed , pass bread or rolls to the left for each to help himself , ind fill the glasses with water . While waiting for this course to be finished , you may lay above the plate a fork or spoon for the Roman punch . As in all cases where an article is set down , not passed , set the spoons in place from the right of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than as a course by itself . When served by itself , in ideal service , the fork or spoon with which it is to be eaten , if not set in place when the table was laid , should be brought in on the tray with the glass of punch and laid upon the cloth beside the glass . 53 The Up-to-Date Waitress SERVING THE PUNCH When the main course of the dinner is finished , bring in two glasses of punch on small plates covered with doilies . Leave one on the serving-table , and carry the other to the guest at the left of the host . Use a ! tray , if spoons for the punch are brought in at this time . If the guest on the right was served first to the first course , take up the dinner plate with the left hand , and set down the punch with the right hand and from the right . Repeat until all are sere ? d . SERVING THE GAME COURSE When the punch has been disposed of , in the same manner as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host , replace the plates holding the punch glasses with plates upon which the venison and rice cups with jelly are disposed . When all are served , set small plates , one at a time , for those wishing salad . These plates may hold the salad when brought to the table or the salad may be placed upon the plates after each has been set in its proper place . When this course is finished , remove the salad plates , two side by side on a tray or one at a time without $4 The Up-to-Date Waitress the tray . Then remove the game plates , always one at a time , and in the same order in which they were brought in . With a tray take up salt and pepper boxes ; and , when these have been disposed of , return and free the table from crumbs . SERVING THE SWEET COURSE Have the moulds of jelly and fruit with cream decoration ready on individual plates . Set these , one at a time , before each guest , at the right . Bring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and take out the dessert plate . After all are provided with these , the bowl and doily being removed from the plate , pass the bonbons and nuts on a tray to the left of each , that each may help himself . The almonds may have been passed before , as they are in order at any time , when there is delay in serving a course . Bread is passed and glasses are filled with water whenever needed . Coffee in cups is now brought in and set down as usual from the right , and cream and sugar on a tray are afterwards passed to the left of each guest . When the main dish of the dessert is not shaped in individual portions , but a portion is 55 The Up-to-Date Waitress to be cut for each individual , the finger-bowls may be brought in upon the dessert plates with a doily between . These plates suffice also for the bonbons . SERVING SOUP AT DINNER , ENGLISH STYLE The directions given for serving breakfast after the English fashion can easily be modified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner , let the waitress ascertain if the family be ready for the meal . If so , give the final touches to the table , i. e. , bring in the butter and fill the glasses with water ; bring the soup plates , comfortably heated , to the servingtable , and set the soup tureen , covered , before the place designed for the hostess ; remove the cover of the tureen , ? reverse it , to avoid drops of water ( condensed steam ) , ? and take it on the tray to the side-table or pantry . Bring back two soup plates ; set one down to be supplied with soup , then take up the filled plate and set down the other . Set the plate of soup on the service plate of the one for whom it was prepared and take another plate from the side-table to set down on taking up the second filled plate , and thus continue . // SERVING LUNCHEON , COMPROMISE STYLE TABLE LINEN FOR LUNCHEON LACE-TRIMMED and elaborately embroidered tablecloths , or those that are embellished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luncheon table . But often the cloth is discarded , and a centrepiece , with individual doilies for each article to be set upon the table , are chosen . Napkins of a smaller size than the dinner napkin are preferred for this meal . Fine lace or drawn-work doilies , laid under the service plate , are quite small , affording space for the plate and one spoon ( bouillon ) or knife and fork , respectively . All other silver is set in place as needed . Occasionally plate doilies of fine crash , handsomely embroidered , are of larger size . If the cloth be lace-trimmed or ornamented with drawn work , a delicately tinted silk lining is generally used over the silence cloth , and the dishes , from preference , are served from the side . 57 The Up-to-Date Waitress STYLE OF SERVING LUNCHEONS A formal luncheon is usually served after the Russian style of service , and the directions given for serving dinner will suffice for this meal also . Family luncheons are often served in English fashion from the table ; and the directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this style . The compromise style of serving , described on page 34 , is probably the one most largely in vogue for luncheons , and it is here described in detail . On a table , without cloth , the luncheon is served satisfactorily only after the Russian fashion . figure 58 The Up-to-late Waitress Directions are given for serving the above menu up to the salad after the Russian style . Beginning with the salad , the instructions are for serving in the English manner . The combination of the two styles results in what is known as the " compromise " style of service . LAYING THE TABLE We will suppose that the cloth has been laid according to the directions previously given . A bowl of flowers stands on a centrepiece in the centre of the table . Think of the " plate line " as an imaginary line extending around the table fifteen or sixteen inches from the edge . Just inside this line set candelabra or candles , at points equidistant from each other and the centre of the table . Between these set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are served upon bits of ice , should not be placed upon the table . Now , according to the instructions previously given , set in place the following items : Service or place plates ( ten inches in diameter ) . Spoons for grape fruit . ( Set these above the plate or first in order at the right . ) Spoons for bouillon . 59 The Up-to-Date Waitress Forks for oysters ( those used for raw oysters ) . Small forks for timbales . Knives and forks for fillets of beef . Salad forks . Tumblers for water . Glasses for wine or Apollinaris . Napkins . ( Later on insert a roll or piece of bread between the folds . ) Individual butter plates . ( Supply balls of butter later on . ) ( Bread-and-butter plates , with spreaders , are less formal than the individual butter plates , and are reserved for breakfast and informal luncheons . ) THE SIDEBOARD WHEN LUNCHEON IS ANNOUNCED When luncheon is announced , the following items should be in order upon the sideboard : ? A carafe of chilled water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bits , with spoon . Extra supply of butter . Extra supply of bread . Sandwiches to serve with oysters . Olives in fancy dish . Cruets of oil and vinegar . 6o The Up-to-Date Waitress Salad fork and spoon . Ice-cream forks or spoons . Cut sugar for coffee . Finger-bowls on plates , doilies between . THE SIDE-TABLE WHEN LUNCHEON IS ANNOUNCED When luncheon is announced , the following items ( for this menu ) should be found disposed in an orderly manner upon the side-table : ? Tablespoon to serve timbales . A carving fork of small size and a tablespoon to serve the beef . After-dinner coffee spoons . A tray covered with a doily . Two or three napkins and towels for emergencies . The bouillon cups and plates for the oysters , the plates for the timbales and the fillets of beef should be in the warming oven . The plates for the salad and ices should be in the refrigerator , preferably one standing in the butler 's pantry . A second side-table , or a dinner wagon , set on castors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendants is limited . 61 The Up-to-Date Waitress THE TABLE WHEN LUNCHEON IS ANNOUNCED When luncheon is announced , the grape fruit , prepared according to directions given on page 79 , is in place on fancy plates ( a lace-paper doily between ) set upon the service plates , the tumblers are filled to two thirds their height with water or bits of ice and water , and each individual dish is supplied with butter . At a very formal luncheon or dinner the butter is omitted . REMOVING THE GRAPE-FRUIT COURSE Beginning at the right of the hostess , remove the grape-fruit plates from the right . Remove them , one at a time , or one in each hand , to the pantry . Leave the service plate in position . SERVING THE BOUILLON Now bring in the bouillon cups and saucers , one at a time , one in each hand or two ( no more ) on a tray , borne on the flat of the hand , a napkin between , as is most expedient under the circumstances , and set them upon the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tray to the left , that each may help herself . Remove the cups and saucers from the right , still leaving the service plates in place . In removing soiled plates , begin with the individual first served . SERVING AND CLEARING AWAY THE OYSTERS Alternate the service , and begin with the guest at the left of the hostess . Set down upon the service plates , from the right , the plates of oysters cooked in the shell . Pass the plate of sandwiches to the left of each , beginning with the one first served to oysters . Remove these plates as before , again leaving the service plates in place . SERVING THE TIMBALES The timbales may he disposed , in the pantry or kitchen , upon individual plates or upon one large platter . In the first case , set the individual plates upon the service plate , as before . In the second case , dispose the hot plates for the timbales upon the side-table , then , taking one 63 The Up-to-Date Waitress in each hand , set them down upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the platter of timbales , take the tablespoon from the side-table , and put it on the platter , then , carrying the platter upon a folded napkin laid upon the flat of the left hand , pass to the right of each , and serve the timbales , or pass to the left , and let each one help herself . When the waitress serves the timbales , there need be no break in the conversation . She also usually understands how to handle them better than does the guest . Pass bread to the left of those needing it . Refill tumblers with water . Remove the timbale plates from the right , leaving the service plate . SERVING THE FILLETS OF BEEF AND POTATOES Bring to the side-table the hot plates for the fillets of beef , then , taking a plate in the left hand and commencing on the left of the hostess , take up the service plate and set the hot plate in its place . When all are thus provided with hot plates , bring in the fillets of beef with sauce on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spoon 64 The Up-to-Date Waitress upon the dish , and , passing to the right of each , serve the fillets . Return to the pantry for the dish of potatoes , and serve these in the same manner . This dish , being smaller than the platter of meat , if preferred , may be carried on the tray . Thus far the meal has been served after the Russian fashion . From now on , through the meal , the English fashion will be followed . SERVING THE SALAD Set a silver or china tray before the hostess . Upon this set a bowl of lettuce , carefully washed and dried , the salad fork and spoon , bottles of oil and vinegar , a dish of salt , and another of paprika . While the salad is being dressed , bring in the cold salad plates . Take one in each hand , set one down before the hostess , and , when a portion of salad has been placed upon it , take this up and set down the other plate . Place the plate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now take another plate from the sideboard , take up the second prepared plate , replacing it with the one in the other hand , and set it before the second in order . When all are served , bring in the // The Up-to-Date Waitress cheese balls , on a plate covered with a paper doily , and the pulled bread , together on the tray , and pass to the left , that each may help herself . When this course is finished , remove the salad tray , and salt and pepper cups or shakers that may be upon the table , then one at a time , or one in each hand , the salad plates . SERVING THE SWEET COURSE Remove the crumbs . Use a plate and napkin for a bare table , and the pan and knife for a draped table . Set the dish of parfait before the hostess , with the slicer at the right . Return to the sideboard for two plates put one before the hostess , and , when she has disposed the ice upon it , replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cream before the guest at the left of the hostess . Repeat until all are served . Pass the plate of cake to the left , that each may help herself . Remove these plates , one in each hand . Bring in the finger-bowls on fancy plates , with doilies between , one in each hand . Set these down from the right . Pass the bonbons to the left , that each may help herself . The bonbons being eaten , take out these plates , one in each 66 The Up-to-Date Waitress hand , and bring in two coffee cups on a tray . Set these down from the right . When all are served , return with sugar and cream or sugar alone , on the tray , and pass to the left , that those who wish may help themselves . COFFEE SERVED IN LIBRARY The coffee is often served in the library or reception-room . The waitress may bring it in , in after-dinner cups on a tray , and return for the sugar ; or the after-dinner coffee service ? coffee pot with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought in on a larger tray , and set down on a table , at which the hostess seats herself to pour the coffee . The maid passes the cups on a tray , and afterwards passes the sugar . She remains to gather up the cups and remove all traces of the service . CREME DE MENTHE SERVED IN LIBRARY At a luncheon party , when coffee is served at the table , creme de menthe is occasionally passed after the guests are seated in the library . Tiny cordial glasses are partially filled with fineshaved ice and over this is poured a tablespoon-67 The Up-to-Date Waitress ful of sugar syrup mixed with creme de menthe cordial . These are set on very small doily-covered plates , an after-dinner coffee spoon beside each glass . The plates are passed , two at a time , on a tray . In English and compromise style of service the waitress stands at the left of the host or hostess when setting down a plate or taking up a plate , or when receiving upon a tray a plate or other article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) or the waitress set the plate or cup ( coffee or tea ) made ready for serving upon the tray is a matter to be decided by each individual host . We are however inclined to think that it should be done by the waitress . When no tray is used the waitress lifts the plate . Why change because a small tray is in one hand ? // SERVING AFTERNOON TEA IN most houses , where a butler or parlor maid is employed , and in many houses where a cook and waitress make up the staff of employees , afternoon tea is a simple and every-day occurrence . Occasionally no one outside the family may happen in , but tea is served just the same . Tiny sweet wafers or cakes or plain bread-andbutter sandwiches with tea are usually all that is provided at this hour ; still there are hostesses who vary the items from day to day , or occasionally . Ilot bouillon with bread sticks or buttered rolls , hot toasted muffins or cassava cakes , nut , cress , or fanciful , sweet sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served in some houses . The cook assists in the preparation of some of these articles , but the waitress , no butler being employed , is responsible for the freshness of the tea , the temperature of the bouillon , tea , and hot muffins. 69 The Up-to-Date Waitress For carrying out the hospitality expressed in this custom , a nest of tea-tables and a " curate " or English basket-tray are of great convenience . These articles are very light and sometimes exceptionally pretty ; the tables are often of highly polished mahogany and inlaid with pearl . The basket-tray ( " curate " ) consists of a tripod to which three hoops are fastened one above another , and some distance apart ; into each of the hoops is set a plate holding the articles to be served . The framework is of mahogany , bamboo , or other light wood , and the whole is carried about the room by a handle at the top . The other accessories to afternoon tea are : i . Tea cloths for the tables . 2 . Small fringed napkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cake trays or baskets . 4 . A small tray covered with a doily for the waitress . S. A tray holding two or three small tea cups and saucers , teaspoons of small size , small sugar bowl with sugar and tongs , small cream pitcher of cream , and a pretty dish holding thin slices of lemon . 6 . A teapot of fresh-made tea , or a tea-7o The Up-to-Date Waitress pot of boiling water , a tea caddy with tea , spoon for the caddy , a silver tea ball or a china percolater , and a teakettle filled with fresh boiling water . 7 . A bouillon urn. 8 . Bouillon cups . g . Bouillon spoons . Shortly after three o'clock the ever prompt waitress has the tea-tray with its glistening china and silver and the basket-tray of edibles in readiness ; the teakettle is singing over the lowturned jet of the gas range and the waitress herself is in immaculate trim from the tiny cap on her neatly brushed hair to the soft-soled shoes on her feet . She may or may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this depends upon the number of employees . After the hostess has greeted one or more guests , the waitress sets a pot of tea to brew , noiselessly brings in one of the larger tables from the " nest , " and sets it in an inconspicuous place in the drawing-room . Upon this she disposes such articles as will crowd the table of her mistress . Here also she sets the bouillon urn , with cups and spoons , when bouillon is pro-71 The Up-to-Date Waitress vided . The outer and handsomest table of the nest she now sets before the hostess , spreads a cloth over it , and brings in the tea-tray to set down upon it . She now returns for the pot of tea , which was set to brew , and her tray . After a cup of tea is poured she passes it on her tray , with two or three napkins beside the cup , to the one for whom it is prepared , then brings in the basket-tray of edibles , and passes this and other cups of tea or bouillon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookout and removes cups or replenishes them with tea as is needed . Or , she passes cream and sugar or slices of lemon , takes out the spent teapot , and brings in a fresh supply of tea or slices of lemon , etc . All this sounds arduous , but in reality , in houses where the maids are limited in number the callers of an afternoon are not numerically strong , and a sister , daughter , or friend of the hostess is usually present to help out . // PREPARING AND SERVING BUTTER BUTTER is served at breakfast , luncheon , and supper , but not at a formal dinner . If the luncheon take the form of a formal luncheon party , the small butter plate is thought preferable to the bread-and-butter plate , which is more Bohemian in character . Often neither appears . At a formal dinner , the menu of which abounds in rich sauces , butter is regarded as a superfluity , since each dish is supposed to be perfect as it is , or with the accessories provided as accompaniment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom sauces are not desired , are given a place at table , butter should be in readiness for use on the sideboard . The sideboard , rather than the serving or side table , seems to be the natural place for the disposition of this article , as here hot dishes , the vicinity of which would be prejudicial to the appearance of butter , do not appear . 73 The Up-to-Date Waitress The appearance of the butter and the temperature at which it is served may seem very trifling matters , perhaps ; but it is in the painstaking attention to just such little details as these that the true capability of a waitress is manifested . Occasionally there are homes to which table butter is sent that has been worked at the time of churning into tiny half-ounce cakes , just large enough for a single service . By this means , if the butter be carefully manipulated during the washing and salting , the original , granular consistency of the substance is retained . This consistency is always looked for by those who are conversant with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for table use is sent to the house in a firkin or box , ? as is usually the case , ? then the waitress needs to exercise great care in " working over " the butter , to manipulate it as little as possible , that the desirable texture be not lost . Let her remember to handle it just as little as possible , and never with anything but properly prepared wooden utensils reserved for this purpose . As some little time is required to get the nee-74 The Up-to-Date Waitress essary spoon , bowl , butter hands , and moulds in suitable condition to use , it will be well to take some favorable opportunity , and make a business of preparing , at one time , the butter for several days . It should then be set away , carefully covered , in the compartment of the refrigerator that is reserved for butter , cream , and milk . TO SHAPE BUTTER First of all put the moulds , butter hands , or whatever articles are to be used , into a wooden bowl filled with boiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replenishing the water as needed , to keep the same at a high temperature . Then empty the bowl of water , and refill with cold water , adding ice at the last , if the weather be warm . When the utensils are thoroughly chilled , put the butter into the bowl of cold water , and with the spoon work it , until it be of a consistency to shape , but not a moment longer . To shape into balls , cut off a level tablespoonful , and roll between the butter hands and drop on to a cold plate , keeping each ball separate . Chill before piling into a butter dish . Be careful to dip the moulds , paddles , or 75 The Up-to-Date Waitress " hands " into the cold water after each shaping of butter . At those meals where butter is served , two minutes before announcing the meal , with a silver pick put a butter ball on each plate , and set a dish with a reserve supply and a butter pick upon the sideboard . Butter dishes are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this arrangement , when a second serving is required , the waitress needs to take care to drain the water from the melting ice before the dish is passed . Individual moulds , also moulds to shape a half or quarter pound of butter , are shown in the illustration . The manner of use is the same in both cases . Invert the mould , and let the stamp drop to the bottom of the mould . Then fill the mould with butter , turn it over , and with the stamp press out the butter on to a chilled plate . Let the butter chill thoroughly before using . A quarter or half pound cake of butter is served with a knife . The waitress may cut and serve , the butter dish resting meanwhile on a tray , or she may pass it to the left of the person to be served , who may then cut the butter and place it upon the special plate pro-76 The Up-to-Date Waitress vided for this purpose . A dish of butter may be garnished with two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two of cress or parsley , or with nasturtium leaves and blossoms . // PREPARING AND SERVING FRESH FRUIT THE preparation of uncooked fruit for the table is usually classed with the duties of a butler , and thus is one of the things which a waitress is liable to be called upon to do . Certainly it is dainty work , in which she can take much pleasure . A few leaves inserted here and there between the fruit placed on the breakfast-table give an artistic touch that will be appreciated . Peach , apple , pear , cherry , strawberry , currant , and grape leaves can often be procured for use with these respective fruits . The leaves of the mountain laurel or of rhododendrons will keep for weeks in water that is changed daily , and their glossy surface improves the looks of any dish of fruit , but especially that of oranges and bananas . Choice strawberries that do not require washing , but simply a gentle wiping with a soft brush , should be left unhulled . Small fruits and berries 78 The Up-to-Date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if on hand the night before , for service at breakfast , should be kept in a large open dish , that fresh air may circulate about the fruit . To prepare berries for the table , handle as lightly as possible . While looking them over , do not hold two or three in the hand at one time . Look at each one singly and set it aside . To free from sand , let water from the faucet run through the berries in a colander ; let stand to drain , and serve at once . Wash all varieties of berries after hulling or looking over ; they can not be handled after being wet . Finger-bowls are passed after a service of fruit . PREPARING GRAPE FRUIT For Breakfast Cut the grape fruit in halves across the grain , to form two portions . With a thin , sharppointed knife , ? a penknife is the best , ? cut around the pulp in each little section of the fruit , so that each triangular section of pulp can be freed from the surrounding membrane and lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the membrane , separating the sections and 79 The Up-to-Date Waitress the core from the skin , and remove all the membrane and core in one piece . Set the halves of fruit on plates with a small lace-paper doily between the fruit and plate . A spoonful of powdered sugar and sherry wine or Jamaica rum , or the sugar alone , is disposed in the centre , or , no addition is made to the fruit , according to the taste of those served . GRAPE FRUIT , WITH MACEDOINE OF FRUITS For a First Course at Luncheon Prepare the grape fruit as for serving at breakfast , then for each half of grape fruit have ready about a tablespoonful of prepared fruit . A mixture of pineapple , fresh or canned , orange , and maraschino cherries is good . Brandied peaches may be used , when at hand , as also fresh white grapes , seeded and skinned . Mix the fruit , cut in small pieces , with liquid from the cherry bottle , sugar , or sugar syrup , and use to fill the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quarters . For a change , omit the macedoine , and , just at serving , put a tablespoonful of sifted powdered sugar in the centre of each half fruit , and decorate 8o The Up-to-Date Waitress with pieces of cherry , as before . Grape fruit is also used as a salad with lettuce and French dressing . SALPICON OF FRUIT , WALDORFASTORIA STYLE Make such a selection of fruits as is desired . Triangular pieces of pulp cut from halves of grape fruit , maraschino cherries , bits of pine-apple , fresh strawberries cut in halves , brandied peaches cut in pieces , orange pulp , and slices of banana afford a choice . Chill thoroughly , then sprinkle lightly with sugar , and dispose in champagne glasses , set in larger glasses ( on tall stems ) filled with shaved ice . Serve as a first course at dinner or luncheon . These furnish a particularly pretty table decoration . The pulp and juice of grape fruit daintily taken from the shell , that each piece may be in perfect shape , are often served in sherbet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a first course at luncheon or dinner . For variation a tablespoonful of sherry or two mar aschino cherries with a little of the syrup from the cherry bottle may be added . The Up-to-Date Waitress SERVING WATERMELON WITHOUT RIND Let the melon stand on ice several hours before serving ; have the plates chilled also . Secure a section about four inches thick from the centre of the melon by cutting off from both ends . To serve more than eight , cut the melon , to give two sections of this thickness ; cut these sections , to leave the green portion in one piece and the edible portion ? a round of pink melon pulp ? in another . Place the edible portion on a dish of ample size . To serve this , cut it in triangles in the same manner as a pie . OTHER WAYS OF SERVING WATERMELON Cut the melon in halves , crosswise . If it is to be served from the table , trim , if needed , that the half melon may stand firm on the plate , and dispose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a tablespoon scoop out the pulp in egg-shaped pieces . Or , cut the melon in halves lengthwise . Scoop out the pulp from both halves in egg-shaped pieces , and use to fill one half the melon-rind . Garnish the plate with green leaves . The pink pulp of the chilled melon may also be taken out with a French 82 The Up-to-Date Waitress potato-ball scoop in the shape of balls . Serve these in sherbet cups . Melon should always be thoroughly chilled . SERVING MUSKMELONS Have the melons thoroughly chilled . Wash the outside , wipe dry , cut in halves , and remove the seeds and stringy portion . Set the half melons on small plates covered with paper doilies . Pass sugar , salt , pepper , or cinnamon , as is desired . Bits of ice are occasionally placed in the hollow centre of the melon , but these are in the way during eating , and also detract from the flavor of the melon. // PREPARING RAW OYSTERS AND CLAMS ON SHELLS OR IN COCKTAILS SCRUB the shells thoroughly , using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there be a " handy " man around the house , induce him to open the shells for you ; in an emergency you can do it yourself . Push a thin flat knife under the flat upper shell , cut the adductor muscle that holds the shells together , and take off the upper shell ; with a soft bit of clean cloth wipe off any sand on the edge of the shell ; clean the upper shells if needed , and put them back in place , or set the oysters in a pan , and cover this , to keep the oysters from drying off on top . Let them chill on ice . Make ready shaved ice to fill the requisite number of plates . Just before announcing dinner , put ice on the oyster plates , fit five or six of the deep shells on each plate of ice , and put a quarter of a lemon or a cocktail 84 . The Up-to-Date Waitress glass with cocktail liquid in the centre of the plate . Set in place and announce the dinner . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated . If the waitress be serving the dinner without assistants , the oysters should be in place when dinner is announced , or some of the guests will have to wait too long for the brown-bread sandwiches and pepper and salt to complete the dish . Little-neck clams are prepared in the same way . COCKTAIL MIXTURE FOR RAW OYSTERS OR CLAMS Mix one teaspoonful of grated horseradish , six or eight drops of tabasco sauce , half a tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce , a tablespoonful of tomato catsup , one fourth a teaspoonful of salt , and the juice of half a lemon . This mixture may be poured over the oysters in the cocktail glass , or the oysters on the deep shell may be taken up with the fork and dipped into the mixture turned into cocktail glasses set in the centre of the oyster plate . In the illustration two styles of cocktail sets are shown ; in one the outer dish holds the sandwiches , the middle dish , crushed ice and the cocktail cup itself . 85 The Up-to-Date Waitress Either of these sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mixture given above is for four cocktails or services . The proportions of the various ingredients are subject to variations , to suit different tastes . FRESH MUSHROOM COCKTAIL Allow six fresh mushroom caps ( about an inch and a quarter in diameter ) for each service . Peel the caps and let simmer in boiling broth about fifteen , minutes . Season and chill . Set cocktail glasses , each containing three or four tablespoonfuls of choice tomato catsup , on small plates ; on each dispose three or four heart leaves of lettuce , a mushroom on each leaf , and one on the catsup . Serve as an appetizer at luncheon or dinner . Three or four crackers or small bread-and-butter sandwiches , on a separate plate , should be set at the upper right hand of each cover . Salt , paprika , horseradish or lemon juice may be added to the catsup . With an oyster fork the mushrooms and lettuce are dipped in the catsup and eaten . Choice pieces of fish , lobster , crabflakes or shrimp may replace the mushrooms . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her profession there is no one subject on which a waitress needs to perfect herself with more care than that which relates to the cleansing and care of salad plants , the making of salad dressing , and the dressing of salads . The mixing of a mayonnaise dressing is a mechanical operation , and should be mastered at the first trial . A perfect emulsion of oil and acid is to be secured by means of egg yolks . The old way of mixing the ingredients with the eggs ? the addition of the oil to the egg , drop by drop , was tedious , and without great care it often resulted in failure . By the new method , given in this chapter , success is assured , and the process is materially shortened . Formerly no acid was used until considerable oil , added drop by drop , had been beaten into the condiments and egg yolks ; by 87 The Up-to-Date Waitress the new method all the acid to be used is first stirred into the well-beaten yolks and condiments ; then into this larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaspoonful , and later on by the tablespoonful . A Dover eggbeater of small size ( tumbler beater ) is used at first , but after a little while the beater of ordinary size works to better advantage . CRISPNESS AND CLEANLINESS FIRST ESSENTIALS Plants eaten uncooked , as celery , endive , and lettuce , are not easily penetrated by the digestive fluids unless they be fresh and crisp . A wilted salad plant is most unwholesome . Vigorous and healthy plants are often infested with tiny insects of the same color as the plant itself , and only the most exact and painstaking care will remove them from the tender leaves . A hasty plunge in cold water is not enough . Each several leaf needs careful attention and examination . If salad plants can not be made crisp , or if doubt as to their absolute cleanliness exists , discard them . Lettuce and celery may be freshened by setting them in ice-water. 88 The Up-to-Date Waitress CLEANSING AND PREPARATION OF LETTUCE , TOMATOES , CELERY , ETC . Lettuce 1 . Cut off the root and coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singly by rinsing up and down in cold water , changing the water often . 3 . Let the leaves , if wilted , stand in cold water to freshen . 4 . Shake them in a wire basket , a colander , or a cheese-cloth hag. 5 . Set them aside in a cold place until nearly time to serve . 6 . Wipe each leaf , without bruising or crushing , with a soft cloth . 7 . Mix with dressing and send at once to the table . Peel tomatoes , cut out the hard centres round the stems , and set them near the ice , to become chilled . Cleansing and Preparation of Celery The best celery heads are not fastened together with nails , but are tied with straw . This leaves the roots in good condition for serving . 89 The Up-to-Date Waitress The roots are tender , and , though close-grained , are free from coarse fibres . When dressed " clubhouse fashion , " the root is retained . To dress celery in this style , remove the coarse outer stalks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly fibrous down to the more solid portion , and trim the root neatly , discarding the outside discolored by exposure to the air . Cut through the centre of the head and the root . If the halves are large , cut each in the centre , thus dividing the whole head into quarters . Wash in plenty of cold water , holding lengthwise under the faucet when convenient . Crisp in the same manner as lettuce , drain , and wipe dry . When the root is not served , cut it off close to the stalks , separate the stalks carefully , wash , crisp , and dry as before . When salad plants are brought from the market , keep from the air in a closed vessel or tightly wrapped in paper . To avoid a rusty appearance , ? especially in the case of celery , ? postpone the use of water until a short time before serving . Though celery served as an appetizer or in salads be carefully trimmed , the remnants should not be regarded as waste . All sound leaves and stalks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up-to-Date Waitress PREPARATION OF COOKED MEAT , VEGETABLES , ETC . I. Cut cooked meat , freed from fat and gristle , and vegetables into pieces of uniform size and shape . Season with French dressing and set aside to become " marinated " and chilled . Drain ( to avoid liquifying the mayonnaise ) and mix with mayonnaise dressing , then dispose on a bed of green vegetables or otherwise . Salads are very good or very bad . There is no half-way ground in this matter . It is im-possible to set down the exact proportions and quantities of oil , acid , and condiments needed to dress any salad , nor is it possible to prescribe an exact method of mixing the various ingredients . A " pianissimo touch " of onion is a grateful addition to most salads , and is a positive neces-sity in some salads , as those made of cooked beans and potatoes . Cold potatoes swimming in oil are far from palatable or hygienic , and such a combination can lay no claim to the name of salad . Potatoes , without flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they can be made a medium gI The Up-to-Date Waitress of carrying other flavors . Onion is as necessary to a successful potato salad as is oil and acid , nor must salt be lacking . Potatoes have an affinity for salt and onion , and oil also , judging by the quantity they can be made to take up . Coarse pieces of crude , uncooked onion or cruder garlic will not do . For a small quantity of salad , rubbing over the bowl with the crushed half of a clove of garlic will give flavor enough to inoculate the whole . A slight grating of mild Spanish onion or a tablespoonful or two of fine-chopped chives will also prove quite sufficient . But think not to make a satisfactory potato salad without calling into requisition some member of this useful family . We speak of " tossing up " a salad . This would seem to indicate that a salad is put together quickly ; but there are salads and salads , and the time to be expended on the mixing of them must be gauged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a mental picture , and palate picture as well , of what the finished product should be , the salad can not fail to be other than disappointing . Of course , one may have moments of inspiration , when the understanding is so quickened that a salad of unsur-92 The Up-to-Date Waitress passed merit is evolved . Still , every-day , prosaic people can not trust to inspiration , but need to consider and weigh with care the composition and qualities of the articles to be dressed . Potato needs to be turned over and over again in the dressing , until one 's stock of patience is wellnigh exhausted . Then , and not till then , may it be set aside to become thoroughly impregnated with the seasonings and oil , ? " to ripen , " as it were . Not after the same fashion can we treat the ingredients of a celery and apple salad . By long standing in the dressing the celery wilts , which , to be at its best , must not have parted with its pristine crispness . Nor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equal bulk of potato ; yet it needs to be dressed ? " fatigued , " the French say ? with care and discrimination . A judicious pressure must be brought to bear upon its unabsorbent texture , to force it to take up a modicum of those elements which it lacks , to make a complete dish . Often the more clinging nature of the sauce mayonnaise commends it to favor , when celery is to be dressed for other than a dinner salad . 93 figure Mix the salt and pepper with the oil ; beat in the vinegar gradually , beating until an emulsion is formed . Then pour the dressing over the prepared materials , and turn them over and over until the dressing has been evenly mixed throughout . No dressing should remain in the bottom of the bowl , but the leaves or other articles dressed should be glossy with oil . If they look dry , mix more dressing , and add in the same manner as before . The quantity of acid used depends upon the article dressed and the dish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be indicated if the salad is to be served with a rich oily roast , as pork or turkey , than with game , which is proverbially dry and lean . " Three or four half-inch squares of bread may be placed in the bottom of the salad bowl to absorb any surplus dressing . 94 The Up-to-Date Waitress figure Mix the salt and paprika , and add the yolks of egg , which should be fresh ; beat until the yolks are well thickened , then gradually beat in the lemon juice and vinegar . Put a Dover eggbeater into the mixture and beat in the oil a teaspoonful at a time ; beat thoroughly between each addition of oil . Add more seasoning if needed , cover with an earthen dish , and let stand in a cool place until time of serving . If sugar or mustard , one or both , be desired , add to the salt and pepper . For other recipes of salad dressings , see " Practical Cooking and Serving " and " Salads , Sandwiches , and Chafing-Dish Dainties " by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salad in a meal , note its nature and why it is served . Fish 95 The Up-to-Date Waitress served with rich sauces needs a mild acid and a dilutant , to tone down the richness . The same is true with the roast and game . Then a crisp , succulent vegetable with the simple French dressing would render the fish and meat course complete , and a rich heavy salad would be quite out of place . For esthetic reasons cucumbers or tomatoes , preferably cucumbers , are the choice with fish , while cress , celery , endive , escarole , chicory , or one of the varieties of lettuce , or celery , or cress , with apple , orange , or pineapple , is to be preferred with the roast or game . A mayonnaise of cauliflower , tomatoes , or asparagus is often served as an entree or a course by itself . A cucumber salad with the fish course does not preclude the serving of a second salad ; but after serving a salad with game no salad , as a fruit salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayonnaise dressing accompanies wild duck and birds with dark flesh . Lettuce , or lettuce and tomatoes with French dressing , are preferred with quail , broiled chicken , or game with light meat ; while cabbage with mayonnaise dressing to which whipped cream has been added is the choice when oysters are served . 96 The Up-to-Pate Waitress THREE NOVEL SALADS Tomato Salad , Du Barry Style Peel a tomato for each person to be served . Cut out a piece around the stem of each , and scoop out a portion of the pulp . Sprinkle inside with salt , and set upside down in the refrigerator . When ready to serve , fill the open spaces with cold , cooked cauliflower and set on heart leaves of lettuce . Put a spoonful of mayonnaise on each , and serve at once . tomato Salad , Poinsettia Style Select round , smooth tomatoes . Take one in the hand , keeping the stem end down . A close examination will show light lines running underneath the skin from the centre outwards . These separate the tomato into sections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along these lines from the centre to about an inch from the stem end , then cut through the pulp underneath to the depth of one fourth an inch . With a sharp-pointed French knife peel each section of skin from the pulp below , then lift the pulp in triangular sections about one 97 The Up-to-Date Waitress fourth an inch thick . These , if cut properly , will be of the same shape and size as the sections of skin , and each will form a circle resembling the petals of a flower . Let chill thoroughly in the refrigerator . Then , when ready to serve , cut out the hard centre at the stem end without injury to the shape of the flower . Season with salt and pepper ; fill the open space beneath with mayonnaise , and set the tomato on an individual plate . Put heart leaves of lettuce around the outer row of petals , bending them over the lettuce . Turn back the second row of petals , and fill the centre with mayonnaise .

Mix very thoroughly , turning the potato over and over and adding more oil , if needed , to make each piece of potato glisten with oil . Shake in a 98 The Up-to-Date Waitress teaspoonful of salt and a dash or two of paprika , while mixing in the oil . Then add three or four tablespoonfuls of vinegar , one tablespoonful at a time , mixing in each before the next is added . Rub the salad bowl with the cut side of a clove of garlic .

Bottled waters , also boiled or distilled water stored in tightly corked bottles , are easily chilled when placed in contact with ice . To avoid waste of ice , boiled water should stand until cool before storing in a refrigerator . When ice is used , it should be broken in small pieces no larger than a hickory nut . A perforated bowl set in a deep plate holds the ice while the dinner is in progress . This is set upon the sideboard . In serving the meal after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three people at table . These stand between the covers , near the plate line . With one maid let the glasses be filled before the too The Up-.to-Date Waitress family or guests are seated , then , as they need replenishing , the maid will bring the ice bowl and plate with a spoon on a tray ( if water has dripped through into the plate , empty this into a dish kept on the sideboard for the purpose ) , and put ice into the glasses without removing them from the table . Then one wishing water helps himself from the carafe . Small tumbler plates are provided , ? the imported ones are often very quaint , ? which keep the moisture on the outside of the glass from the tablecloth . With many attendants and Russian service the tumblers are not filled until after the guests are seated . Then the oysters are set in place by one attendant , another follows with the sandwiches , pepper , etc. , on a tray , and a third follows with the ice bowl and carafe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A waitress who is fond of flowers will certainly enjoy arranging them for the table or house and be glad when this duty is relegated to her . A table laid and served after the English fashion admits of little space for floral decoration . Indeed , unless the table be at least five IOI The Up-to-Date Waitress feet in diameter or breadth , space is not possible for more than a single branch of blossoms , or perhaps two or three stalks , as of iris , in a tall slender vase . A small pot of ferns in a low fern dish can not be used conveniently on a table less than five feet in diameter . When the meals are served Russian fashion , the table top may be divided between " the covers " and the floral decorations ; thus , after sixteen or seventeen inches are reserved for " the covers , " the whole centre , large or small , may be used for decorative purposes . The simplest device for a round table consists of ferns radiating from a bowl in which are massed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers may be wired and pushed down into moist sand , or , with a greater abundance , they may stand in water . Stems of grain in variety , as wheat , oats , etc. , combine well with autumn fruits for autumn dinners . Indian corn in varied colors , hop vines , clematis after seeding , blackberry and sumac leaves , after turning in the fall , scarlet dogwood berries , and branches of chestnut burrs are all available in late summer or early fall , in country places ; but these are too heavy to use in profusion except on a gala IO2 The Up-to-Date Waitress occasion . Ground pine , holly , mistletoe , partridge-berry vines , and poinsettias find place in decorating a table at the Christmas holidays , while apple and other fruit blossoms , tulips , and primroses in early spring , are succeeded by sweet peas and roses in June , and poppies with grasses or grain in July . Let each flower used look as if growing ; select the utensil which is to hold it , or the method in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view . For daily use a few flowers carefully arranged are preferable to a mass of blooms no matter how tastefully handled . CARE OF CUT FLOWERS Flowers may be kept for some special occasion in a refrigerator , but they do not retain their beauty long after such treatment . The water in which flowers are kept should be renewed twice a day , or at least once each day . Cutting off an inch from the stems is probably of advantage . ATTENDANCE AT STREET DOOR The well-trained waitress is prompt to answer calls at the door . In the early morning a fresh 103 The Up-to-Date Waitress apron may occasionally be needed , in order that she may be immaculate , but this should be in readiness beforehand , that it may be quickly donned and no one kept waiting .

Bread for dinner is cut in thick slices ; if the loaf be square the slices are divided into two or four pieces . The pieces should be about three by four inches . Slices cut from a French loaf are not divided . The crust is not removed . Bread for sandwiches is cut as for breakfast . For picnic basket or box for traveling , fanciful shapes are not desirable . As novelties in the IO5 The Up-to-Date Waitress service of bread we give ribbon bread and cassava cakes . RIBBON BREAD ( To serve with oysters , salads , or at five o'clock tea or a card party ) Cut Boston brown bread and white bread into slices of uniform thickness .

Use in all five or six slices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crusts , and slice as ordinary bread . TOASTED CASSAVA BREAD Spread the cakes light with butter on both sides , then toast as bread . When delicately browned , serve at once in the folds of a hot napkin . These cakes are particularly appropriate for afternoon tea . They sell for about twentyfive cents per box . A box contains two dozen cakes . At the close of a dinner or luncheon , cassava cakes may be served with cheese . Prepare as above , or spread with butter and grated Io6 The Up-to-Date Waitress cheese , and set into a hot oven long enough to melt the cheese . CUTTING COLD MEAT Cut cold meat across the grain . Make the slices no thicker than is needed to hold the fibres together . Retain a narrow edge of fat on slices of roast beef , baked or boiled ham , and baked fresh pork . All cold joints and fowls are sliced in the same manner as they would be carved if hot . SERVICE OF CHEESE Cheese is served before the sweet dish with a salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To prepare an Edam or pineapple cheese for the table , cut off the top neatly , retain this to fit tightly back in place when set aside , to keep the cheese from drying . Wrap the cheese in a napkin , or at least set it into a folded napkin that comes up around the cheese . " hhe outside of a cheese , especially in warm weather , is liable to be oily , but when partially covered with a napkin one may help himself to cheese without soiling the fingers . At the first service of a whole cheese , 107 The Up-to-Date Waitress the silver scoop can not be set into the cheese ; lay it on the tray in front of the cheese with the handle towards the hand of the one served . American dairy cheese is usually cut in small , uniform pieces and served upon a plate covered with a lace paper .

If desired , half a cup of cream , beaten solid with one fourth a teaspoonful of salt , may be mixed with the cheese before it is pressed through the ricer .

Rather , on the contrary , is it the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of this art by all women who take up the calling of a waitress . To be appetizing , meat needs to be cut in thin , even slices . A thick , ragged-looking section of underdone beef , set before one who chooses well-cooked viands in small portions , will take away all pleasure from a meal . If we had not seen joints otherwise served , we should think it needless to say that meat should be carved across the grain rather than with it 109
