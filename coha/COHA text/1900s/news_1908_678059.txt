txt The citizens of four counties who for two weeks have been trying with increasing eagerness to capture two desperate young men whom they accuse of attacking two little girls , burning down one house , and destroying the furniture of another , and with other offenses due to mere malice , believe to-night that they have located the young men in the home of their sister , at Ridgefield , Conn. , just over the New York State line . They now hope to have the young men in their hands before Monday night . It is possible that the prospective punishment of the law will be anticipated if the posses , of which there are four , lay hands on the suspects . The men wanted are Stamford and Daniel Lockwood. 23 and 20 years old respectively .

There are quite a number of vacant houses in the neighborhood of North Salem , both in New York State and in Connecticut . The searchers believed that the Lockwoods were hiding in these houses . The hunt for the Lockwoods was redoubled last Monday . Two young men , believed to have been the Lockwoods , seized the eleven-year-old daughter of William Cunningham wane she was on her way to school . They dragged her into a vacant lot , nut were frightened away by the sounds of some one approaching before they had done the child any harm . Then the countryside flared up . But the next day two young men seized ten-yearold Annie Regan while she was going to school , blindfolded her , and dragged her into a vacant house on the C. W. Nichols place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , too . Putnam. and Westchester Counties , in ? New York , and Fairfield and Ridgefield Counties , - ia , Connecticut , - then-  sent-men day after day to ' take part in : the hunt for the two Lockwood boys . The Sheriffs and Deputy Sheriffs of those counties joined in the - chase . The searchers got traces of the Lockwoods one day at this old , vacant house . The next day they would hear of them at another . On Friday night an unoccupied house on the place of Dr. S. L. White , north of here , was burned down . The Lockwood boys were reported to have been seen in the house . The posses hurried thither on Saturday , this time with two bloodhounds to help in the chase . The dogs had been furnished by Dr. Louis G. Knox of the Imperial Bloodhound Kennels , at Danbury . Conn. , at the instance of W. It Finch , a well-to-do farmer , who is among the leaders in the chase . The two hounds took up the trail at the burned house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then it was lost . Mrs. David Vail . who lives not far from the burned house , sent word to the hunters yesterday that about nightfall on Saturday she had seen the two Lockwoods pass her house . Yesterday morning there came also another clue from the home of Gilbert M. Robdell , whose home is some three miles north of this town . Mr. Robdell said that on Saturday night about 9 o'clock he returned from a trip to Purdy 's Station , and when he opened his stable door it was slammed in his face ; whereupon two young men rushed nut and away . They had harnessed one of his horses to a light rig . If he had arrived ten minutes later they and the rig would have been gone . The combined posses , therefore , were rushed up to the Robdell place this morning . The two hounds , Jack Cheshire and Cheerful of Cragswell , took up the trail . This time it ran southward . It was difficult to follow the two fleeing young men . They would wade-a rushing brook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred yards along the top of a stone fence . Each of these manoeuvres would delay the dogs sometimes for an hour . The trail continued southward and east ' ward , and to-night the posses reached the conclusion . from the direction of the trail and from information received in the course of the day , that the Lockwoods were hiding in the home of their sister In Ridgefield . A guard of five men was set about the suspected Ridgefield house . i.nd the bloodhounds were sent home , I much wearied , in an automobile . The Lockwoods have friends in and around Ridgefield and North Salem . ' These have carried them food several times since the hunt for them began . Five suspected houses are under watch to-night , but it is believed that the Iwo Lockwoods are most likely at the home of the Ridgefield sister . It is about this that the hunters are concentrating their forces . The two young men are said to be desperate characters . Both are armed .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
