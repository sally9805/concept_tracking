txt Thomas W. Lawson issued a statement to-day regarding the developments in the Boston Gas Consoli- I dation suit , in which he says that he would have been well within the truth had he estimated the profits of a certain deal in which he and H. H. Rogers of the Standard Oil Company were interested at $66,000 , nue instead of at $40,000,000 . Presumably , this was the Amalgamated Copper deal . The Boston financier goes on to describe , at least by Inference , the financing of the copper deal as " a record in high finance which for geometrical crookedness has never been equaled . " Mr. Lawson also states that witnesses in the Gas case have delibkrately perjured themselves . He himself , he added , had been warned before going on the stand not to balk at " taking his medicine , " ? as all others in Standard Oil history had taken theirs . Mr. Lawson declares he has bean shuddering for his friends ever since the Amalgamated Copper flotation , and that he foresaw the exploitation of years of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Issued by Mr. Lawson begins by quoting another one issued by hint on March 4 in , which he said , among other things : " In my opinion , starting with yesterday 's first day in court , the public will be privileged to witness a series of flashlight pictures , to which , for flashlighting generally , the United States Shipbuilding fandango will look like a midnight silhouette . " Mr. Lawson then continues : " The press at once construed what I said as meaning that at the trial of the gas case there would be startling revelations . I only intended to say that the Gas case would be the first step in a series of revelations which would by the time the last one was reached show to the public a most ominous condition of affairs , to which the United States Shipbuilding episode would appear insignificant . " The present Gas case is one in which I was- interested only as a witness , and I had no idea I was going to kick up such a furor . As I had been subpoenaed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . " But as I knew the truth would be confined to the things closely related to this suit , I did not see how this case could develop into a startling lid-lifter , although did know that others whin would immediately follow could not proceed far without the years of accumulated germination of fraud and corruption blowing the lid and the receptacle to which it was attached so far into space that it would require the passing of the present generation and the coming of new ones before any new lid could be so snugly adjusted to a new receptacle as to allow any kind of public plandering fermentation . " Of course , as I sat day after day in the courtroom for four weeks and listened to samples of , perjury new to a Massachu- ? setts Supreme Court , I was compelled to a conclusion that the first leg of what had been started as a tuning-up contest was , because of the rawness developed , liable to be advanced to the second or third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those natural soberingdown , halting places , which usually bring the high priests of lofty finance back to earth and dollars . " When I was informed , before going on the stand , that it would be fatal for me to balk at taking my medicine , as all others in the history of ' Standard Oil " had taken theirs , I knew that my conclusion was correct  --  that what had been intended as an ordinary incident in high finance had really developed into an extraordinary accident . " At the present time  --  that is , during the . pendency of this suit , it is only meet for me , to say it is no affair of mine how it ends . It is my affair how the many suits which will immediately follow this one will end .

" Yet , knowing what I do , I would shudder for any friend who stood to-day where I stand , but  --  well , I have been shuddering so continuously for my friends since the Amalgamated flotation , that I have forgotten how to . shudder for my-. . self . There are a few things I owe to My friends and clients to touch on in this brief say-so . " On the witness stand I spoke of a deal whereby $40,000,000 profits ' had been made . Immediately are spread before the . public the details of what I meant . These details are so far from the facts as to only mislead and confuse those who read them . I ' will give these details when on the witness stand , not before . " Much comment has been made at the tremendousness of the amount .

" The thousands of holders of Amalgamated who have a right to look to me for advice and protection may rest assured that nothing can possibly grow out of this affair which will damage their holdings or hurt any good coppers . " If the aggregation of business men who to-day control Amalgamated , and they are the most- powerful and able of any in the world , continue to hold control over the coming annual election , the stock should , in the meantime , advance materially . If these gentlemen should . find they had parted with control to the real owners , these real owners may rest assures , that they can draw at least one extra dividend of , /0 per share from funds other than those coming from.the sale of copper .
