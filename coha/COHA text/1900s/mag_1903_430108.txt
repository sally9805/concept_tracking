 | TWO of the greatest events in the history of the British nation are now near at hand , and yet they have attracted so little attention from press and public that only a small number of people are aware of their imminence . These two events , taken together , will amount to a solution of the problem of Ireland . The Irish question has run so long unsolved , has given rise to so much bitterness and contention , has stirred such fierce and apparently implacable animosities , that most observers have settled down to a state of mind concerning it which may fairly be described as utter and chronic hopelessness . The news that a settlement is now within sight ? that finally an end is to be put to the centuries-old story of repression , struggle , agitation , conspiracy , crime , coercion , suffering , ? does seem almost too good to be true . But I 192 THE AMERICAN MONTHL  | have most excellent reasons for believing that it is not only good news , but news wholly warranted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an investiga. tion of this subject in England and Ireland , undertaken for the Chicago Record-Herald newspaper . The only instructions given me by the editor of that paper were to learn the truth and print it . I undertook my task with a feeling that I was to inquire into and write upon a controversy almost as old as the green hills of Ireland , which would be a burning question in the politics of the British Empire long after the present inhabitants of those hills had been gathered to their fathers . To my surprise and pleasure , I found , instead , that a settlement is fast approaching ; that the foundations are already laid ; that the superstructure of the great edifice of reform is even now being carefully put together by practical statesmen , and that within a few weeks all the world will be taken into confidence as to the first part of the work , the second part to be ready within a year or two after the first shall have been disposed of . In other words , British statesmanship is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land reform , to consist of the complete abolition of landlordism throughout the island and the turning of the soil over to the individual ownership of the men whc live upon it , till it , love it , and who , through the centuries since they were dispossessed of it , have clung to the tradition that it is rightfully theirs . 2 . Political reform , to consist of some form of home rule within the empire , an arrangement by which purely Irish legislation will be placed wholly in the hands of the elected representatives of the Irish people , and which will , in a measure , at least , satisfy the aspirations of the Irish people to a national entity . TO MAKE A NEW IRELAND . The first , and in some respects the greatest , of these revolutionary changes is not far distant . In fact , during the month of February , this year , the Balfour ministry has promised to introduce in Parliament a bill dealing with the land question in Ireland . There is little doubt that this bill will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question of the land . It will be a great measure in every sense . Its economic , social , and political effects will be momentous . In the opinion of every competent observer and student , it will make a new Ireland . It is , in effect , a great measure of government paternalism , or of state socialism ; for it is the intervention of the state , with the power and funds of the state , to work a wholesale change of ownership of the agricultural lands throughout an island as large as the State of Indiana , and having a population somewhat greater than that of the State of Ohio . The credit of the state is to be employed to the extent of about ? 100,000 , - 000 in effecting the transfer , and the state will undertake to pay a bonus amounting to probably ? 800,000 or ? 900,000 a year for half a century in harmonizing the differences which exist between the landlords who are to sell and the tenants who are to buy . Thus , the state is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the transaction ; it is to arrange and finance the deal , but . instead of taking out its commission or profit , is to ' incur a nominal cost to its treasury of $4,000,000 or more a year for the sake of putting the bargain through satisfactorily to both the great parties at interest . That this is a tremendous undertaking , any one can see at a glance to fully realize the scope of the project , one must bear in mind that it is to extinguish the feesimple of virtually all the landlords in Ireland and enable their 400,000 tenants to become owners of the soil for which they and their ancestors have paid rentals throughout the centuries . That this measure is to become law during the present year , there is little reason to doubt ; and as soon as it is out of the way the Balfour ministry proposes to take up the question of home rule and dispose of it in a way which will be satisfactory to a majority of the Irish people . " THE UNITY OF THE EMPIRE . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen who have this project in hand are actuated very little by any sentimental desire to make reparation for the injustices committed by their predecessors many generations ago . They are not proceeding upon sentiment at all , and ethical or altruistic considerations have small weight in their calculations . What they do wish , above all things , is to strengthen the British Empire . Recent events have taught them that the empire needs strengthening . The weakest link in the imperial chain to-day is Ireland . Nominally a member of the union , Ireland is in essence and spirit alien . It is not loyal to the empire , is not even friendly ; and practical English statesmen no longer delude themselves with the fiction that it is , or that the attitude of Ireland may prudently be regarded as a negligible quantity . For a hundred years , British leaders have refused even to consider the advisability of giving Ireland home rule , upon the ground that they would not take the risk of having " the unity of the empire " destroyed . At last they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no unity , and that there never can  | be unity under present conditions . Ireland is a Conquered country which refuses to be conquered , and which can never be conquered . The people have been in a state of " suppressed revolution " for three or four hundred years , and will be in such a state , in all probability , for three or four hundred years longer if their wrongs are not sooner righted . It has taken the leaders of British public opinion a long time to discover that there is just one way in which the unity of the empire can be secured , and that is by removing the cause of the discontent , ? by undoing the wretched work of the conquest . THE SUBLIME FAITH OF THE PEOPLE To go back to the conquest looks like an excursion into ancient history , but one must glance rapidly at the Ireland of the past in order to understand the Ireland of the present . We must remember that the conquerors found in Ireland one land system , and that they set up another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which individual rights were recognized . The one they set up was a system of great plantations or estates . Virtually all of the lands in the country were confiscated and parceled out among favorites , ? generals , soldiers , adventurers . To this system the people of Ireland have never been reconciled . At its door they lay all the blame for their failure to participate in the prosperity which has come to other members of the British union . They have never ceased to cherish the tradition which has come down to them through the centuries from the days of tanistry , or tribal ownership , that the land belongs to the people . Through all the changes of time , ? the plots and insurrections , the struggles and the repression , the famine and the great migration , ? the peasantry of Ireland have held fast to this faith . To my mind there ' is nothing finer in the history of peoples than the patient persistence with which the Irish have clung to this principle , ? the one principle in all the long chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which deserved to live and triumph . When the practical statesmen of to-day take up the problem of Ireland and seek its solution , they are compelled to give consideration to the historical view . They find that the land system which the conquerors imposed upon Ireland has been a failure , and they are forced to inquire why it has been a failure , that they may apply an efficacious remedy . It has been a failure because it was an unsound , a false system . Irish landowners , favorites of the conquerors , or heirs or assigns . of favorites , have never been landlords in the proper sense of the word . That is to say , they were never , except in rare instances , the conservators of their estates . It was a tremendous misfortune for all concerned that the system which the English imposed upon the country did not require the landowners to nurture , improve , and develop their lands . They simply let tracts to tillers , and the occupiers made all the improvements ? built or repaired the huts or houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fences . All that was done upon or for the land they did . The owner had no improvements to make . He had no responsibility for the land beyond the collection of his rents and the payment of his taxes . He was not required to put anything back upon the land . His only aim was to get as much as possible from it , and do nothing for it in return . Unlike landlords in England , Scotland , and Wales , they were mere rent-chargers , not landlords , or lords and managers of the estates which fortune had placed in their keeping . THE BLIGHT OF AN ENDLESS TRIBUTE . Fundamentally bad as this system was , the Irish landlords habitually and generally made it as much worse as they could . For centuries they were a sporting , drinking , gambling lot . Energies which should have been employed in practical management of their estates were thrown into the seeking of pleasure . Many naturally lived beyond their incomes , and were frequently forced to two methods of replenishing their purses , ? one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest ; the other was by putting up the rents . The first expedient led inevitably to employment of the second . About one-half of all the Trish landowners lived in England , and a considerable proportion of the remainder did not reside upon their estates , but elsewhere in Ireland . The bulk of all the money wrung from the agricultural land of the country was spent abroad . It was not spent upon the land , and very little of it near the land , which had produced it . Thus the conquest of Ireland became that most terrible of all forms of conquest , ? a perpetual tribute , If the conquerors had levied upon Ireland an indemnity , even an excessive indemnity , it would have been merciful in contrast with that which they actually did . An indemnity could have been paid off . One , two , ten generations might have been required . But in the end the debt would have been lifted . Under the system which was adopted the debt was always to be paid ; and was never extinguished . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , but acquired not an acre ; and every succeeding generation had to pay for it again with194 THE AMERICAN MONTIIL  | out any more hope of relief from the burden . No more cruel and destructive system was ever devised . For centuries , landlordism drained agricultural Ireland of its produce . Every year 15,000,000 acres of productive land , tilled by five or six millions of people , had to pay a tribute averaging $50,000,000 a year , most of which was sent out of the country . Ireland was impoverished . The people could acquire no surplus , because what would otherwise have been a margin of accumulation or savings went to the tribute-collectors . The prosperity of any purely agricultural country must be a matter of slow growth . In any one year , in any one decade , even under the natural and sound system of individual ownership , the margin of surplus must be small indeed . A little is gained one year , or by one generation , and this is laid by as a foundation for future years and future generations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to solidity , resourcefulness , genuine prosperity . In America , ? say in Iowa , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Nebraska , or the Dakotas , ? we have seen how in one generation , under favorable conditions and the sound principle of individual ownership , the naked prairie may be converted into a fertile , highly tilled , richly productive , well-improved , and fully stocked farm . It takes time , even in America . SKIMMED OF THE LAST DROP OF CREAM . In Ireland , there has been time enough , Heaven knows , as the period has been measured by centuries , not by generations . But Ireland has never had a chance to profit normally by this natural law of development . One generation has acquired little or nothing from that which preceded it . There have been no small yearly margins to merge at last into family accumulations which spell independence and comfort . The tillers of the soil have drawn from it barely enough to keep body and soul together , and the remainder has gone to the landlord , and through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wine-grower , the distiller , the race-track , the gaming-table , the purveyor of luxuries , the vampires of vice . the moneylenders . For three hundred years the system has annually skimmed Irish agriculture of the last drop of cream ; and yet there are superior persons who wonder why " the lazy Irish " are only skimmed milk . Let us suppose that two hundred years ago there had been a British conscience and British statesmanship such as there are to-day , and that at the beginning of the eighteenth instead of at the beginning of the twentieth century the government had righted the wrong of the conquest and confiscation by giving the tenantry an opportunity to purchase their holdings . Before the century was half gone the land would have been paid for and would have become the property of those who tilled it ; the yearly outflow of tribute money would have stopped ; the earnings of the land would have remained upon or near the land ; every year fifty million dollars would have been devoted to betterments , ? to houses , farm buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , education , superior food , and a reserve of savings . If fifty years ' earnings had been devoted to paying off the legal ' ( or historic ) equity of the landowners , one hundred years ' earnings would have been left to accrue to the people . I s there one wise enough to estimate what would have been the social and economic effect of this diversion of seven and a half billions of dollars from the channel of tribute to the accumulation of the people in one form or another durjng that century and a half ? It is not difficult to believe that if the Irish people had had the sound system of individual ownership for one hundred and fifty years after buying off the descendants of the conquerors and confiscators , and . had enjoyed the just reward of their labor and economy , they would to-day be as prosperous as the peasantry of France , fully as conservative in all their relations to government and society , and vastly more intelligent . WHEN THE LANDLORDS WERE MASTERS . Ireland is a country virtually without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not greatly thrive . Tillage of the soil was the chief occupation of the people . As the population increased , the area of productive land was insufficient to support the people who lived upon it . 1 f they had had no tribute to pay , ? if they had owned their lands outright , ? their lot would still have been sad enough . But they had to pay the tribute . Worse still , the landlords forced them to pay every penny which could possibly be wrung from them . The land was the only avenue to employment , and the owners of the land took advantage of the necessities of the people , ? of the land-hunger which inevitably followed . Rents already high were put higher . With some landlords , it was simply greed ; with others , it was dire necessity , ? the necessity which had been created by the improvidence of themselves or their forebears . They were in the hands of the usurers ; their fixed charges and family expenses were enormously high . They had everything in their own hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the civil  | power was in their grasp . They were the magistrates ; they made the grand juries which managed the affairs of the counties ; at their , beck and call were the constabulary and redcoats . They were the representatives of the country in Parliament . They made the laws and enforced them . The English garrison in Ireland held all the reins of power , and for centuries their chief activity was in collecting the tribute , in evicting those who failed to pay , and in punishing those who kicked against the pricks . They squeezed the orange dry , and then wondered why there was no juice in it , and tried to put the blame upon the thriftless nature of their victims . THE TRIBUTE AND THE FAMINE . Sixty years ago , the process of choking out the natural development of the country had reached its climax . The condition of Ireland was fearful . More than 8,000,000 of people were crowded upon 20,000,000 acres of land , of which only 15,000,000 acres were productive . Two acres per inhabitant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arable parts of the country , a population of 320 persons per square mile . With similar density of population , the agricultural State of Iowa would have 17,000,000 inhabitants , instead of 2,500,000 . In Ireland , at that time , four-fifths of the people lived directly by agriculture . There were so many people and so little land that the average holding was but a few acres per family . The great mass lived in a mud hut of one or two rooms , with or without windows , and sustained life almost exclusively with the potato . They lived literally from hand to mouth . They had no reserve or surplus , ? nothing to fall back upon in evil days . The system had drained the country ; the annual tribute , paid for centuries , had left no margin against the hour of dire want . Then came the failure of the potato crop , the famine years , starvation , famine-fever . A million human beings perished . Since then , five millions have emigrated . In every subsequent year , the population has dwindled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now denies that the famine was due to the inability of the people to acquire a reserve with which to meet an emergency . Almost any country in the world subjected to the system under which Ireland so long suffered would be liable to a similar disaster . If the years of crop failures in Nebraska had been preceded by centuries of tribute-paying , there would have been famine in the Platte country . When England repealed the corn laws and sought cheap bread for the factory operatives of her cities , agriculture in all parts of the United Kingdom was hit a heavy blow . In England , the landlords found it necessary to reduce rents . The reductions averaged about 40 per cent . Inducements were offered the farm laborers to remain upon the land and not run away to the cities . But in Ireland the landlords , some through greed and others through need , ? for the false system had developed both in an acute form , ? actually endeavored to continue their old method of raising the rents . Then ensued eras of agitation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmingly prevalent , and coercion was rigidly applied by the rulers of the country in London and the garrison of administrators and tribute-collectors in Ireland . It must ever remain a reproach to England that a third of a century elapsed after the famine had shown the dire necessity of a rehabilitation of the Irish land system before English statesmanship roused itself to action . GLADSTONE LAYS THE FOUNDATIONS . Then came the Gladstone land act of 1881 . It was opposed by the Irish representatives of that day , because they thought it only a makeshift . - They wanted to go to the roots of the difficulty , and predicted that this lopping of the tops of the poisonous plant would do little good . They were both right and wrong . Gladstone 's act did not solve the problem , but it laid the foundations of the solution which is now imminent . What Gladstone did was to provide that the tribute-collectors should no longer be permitted to fix their rents , but that the courts should fix them . This was the first great blow at the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand tenants out of a total of 500,000 in Ireland took their landlords into court and secured a reduction of their rents of an average of 21 per cent . That was the first term of fifteen years . For the second term , 70,000 tenants have had their rents still further reduced 22 per cent . By private agreement most of the remaining rents have been adjusted out of court in accordance with the judgment of the land tribunal . The net result is that in the last twenty years the total agricultural rents of Ireland have been reduced from about ? 9,000,000 a year to about ? 5,000,000 . Here is the declaration of the fair judicial tribunals that as long as the landlords had everything in their own hands they were squeezing 40 per cent . too much out of their tenants . It was bad enough for the poor people of Ireland to be compelled to pay this eternal tribute at all ; it was far worse to be compelled to pay an excessive tribute . It is almost painful to let the mind dwell upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . of unjust rent , ? that two-fifths of excessive tribute wrung for many generations from a people needy and helpless , ? might have done , through accumulation and the natural law of increase and development , toward averting the famine-tragedy and the widespread destitution and suffering which have scarred Irish life through the centuries . THE IRISH PEASANTRY THRIFTY AND CONSERVATIVE BY NATURE . But at last the thin edge of the wedge of reform had been pushed in . The landlords were no longer absolute masters . They could not do as they liked with their own . They could not demand excessive tribute . They could not push up the rent on Pat 's little patch because he had , through incredible toil , reclaimed a bit of bog and grown a little larger crop . Soon the wedge was pushed a bit further . Universal suffrage nearly destroyed the political power of the landlord class . True representatives of the Irish people , and not mere creatures of prerogative and privilege , appeared at Westminster . Other land acts were passed , and 72,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of ? 23,000,000 . Wherever these purchases have been made , thrift and prosperity have followed , and the purchasers have so punctually paid their installments that the state is not losing a penny by the transaction . One could not ask more complete refutation of the favorite argument of the supporters of the let-alone policy that the Irish peasantry are so shiftless and thriftless that it is not worth while trying to do anything for them . Experience under limited land-purchase shows conclusively that the Irish peasantry respond to all efforts to uplift them , just as they have responded to the cruel system which bore them down . Among the leaders of English activities , there is a latent fear of the radical or socialistic tendencies of the great masses of workingmen in the large cities . It is a curious and most interesting fact that the British statesmen of our day who are trying to settle the land and political questions in Ireland firmly believe that with such settlement the rish peasantry will become perhaps the most thrifty , most conservative , and most intelligent peasantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure , what the peasantry of France are to the republic . THE EXISTING SYSTEM INTOLERABLE . When Prime Minister Balfour and his associates of the present government survey the Irish scene , they quickly discern that the existing order of things can not continue . Something must be done . Government has gone so far , and it is bound to go farther . Gladstone virtually established as a legal fact the right of the tenant to his holding at a fair judicially fixed rent , thus fixing in statute the ancient and beloved tradition of the Irish people . " Tenant 's right is landlord 's wrong , " Lord Palmerston sneered in the House of Commons , and benches filled with landlords and the creatures of landlords cheered him to the echo . Great changes have come since then . Gladstone 's law made tenant 's right a living reality . He prepared the way for the revolution which is now impending . For he set up a system as false , though not as cruel , as the one which he pushed aside , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound and wholesome . He established dual ownership of the land , ? the landlord with his fee on one side , the tenant with his tenant-right on the other . Between them stands the state , fixing the rent . When the landlord was shorn of his power to fix the rents according to his need or greed , the whole system was doomed . The landlord is a landlord only in name . He is now nothing more than a rent-charger , nothing but a mortgagee with an historic or legal equity upon which he collects the interest , as fixed by the courts . It is a false system , because neither owner nor occupier is master . Owner has no interest in the land beyond collection of his rent ; occupier has no incentive to the making of improvements or the developing of productive capacity , lest the land courts imitate the policy of the landlord himself in his palmy days and refuse to reduce the rent for the next term . Under the old system , there was a sure and harsh tax upon thrift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that natural reward for it which alone can produce a healthy condition . THE LANDLORD DETHRONED . Bad as the systems , old and new , have been for the tenant and for the people of Ireland , it is the landlord who is the under-dog now . He has fallen from his high place . He is no longer absolute master of the country , or even of his own estate . The courts will not let him rack the rents , but creditors demand that he settle with them . His income has been cut down , but his fixed charges and family expenses continue . Bankruptcy stares him in the face . He can not sell his lands , eager as many are to buy , great as is the land-hunger in the country . This curious anomaly is easily understood when the facts are stated . The government has already helped one-seventh of the Irish agricultural tenants to buy up their holdings , to lift the mortgage , and it is " in the air " that sooner or later it is going to help the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ireland are determined that government shall do so , and that the men who profit by it and secure possession of the land shall be the - men who live upon it , ? the descendants of those who were robbed of it centuries ago . " The land for the people " is a principle to which both the government and the landlords must in the end subscribe , and those who like to look for the dramatic element in history will find it here . The men who hunger for land in Ireland are the tenants or the traders in the towns . But Were is a public opinion which declares the former shall have it , not the latter , nor yet any outsiders . Tenants will not buy at private sale , because they firmly believe that they shall get better terms when the government moves . Outsiders dare not invest amid the prevailing uncertainties . Few traders care to purchase and thus bring public opinion down upon them . This public opinion manifests itself in a peculiar way . Debarred from finding expression as it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to agitation , to organization . William O'Brien 's United Irish League , with its branches everywhere in the island , is the present medium . The league has contrived a skillful , insidious , but effective means of visiting the displeasure of public opinion upon all who violate the code of ethics as to the land . There is no agrarian crime , no criminalaagitation or practices , no shooting at landlords from behind the hedge , no maiming of animals , no thumping of bailiffs . The day of such things has passed . Even the boycott is no longer employed in a harsh and clumsy way . The tradesman who buys up holdings from which tenants have been evicted finds that by common impulse all the people stay away from his shop . The outsider who comes in to purchase and man acrean Irish farm soon learns that no one will herd his cattle or harvest his crops . TRIUMPHANT DEMOCRACY . Hence , there is a deadlock as to the land situation , and the tenants have all the best of it . Accustomed always to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of them are poor , and not a few are destitute . But they are patient and long-suffering . There are few mud or stone huts in Ireland wherein the group that gathers about the peat fire does not discuss hopefully the coming revolution in the land system . They know little or nothing of the project which the government has in hand ; they know only that their leaders tell them the day is not far distant when they are to come into their own . So they bide their time . They and their people have waited for centuries for this righting of the ancient wrong ; they can wait a few years more . For the landlords , it is not so easy . Many of them are harassed by their creditors ; many are on the verge of bankruptcy ; many are eager to sell . So general is the desire of the landlords to close out that the government is endeavoring to take advantage of the situation and bring landlord and tenant together in a purchase scheme which shall be satisfactory to all sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when pressed in Parliament . Landlords who have resided upon their estates , and who have in fair measure performed their duty by their tenants and their property ( for there are a few such ) , are not in such sore straits . This is especially true of landlords who are themselves Irishmen and whose people are of their Church . But landlords who have been on bad terms with their tenants , and who are out of touch and sympathy with their neighbors ; now find their situation well-nigh intolerable from all points of view . They are still the magistrates , it is true , but the magistrates no longer choose the grand juries which administer the affairs of the counties . The old administrative grand-jury system , which placed all local power directly in the hands of the landlords , was swept away by the act of 1898 , framed by Gerald Balfour , brother of the prime minister , and a county council , elected by a broad , franchise , was installed in its stead . These county councils have worked well , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish people for self-government . NEW ERA UNDER THE BALFOUR REGIME . The new era in Ireland , now foreshadowed by coming events , began with Gladstone . He laid the- foundations ; and then there was a pause . For twenty years , little has been done toward a solution of the land problem , except some additions to the purchase acts . With the rise of the Balfours as influential factors in the English Government , the work of regeneration may be said to have taken a fresh start . From 1887 to 1891 , Arthur Balfour was chief secretary for Ireland . He studied the Irish problem with great care , and his studies are now bearing fruit . Accompanied by the brilliant young man who was then his private secretary , but who is now chief secretary for Ireland , with a seat in the cabinet , George Wyndham , Mr. Balfour visited all parts of the island on tours of investigation . He went into the poorest parts of the country , the unhappy West , where a new problem has presented itself during the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn laws , landlords began to look about for more profitable use of their lands than the precarious 198 THE AMERICAN MONTHL  | rentals afforded . English farmers took up the importation of foreign corn and the fattening of store cattle , and Irish landowners resolved to supply English feeders with stores . So thousands of tenants were cleared out from their little holdings and the lands they had tilled turned into pasture . In fifty years , the area devoted to cereals has diminished one-half ; that devoted to root crops has diminished , one-quarter . Meadow and pasture have increased 65 per cent . It is an extraordinary fact that to-day , of 15,000 , - 000 acres of productive land in Ireland , only 2,400,000 are under plow . As there are about five hundred thousand so-called farmers , the average of crops is only five acres per farm . And as many thousands of farmers in Ulster and other more prosperous sections have from ten to fifty acres each , it follows that others must be reduced to one or two acres . GOOD LAND FOR THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor West , where the people have been driven off the good lands to make room for the cattle , the situation is a most painful one , " Where the lands are , there are no people ; where the people are , there is no land , " is William O'Brien 's vivid generalization . It is too true . I rode parts of several days through rolling , fertile tracts , green in December , dotted with bullocks and sheep , and no houses except here and there the dwellings of the graziers . But down in the bogs , ? in the black , grimy swamps , ? the people were found swarming in their miserable huts , many of them with their few cattle , pigs , and poultry housed under the same roof with the family , trying to eke out a living from two to half a dozen acres of mudhole , land which an American farmer would never think of trying to till , but would turn over to his pigs for a wallow . Take Westport Union for an example . Fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 151,000 acres are monopolized by the herds of a dozen graziers . In the union are 5,322 occupiers of agricultural land , and 3,041 of them pay less than twenty dollars a year rental for their holdings . They pay all the holdings are worth , one may be sure ; and the annual value of the produce which a family can gather from a farm worth twenty dollars a year is the measure of these people 's standard of comfort . More than one thousand other tenants are able to pay less than forty dollars a year for their holdings . Nearly all of the land held by these poor tenants is reclaimed bog or mountain heather , upon which crops are produced only by dint of incredible toil . WHERE THE POOR FEED THE DESTITUTE . The conditions in this union are typical of those which exist in a considerable area of the western part of Ireland , ? in Mayo , Donegal , Galway , and Clare . In County Mayo , for instance , of a total of 1,327,000 acres of land , 93,000 acres are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these 93,000 acres , chiefly very poor land , 217,000 inhabitants must extract the means of subsistence . These people can not live , upon the land , and every year many thousands of them go as harvest laborers to England or Scotland , earning small wages , sleeping in barn 's , exercising the most heroic self-denial , that they may bring meager savings of forty or fifty dollars each home to their families . But for these additions to their incomes , and the steady inflow of remittances from loyal kin in America , starvation would ever stalk through the region . As it is , the great majority live from hand to mouth , the poor help the destitute , one out of seven of the population are supported from the poor rates , and half the remainder are constantly upon the verge of actual want . In all , throughout what is known as the congested districts , ? the agricultural slums of Ireland clearly created by the harshness of the system and not by natural causes , ? more than one hundred thousand families are living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Empire . Arthur Balfour visited this region in 1888 , and was so impressed by what he saw that the shortly afterward created the Congested Districts Board , a government body fairly supplied with funds , and with power to buy and redistribute estates , enlarge and sell out holdings , and help the people to lift themselves up . This board has done good work . On a small scale , this experiment has practically demonstrated how the work of rehabilitation may be performed . It is a satisfaction to know that in the land-settlement scheme now in hand the ministry proposes to create a vastly larger congested districts board to deal with this problem on an adequate scale . A TRUE IRISHMAN IN DUBLIN CASTLE . When Prime Minister Balfour and Irish Secretary Wyndham decided that the greatest work to be done for the unification and strengthening of the empire was to make Ireland loyal , that Ireland could not be made loyal without contentment , that contentment could not be had without prosperity , and that prosperity could not be secured without the abolition of landlordism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they cast about for ,  | men and means with which to carry out the new policy . Chief Secretary Wyndham has the work directly in hand , but as he must remain most of the time in London , lie needed a man ? the right man ? to represent him in Ireland . While in India as viceroy , Lord Lansdowne had known of the work of Sir Antony MacDonnell . In the northwest provinces of India , MacDonnell had solved ? scientifically and satisfactorily ? a land problem similar to that in Ireland . On Lansdowne 's recommendation , ? and this is a state secret , ? he was sent for . Lord Lansdowne took him to King Edward , who feels the keenest interest in the project to make a new and loyal Ireland . ' I am willing to undertake the work , " said Sir Antony to the King , but you must bear in mind that I am not only an Irishman and a Roman Catholic , but a Nationalist and a Home Ruler . " That makes no difference , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . " So Balfour and Wyndham sent MacDonnell to Dublin as under-secretary . He has been there only two months ; but in this short time he has thrown old traditions and prejudices to the winds ; he has consulted not only the landlords , but the true representatives of the Irish people , ? the Nationalist members of Parliament and T. W. Russell , the Scotch Presbyterian , who has brought Ulster in line for land reform and for the first time enabled the Irish people to present a united front , Catholic and Protestant , Nationalist and Unionist , Leinster , Munster , and Connaught along with Ulster , ? for settlement of the land problem upon the sound principle of individual ownership in place of dual ownership and landlordism . As a practical administrator , dealing frankly with the landlords on one side and the Nationalists on the other , he had , up to the time I left Ireland , in December , secured a general agreement upon the details of the project which the government will present to Parliament in a few weeks . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed five hundred pounds a year had given their consent , and most of the remainder were expected to join . If a remnant stand out , the project will go ahead just the same , and something akin to compulsion or the law of eminent domain will be applied to them , for the government is determined this time to make a complete and final job of it , to leave no sore spots or centers of discontent . The Nationalist leaders ? William O'Brien , John Redmond , T. P. O'Connor , John Dillon , Michael Davitt , and others -- will support the government measure in Parliament . Mr. Bryce and other leaders of the Liberal party tell me that if the bill is a good one , ? and , of course , English political and journalistic methods are  | such that they do not yet know what the measure is to be , ? there will he no opposition . HOW THE LAND IS TO BE RESTORED TO THE PEOPLE . Land settlement , then , may be regarded as fairly well assured . There is always danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work in hand are confident of success . Already their plans are well-nigh perfected ; subject to slight variations of details , which will not affect the general principle involved , the project is substantially as follows : Landlords are to have twenty-three years ' purchase of their second-term rents , or ? 23,000 for an estate renting at ? 1,000 a year , one-half in cash , to enable them to clear off their debts , and onehalf in land stock bearing about 4 per cent . interest . This will assure the landlords their present net income , with the advantage of prime security in place of the existing uncertainty . Tenant purchasers are to pay eighteen years ' rent in terms of fifty or sixty years , making their annual payment considerably less than their present rent , and with ownership instead of endless tribute at the end of the period . Most landlords are glad to sell , all tenants willing to buy , on these terms . The difference of five years ' purchase , and the difference between the 3 per cent . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital or credit and the 2+ or 21 per cent . it will get from the purchasing tenants , is the bonus which the state must pay for contentment and prosperity , and in the end for loyalty , in Ireland . It is computed that the annual cost of carrying and amortization of this bonus will be under a million pounds sterling , ? the best investment for the unity and strength of the empire England ever made , even if every penny of it must come out of the treasury . But the treasury will not have to bear it . With the land question settled , members of the cabinet tell me the cost of Irish administration can easily be reduced ? 1,000,000 a year . For instance , the royal constabulary , a standing army of 13,000 men , maintained almost entirely because the landlords think they need it , costs ? 1,350,000 a year . With landlordism abolished , this standing army may be largely dispensed with ,  - -  be reduced to one-quarter or one-third its present numbers and cost . With the land question settled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that home rule ? in some form ? will logically and naturally follow disposal of the land question , is the belief of English and Irish public men of all parties . This most interesting and important topic of home rule for Ireland I propose to deal with in a future number of the REVIEW OF REVIEWS .
