Mr. Binyon has not produced the great history of Chinese and Japanese painting which awaits the hand of some exceptionally endowed and privileged writer The resources upon which he has drawn are scanty the paintings in the British Museum , the Arthur Morrison Collection , the Freer Collection , and the reproductions in the Kokka and the superb " Select Relics of Japanese Art " edited by S Tajima . His task has thus been comparable to that of a critic who should attempt to describe Italian art without the treasures of Italy . But within the limitations imposed upon him , he has made a useful and interesting volume If he writes of Professor Fenollosa as if that critic were still living and able to give us the promised and much-desired work on Japan , such slips are rare , and in general he has availed himself of the most recent helps  --  still very few  --  toward mastering his subject . Among these sources Mr Binyon does not omit Dr. Stein 's great work on the explorations in Chinese Turkestan ( " Ancient Khotan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 332 ) , with its astonishing evidence of the influence of Greek art on the Far Eastern peoples of Asia These glimpses into the past throw daily more light on that miracle of history by which a little folk on the lEgean Sea sent out their sense of form in lines of power radiating endlessly to the East and the West Mr Binyon lays sufficient stress on this fact historically , but in his chapter comparing the art of Orient and Occident he does not take advantage of this influence as a point of departure He has his eye too exclusively on the painting of the middle ages and the renaissance in Europe . The contrast he draws is initially sound He explodes easily the earlier view which found in the West an art of form and in the East an art of color Not color , but line , is the characteristic of Eastern painting , or , more precisely , rhythmical line In this theory every work of art is thought of as an incarnation of the genius of rhythm , manifesting the living spirit of things with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex matter allow to be transmitted to our senses in the visible world around us A picture is conceived as a sort of apparition from a more real world of essential life That is well said , but we question whether Mr. Binyon goes quite to the root of the matter This apparition is not precisely a glimpse into " a more real world of essential life " ; that , we take it , is an Occidental philosophy What seems rather to need emphasis is the feeling always of rhythmical evanescence caught from the Buddhistic law of universal impermanence This bit of moon-lit scenery , this poised tiger or fish , this delicate spray of blossoms , this floating human figure , produces its entrancing effect because it is a glimpse of life vibrating from one impenetrable obscurity to another The most fruitful point of comparison would be to show how on one side the Greek vision of form was modified and subtilized by the Oriental sense of transitoriness , and /on the other side by the renaissance conception of stability and scientific law And to this comparison should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , at its best , there was a Platonic mystery of pure stationary form as the impress of the infinite on the finite , which neither Oriental nor Occidental ever again quite recovered or understood . But in adding our own theory to Mr Binyon 's excellent discussion of principles we are forgetting the chapters in which he follows the course of Chinese and Japanese painting from the work of Ku K'ai-chih in the fourth century A n ( with a reproduction from a picture of his in the British Museum , the oldest Chinese painting whose existence is known ) to the marvellous and comparatively well-known works of Hokusai ( b 1760 ) and the color-prints of Ukiyoye The record necessarily touches on only the chief moments and the great names , but Mr Binyon 's text is pleasant and discriminating , and the full-page reproductions are excellent collotypes For those who desire an amateur 's acquaintance with a great and fascinating art , the book can be heartily recommended It is also one of the handsomest of the holiday productions David C Preyer 's " The Art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Painting Illuminated and Demonstrated by Critical Descriptions of the Great Paintings in the Many Galleries " ( Boston L C Page &; Co ) is a mildly entertaining book by an author with no charm of well-formed literary style , with apparently no profound convictions , no original philosophy of art and life , but with an equipment of generally sound ideas as to the relative standing of the Dutch painters , and with an indubitable fund of information on various aspects of his subject His interest and erudition find expression in a well illustrated volume of nearly 400 pages , which would be of undoubted assistance in preparing for a paper at the woman 's club or for a tour of the Netherlands Mr Preyer is proud of not having " burdened these pages with the romancing fancies and fairy tales which tradition has gathered around many of the more prominent men " Yet , to the student who appreciates art in its larger relationship to society the legends and apocryphal stories are often quite as illuminating as verified facts , and should at least be stated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat better than his theory , for he gives not a few entertaining personalia Mr Preyer , like many who write harmlessly harmful criticism ( for these illustrated art books , it may be suspected , are looked at more often than read ) , builds his whole work around Leonardo 's aphorism that " the true artist must study and follow nature alone , " a dictum which is true only if a very broad definition of " nature " is accepted For art itself is certainly not supernatural Every act of artistic cre-ation is an outcome of varied experiences , extending over the greater part of the artist 's life No realist , no impressionist who has ever seen works by other painters , fails , however sincerely he thinks he is following nature alone , to be influenced in his technical procedure by concepts thus previously integrated No artist , on the other hand , who imitates or even copies work of another country and age can help putting into his art some of the results of his observation of his immediate surroundings and his reaction upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chosen from European Galleries and Reproduced in Color with Notes on the Pictures , " is a handsome quarto in two volumes , published in London by J.

These massive foundations , composed of fragments of tufa and travertine , mixed up with pieces of terracotta and broken marble ornaments , are attributed to the sixth century A o . They furnished a fortified defence to the Palatine Hill of which the towers , connected by corridors , can still be traced Within the area which these walls enclosed stand the ruins of the ancient horrui ( magazines and granaries of all kinds ) , and of many other buildings , some of which date back to the earliest days of the Roman Empire Near the Arch of Titus the line of fortifications cut through a building which dates either from the later republic or the beginning of the empire . The ground floor of this republican house still retains some of its mosaics The most remarkable feature of the house is its underground portion divided into numerous small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which still preserve the brick ridges that once supported beds . In one of these chambers the walls , which were filled with nails , showed traces of about twenty coats of paint and whitewash ; some traces of an inscription are still discernible , as well as a painting of three Bacchic thyrsi . Another series of rooms contained baths . A large quantity of pottery was found in this house , including about 200 lamps , some with painted designs , a number of fine fragments of Arretine vases , and many pieces of glass . Prof J. Garstang of the University of Liverpool , in a recent lecture before the Royal Asiatic Society in London , gave the results of an archeological expedition in Asia Minor , from which he has recently returned . A concession had been obtained for excavating the ruins of Sakji-Geuzi , and a preliminary survey was made of this important site , which is expected to yield valuable evidence for the state of culture reached by the Hittites On excavating one of the mounds the explorers discovered a temple in excellent preservation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the weather , the inscriptions and carvings were much clearer than on any Hittite monuments previously discovered . Although found in what was only a provincial city the sculptures were of good quality . By paying special attention to the stratification of the mound it was found that the site was occupied from neolithic times to the end of the Hittite power . The soundings made in other mounds proved that they would abundantly repay excavation , and Professor Garstang is therefore looking forward to ten or fifteen years of excavation of that site , and is confident that the work there will throw much light on the great Hittite problem . Among the exhibitions at the dealers ' galleries in this city are " thumb-nail " sketches by well-known artists at Powell 's , till December 30 , bronzes by American artists , Macbeth 's , December 31 ; pastels by Walter Griffin , Bauer-Folsom 's , December 31 , Italian laces and embroideries copied from old designs by women of the New York Italian colony , Scuola 's , December 31 , paintings , Edward Gay , Clausen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A severe break in prices on the Stock Exchange , such as has just occurred , usually opens the eyes of many people to facts which they had been unable or unwilling to see before . This office the present reaction in prices has helped to perform . The best judges , in and out of Wall Street , declared in October that Mr Taft 's success could hardly of itself cause prosperity , or Mr Bryan 's success adversity . They admitted the " holding-up of orders " on the eve of election day , but they now explain both the spasm of trade activity in the fortnight after November 3 , and the subsequent relapse to quiescence , as a perfectly natural result of these postponements Some of them are beginning to hint that , with merchants ' shelves so bare and underlying conditions working so normally towards improvement , we might by this time have been pretty much where we are to-day , even if Bryan had pulled through . We should have had a break on the Stock Exchange , of course , and a week or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they met , wondering who was to foot the bill at Christmas . But , say the heretics , real conditions will in 11-1c , Inn cr the worn-out rails of the Pennsylvania would have had to be replaced , whoever was choosing Cabinet officers ; the $7,778,000,000 worth of American crops in 1908 would have equally found a market , whatever the voters had decreed ; and shoes and clothes and hate and furniture call for renewal as surely as do rails . Therefore , one may even go so far as to imagine the great " bear movement " ? the immediate and highly probable sequel to the news of a Bryan victory  --  to have been followed in its turn by a sudden " raid on the shorts , " by a violent Stock Exchange recovery , and , finally , by a volume of general trade exactly what it appears to be to-daysomething like three-fourths of normal , with an output from the Steel Corporation , on December 19 , ranging from 58% to 60 per cent . of the mills ' capacity . What have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to real prosperity ? A trained economist , when this question is put to him as regards either past or present conditions , has several tests to apply The iron output is one , bank clearings another , business failures a third , and transactions on the Stock Exchange a fourth . The testimony of November 's iron production is commonly called disappointing , because increase in daily output over October was only 4 per cent. , increase in capacity December 1 only 5 per cent . over November 1 , and both of them far below the same date in such a year as 1906 . But against this must be placed the fact that November 's output reflected a steady and unbroken increase over midsummer , making daily production larger by 56 per cent than that of January  --  a far more rapid rate of increase than in the previous after-panic year . November bank clearings in the United States , with their increase of 7 per cent over October , their approach within 5 per cent . even of the enormous exchanges of November , 1906 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the returns of the agricultural West , are striking facts Expanded as the bank clearings undoubtedly were by the outburst of speculation and by an abnormally early movement of the wheat to market , they must nevertheless have had a substratum of legitimate trade underneath them Business failures in November were in number the smallest of any month this year , barring September , and in liabilities the smallest of any month . They do , it must be admitted , still compare unfavorably with the November record of any year in the decade past except 1907 , but they none the less show consecutive improvement . What Stock Exchange trading has had to show , last month and this , every one knows already . Stock trading had ? except in 1905 and 1904 . Very much of this must be ascribed to unwarranted speculation , but transactions in bonds , with only one parallel for magnitude in our previous history , must have more meaning . They show at least one genuine point of vantage in existing conditions , as compared with those of the similar date in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has not , as in 1894 , been compelled to forego interest on a great part of its bond investments , and to prepare for assessments on its stocks . Defaulting bonds are rare , and stocks which paid dividends in 1906 generally pay dividends now . Nor does this reasoning apply alone to investments on the Stock Exchange When one recalls how largely holders of mortgages on real estate , East and West , had to foreclose and patiently await the doubtful sale of the property in 1894 and 1874 , one will understand how different the present situation is . The contrast doubtless goes far towards explaining the strong support of the recent investment market by what Wall Street calls the " outside public " ; one may ask if it does not have some bearing also on general trade . People who can buy investment bonds can also spend money liberally among the merchants .
