SCENE .  --  A Large Room in Grindstone 's House . Practicable window , L. C. ; large screen , R. ; two doors , R. and L. ; a table in centre ; large high-backed chair , tall enough to hide any one behind it ; smaller chairs , &amp;c. ; and stage dark . Enter SACKS , R. , with a small lighted lamp , which he places on table . SACKS Well , of all the odd whims , did I ever hear of one like this ! Here is my respected Master Grindstone , the best of millers ( and I may add , the greatest rogue in grain , ) for three miles round , forbidding the village lads and lasses to dance in his barn to-night  --  yes , actually considers it immoral ; and instead of finishing up the yearly festival with a merry waltz , or a lively cotillion , he , as the magistrate 's deputy , sends them all packing off at the last minute ; orders their parents to keep them at home , safe under lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they dare to scrape a string , or to shew their unlucky phizzes in the places . And as to merry making  --  lud a ' mercy ! he 'll commit every soul to jail , who is n't in bed and snoring as the clock strikes nine . Why , the very dogs dare not bark nor an owl hoot without leave . Oh ! here he comes . ( crosses to R. ) EnterGRINDSTONE , door R. 1 E. p. 3 GRINDSTONE Well , Sacks  --  have you been round the village and given my orders ? SACKS Have n't I ! to the very last tittle ! And , la , master ! you should have seen the poor lasses , when I told them there was to be no dance to-night . GRINDSTONE What could the silly girls have to complain of , I should like to know ? Have n't I treated them to an extra day 's work in my orchard , and allowed them to appropriate to their own use all the apples they could pick up , that were not fit for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had heard what they said of you  --   --  GRINDSTONE Oh , indeed ! And pray what was it they did say ? SACKS Such things ! First of all  --  little Ida , the cherry-cheeked daughter of one-eyed Blaize the inn-keeper  --  she comes bustling up , like a bantam hen with all her feathers ruffled  --  " So , Mr. Sacks , " says she  --  for , bless you , she is so polite when she means to be very rude  --  " So , Mr. Sacks , your old fool of a master  --   --  " GRINDSTONE Did she presume to call me a fool ? Me ?  --  Grindstone , the magistrate 's deputy ! I 'll take away her father 's license . A fool , forsooth ! p. 4 SACKS Fool ! was the very identical expression . But that is nothing to be shocked at , when she called me an ugly , spiteful hunchback . Well , but I have n't done ! " Yes , " says Rose , the tailor 's niece  --  you know little Rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibs of her sweetheart  --  " Tell Mr. Grindstone that we shall find a way to outwit him . " " A sneaking old curmudgeon , " says Julie . " A crabbed old bachelor , " adds tall Mariette . " A regular rogue , " adds Georgette . Ha , ha , ha ! Oh ! it was such fun to hear them all falling foul of you , and vowing they would break into the barn in spite of your teeth . GRINDSTONE Oh ! ho ! Will they ?  --  we shall see . Of course , Sacks , you told them what to expect ?  --  you made them understand what a terrible fellow I was ? SACKS Of course I did , master . I said that a monster was a joke to you ; " besides , " says I " he has turned the fierce yard dog into the barn , and he 'll kill the first that ventures in . Younever saw such a quandary as they were in . GRINDSTONE Serve them right  --  a pack of saucy girls ! Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to bring anyone across , without an order from me ? SACKS I did , master . So if the young ladies want to run away , they will have to walk two leagues round to he bridge , or else to wade through the ford . I offered to carry them across on my hump , provided they would each promise to have no partner but me the whole evening . Oh my ! was n't I abused ! " Get rid of your hump ! " says one  --  " You look like a travelling pedlar "  --  " Had n't you better hire a monkey , " says another , " and you two can shew yourselves for a penny a head "  --  " You would run easier on all fours "  --  " And just look at yourself in the glass . " Oh !  --  I promise you I came in for my share of abuse , I did . p. 5 GRINDSTONE Serve you right , you old goose . SACKS Old goose ! What next , I wonder . GRINDSTONE No muttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to anyone to-night . You may shut the house up and go  --  SACKS Thank you , master . GRINDSTONE To the deuce ! or about your business ;  --  hang , drown yourself , if you will  --  provided that you are at work by four in the morning . SACKS I 'll do my best to oblige you ;  --  good night , master . ( going ) GRINDSTONE Stop , you may bring my hat and cloak , and the dark lanthorn . I am just going to take a turn in the village , and make sure that my orders have been punctually observed . ( ExitSACKS , R. ) That fellow is such a fool , he will never suspect that I , the honest old miller , should actually have a state secret in my keeping . I must have the place quiet , for at nine the chevalier will be here . Long ere that it will be pitch dark , and very favourable for the arrival of the other parties who are expected , and who are to find their way into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Enter SACKS with hat , cloak , and lanthorn , R. p. 6 SACKS Here you are , sir  --  your hat ( gives hat ) , your cloak , and your lanthorn. ( puts down lanthorn , and assists GRINDSTONE to put on cloak ) Why , you look for all the world like a conspirator . GRINDSTONE Conspirator !  --  you rascal ! What do you mean ? ( aside ) Can he suspect ? SACKS I never mean anything , master . You know what a poor simple fellow I am . GRINDSTONE There  --  there  --  hold your tongue , and never let me hear you hint that a respectable miller , and a deputy magistrate , looks like a conspirator . I have a noble aim in view  --  a patriotic project . I shall increase my rheumatism , but add to my renown , by looking after the morals of the million . Exit with lanthorn , L. SACKS Ah  --  ha , ha , ha ! Simple as I seem , I am not to be blindfolded by you , Master Grindstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send you out of a cold night . No , no , my good Grindsone  --  cunning as the fox may be , his skin comes to the currier at last . Well , as I have the place to myself , I shall obey orders  --  lock up the house , then return here , vote myself into the chair , and preside at a convivial meeting of one . Exit with lamp , L.  --  Music , " The winds whistle cold , " played very piano and slowly . Enter BERNARD from behind screen , which is supposed to conceal a door  --  Music ceases  --  he is wrapped in a cloak , and advances cautiously . p. 7 BERNARD What a cold walk I have had , two leagues round at least ; so lonely , too ; I did not meet a soul . Of course everybody is dancing in the barn . It is now the hour when Ida and her cousin appointed to meet me here . What a cross old fellow that Father Blaize is ! he sees further with his one eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he forbid me to shew myself in his house . Never mind ; my dear Ida and Georgette have promised to come here , and to remember to bring the supper . Hist ! what footsteps are those ? Clumpity  --  clumpity  --  clump . ( looks out at side , by which SACKS exits ) A man with a light  --  oh no  --  I shall hide  --  this screen is most convenient . ( runs behind screen ) Enter SACKS , L. , with lamp and basket . SACKS Now to make a night of it . I have found a delicious pork pie , half a ham , and some beautiful cold roast pig ; I hope there is variety for once in a way . Then here are eggs , cream , cheese , and a loaf of brown bread . Exhausted nature may support herself on that till breakfast time to-morrow . Now then for the drinkables to give a zest to the grand banquet . ( puts basket and lamp on table , and exits , R. BERNARD peeps cautiously from behind screen  --  advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an excellent appetite . It must be some benevolent friend of my little Ida , who compassionates a poor lover , and can feel for a hungry lad that has come out supperless . There can be no harm in appropriating this pie , which he so highly eulogised . I still leave him the ham and the cold pig . Bless me ! he is actually returning , and Ida not here to introduce me  --  I must return to my hiding place . Suppose he should miss the pie , and look behind the screen . Surely there must be a closet of some kind  --  ah , here is one large enough to hold half a regiment . ( enters closet , R. ) Re-enter SACKS , R. door , with several bottles in another basket . p. 8 SACKS Here we are , all right ; I can always find my way to the cellar in the dark ; and somehow I know by instinct where the best vintage is stowed away . I shall now perform the part of a waiter , and commence by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goose I am ! I have forgotten the table cloth , plates , knives and forks , and when a gentleman invites himself to supper , he expects things to be done in a genteel way . The light is burning in the kitchen ; I shall find what I want there . Exit , R. ( Music . " Let me like a soldier fall . " MAX jumps in through window , he is in a serjeant 's uniform , he comes forward ) MAX I am first at the place of rendezvous , which speaks well for my gallantry and punctuality , I have had a fine run for it  --  the old fool of a ferryman wanted to hinder me from passing over , because he said that he had received orders to do so ; I soon settled that little matter , by pitching him out of his boat , and rowing myself over . I then secured the crazy old tub by a stout rope , so as to ensure my safe return to quarters before midnight . Rose and Georgette are very late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some preparation for supper , I perceive . A savoury ham ! I may as well commence by attacking the commissariat. ( sits at table , pulls out a clasp knife , and begins eating ) If the young ladies do n't appear soon , I very much doubt if there will be any of the supper left ; it is vanishing with fearful rapidity . ( SACKS sings without ) What ! is that a man 's voice ? it must be that crabbed old miller , who has slipped away from the barn  --  I mean the ball room , and most likely I am devouring his supper . ( rises ) So , Max , my friend , I advise you to lie in ambush for a while ; the screen is the first place people look behind , this high-backed chair will make a capital barrier . ( places high backed chair near window ) But lest the garrison should be starved into a surrender , I shall carefully victual the citadel . ( takes off the ham , loaf , and bottle , and hides behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which are plates , glasses , &amp;c. p. 9 SACKS Now to lay the cloth . ( removes baskets from table , then spreads a large cloth over it ) Plates for four  --  there you are  --  dishes , glasses , bread  --  where 's the bread ? I could have sworn that I had brought in a loaf ; what a cannibal I must have been , to have forgotten the bread ; I 'll get it directly , of course it is in the kitchen . Exit , R. MAX ( peeping from behind chair ) He never suspected who was listening to him . I wish these little girls would come ; I shall be tired of playing at hide and seek , and if they delay much longer , I shall take the liberty of introducing myself to the party with the hump , and proposing that we commence supper without further delay . Footsteps again ! ( listens ) This time it must be Rose and Georgette , and perhaps accompanied by one or two of their friends , the more the merrier ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( listens again ) I 'll hide , and just startle them on their appearance . ( conceals himself behind chair .  --  Music . " There 's some one in the house with Dinah . " ) Enter LOUIS , from window , followed by FRITZ , who carries a basket . LOUIS ( advances ) It is all right , Fritz  --  we are safe now . That must have been old Grindstone that we dodged through the coppice . p. 10 FRITZ I never was more frightened in my life ; I 'm sure that my heart was fairly down in the heel of my shoe , as one may say . Why , bless me ! good gracious ! oh la ! did one ever ! LOUIS Do n't be a fool , little Fritz . What are you " Oh , la-ing ! " and " Good gracious-ing ! " about ? FRITZ Just look at that table  --  all higgledy-piggledy , as one may say . There 's a funny way to lay a cloth for supper . LOUIS As we have brought a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put everything in order , before Julie and Mariette come . Poor girls ! if dancing has made them half as hungry as my long walk has made me , they will not be long before they appear in court . Come , Fritz , be quick , or we shall not be ready before the ladies arrive . FRITZ Now do n't hurry a body , as one may say  --  I do not like it ; in fact , I violently object to all such hasty proceedings . ( they bustle about , and arrange the table ) LOUIS What did you bring in that basket , Fritz ? FRITZ A cold goose , some sausages , and an apple tart ; two bottles of cider , and a dish of plums . Here they are ! ( takes out dishes and arranges them on table ) p. 11 LOUIS ( stumbles over SACKS ' basket ) Why who could have brought this ?  --  Cold pig ! cheese ! FRITZ Our sweethearts , of course . How thoughtful of the dear creatures ! That cold pig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body may say . LOUIS One can scarcely ascertain that fact without previously tasting it . Suppose that we  --   --  FRITZ Sit down , and just try what it is like . I am quite of your opinion , Mr. Louis . ( they sit at table , and begin eating ) LOUIS It would be a pity to disarrange the table , or I should have suggested an attack on the goose . We will give the little girls ten minutes ' grace , and then  --   --  FRITZ ( speaking with his mouth full ) Then we 'll commence supper in earnest . ( BERNARD peeps from closet , exclaims very loudly " Ahem ! " and pops in again ) LOUIS What are you aheming about , Fritz ? FRITZ Me ahem ! I did n't ahem , as one may say . LOUIS Do n't do it again ; it startles me so . MAX ( looking over back of chair ) What are you doing there ? ( disappears behind chair ) p. 12 FRITZ Eh  --  was that you , Louis ? LOUIS Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise ) FRITZ This is n't pleasant , as one may say . I begin to think , Louis , there 's some one hid somewhere , as one may say . LOUIS ( listens ) Hush , do ! There 's some one coming . Quick  --  hide under the table  --  we shall be concealed there . FRITZ And at the same time I 'll finish off the cold pig . ( they both creep under the table , the cloth of which should touch the ground on all sides ) Re-enter SACKS , with a loaf , R. SACKS At last I have found a loaf ; and now I suppose I shall be allowed to begin supper . ( puts loaf on table ) My conscience ! what does all this mean ? I have a vivid recollection that I brought in sundry savoury preparations of pork , which I find transformed ( examines dishes ) into roast goose , tart , and plums . I have n't been walking in my sleep ; I am not dozing ; I do n't see double . ( pinches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not morally , I am wide awake . Who can it be that has so politely secured this second repast . Hallo ! here 's more hocus-pocus work . Somebody  --  I name no names , so I ca n't give offence  --  but I wish merely to hint that some one has feloniously decamped with someone else 's property , leaving this in exchange . Here are my baskets emptied  --  positively emptied . That 's cool ! I shall at once confiscate the deposit . First let me ascertain that all is right . ( Music  --  SACKS looks behind screen , closes window , and draws the curtain  --  whilst his back is turned , LOUIS and FRITZ come from under the table , remove all the dishes , and hide behind screen  --  SACKS , advancing with great pomposity ) posity ) Mr. Sacks , may I request the honour of your company to supper ? ( bows ) Sir , I shall feel delighted . ( bowing ) Mr. Sacks , allow me to conduct you to the head of the table . ( bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) After you , sir . ( bows ) Oh , sir , you are too polite . ( as he turns up stage , the four YOUNG MEN disappear into their several hiding places  --  SACKS seats himself at the head of the table ) p. 13 SACKS Now , my good friend Sacks  --  eh ! oh ! ( starts up ) This is too bad ! the goose is gone . ( comes to front ) I 'm not naturally pusillanimous , but hang it , this is carrying the joke too far , as well as the goose . ( exclaims ) Who is that ? Do n't be a fool ! I know where you are ! under the table . I wish I had courage to look round . ( During this speech SACKS faces the audience , and FRITZ , LOUIS , MAX , and BERNARD bring back the remainder of the supper , place it on the table , and seat themselves , two on either side , leaving the high-backed chair at the head for SACKS ) What is that ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , it is sure to be the cat . Here , puss ! puss ! pussy ! pussy ! ( turns round and perceives the young men , staggers to side ) Oh , my conscience ! I feel as if I was a going to go . ( YOUNG MEN laugh ) Oh please do n't ; consider my nerves . ( they all four rise and run to SACKS , who snatches up a chair to defend himself ) Keep off , I 'm a desperate fellow ! I nearly shot a man one day , only the gun was n't loaded , and did n't go off . BERNARD Is it possible , Sacks , that you do not recognize me , your old friend Bernard ? MAX And I , corporal Max with whom you have smoked many a pipe ? p. 14 LOUIS Surely you recollect me , Louis , clerk to worthy Herr von Botherman  --  the old rascal ! FRITZ You wo n't pretend to say that I 'm not your own loving cousin Fritz ? SACKS ( putting down the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , you are not such rogues as I took you for . But what brings you here in Master Grindstone 's mill , at this hour of the night ? MAX ( slapping him on the shoulder ) To meet our sweethearts , who appointed this place of rendezvous . BERNARD And who intend to slip away from the dancers in the barn , where , alas ! we poor lads are forbidden to shew ourselves . SACKS ( laughing ) Ho , ho , ho ! So you came to meet your sweethearts ? Poor dear deluded boys ! I regret to say that you will all be terribly disappointed . I 've an idea the young ladies do n't intend to come . LOUIS How is that ? Explain ! ALL Yes , yes  --  explain if you can . SACKS Now do n't lose your tempers , young gentlemen ; but the fact is , that for some reason or other , my excellent master , Grindstone , the magistrate 's deputy , has forbidden the dance to take place to-night , and has commanded all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which must account for their non-appearance. p. 15 FRITZ What a shame ! and I brought a beautiful goose . SACKS Do n't let the memory of the goose affect you , cousin Fritz . I see that you have prepared a snug supper . Suppose that we sit down to it , and thus console ourselves for the absence of the young ladies . BERNARD Well , I consent ; but every mouthful I eat of the goose will remind me of my dear Ida . MAX Nonsense , man ! I vote for supper instanter , and little sacks shall be president . ALL Agreed ! Agreed ! SACKS If you insist on it , I 'm agreeable ; so we 'll stand on no ceremony , but fall to at once . ( they all sit at table , SACKS in the tall chair at head , and begin eating ) Really , considering all things , we are as well off here as in the barn . MAX I am of your opinion , Sacks , though my little Georgette is perhaps breaking her heart . BERNARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't fancy anything of the kind , particularly after the scolding they all gave me . But to prove that I bear no malice , I 'll propose a toast . Here 's to the ladies , or if you like it better , here 's to the young ladies . p. 16 ALL Here 's to the young ladies ! Well done , Sacks ! SACKS I would on this occasion , gentlemen , make a speech , only there happens to be nothing to make a speech about . ( a loud whistle is heard ) Hark ! what is that ? Who is that whistling ? ( they all rise ) It sounds exactly like Master Grindstone 's whistle . I should know it among a thousand . Now be quiet , all of you , boys , whilst I run out and look about me . Exit , L. LOUIS Why , who can it be ? FRITZ Good gracious ; is there any danger ? MAX Danger , you little poltroon ! Not whilst I am here to defend you . BERNARD Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should like to know ? Re-enter SACKS , hurriedly , L. SACKS Run , run and hide , every man jack of you , or you will be in a fearful scrape . MAX What 's the matter , Sacks ? SACKS Matter enough ! Master Grindstone has returned , but who he can be whistling to I do n't know . He 'll be sure to come here . ALL What will become of us ? MAX Hide us somewhere , do . p. 17 SACKS Hush  --  keep your senses about you . First clear away these things , then till the place is clear again , hide yourselves anywhere . Music , " Oh dear , what can the matter be . " They all bustle about , stow away the supper in the closet , into which MAX and BERNARD enter , and slam the door in the face of FRITZ and LOUIS , who also run to it . The two last hide under the table , and SACKS blows out the candle , and hides behind the window curtain . Very melodramatic music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lanthorn , L.  --  he lights the candle on table , and then looks cautiously round . GRINDSTONE Good ! All is quiet  --  not a soul here . ( SACKS peeps from behind curtain ) That rogue , Sacks , I am thankful to say , is out of the way  --  snoring in his cock loft  --  I heard him as I came in . Now to let in the Chevalier . ( SACKS disappears behind curtains  --  GRINDSTONE goes on tiptoe behind screen , claps his hands three times , and returns ) That is the signal agreed on : it is to signify that all is safe , and that he may enter by the old passage . Enter CHEVALIER D'ESPION , from behind screen , he also wears a large cloak , and a slouched hat . p. 18 CHEVALIER D'ESPION Is all safe ? GRINDSTONE Not so much as a mouse stirring , on the honour of an honest miller . ( bows ) CHEVALIER D'ESPION An honest miller ! Well , that is a novelty now a-days . But I am afraid Master Grindstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat secured on the wrong side of the river . Of course you do not guess  --  in fact you do not know anything at all of the business that brings me here to night . GRINDSTONE Nothing , your excellency , but what you are pleased that I should know . CHEVALIER D'ESPION It will be better for you to remain in perfect ignorance of this little affair ; so remember that you forget everything connected with it . GRINDSTONE I will be deaf , dumb , and even blind , if your excellent Excellency wishes it . CHEVALIER D'ESPION Exactly what I do wish ; let this be a sign , that I appreciate your great zeal . ( gives a purse ) Retire now ; keep watch ; and should any unpleasant intruders demand admittance here in the name of the law , give the signal whistle  --  and then  --   --  GRINDSTONE Knock them down , my lord ! p. 19 CHEVALIER D'ESPION No , admit them , and tell them as many falsehoods as you conveniently can call to mind . I shall take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you value your ears , keep out of earshot , and watch the outer entry . GRINDSTONE I shall obey your orders , most illustrious sir . Exit door , R. CHEVALIER D'ESPION The success of this plot will make the fortune of my illustrious patron ; and should we be interrupted I have taken my measures so well , that detection is next to an impossibility . Where have my confederates concealed themselves so effectually ? for I know they have arrived , I watched their entrance from my hiding place . This closet for instance  --  ( opens closet door , and discovers MAX and BERNARD ) Enter , gentlemen , our other friends are here no doubt . MAX Our other friends ! we are only two harmless lads , I assure you , sir . CHEVALIER D'ESPION Yes , yes , I understand ; you are perfectly right . A corporal in the regiment near Potzentausend , and your companion there , an honest young farmer . BERNARD ( aside to MAX ) He knows us ! CHEVALIER D'ESPION This table shelters two others , perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who scramble to their feet ) Admirably managed ! a peasant boy , and one of the learned profession ; your disguise is excellent . p. 20 FRITZ ( aside to LOUIS ) We are found out , as one may say . LOUIS ( to FRITZ ) Mum ! not a word ! Keep your own counsel . CHEVALIER D'ESPION There is  --  or ought to be a fifth . Ah ! ha ! That curtain , I did not perceive it . ( draws aside curtain , and discovers SACKS ) We only wait for you , sir , to commence the conference . SACKS Goodness me ! I 'm getting into a scrape , I 'm thinking . CHEVALIER D'ESPION We had better be seated . I will preside , and hear the report of each in succession . ( the CHEVALIER seats himself at the head of table in the high-backed chair , the four young MEN sit , two on either side  --  and SACKS brings forward an old stool , and seats himself R. of table ) Now , gentlemen , as caution is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by name . I will first address my neighbour , the corporal  --   --  MAX Corporal Max , so please you , of the Potzentausend Chasseurs , absent on leave . CHEVALIER D'ESPION Exactly so ! you have learnt your lesson I see . Then , as a military man , and doubtless renowned for politeness and gallantry , you will know who is meant by the " Fair Lady . " What is your opinion of her conduct ? Has she kept her word ? p. 21 MAX Well , I ca n't say that she has , and I begin to fear  --  CHEVALIER D'ESPION Ha ! what !  --  speak ! MAX That she is playing me false with a rival . ( aside ) Now Miss Ida , if that fellow is making up to you , he has a bit of my mind . CHEVALIER D'ESPION ( making a note in pocket book . ) Then it is as we feared  --  the Marchioness will betray Austria . That Pompadour is a very Machiavelli. ( to BERTRAND ) You represent the Agricultural interests : what says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Grumbles as much as ever  --  talks of lowering the wages  --  complains of the scarcity of wool  --  CHEVALIER D'ESPION ( aside ) Worse still  --  the Farmer-General against us ; after being been allowed to fleece the nation . Where shall we get money for the secret service ? ( to LOUIS ) Surely you have better news . What will the Law do on the occasion ? You know to what I allude , the great case now pending . LOUIS ( aside ) I do n't know anything of the kind but I 'll say something at a venture . Oh  --  ah  --  yes  --  well  --  I think we shall win the day . p. 22 CHEVALIER D'ESPION Indeed ! That makes amends for all ! ( aside ) If the Chancellor is our friend , we can make head against the rest ( to FRITZ ) As the deputy from the rural interests , that is the country people , what is your opinion ? FRITZ Well , sir , my opinion is that provided you treat them well they are all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , making note ) Ripe for revolt , but we must be liberal in bribes , and promises . ( to FRITZ ) I look upon you , friend , as a great moral philosopher . FRITZ Oh do n't , sir ,  --  I do assure you , I 'm one of the honestest , hard-workingest boys in the province , as one may say . CHEVALIER D'ESPION Your zeal is appreciated . ( to SACKS ) Now my hitherto silent , and discreet friend . SACKS ( aside ) Ah ! I thought he would n't forget me . Now for it . ( CHEVALIER rises , approaches SACKS , who jumps up and retreats as the other advances . ) CHEVALIER D'ESPION ( aside to SACKS ) Fear nothing  --  I know all . p. 23 SACKS Really now ! Well that is wonderful : what all about the goose , and cold pig , and the wine ? CHEVALIER D'ESPION Hush ! caution ! those at the table know literally nothing at all of the grand plan . SACKS Plan ! what plan ? CHEVALIER D'ESPION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SACKS ( aside ) The illustrious Sacks ! That is meant for me . CHEVALIER D'ESPION I recognise in you his envoy  --  the only man fit to be trusted . Tell him the mill is in danger ; he will know to what I allude . SACKS The mill in danger . Had I not better run and tell master Grindstone ? ( a loud whistle is heard ) Eh , what is that . ( BERNARD , MAX , LOUIS , and FRITZ start up ) CHEVALIER D'ESPION It means that we are surprised : that signal is my warning . ( noise within ) Ha ! they approach . But be under no apprehension , either on your account , or mine ; and recollect to keep up the character you have assumed  --  that of five young fellows who have met here to have a little private merry-making . SACKS Well , and so we are  --  five honest lads . p. 24 CHEVALIER D'ESPION Our nextinterview will be decisive . Be cautious in your replies . Farewell  --  my path lies here . Exit behind screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be in a hobble , if we are found out ; so let us all hide  --  I hear Grindstone coming . ALL Yes , yes  --  let us hide . SACKS And if we are discovered , leave everything to me  --  I will get you off . Run into the closet , all of you ! ( the four YOUNG MEN hide in closet , FRITZ attempts to enter first , but is put aside by MAX , LOUIS , and BERNARD follow MAX , and finally FRITZ goes in ) SACKS ( listens ) Yes  --  they are coming . Master Grindstone is talking pretty loud too . Well , I 've done nothing ! So here I 'll sit . Walk in , gentlemen , as soon as you please . ( sits on stool near table , and slouches his hat over his face ) Enter GRINDSTONE , OFFICER , and TWO SOLDIERS , L. GRINDSTONE You can search the house if you choose , sir , and begin by this room . OFFICER ( to SOLDIERS ) Secure the door , and shoot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) A man here ! p. 25 GRINDSTONE I assure you , captain , on the word of an honest miller , I know not who it can be . OFFICER ( to SACKS ) Speak , fellow  --  who are you ? SACKS ( rising ) Please , noble captain , I am only Sacks . OFFICER Sacks ! and in the name of wonder , who is Sacks ? SACKS I am only Sacks  --  master Grindstone 's man . OFFICER You have had accomplices , villain ! SACKS ( looking at GRINDSTONE ) Yes , I confess  --  there have been persons here  --  that  --  that I would rather not betray . OFFICER ( holding his sword to SACKS ' throat ) Instantly confess that you have been concealed in this room . GRINDSTONE Yes , rascal , confess ! ( aside ) I 'll lay all the blame on him . SACKS I will if you will remove your sword . OFFICER Well , there  --  proceed ! SACKS ( looking at GRINDSTONE ) I was concealed behind the curtain . p. 26 OFFICER And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . OFFICER ( to SOLDIERS ) Search for them ! ( OFFICER walks up to window  --  SOLDIERS search behind screen , under table ) SACKS ( aside to GRINDSTONE ) I say , master ! I know all . But just confirm the truth of what I confess , and you shall come off with flying colours . ( to OFFICER who comes forward ) Most noble captain , you and your men of valour may save yourselves all further trouble , by just peeping into yonder closet . OFFICER A closet ! Oh ho ! ( opens the door suddenly FRITZ tumbles out  --  he collars him ) Now young man , who are you ? and what brings you here ? FRITZ Please , I am only Fritz , farmer Hildberg 's boy ; a harmless lad , as one may say . OFFICER ( throwing him off ) A harmless lad indeed ! And who are these ? ( goes to closet , and drags out LOUIS , MAX , and BERNARD follow ) Pray who are these fellows ? ( preceives MAX ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the conspirators ! How is this , Max ? Why are you here ? p. 27 MAX ( salutes la militaire ) Absent on leave , captain . OFFICER And who are your companions ? GRINDSTONE Yes , fellow , who are they ? Why , as I live I declare they are only Bernard and Louis . Captain , I told you it was all a mistake ; bless you , there are no conspirators here , I know every one of them . SACKS If you , noble captain , will allow me , I can explain everything . You see , sir , to-night was to have been the conclusion of the village fte , when all the lads and lasses were to have finished the revels , by a dance in Master Grindstone 's barn ; and these four young gentlemen came for the purpose of seeing their sweethearts , who had promised to meet , and sup with them here . ( aside to GRINDSTONE ) Now do n't you contradict me , or I 'll betray the secret . OFFICER Well , Sacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason or other the dance was postponed , my young friends would not be disappointed ; so they determined to have supper , and we were enjoying ourselves very much , when you interrupted us . OFFICER A very plausible story ; but who will vouch for the truth of it . SACKS ( runs to closet , brings out the supper , holds up the goose ) Behold my proofs ! You must know , captain , that Fritz , my rural friend , not thinking his own company sufficient , brought another goose to keep him in countenance . ( OMNES laugh ) And as to the little disappointment touching the ball , Master Grindstone intends to put that all to rights  --  do n't you , master ? p. 28 GRINDSTONE To be sure I do . SACKS He only put it off in order to do the thing handsomely ; so he means to have a famous ball and supper to-morrow night , to which he invites you , sir , and moreover , he has in his pocket a certain purse  --   --  OFFICER A purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the young folks to buy them all fairings . GRINDSTONE ( aside to SACKS ) You villain ! SACKS Not another grumble ! Out with the purse , master . GRINDSTONE ( gives purse to SACKS ) Here it is , captain  --  exactly as Sacks has told you . OFFICER And as we have really discovered nothing , I presume there is nothing to discover . The Chevalier d'Espion , whom I came to arrest , is certainly not here . SACKS Most decidedly he is not , captain  --  and thus ends THE PLOT OF POTZENTAUSEND. ( the Curtain drops to the Air of " Over the Sea " )
