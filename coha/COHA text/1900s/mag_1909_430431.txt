 |p799  1 . THE point at which any true appreciation of the short story begins is the clear perception that it is a distinct form of art ; and the reason why the older novelists so rarely succeeded in the short story is that they did not apprehend this . If we bear in mind the three principles , that the short story must be complete in itself , that it is short because it can not be long , and that it consists of a single incident , we can readily apply a critical test , which , while not infallible , nevertheless affords a valuable means of discrimination . Let us take the test of completeness and apply it to Dickens 's exquisite story of " Boots at the Holly Tree Inn . " The story as Dickens writes it straggles over a great variety of themes . We have an embittered lover , a detailed description of a mail-coach journey , of a snow-storm. of an inn , of his own ennui , of his own curious imaginings , elaborated in thousands of words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holly Tree has to tell . No fewer than thirty-seven pages consist of extraneous matter , while the story itself is told in thirteen pages . It is not until the Boots begins to speak that the story begins ; up to this point we are engaged in the tedious reflections of Charles Dickens , mixed with a great amount of totally irrelevant detail . Dickens himself must have been conscious of these defects , for when he prepared the story for a public reading he ruthlessly cut away all about the mailcoach , the snow-storm , the struggling horses , and so forth , and came at once to the incident which the Boots repeats with so much humor and pathos . Why , then , did he not write the story in this form ? Simply because he had not grasped the principle that a short story must be complete in itself . The moment he  |p800  brought his work to the test of oral and dramatic delivery this principle was discovered clearly enough . And it may be added that there is no better test of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is read aloud , the interest of the hearer is in exact proportion to the direct appeal of the story ; and the inattention of the hearer is the sure indication of the lack of direct appeal . The hearer of a spoken story resents everything in the nature of excrescence ; he finds mere description tedious ; he is intent only on the living issue . Dickens discovered this when he submitted his work to an oral test ; the true short-story writer will not need such a test to teach him the law of dramatic completeness . In contrast let us take such a story as Kipling 's " Matter of act , " not because it is his best story , but because here also there is a great amount of description . But with Kipling the description is vital to the story , whereas in Dickens it is not . The story begins abruptly with a rapid sketch of three journalists on a tramp steamer making for Southampton . The dramatic note is instantly struck in the cry of the sweating steersman that something is wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sea , with its oily surface , its sudden inexplicable upheaval and run of gray water , is legitimate art , because it is all necessary to the fearful apparition of the wounded sea-serpent , flung up from the ice-cold depths of ocean by the explosion of a submarine volcano . And although the story ends in London , yet its unity is never violated ; and , more wonderful still , although it ends in ridicule and humor , yet its impression of horror is not destroyed . In this case Kipling 's powers of description do not hinder his story ; they are not felt to be excrescence ; and for this reason : that they are vitally necessary to the theme . We do not need the snow-storm and the mail-coach to explain the eloping children in Dickens 's story ; we do need the horror of the bewitched sea to explain the state of mind in the three journalists . We can cut away three-fourths of Dickens 's story , as he himself did when he made it a public reading , without essential loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single sentence of Kipling 's without deterioration of the total effect . The one does not obey the law of essential completeness and the other does . Let us apply the second test , that the short story is short because it can not be long . A good example of the reverse of this principle may be found in Hardy 's great tale of " The Withered  |p801  Arm . " It is a most dramatic story and may rank among the great achievements of Hardy 's genius . It concerns a group of persons , each drawn with vital truth : a farmer who brings home a young and sweet woman as his bride ; a wronged woman , who has a son by the farmer , and a wise man or wizard . The bride 's arm withers and she loses the love of her husband . The illegitimate son commits arson and is condemned to death . The young wife goes to the gaol that she may put her withered arm on the neck of a man newly hanged , having been told by the wizard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanged man is her husband 's son , and she meets her husband as he stands overwhelmed with grief and contrition beside his son 's corpse . Here is a story capable of great elaboration . Considered only as a plot , it is as full of dramatic possibilities as " Tess of the D'Urbervilles . " Obviously it might have been treated with the same fulness ; all that is needed is an elaboration of incidents , such as Hardy excels in ; as , for example , the previous history of the wronged woman , the events leading up to the marriage of the farmer , the character of the outcast son and the general background of country life and manners . So treated , it might have taken rank with the greatest of Hardy 's novels ; Hardy chose to compress it within the limits of forty pages . But this compression is purely arbitrary . Its result is an abbreviated novel , but not a short story . The single incident of the woman visiting the gaol to find a cure for her disease in a horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate short story ; as it is the result is a miniature novel , which has all the characteristics of the novel except its length and none of the features of a short story . If we contrast with this Quiller-Couch 's story of " The Drawn Blind , " we at once see the difference in method . Here also we have the story of a son who is hanged and the pathetic invulnerable faith of the mother in his innocence . These two persons , in their mutual relations , compose the entire story . The mother is so certain of the acquittal of her son that she has prepared a feast for him on his release ; when the fatal verdict is announced , she extinguishes the lights and drops the blind . That is all . There is obviously not enough material here for a novel ; but there is just enough for a successful short story . Spread out into a novel the interest could not be sustained ; and the incident itself is so dramatic that any additional incidents would weaken the  |p802  effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be told in no other way . And this we may take as a sufficing test . Of the short story proper , it is always true that it could be nothing else but what it is . If it could just as well have been elaborated into a novel , it is not a short story , but only a novel in miniature . And this gives sanction to the third principle of the short story ? viz. , that it consists not of several related incidents , but of one incident . In a sense this is untrue to nature , because in actual life every incident is related to some other incident , of which it is either the cause or the effect . But one can pluck a rose without investigating the secrets of its growth , and it is not necessary to trace that growth through all the series of its vicissitudes in order to be aware of its charm , its color or its fragrance . if art violates nature in giving us the unrelated incident , it is for the sound reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much as well as too little for a just appreciation of art . The great artist is he who knows how to interest without fatiguing us ; who gives us just enough knowledge of his theme to invest with overwhelming significance what he chooses to reveal ; who makes one 's imagination the confederate with his own by leaving us to supply much which he only suggests . Thus Dickens fails in the story already described , because he tells us more than we want to know ; and many other writers fail by attempting to blend several incidents instead of centralizing the attention on one . Hardy fails for the same reason in " The Withered Arm , " considered as a short story ; he gives us a series of incidents legitimate enough in a novel , but confusing in a short story . But Kipling succeeds in the best of his stories by his perfect centrality of aim . He has a single situation to depict , and he is not distracted from it for a moment by any side issues . We do not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying sea-serpent than what he chooses to tell us . The central incident is the sea-serpent , and the central interest is the effect on each man 's mind of what he sees . Had he told us how the three men came together , how one had gone in quest of gold to South Africa , and another had fought in a native war , and the third had explored the mountains of the Moon , however vividly he might have written , he would nevertheless have spoiled his story . No amount of fine writing could have atoned for confusion of interest . The finest writing in a  |p803  short story is that which takes us quickest to the very heart of the matter in hand . The most characteristic - note of the short story is then immediacy . It is of its very essence that it should be dramatic from the start . If it fails to arrest attention with its first paragraph it is likely to fail altogether . It affords no opportunity for that slow building-up of character and situation which is common in the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly legitimate and even compulsory to the novelist is wholly impossible to the short-story writer . The short story stands related to the novel very much as the vivid impressionist sketch does to the painstaking picture . The picture is built up by months of toil ; its final harmony is the result of thousands of little strokes , of much stippling and repainting . But the sketch is achieved with a full brush in a confident hand and conveys its impression instantly . Oscar Wilde once said of Kipling 's stories that they were " life seen by flashes of vulgarity . " One may ignore the charge of vulgarity , but there is no doubt about the flash . It was by virtue of this incomparable directness , this rapid confident brush-work , that Kipling at once arrested the attention of the public . " His name was Charlie Mears " ? so Kipling begins what he calls " The Finest Story in the World " without preface , without preliminary . No wonder the literary scribes and pharisees were offended in him . According to their traditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something almost brutal in this abruptness . The ancient school of landscape art in the same way had a tradition that there was a certain place in a landscape where a brown tree must appear , and the tradition was held sacred until suddenly Turner startled the world with masses of living color in which no brown tree appeared . From that hour landscape art was revolutionized . And a similar revolution of literary ideals has followed the triumph of the short-story writer . He has taught the novelists themselves the value of immediacy . and . while the novelist of the older school still clings to the law of slow approach . almost all the newer writers have learned how to cut away preliminaries and to get at the heart of their story with a celerity which would have scandalized the writers of an earlier generation . It must not be assumed , however , that because the short story occupies but a small canvas it is therefore inferior to the novel ,  |p804  for this would constitute bulk as the standard of value . The entire witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such a conclusion . A fine intaglio may be as great a work of art as a Grecian statue ; a square foot of Gerald Dow 's painting is much more valuable than one of Haydon 's interminable yards of canvas ; and a lyric of a dozen lines of Burns is much more precious than a hundred epical pages of " The Earthly Paradise . " The fact is that it is much more difficult to write a perfect short story than a successful novel . It demands superior gifts of concentration , of ingenuity , of fantasy , of originality , of dramatic intensity , of exquisite craftsmanship . The novel can afford to have its lapses , its relatively dull moments , its pages of reflection ; it even gains by them , for they afford a necessary contrast to its dramatic climax . But the short story can afford to have nothing of the kind . The eagerness of its movement must be continuous and sustained . And this is , perhaps , why the regular novelist so rarely succeeds in the short story . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate , too discursive ; his touch is not light enough , his method is not sufficiently rapid . He frequently betrays his ignorance of his medium at every turn . He writes condescendingly or reluctantly ; he makes us feel that he grudges throwing away a good motif ; or he adopts some purely mechanical device , such as combining a series of episodes , which are neither in themselves short stories nor in their combination a true novel . The latter method was adopted by Barrie in his " Window in Thrums " and by Ian Maclaren in his " Bonnie Briar Bush . " The result is not unpleasant ; but the various episodes do not stand by themselves and therefore are not short stories . For no writer will ever succeed in the art of the short story who does not thoroughly understand that it is a form of art wholly separate from any other ; and that it is also a four of art which is at once so difficult and delicate that it worthily challenges the highest qualities of genius . As regards the throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man can not enter on the career of the shortstory writer who is parsimonious in motifs . But the extravagance is more apparent than real , for the reason that the motif which makes a great short story can rarely be utilized in any other way . It is possible to expand a short story into a novel ; Mr. A. E. W. Mason has done it successfully in " The Four Feathers . "  |p805  It is possible to transform it into a play ; Mr. Jerome has done it in the " Passing of the Third Floor Back . " But such instances must be ranked with the exceptions . As a rule , the essential factor in a great short story is that it can be expressed in no other way with anything like the same success . Who would attempt to create a novel out of Kipling 's sea-serpent story , out of the " Incarnation of Khrisna Mulvaney , " out of " The Finest Story in the World " ? We recognize at once how impossible such a feat would be . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short story . Life consists both of prolonged sequences and of flashing episodes . The first afford the material of the novelist , the second of the short-story writer . And life is so rich in episode to the observant and adventurous that he is much more likely to suffer from embarrassment of material than from poverty . It may be true that hit the plots of the novelist have been used before , but that is only because the novelist persists in the use of a certain type of plot . But the episodical wealth of life is inexhaustible . A year 's study of a daily newspaper may furnish the short-story writer with more material than he is likely to utilize in a lifetime . A face seen in a crowd . gossip overheard in a tavern , a conversation at a street door , the revelations of hostile eyes in meeting or in parting , the sudden passing of insignificant men and women across the beam of his questing searchlight ? these are enough to excite his imagination . to start the wheels of fantasy ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , and to report truthfully what he sees , he need never lack material for the warp and woof of the stories he can spin . II . So long as the three-volume novel reigned supreme and magazines held to the tradition of the long serial , there was neither opportunity nor motive for the British writer to practise the art of short-story writing . But the conditions which repressed the short story in England acted powerfully for its benefit in America . If we investigate the position of the American writer of fiction of the last century some extremely interesting facts are noticeable . The chief of these facts is that almost all the novels read by the American public were of British origin . There was no international copyright law , and the most that a British novelist could do to secure any reward from America was to sell advance  |p806  sheets of his book to an American publisher . Obviously this was a very exiguous device to protect his interests . It broke down the moment his book was pirated , which it invariably was within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only was it pirated , but sold broadcast at extremely low prices . It is patent that the American novelist had no chance at all in this competition . Who would buy the work of a native author of local fame when he could purchase for a trifle the latest novel of Dickens or Thackeray ? The result was that there was a very poor market for native fiction . The pirate publisher of those days did a great deal more than injure the British author by robbing him of his just reward ; he injured yet more fatally the American author by robbing him of all chance of successful authorship . Driven from the field of legitimate fiction by unjust competition , there was but one road to success left open to him ? the magazine and the short story . Here , at least , he was free from rivalry , for here was a demand which could not be supplied from British sources . Therefore , it was to the short story that the rising school of American writers of fiction devoted their attention . Among these writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excelled in the brief sketch rather than the short story proper . It is only at a certain heat of the creative faculty that he attains pure narrative . Grave , wise , genial , he is apt to write with leisurely ease , in a mood of reflection rather than with directness and intensity . Hawthorne displays the same tendency , though in a much less degree . He is apt to delay his dramatic moment by philosophical observation , to be tediously analytical when the theme demands intensity , to stifle the fire of his imagination under a dull weight of pedantry . It may even be said that Hawthorne 's true and fine genius often appears to work in some obstructive medium ; at least that is the impression which he frequently produces on the reader . It may have been distrust of his own powers , a kind of intellectual shyness , a native difficulty in speaking out . It may have arisen in large degree from his own inborn habits of introspection and metaphysical analysis . It may have consisted of a constantly changing combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there , a resisting medium which gives the sense of effort to his work . In all his best work he conquers this obstruction . And in the short story he is at his best . His outstanding claim  |p807  is that he applies a profound psychology to the art of fiction . He deals not with the surfaces of life , but with the depths . He delights in the exploration of what Arthur Hallam called " the abysmal depths of personality . He has a keen eye for the dramatic moment . His themes are uniformly significant and often of extraordinary fascination . In all that concerns the technique of the short story he is a great master . This technical excellence has been again and again recognized , and by later critics so completely that they have unhesitatingly chosen some of Hawthorne 's stories as the perfect models of what a short story ought to be . But the true creator of the modern short story in American literature is neither Irving nor Hawthorne : that honor belongs to Poe . Poe brought to his task precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unusual subtlety , an imagination of extraordinary vividness , a faculty of observation only less extraordinary , and , above all , a mind wholly free . wholly unfettered by tradition and almost insolently scornful of accepted canons . His self-confidence is superb ; in a man less singularly gifted it would have been ridiculous . His originality is unquestioned ; and the witness to this originality is found in the fact that he was the first man to recognize completely the artistic possibilities of the short story . He found in it a sufficient vehicle for the expression of his genius . He brought to it the highest and rarest genius not only of his age , but of his nation . Both in poetry and in short-story writing Poe stands first in the literature of America . Poe excelled equally in three kinds of story : the story of ingenuity , the story of adventure and the story of horror . To take the first , what stories have surpassed in ingenuity the " Murders in the Rue Morgue " and the " Purloined Letter " ? Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conan Doyle has so successfully copied in his Sherlock Holmes . The same ingenuity , differently applied , distinguishes the great story of " The Gold-Bug . " Many writers have since used cryptograms and concealed in them the secrets of hidden treasure , but there is not one who has ever surpassed Poe in this kind of story . The " Descent into the Maelstrom " and the " Adventure of Hans Pfaall " are equally unique examples of the story of adventure . The latter found an imitator in Jules Verne , but  |p808  the Frenchman 's " Voyage to the Moon " is a dreary pedestrian performance compared with the imaginative daring of Poe ' s narrative . In the story of horror no one has ever pretended to rival him ; and it may be questioned if Stevenson would ever have written " Markheim " had not Poe first written the " TellTale Heart . " The mere fact that we can thus trace the influence of Poe among the most recent and the greatest of modern storywriters is conclusive evidence of his profound originality . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models , without a single counselling voice and without any real recognition or encouragement , he discovered the value of the short story , endowed it with form and method , devoted his rare gifts to its perfection and did each of these things so completely that his own stories have become classic , the value of his method has never been disputed and the form which he gave the short story has become the model of succeeding writers . Perhaps , however , the chief contribution of Poe to the art of the short story lies not so much in form or method as in fantasy . Thus in the " Murders in the Rue Morgue " he fails in immediacy . Again , in " The Gold-Bug " the interest is wrought to the highest pitch when the treasure is found , and the explanation of the cryptogram , infinitely ingenious as it is , coming after the finding of the treasure , has the effect of an anti-climax . Pipling , telling the same story , would probably have commenced with the discovery of the cryptogram and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this is , after all , to say no more than that the technique of the short story has advanced with the practice of the art . The unique claim of Poe is that he endowed the short story with fantasy . He gave it wings , opened the heavens of imagination to it , made it almost a form of poetry and put it on the highest level of literary art . One fault he had which can not be excused : he took a morbid delight in the horrible . This is a constant temptation to the short-story writer . It arises from the need to produce an instant and deep impression ; and such an impression is most readily produced by an illicit appeal to fear . Stevenson makes this appeal in " Thrawn Janet " ; Kipling in many of his stories , notably " The Return of Imray " ; Fanu almost always . In going over the vast literature of short stories , it has been a surprise to the writer to discover how many of them are stories of pure terror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeniable ; yet simply because the appeal to terror is so easily made , it is a kind of appeal which should be very sparingly used . The use which Poe makes of it is constant and therefore illicit . This is his chief fault . Yet against it must be reckoned his extraordinary power of fantasy , and this gift raises his worst theme into the realm of the creative imagination . Poe was essentially poet , a poet whose genius moved habitually on the darker side of life and was deeply tainted by the morbid and the abnormal . It is because he was so essentially a poet that even an illicit theme is redeemed by the wonderful splendor of the imagination with which he bathes it . For , after all , technique is not everything , a truth upon which some insistence needs to be laid to-day because its value is often overestimated . Thus , for example , in what must certainly be reckoned as one of the greatest of all Kipling 's stories , " The Man Who would be King , " there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses in many shorter stories with such superb effect . This story has three distinct episodes . The first concludes on the railway station at Marwar Junction when he delivers Carnehan 's enigmatic message to the red-bearded man in the second-class compartment . The second begins in the newspaper office when Carnelian and Dravot unfold their daring plan of becoming Kings and ends with the starting of the Afghan caravan . The third , which contains the real story , occurs three years later , when Carnelian relates the marvellous adventures of himself and Dravot in Kafiristan , and concludes with that noble touch of fantasy when Carnelian stands in the blinding sun singing : " The Son of God goes forth to war A golden crown to gain , His blood-red banner streams afar Who follows in His train . " The laws of technique are violated , but surely it would be the merest pedantry to insist that therefore this is not a true short story . The sympathetic reader , thrilled with its pathos and its daring , astonished by its imaginative power , conscious of its Homeric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all events a great story , that it is indeed among the greatest of all stories in the English tongue , and he would be right . No , technique is not everything . It is no more than the servant of the shaping  |p810  creative force and must not be allowed to be its master . If it be not elastic enough to serve the end of the creative force , that force will certainly discard and transcend it . By all means let the writer study technique ; it is as useful to him as the life class and the art school are to the artist . But let him also recollect that technique alone never yet made a great artist . It is at best but the weapon of success ; for while a writer may succeed with an imperfect knowledge of technique , it is certain that he can not succeed without the creative imagination . To forget this is to magnify the lesser things of the law and to forget the eternal verities . And this is but to say in plainer language that in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most . Great writing is always the expression of great personality . It is well to be acquainted with the unities of composition , but if that is all we know nothing awaits us but barrenness and failure . When a Shakespeare arises , he pours such floods of flame into the old dramatic forms that they are utterly dissolved , and none regret them but the pedants , with whom form counts for more than spirit . Here , as elsewhere , it is the letter that killeth , it is the spirit that giveth life . The cardinal questions to be addressed to a writer of short stories are these : Has he any vital message to communicate ? Has he any sincere experience to impart ? Has he seen life for himself , from his own angle of vision , and seen it truthfully and completely ? Has he the creative force that makes us see what he sees , feel what he has felt , comprehend what he has comprehended ? These are the inexorable questions , and the greatest writers of short stories have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not to be evaded on the plea of technique ; personality transcends technique . The short story , more than any other form of literature , must have individuality ; and to have it it must be impregnated with the personality of the writer . It is from this source that it derives its color , its charm , its power to arrest and please . Poe and Kipling , Stevenson and Hawthorne , write nothing that is not impregnated with personality , and this is the deepest secret of their fame . The most miraculous color in the picture is always that which is derived from the life-blood of the artist . @#
