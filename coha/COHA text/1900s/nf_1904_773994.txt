txt // tariff and free trade whims , their gold or silver craze . Mechanics have their one ideal way of doing their work . I know horse-shoers that have such faith in bar shoes that they believe it will cure everything from contraction to heaves . Others have such a faith in toe weight that they will guarantee that in a horse shod this way the front quarters will run so fast that they must put wheels under the hind feet to enable them to keep up with the front feet ; and in a threemile race the front quarters will reach the stables in time to feed on a peck of oats before the hind quarters catch up . In some States there is a union craze . All that these schemes will do is to prepare the legislatures for the legislation that will some day be asked of them . Unions have been organized and the objections are the same . I object to all these schemes because they fall short of their purpose . Two years age the horse-shoers of Minnesota asked the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prominent member of the house of representatives and asked him to put his influence against the measure . He did so , with the result that the bill was killed so far as the counties and smaller towns were concerned . Such a law will only provide for an extra tax on the poor smiths and horse-shoers , and his chances of making a living will not be bettered , because no one will be shut out , no matter how incompetent . MODERN BLACKSMITHING zi TAXATION WILL NEVER RAISE THE STANDARD OF A MECHANIC It deprives him of the means whereby to raise himself . Such a law will only create offices to grease the machinery for the political party in power . THE only thing that will ever elevate the standard of workmanship is education education and nothing but education . Give us a law that will provide for a certain degree of education before a boy is allowed to serve as an apprentice ; and that he will not be allowed to start out for himself until he has served the full term , both as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be issued to him . I see now that I was right when I opposed this law . The horse-shoers of Minnesota are now kicking and cursing the examining board . The National Convention of horse-shoers which was held in Cincinnati passed resolutions which were ordered transmitted to the governor of Illinois , requesting that the board of examiners now authorized to grant // licenses to horse-shoers in that State , be changed , as " The board has failed to accomplish the purpose for which it was instituted ? the elevating of the standard of workmanship of horse-shoers of that State . " Unions are all right in every place where there is only one smith , let that smith unite with himself to charge a living price for his work and he is all right . Where there are more than one smith unions will only help the dishonest fellow . Such unions live but for a short time and then the smiths knife each other worse than ever . In hard times ( and hard times are now like the poor , " always with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blacksmith business . If they could make a dollar a day in something else they would stay out , but this being impossible , they think it better to try at the anvil . For them to get anything to do without cutting prices is out of the question , and so the cutting business begins , and ends when the regular smith has come down to the tinker 's price . To remedy this we must go to the root of the evil . First , political agitation against a system whereby labor is debased . This is a fact , in spite of all prosperity howling . Whenever there is trouble between labor and capital we will always find the whole machinery of the government ready to protect capital . The laboring men will not even be allowed to meet , but will be dispersed like so many dogs . They are the mob ! But the capitalists , they are gentlemen ! When the government wants a tailor for instructor in our Indian schools , or a blacksmith for the reservation , they get about // $600. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office he must have $5,000 per year . What inducement is it , under such conditions , for a young man to learn a trade ? Laboring men , wake up ! But , as this will bring us into politics I shall leave this side of the question , for it would do no good . Thomas Jefferson , in the Declaration of Independence said : " Mankind are more disposed to suffer , while the evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed . " The laboring people will , in my judgment , suffer quite a while yet . In the meantime let us build up a fraternity on the ruins of the ancient guilds . Between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries mechanics of all kinds prospered as never before , nor have they done it since . The reason for this was not a high protective tariff , or anything in that line , but simply the fruit of the guilds and the privilege they enjoyed from the state . What we now need is a modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing the legislation necessary , but we will not ask more than the doctors now have . I can not now go into detail ; that would take more room and time than I can spare in this book . // ONE thing is certain , we have a hard row to hoe , because , this is a government of injunctions , and any law on the statute book is in danger of being declared unconstitutional , according to the biddings of the money power , or the whim of the judges . One tyrant is bad , but many are worse . I am no prophet , but will judge the future from the past . History will repeat itself , and Christ 's teachings will be found true : " A house divided against itself can not stand . " I will say so much , however , that no man should be allowed to start out for himself before he has served three years as an apprentice and two or three years as a journeyman . This should be proved by a certificate from the master for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to by his master , one uninter-ested master and himself . No apprentice to be accepted without a certificate from the school superin-tendent that he has a certain knowledge in language and arithmetic and other branches as may be required . It shall not be enough to have worked a few days each year , but the whole time . With these papers he shall appear before three commissioners , elected by the fraternity and appointed by the governor of the State . // He shall pay not less than ten and not more than twenty-five dollars for his diploma . All complaint shall be submitted to these commissioners , and they shall have full power to act . If a practitioner acts unbecoming , runs down his competitor , charges prices below the price fixed by the fraternity , or defrauds his customers , such shall be reported to the commissioners , and , if they see fit , they can repeal or call in his diploma and he shall not be allowed to practice in the State . These are a few hints on the nature of the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a journal edited by one editor on literature and one on mechanics , the editor on mechanics to be a practical blacksmith with not less than fifteen years ' experience . The editors are to be elected by the fraternity . This is all possible if we can get the legislation that the doctors have in many States . And why not ? Mechanics of to-day have a vague and abstract idea of what is meant by journeyman and apprenticeship . In Europe there is yet a shadow left of the guilds where these were in existence . When I learned my trade I worked some time with my father in Sweden , then I went over to Norway and worked as an apprentice in Mathison &; Johnson 's machine , file and lock factory of Christiania . I was requested to sign a contract for four years . In this contract was set forth the wages I was to receive , and what I was to learn each year . Everything was specified so that there would be no room for misunderstanding . The first two weeks I worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good file and a piece of iron , this iron I filed square , round , triangle , hexagon and octagon I wore out files and pieces of iron one after another , the master giving instructions how to stand , hold the file , about the pressure and strokes of same , etc . The same careful instructions were given in blacksmithing . The apprentice was given some work , and he had to forge it out himself , no matter what time it took , nor did it make any difference if the job , when done , was of any use , the apprentice was simply practicing and accustoming himself to the use of tools . Thus the elementary rules were learned in a few weeks , and the apprentice made capable of doing useful service that would repay for the time lost in the start . // LITERATURE SAVING thoroughly learned the trade , it is important to keep posted in this matter by reading books and trade journals . As far as books are concerned , we have a few treating on horse-shoeing , with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , Modern Blacksmithing , " is the first in that line , written by a practical blacksmith and horse-shoer . Our trade journals must be read with discrimination . They are mostly edited by men having no practical experience in the trade , and are therefore not responsible for the articles these papers contain . Many articles are entirely misleading . Blacksmiths having more experience with the pen than the hammer , and anxious to have their names appear in print , write for these journals . Prize articles are also doing more harm than good , the judges giving the prizes to men with ideas like their own , not being broad-minded enough to consider anything they do n't practice themselves , and the result is a premium on old and foolish ideas . But we should not stop at this . We should read much . Anything , except bloody novels , will help to a8 MODERN BLACKSMITHING elevate the man . No smith should think it idle to read and study . " Every kind of knowledge , " observes a writer , " comes into play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fragmentary , even the odds and ends , the merest rag-tags of information . " Some fact , or experience , and sometimes an anecdote , recur to the mind , by the power of association , just in the right time and place . A carpenter was observed to be very particular and painstaking in repairing an old chair of a magistrate , and when asked why , said : " I want this chair to be easy for me to sit in some time . " He lived long enough to sit in it . Hugh Miller found time while pursuing the trade of a stone mason , not only to read , but to write , cultivating his style till he became one of the most facile and brilliant authors of the day . Elihu Burritt acquired a mastery of eighteen languages and twenty-two dialects , not by rare genius , which he disclaimed , but by improving the bits and fragments of time which he had to spare from his occupation as a blacksmith . Let it be a practice or a habit , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to read the same , once , twice , thrice , or until its contents are indelibly impressed upon your mind . It will come back to your mind and be useful when you expect it the least . CHAPTER II No other mechanic will try to turn out such a variety of work with so few tools as the blacksmith , even when the smith has all the tools to be had , he has few in proportion to the work . There are a class of smiths who will be content with almost nothing . These men can tell all about the different kinds of tobacco ; they can tell one kind of beer from another in the first sip , and the smell of the whisky bottle is enough for them to decide the character of the contents , but when it comes to tools which belong to their trade , they are not in it . It ought to be a practice with every smith to add some new tool every year . But if they are approached on the subject they will generally say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With them it is not a question of what they need , but what they can get along without . Some smiths have the Chinaman 's nature ( stubborn conservatism ) to the extent that they will have nothing new , no matter how superior to their old and inferior tools ; what they have been used to is the best . When the hoof shears were a new thing I ordered a pair and handed them to my horse-shoer , he tried them for a few minutes and then threw them on the floor and said , " Yankee humbug . " I picked them up and 29 3o MODERN BLACKSMITHING tried them myself , and it took a few days before I got used to them , but then I found that they were a great improvement over the toe knife . I told my horseshoer to use them and after a while he could not get along without them , but would yet have used his toe knife if it had not been for the fact that he was compelled to use them . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected more or less , we would be far more advanced in everything . The mechanic that has poor tools will in every case be left behind in competition with the man with good tools in proper shape . There are smiths who will take in all kinds of shows and entertainments within fifty miles , but when it comes to tools , oh , how stingy and saving they are . There is no investment which will bring such a good return as first-class tools do to a mechanic . The old maxim , " A mechanic is known by the tools he uses , " is true . Many of the tools used in the shop can be made by the smith . If less time is spent in the stores and saloon there will be more time for making tools . I shall , in this chapter , give a few pointers how to make some of the tools used . I will not spend any time in explanation about the more intricate tools like drill presses and tools of that kind , because no smith has experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worth anything . I shall simply give a few hints on the most common tools used , with illustrations that will be a help to new beginners . Before we go any further let me remind you of the golden rule of the mechanic , " A place for everything and // everything in its place . " Some shops look like a scrap iron shed , the tools strewn all over , and onetenth of the time is spent in hunting for them . I shall first ay a few words about the shop and give a plan . This plan is not meant to be followed minutely , but is simply a hint in that direction . THE SHOP In building a shop care should be taken in making it convenient and healthy . Most of the shops are built with a high floor . This is very inconvenient when machinery of any kind is taken in for repairs , as well its in taking in a team for shoeing . Around the forge there should be a gravel floor . A plank floor is a great nuiLance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hunted up and picked up or it will set fire to it . I know there will be some objection to this kind of floor but if you once learn how to keep it you will change your mind . To make this floor take sand and clay with fine gravel , mix with coal dust and place a layer where wanted about four inches thick . This floor , when a little old , will be as hard as iron , provided you sprinkle it every night with water . The dust and soot from the shop will , in time , settle in with it and it will be smooth and hard . It will not catch fire ; no cracks for small tools or bolts to fall through ; it will not crack like cement or brick floors . If your shop is large then make a platform at each end , and a gravel floor in the center , or at one side , as in figure // x . This floor is cool in summer and warm in winter , as there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skylights if possible . The soot and dust will , in a short time , make the lightest shop dark . The shop should be whitewashed once a year . Have plenty of ventilation . Make it one story only if convenient to do so , as an upper story in a blacksmith shop is of very little use . The shop is the place where the smith spends most of his time and he should take just as much care in building it , as a sensible housekeeper does in the construction of her kitchen . // THE FORGE The forge can be made either single or double , square or round . The square is the best as it can be placed up against the wall , and you will then have more room in front of it . The round forge will take more room , if it is placed in the center of the floor there will be no room of any amount on any side and when the doors are open the wind will blow the fire , cinders and smoke into the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if hung over the fire will sometimes be in the way . Of course the hood can be made in halves and one half swung to the side , but it will sometimes be in the way anyhow , and it seldom has any suction to carry away the smoke and cinders . The anvil should not be too close to the forge , as is often the case in small country shops . Make it six feet from center of fire to center of anvil . The anvil // should not be placed on a butcher block with the tools on , but on a timber the same size as the foot of the anvil . Set the timber down in the ground at least three feet . For heavy work the anvil should stand low in order to be able to come down on it with both hammer and sledge with force . When the smith has his hands closed the knuckles of his fingers should touch the face of the anvil and it will be the right height for all-around blacksmithing . COAL BOX Close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal box i8 x 24 X i6 inches , this box to be dug down in the ground and so placed that one end will protrude from under the barrel or tank far enough to let a shovel in . This opening can be closed with a lid if the tools are liable to fall into it . In this box keep the coal wet . In figure i a plan is given from which you can get an idea of a shop and how to place the tools and different articles needed . TOOL TABLES On the right hand of the anvil should be a tool bench or tool table 20 x 20 , a little lower than the anvil . Outside , on three sides and level with the table , make a railing of i 1 . inch iron , about i Ia inch space between the table and railing , this makes a handy place for // tools and near by . Many blacksmiths have no other place than the floor for their tools , but there is no more sense in that than it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor all around him . There ought to be " a place for every tool and every tool in its place. ? THE HAMMER When a lawyer or a minister makes his maiden speech he will always be in a great hurry on account of his excitement . The sentences are cut shorter , broken , and the words are sometimes only half pronounced . After a few years ' practice he will be more // self-possessed and the speech will be changed from unintelligible phrases to logical oratory . When the carpenter 's apprentice first begins to use the saw , he will act the same way ? be in a great hurry ? he will run the saw at the speed of a scroll saw , but only a few inches of stroke ; after some instructions and a few year 's practice the saw will be run up and down steady and with strokes the whole length of the blade . When the blacksmith 's apprentice begins to use the hammer he acts very much the same way . He will press his elbows against his ribs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peck away at the speed of a trip hammer . This will , in most cases , be different in a few years . He will drop the bundle ? that is , his elbows will part company with his ribs , the hammer will look over his head , there will be full strokes and regular time , every blow as good as a dozen of his first ones . Some smiths have the foolish habit of beating on the anvil empty with the hammer , they will strike a few blows on the iron , then a couple of blind beats on the anvil , and so on . This habit has been imported from Europe , free of duty , and that must be the reason why so many blacksmiths enjoy this luxury . THE SLEDGE In Europe great importance is laid upon the position taken by the apprentice and the manner he holds the sledge . The sledge is held so that the end of it will be under his right armpit , when the right hand is next // to the sledge , and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sledge . In this unnatural position it is next to impossible to strike hard and do it for any time . This is another article imported free of duty , but few Americans have been foolish enough to use it . In this country the apprentice will be taught to use the tools in a proper way . The end of the sledge-handle will be to one side ; at the left , if the left hand is at the end of the handle , and at the right if the right hand is at the end of the handle ; and be down between his feet when the handle 's end must be low . The apprentice should stand directly in front of the anvil . In swinging , the sledge should describe a circle from the anvil close down to the helper 's feet and up over his head and down to the anvil ; this is a perpendicular circle blow . Be sure not to give it a horizontal start ; that is , with one hand close to the sledge the apprentice starts out either in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anvil , and then up while both hands should clasp the extreme end of the handle close together the sledge should be dropped down to the feet then up . The hold taken should not be changed , but the hands held in the same place . ( See figure 4 . ) For ordinary use a nine-pound sledge is heavy enough , a large sledge will give a bump , while a small one will give a quick good blow , it is only occasionally and for special purposes a large sledge is needed , even an eight-pound sledge will do . Try it , and you will be surprised how nice it works . // With these preliminary remarks we shall now begin to make a few tools . We will begin with the blacksmith 's tongs . I shall only give an idea how to forge the jaws , and every man that needs to make them has seen enough of this simple tool to know what kind is needed , and what he has not seen will suggest itself to every sensible smith . // BLACKSMITH 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the iron diagonally over the anvil , with your left hand a little toward the horn , the end of the iron to reach out over the outside edge of the anvil . Now strike so that the sledge and hammer will hit half face over the anvil and the other half of the sledge and hammer outside of the anvil . Hammer it down to about threeeighths of an inch thick . Now pull the iron towards you straight across the anvil , give it one half turn toward yourself so that this side which was up , now will be towards yourself ; the end that first was outside the anvil now to rest over the inner edge of the anvil , push the jaw up against the anvil until it rests against the shoulder made in the first move . Now hammer this down until it is the thickness of the jaw that is desired . Next , turn it over , with the bottom side up or the side that was down , up ; push it out over the // outside edge of the anvil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have up , will be about an inch outside and over the edge of the anvil , now give a few blows to finish the jaw , then finish the shanks and weld in half inch round iron to the length desired . The jaws should be grooved with a fuller , if you have none of the size required take a piece of round iron and hammer it down in the jaws to make the groove . Tongs grooved this way will grip better . Next , punch a hole in one jaw , place it over the other in the position wanted when finished , then mark the hole in the other jaw , and when punched rivet them together , the jaws to be cold and the rivet hot . The following story will suggest to you how to finish it . An apprentice once made a pair of tongs when his master was out , and when he had them riveted together could not move the jaws . As he did not know how to make them work he laid them away under the bellows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following story : An apprentice once made a pair of tongs and when he had them riveted together he could not move the jaws , and as he did not know what to do he simply threw them away , thinking he must have made a mistake somehow . " What a fool , " said the master , " Why did n't he heat them . " At the next opportunity the apprentice put his tongs in the fire and when hot they could be worked very easily . // HOW TO MAKE A HAMMER Take a piece of tool steel 114 inches square , neat it red hot . Now remember here it is that the trouble begins in handling tool steel . If , in the process , you ever get it more than red hot , it is spoiled , and no receipt , or handling or hammering will ever make it good again . The best thing in such a case is to cut off the burnt part in spite of all proposed cures . This must be remembered whenever you heat tool or spring steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heat it to a low heat , cool it in lukewarm water half a dozen times , this will improve it some , if you can hammer it some do so . Now punch a hole about two inches from the end with a punch that will make a hole x 3/8 " If the punch sticks in the hole , cool it off and put a little coal in the hole that will prevent the punch from sticking . This is a good thing to do whenever a deep hole is to be punched . Be sure that the hole is made true . Next , have a punch the exact size of the hole wanted when finished , drive it in and hammer the eye out until it has the thickness of about 0 of an inch on each side and has a circle form like No. 2 , Figure 5 . In order to do this you may have to heat the eye many times , and upset over it with the punch in the eye . This done put in the bottom fuller and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , like the cut referred to . Now dress down the face then the peen-end . When finished harden it in this way : Heat the face-end first to a low red heat , dip in water about an inch and a half , brighten the face and watch // for the color . When it begins to turn blue cool off but do n't harden the eye , Wind a wet rag around the face end and heat the peen-end , temper the same way . With a piece of iron in the eye , both ends can be hardened at the same time , but this is more difficult , and I would not recommend it . For ordinary blacksmithing a flat peen hammer is the thing , but I have seen good blacksmiths hang on to the machinist 's hammer as the only thing . See No. i , Figure 5 . This hammer is more ornamental than useful in a blacksmith shop . The hammer should be of different sizes for different work , light for light work , and for drawing out plowshares alone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hammer of two up to two and one-half pounds is right . Riveting hammers // should be only one pound and less . No smith should ever use a hammer like No. 3 , in Figure 5 . This hammer I have not yet been able to find out what it is good for . Too short , too clumsy , too much friction in the air . I have christened it , and if you want my name for it call it Cain 's hammer . It must surely look like the hammer used by him , if he had any . HOW TO MAKE CHISELS A chisel for hot cutting , see Figure 5 , No. 4 . This chisel is made of 4. square tool steel . Punch a hole i x 14 x Iz about three inches from the end , the eye should be narrow in order to leave material enough on the sides to give it strength . When eye is finished , forge down below it , not on the head-end , with top and bottom fullers , like cut . This gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , then heat to a low cherry red , and harden , brighten it and when the color is brown cool off . COLD CHISELS Use same sized steel as above referred to , make it like No. 5 , Figure 5 . To distinguish it from the hot cutting chisel , and to give it more strength , in hardening this chisel , draw the temper until it is blue . This is the right temper for all kinds of cold chisels. // SET HAMMER One might think that anybody knows how to make a set hammer , if every smith knows it , I do n't know , but I do know that there are thousands of smiths who have never had a set hammer nor know its use . To make one : Take a piece of tool steel r y x i y inches , punch a hole about two inches from the end , the hole to be i5 x O. Now cut off enough for head . Make the face perfectly square and level , with sharp corners , harden and cool off when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very important little tool and for cutting steel it is a good deal better than the chisel . Plow steel of every kind is easier cut with this hammer than any other way . In cutting with the set hammer hold the steel so that your inner side of the set hammer will be over the outside edge of the anvil . Let the helper strike on the outside corner of the set hammer and it will cut easy . The steel to be cut should be just a little hot , not enough to be noticed . If the steel is red hot the set hammer can not cut it . The heat must be what is called blue heat . I would not be without the set hammer for money , and still I often meet smiths who have never seen this use made of the set hammer . Plow points , corn shovels , and seeder shovels are quicker cut with this tool than any other way , with the exception of shears . // TWIST DRILLS Twist drills are not easy to make by hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twist drill can be made this way . Take a piece of tool steel round and the size of the chuck hole in your drill press . Flatten it down to the size wanted , heat , put the shank in the vise , take with the tongs over the end and give one turn to the whole length , turn to the left . When finished be sure that it is not thicker up than it is at point , and straight . Now harden , heat to a low cherry red , cool off in luke-warm water ? salt water , if you have it ? brighten it and hold over a hot bar of iron to draw temper , cool off when brown , the whole length of the twist should be tempered . Another way to make a drill is to just flatten the steel and shape to a diamond point and bend the shares forward . This is a simple but good idea and such drills cut easy . In cooling for hardening turn the drill in the water so that the edge or shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be too soft and the point of such a drill too hard . Our trade journals , in giving receipts for hardening drills , often get watch-makers receipts . This is misleading : watch-makers heat their drills to a white heat . Now , remember , as I have already said , when your drill or tool of this kind is heated to this heat the best thing to do is to cut that part off . It is different with watchmakers , they do not look for strength , but hardness . They run their drills with a high speed , cut chips that can not be discerned with the naked eye , and must // have a drill that is hard like a diamond . For drilling iron or steel the drill does not need to be so very hard , but tough rather , because of the slow speed and thick chips : Few smiths have been able to master the sim plest tempering , and they think if they could get a complicated receipt they would be all right . We are all more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire . Simple soft water and the right heat is , in most cases , the only thing needed for hardening . I had occasion to consult a doctor once who was noted for his simple remedies . A lady got some medicine and she wanted to know what it was so she could get it when the doctor was not at home , but he refused to reveal it to her . When the lady had left the doctor told me the reason why . " This lady , " said the doctor , " does not believe in simple remedies which she knows , but believes in those remedies she knows nothing about . " I think it is better for us to try to // understand things and not believe much in them before we understand them . S WRENCH See Figure 6 , No. 3 . This wrench is for 3 nut on one end and / on the other , just the kind for plow work . To make one , take a piece of tool steel r / x start as you see in No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fullers , punch a round hole as in end No. 4 , cut out from hole and finish the jaws to make the right length , now bend it in S shape and finish . This makes the best wrench . Do not heat over a red heat . ROCK DRILLS Few blacksmiths know how to make a rock drill . Take a piece of round or octagon steel , the desired length and thickness , shape it , but it must be remembered that if during the process you ever get it over a red heat there is no use to proceed , but just cut off that much and start again , no hardening will prevail if it is burnt . The trouble begins when you put the steel into the fire , and you must watch until you have it finished . When ready to harden heat it to a cherry red heat , cool in water not too cold , brighten and watch for temper . When it is yellow , cool it off , but not entirely , take it out of the water before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this will make the drill both hard and tough . By this simple process I have been able to dress drills and get such a good temper than only two per cent would break . Another way to harden is to heat to a very low heat and cool it off entirely at once . A third way is to temper as first stated and when yellow set the drill in water only one half an inch deep and let it cool . By this process a good per cent will break just at the water line . " De sure yOu are right then go ahead . " ? Davy Crochet . CHAPTER III HOW TO STRIKE AND TURN THE IRON ? RULES FOR SMITH AND HELPER The smith should never turn the iron on the helper 's blow , he should turn on his own blow , that is , never turn the iron so that the helper 's blow will hit it first because he is not prepared for it and can not strike with confidence , but the smith will not be bothered by turning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prepared for it . The smith should strike the first blow in starting , or signal the helper where to strike , in case the smith can not strike the first blow . The smith calls the helper by three blows on the anvil with his hammer , and when the smith wants the helper to cease striking he taps with the hammer twice on the anvil . The helper should strike the blow he has started when the smith signals him to stop . The helper should watch the time of the smith 's hammer ; if fast , keep time with it , if slow , keep time with it . The helper should strike where the smith strikes or over the center of the anvil . The helper should always lift the sledge high , in order to give the smith a chance to get in with the hammer . // THE FIRE It is proper before we go any farther to say a few words about the fire . An old foreman in the blacksmith department of a factory told me once in a conversation we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that very few blacksmiths have learned how to make a good fire . It takes years of study and practice before the eye is able to discern a good fire from a bad one . A good fire must be a clear fire , the flame must be concentrated and of a white color . Even the nose must // serve to decide a bad fire from a good one . A strong sulphur smell indicates a poor fire for welding . In order to get a good fire there must be , first , good coal ; second , plenty of it . It is no use to pile a lot of coal on an old fire , full of cinders and slag . The fire-pot must be clean . Many blacksmiths are too saving about the coal . They take a shovel of coal , drop it on the forge in the vicinity of the fire and sprinkle a handful of it in the fire once in a while . In such a case it is impossible to do good work and turn it out quick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shovels at a time , the coal should be wet . Then pack it in the fire as hard together as you can . Sprinkle the fire with water when it begins to spread . In this way you get a hard fire . The flames are concentrated and give great heat . Saving coal is just like saving feed to a horse , or grub to your apprentice . Neither will give you a good day 's work unless he has all he wants to eat . The fire , of course , should be in proportion to the work , but in every case should the fire be large enough to raise it up from the tuyer iron as much as possible . In a small fire the blast strikes directly on the iron and it begins to scale off ; in a good fire these scales melt and make it sticky , while in a low and poor fire the scales blacken and fall off . This never happens if the fire is full of good coal and high up from the tuyer iron . Good strong blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old whim about the fire that everybody , farmers and others , as well as blacksmiths , are infected with , and that is , if a piece of brass is put in the fire it // renders the fire useless to weld with . Now , while it is a fact that brass is not conducive to welding it takes a good deal of it before the fire is made useless . One smith will not dare to heat a galvanized pipe in his fire , for fear it will spoil it , while another smith will weld a piece of iron or steel to such a pipe without difficulty . Do n't swear and curse if the fire is not what you expect it to be , but simply make it right . Some smiths have the habit of continually poking in the fire , if they weld a piece of iron they never give it rest enough to get hot , but turn it over from one side to another and try to fish up all the cinders and dust to be found in the fire . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of sulphur in the fire and makes a poor fire for welding . Dead coal makes a poor fire . TUYER IRON One of the chief reasons for a poor fire is a poor blast . No patent tuyer will give blast enough unless you run it by steam and have a fan blower . Ninety per cent of the blast is lost in transmission through patent tuyers . The only way to get a good blast is to have a direct tuyer , and one with a water space in . To make a direct tuyer take a pipe r x 12 inches long , weld around one end of this pipe an iron 38 to make it thick on the end that is in the fire , flare out the other end for the wind pipe to go in and place it horzontal in the fire and fill up around it with fireproof clay . This gives the best fire . The only objection to // this tuyer is that where soft coal is used , as is mostly the case in country shops , it gets hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good hard coal it never gets hot , provided the fire is deep enough . From five to eight inches is the right distance from the tuyer to the face of the fire . In factories this kind of tuyer is used , and I have seen them used for ten years , and never found them to clog once . The tuyer was just as good after ten years use as it was when put in . To make a water tuye ? take a pipe i 14 x 12 , weld a flange on each end for water space , now weld another pipe over this , and bore holes for M . inch pipes in the end , where the blast goes in . One hole on the lower or bottom side should be for the cold water to go in through , and one hole on the upper side for the hot water to go out through . These pipes to connect with a little water tank for this purpose . The pipes should // be watched so that they will not be allowed to freeze or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never clog . I now use one that I have made as above described . The dealers now have them to sell . Any smith can get them as they are hard to make by the average smith . BLOWERS I have tried many kinds of blowers and I shall give my brother smiths the advantage of my experience . Portable forges run with fan blowers are fair blowers if you are strong enough to pump away at high speed , but it takes a horse to do that , and as soon as you drop the lever the blast ceases . Root 's blower works easier , but the objection is the same , as soon as you drop the crank the blast stops . Besides this trouble , this blower is often in the way . I have never found anything to beat the bellows yet , if you only know how to use them . Never take a set of bellows less than 48 extra long . Cut the snout off so that it will give a hole 1 , and // with a water tuyer this blower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by steam . The bellows should be hung over head to be out of the way . When these bellows are full of wind they will blow long enough after you have dropped the lever to do quite a good many things around the forge , and to handle the iron in the fire with both hands as is often necessary . WELDING IRON Welding iron is easy and no other welding compound is needed than sand , unless it is a case when the iron is liable to burn or scale off , borax will prevent this . There are three kinds of welds , butt , lap and split . The butt weld is most used in welding iron . The ends should be rounded off a little so that the center will weld first . Weld the ends this way either in the fire or on the anvil , butting the ends while you strike over and dress down the weld . In welding lap welds upset the ends and make them a good deal heavier than the size of the iron is ; then lap the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a long lap . This is wrong , for if the lap is long it will reach beyond the upset part and the ends can not then be welded down , without you make it weak . If soft steel is welded cut a short cut with the chisel in the center of the lap , as shown in Figure 6 , No . I. This cut will hook and prevent the ends from slipping ; if properly prepared this weld will not show at all when done . // SPLIT WELDS Split weld is preferable when steel is to be welded , especially tool steel of a heavy nature , like drill bits for well drillers . If the steel is welded to iron , split the iron and draw out the ends as thin as possible and make it the shape shown in Figure 6 , No. 2 . Taper the steel to fill the split made in the iron , when it fits perfectly cut beard in it to catch in the lips of the iron when fitted in . See Figure 6 , No. 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapered end . Place the tapered end snug up in the split and hammer it together with a heavy sledge . If there is any crack or opening at the end of the tapered end , plug it up with iron plugs , if this is not done , these holes will be almost as they are , because it is hard to weld a heavy shaft or drill , or rather , it is hard to hammer them together so the holes will close in . Now heat , but if you have tool steel go slow , or your steel will burn before the iron is hot enough . Weld the lips while the rod or drill is in the fire . For this purpose use a hammer with an iron handle in . When the lips are welded all around take it out and let two good helpers come down on it with all their might . When welded smooth it up with the hammer or flat hammer . WELDING STEEL Welding steel is quite a trick , especially tool or spring steel . The most important part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not to over heat the // steel . To a good smith no other compound is needed than borax , but if this is not sufficient , take some borings from your drill , especially fine steel borings , and cover the weld with this and borax , and if a smith can not weld with this compound there is no use for him to try . Most of the welding compounds are inferior to this , but some smiths would rather believe in something they do n't know anything about another will not believe in anything he can get for nothing . BANDS OR HOOPS When a round object is to be ironed or a hoop put on to anything round , measure , that is , take the diameter then multiply by three , add three times the thickness of the iron ( not the width ) , add to this one time the thickness of the hoop for the weld and you have the exact length of the iron needed ; in other words , three times the diameter , four times the thickness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a good many old smiths who never knew it . SEEDER SHOVELS To weld seeder shovels is no easy job . Prepare the shovel ; shape almost to it proper shape , draw out the shanks , weld the points first , heat shovel and shank slow , then fit them together so that no cinders can get // in between . Now remember , if your fire is not at least five inches up from the tuyer iron , and clear , it is no use to try . Hold your shovel in the fire , shank down . Heat slow , use borax freely and apply it on the face side of the shovel to prevent it from burning . When ready , weld it over the mandrill and the shovel will have the right shape . If soft center , harden like a plow lay . DRILLING IRON Every smith knows how to drill , sometimes it gives even an old smith trouble . The drill must be true , the center to be right , if one side of the drill is wider than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be true . For centuries oil has been used for drilling and millions of dollars have been spent in vain . It is a wonder how people will learn to use the wrong thing . I do n't think that I have ever met a man yet who did not know that oil was used in drilling . In drilling hard steel , turpentine or kerosene is used as oil will then prevent cutting entirely . Nothing is better than water , but turpentine or kerosene is not as bad as oil ; if you think water is too cheap use turpentine or kerosene . I had occasion once to do a little work for a man eighty years old , and when I drilled a hole , used water . The old man asked if water was as good as oil , and when informed that it was better , said : " I used to be quite a blacksmith myself , I am now eighty years old , too old to do anything , but I am not MODERN BLACKSMI'IHING too old to learn . " It ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in boxes to prevent cutting , it will also prevent cutting in drilling . HOW TO DRILL CHILLED IRON First prepare a drill which is thicker at the point than usual , and oval in form , then harden it as follows : heat to a low cherry red heat and cool in the following hardening compound : two quarts soft water , one-half ounce sal-ammoniac , salt , three ounces . Do n't draw the temper , for if you have the right heat you will get the right temper . Now drill and use water , not oil . Feed carefully but so the drill will cut right along . If you have no chance to get the compound , harden in water but draw no temper , let it be as hard as it will . If the iron is too hard to be drilled and you can heat the same do so , heat to a low red heat and place a piece of brimstone just where the hole is to be ; this will soften the iron through , so the hole can be drilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made of different materials and of different shapes . Take a piece of iron 23 x % , twenty-eight inches long . Cut off the end after you 6o MODERN BLACKSMITHING have thinned it out about 5 inches from the end , cut diagonally Now weld the cut-off piece to the main shank . The cut-off piece to be laid on the outside and welded , bend the iron as soon as it is welded so that it has the shape of the coulter , draw out a good point and sharpen the iron just the same as if it was a finished coulter . This done , cut off a piece of steel , an old plow lay that is not too much worn will do , cut the shape of the coulter you have now in the iron , and let the steel be half an inch wider than the iron , but on the point let it be as long as it will , because the point ought to be quite long , say about nine inches . Next draw the steel out thin on the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the anvil outside up , put a pinch of borax on it at the heel , then a pinch of steel borings , place the steel on top of this and keep in position with a pair of tongs ; now hold it on the fire heel down , and heat slow . When it is hot let the helper strike a pressing blow or two on it and it will stick until you have taken the next weld . Put borings and // borax between steel and iron for each weld . When finished , the angle should be that of the square ; that is , when you place the coulter in the square the shank should follow one end of the square and the foot of the coulter the other . The edge of the outside side should follow the square from the point up . When it does it looks like a hummock in the coulter but it is not . Old breakers will be particular about this as it will cut a clean furrow if it is made in this way and it will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coulter will wedge the plow out of land and make a poor furrow . Next finish the chisel point , soft or hard steel as you please ; weld it to the coulter on the inside , that is , the side next to the furrow . Last punch or drill the hole in the heel . The coulter should not be hardened except a little on and along the point . There is no need of a double chisel point , such a point will be too clumsy and run heavy . I have received a premium on a coulter made in this shape . MILL PICKS Mill picks are very easily dressed and hardened , the whole trick in this case , as in many others , lies in the right heat of the steel . Be careful not to heat to a higher than a red heat . Dress the pick and temper with a low heat , when the color is dark yellow the temper is right , if the steel is of the right kind . No other hardening compound is necessary than water . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . // A smith once wanted to buy my receipt for tempering . He believed I had a wonderful prescription , or I could not succeed as I did . I told him I used only water , but he insisted that I was selfish and would not reveal it to him . If tools and receipts would do the work there would be no need of experienced mechanics . Tools and receipts are both necessary , bat it must be a skilled hand to apply them . HARDEN FILES The best way to harden files is to have a cast iron bucket filled with lead . Heat it until the lead is red hot , then plunge the file into this , handle up . This will give a uniform heat and the file will not warp so easy if the heat is right . In cooling the file off , use a bbx four or five feet long with salt water in , run the file back and forth endwise , not sideways , that will warp the file , take it out of the water while yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a device so that you can bend it right . While in this position sprinkle water over where you straighten until cold and the file will be right . HARDEN TAPS AND DIES Heat the tap or die to a red cherry , cool off entirely in water , brighten with an emery paper . Now , hold over a hot iron until the tap or die has a dark straw color , then cool off . If a light tap , the temper can be drawn over a gaslight , using a blowpipe. // BUTCHER KNIFE . To make a butcher knife , one smith will simply take an old file , shape it into a knife , and harden . The best way to make a knife is to first draw out a piece of iron / inch wide and -i s- of an inch thick , twice the length of the knife . Prepare the steel the same width as the iron , of an inch thick , weld this steel in between the iron . ? his will make a knife that will not break . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool off entirely in water . Brighten and hold over a hot iron until brown , then cool off . The steel should be good tool steel , a fiat file will do , but the cuts must be ground or filed off entirely before you touch it with the hammer , for if the cuts are hammered in they will make cracks in the edge of the knife , and the same will break out . ? HOW TO REPAIR CRACKED CIRCULAR SAWS If a circular saw is cracked it can be repaired so that the crack will go no further , and if the crack is deep , it can be so remedied that there will be no danger in using it . Ascertain the end of the crack , then drill a h-inch hole so that the crack will end in that hole . Countersink on each side and put in a rivet . Do n't let the rivet stick its head over the face of the saw . If the crack is deep put another rivet about half an inch from the edge . If the saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / square or round , square up // the ends and set the saw between the ends so that they will meet over the place where the hole is to be drilled . When the saw is dark blue , the temper is out . It might be a possibility that this will spring the saw in some cases , therefore , I advise you to try drilling the hole without any change in temper . Prepare a drill that is harder than usual , use no oil , but water . HOW TO PREVENT A CIRCULAR SAW FROM CRACKING The reason why a circular saw cracks is , in most cases , incorrect filing . In filing a saw , never let a flat file with its square corners touch the bottom of the teeth you are filing ; if you do , you will make a short cut that will start the crack , The best way is to gum the saw in a saw gummer or on an emery wheel , or use a round-edged file . HOW TO SEW A BELT Belts can be riveted , sewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be riveted , because such a belt will stretch and have to be cut out and sewed over quite often at first . There are hooks made of steel for belt sewing , these are all right when the pulleys are not less than six inches in diameter and the speed is slow . In using these hooks be careful not to // bend them too sharp or drive the bends together too hard ; in so doing they will cut through the leather and pull out . Lacing is the best for all kinds of belts . In sewing a belt with lacing , first punch with a punch made for this purpose , holes in proportion to the width . Do n't punch them too close to the ends . Begin sewing in the center holes and start so that both ends of the lacing will come out on the outside of the belt . Now sew with one end to each side , and be careful not to cross the lacing on the side next to the pulleys . The lacing should be straight on that side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little up in the belt to receive the last end of the lacing ; the last end should come out on the outside of the belt . In this end cut a little notch about three-fourths through the lacing close to the belt , and then cut the lacing off a quarter of an inch outside of this notch . This notch will act as a prong and prevent the lacing from pulling out . Tap it lightly with a hammer above the seam to smooth it down . POINTS ON BELTS In placing shafts to be connected by belts , care should be taken to get the right working distance one from the other . For smaller belts 12 to 15 feet is about the right distance . For large belts , a greater distance is wanted . The reason for this is that when pulleys are too close together there is no sag in the // belts and they must therefore be very tight in order to work . Belts should not have too much sag , or they will , if the distance between the pulleys is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerking motion which will be hard on the bearings . Never place one shaft directly over another , for then the belts must be very tight to do the work , and a tight belt will wear out quicker and break oftener in the lacing than a loose one ; besides this the bearings will give out sooner . If a belt slips use belt oil or resin , or both . BOB SHOES In repairing old bob sleds is is difficult to find shoes to suit . But in every case the shoe can be fitted to suit without touching the runner . The trick here as in many other cases in the blacksmith business , lies in the heating . Any shoe can be straightened or bent to fit the runner if only heated right . A low cherry-red heat and a piece if iron to reach from the crooked end of the shoe and far enough back to leave a space between where it wants to be straightened . Now put it in the vise and turn the screws slowly and the shoe will stand a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of beams so that you can bend it back to the right shape . Remember the heat . I have put on hundreds and never knew of a shoe that broke when the heat was right . I must confess , // however , that my two first shoes broke , but I think I learned it cheap when I consider my success after that . The shoe should fit the runner snug . Ironing bobs is a very simple and easy thing , every blacksmith , and even farmers sometimes , are able to iron their own sleds fairly well , and I do n't think it will be of much interest for the readers of this book to treat that subject any further . AXES AND HATCHETS Dressing axes is quite a trick and few blacksmiths have mastered it . It is comparatively easy when one knows how . I have several times already warned against over heating and if this has been necessary before , it is more so now in this case . In heating an ax do not let the edge rest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot at the edge before it is hot enough to hammer it out . Place the edge far enough in to let it over the hottest place in the fire . Go slow . When hot , thaw it to the shape of a new axe , do n't hammer on one side only . In so doing the ax will be flat on one side and curved up on the other . If uneven trim it off ; trim the sides also if too wide ; do n't heat it over the eye ; be sure you have it straight . When ready to harden , heat to a low red heat and harden in luke warm water . The heat should be only brown if it is a bright sunny day . Brighten and look for the temper . You will notice that the temper runs uneven ; // it goes out to the corners first , therefore dip them ( the corners ) deeper when cooling , and with a wet rag touch the place on the edge where the temper wants to run out . Some smiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of brightening it , and hold it over the fire until the tallow catches fire , then cool it off . This is guess work , and the axe is soft in one place and too hard in another . The best way is to brighten the ax and you can see the temper , then there is no guess work about it . When blue cool it partly off and then while the ax is still wet you will observe under the water or through the water a copper color . This color will turn blue as soon as the ax is dry , and is the right color and temper . Cool it slowly , do n't cool it off at once , but let it cool gradually , and it will be both hard and tough . By this simple method I have been very successful , breaking only three per cent , while no new ax of any make will ever do better than ten per cent . Some will even break at the rate of twelve and thirteen per cent . The ax factories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do better yet to compete with me and my simple method . WELL DRILLS Well drills are made of different sizes and kinds . Club bits and Z bits . How to dress : heat to a low red heat . If nicked or broken , cut out , otherwise draw it // out to the size wanted . The caliper should touch the lips of the bit when measured diagonally so that the bit has the size on all corners . Heat to a low red heat and harden , the temper to be from dark straw color to blue according to the kind of drilling to be done . The trick , in two words , low heat . GRANITE TOOLS By granite tools is meant tools or chisels used by granite or marble workers for cutting inscriptions on tombstones . When a man understands how these tools are used it is easier to prepare them . These are the kind of tools where an unusual hardness is required . The hammer used in cutting with this chisel is very small , and the blow would not hurt your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand a high heat and temper . The chisels should be very thin for this work . When dressed and ready to harden , heat to a red heat and harden in the following solution : one gallon soft water , four ounces salt . Draw the temper to a straw color . A blacksmith once paid a high price for a receipt for hardening granite tools . The receipt was , aqua , one gallon ; chloride of sodium , four ounces . This receipt he kept as a secret and the prepared compound he bought at the drug store , thus paying 50 cents for one gallon of water and four ounces of salt . The real worth is less than a cent . It is said he succeeded // remarkably well with his great compound , which he kept in a jug and only used when anything like granite tools were to be hardened . The reason why he succeeded so well was because of his ignorance concerning his compound , not because it was not good enough . I hold that it is one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People in general like to be humbugged . If they only get something new or something they do n't know anything about , then they think it wonderful . Salt and water should be called salt and water , and be just as much valued . Let us " call a spade a spade , " the spade will not be more useful by another name , nor will it be less useful by calling it by its proper name . The Sultan , the Arch Polygamist and Emperor William in the same carriage . CHAPTER IV When vehicles were first used is hard to tell , but we know that they have been used for thousands of years before the Christian era . It is easy to imagine how they looked at that time , when we know how halfcivilized people now make wagons . The first vehicle was only a two-wheeled cart called chariot . Such chariots were used in war and that it was a case of " great cry and little wool " is certain . The blacksmith used to be the wagon and carriage maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacksmith makes a carriage , and when it happens most of the parts are bought . In 1565 the first coach was made in England . Now there are hundreds of factories making wagons and carriages and parts of them for repair use by blacksmiths and wagon makers . It is no use for any blacksmith or wagon maker to compete with these factories . We have neither the means nor the facili ties to do it , and have to be content with the repairs they need . The most important repairs are the set ting of tire , welding and setting axle stubs . 71 // SETTING TIRE Wagon tire is often set so that more harm than good is done to the wheel . In setting tire the first thing to do is to mark the tire . Many blacksmiths set tires without marking the tire . This is poor work . In order to do a good job the tire should be set so that it is in the same place it had . There are generally some uneven places in the fellows and when the tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and will settle down in these low places . Now , if the tire is not marked and set back in its exact bed , it will soon work loose again , and it is liable to dish the wheel too much as it do n't sink into its place , but is held up in some places . Another thing , when a tire is worn so that it becomes thin it will settle down on the outside , especially when the wheel is much dished . Now if you reverse the tire it will only touch the fellow on the inner edge of the wheel , and leave an open space between the fellow and the tire on the outside . When a wheel has bolts every smith knows that it will make trouble for him if he do n't get the tire back where it was . In every case take a file or a chisel and cut a mark in the tire near to the fellow plates , cut also a light mark in the fellow . These marks are to be on the inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen on that side ; 2 , because in putting the tire on , the wheel should be placed with that side up . If there are nails in the tire cut them off with a thin chisel so that it will not mark the fellow , or drive them into the fellow with a punch . Next , measure // the wheel with the gauge ( the wheel is supposed to be right , not fellow bound nor any spokes loose in the tenon ) . This done , heat the tire and shrink it . If the wheel is straight give it half an inch draw , sometimes even five-eighths if the wheel is heavy and strong . But if the wheel is poor and dished , do not give it more than one-fourth-inch draw . One tire only with a little draw can be heated in the forge , but if there is more than one tire heat them outside in a fire made for this purpose , or in a tire heater . There are different ways of cooling the tire . Some smiths have a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and with a lever sink both wheel and tire in the water . There are many objections to this . I , You will have to soak the whole wheel ; 2 , it is inconvenient to put the tire on ; 3 , in order to set the tire right , it is necessary to reach the tire from both sides with the hammer ; 4 , when spokes have a tendency to creep out , or when the wheel is much dished , the wheel should be tapped with the hammer over the spokes . Now , to be able to perform all these moves , one must have , first , a table ; this table to be about twelve inches high and wide enough to take any wheel , with a hole in the center of table to receive the hub . On one side you may make a hook that will fall over the wheel and hold the tire down while you get it on . Close to this table have a box 5% feet long , 12 inches wide and 12 inches deep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three feet long . In these planks cut notches in which you place an iron rod , run through the hub . On this rod the wheel will hang . The // notches can be made so that any sized wheel will just hang down enough to cover the tire in the water . In this concern you can give the wheel a whirl and it will turn so swift that there will be water all around the tire . It can be stopped at any time and the tire set right , or the spokes tapped . With these accommodations and four helpers I have set six hundred hay rake wheels in nine and one-half hours . This was in a factory where all the tires were welded and the wheels ready so that it was nothing but to heat the tires and put them on . I had three fires with twelve tires in each fire . An artesian well running through the water box kept the water cool . If the fire is not hot enough to make it expand a tire puller is needed . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either wood or iron . Buggy tire is more particular than wagon tire and there are thousand of buggy wheels spoiled every year by poor or careless blacksmiths . In a buggy tire one-eighth of an inch draw is the most that it will stand , while most wheels will stand only one-sixteenth . If the wheel is badly dished do n't give it any draw at all , the tire should then measure the same as the wheel , the heat in the tire is enough . If the wheel is fellow-bound cut the fellows to let them down on the spokes . If the spokes are loose on the tenon wedge them up tight . // BACK DISHED WHEEL For a back dished wheel a screw should be used to set the wheel right . Place the wheel on the table front side up . Put wood blocks under the fellow to raise the wheel up from the table . Place a two by four over the hole under the table ; have a bolt long enough to reach through the two by four and up through the hub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt to go through ; screw it down with a tail nut . When the wheel is right , put the tire on . The tire for such a wheel should have more draw than for a wheel that is right . If a buggy wheel has been dished it can be helped a little without taking the tire off . Place the wheel on the anvil so that the tire will rest against the anvil . Do n't let the tire rest lengthwise on the anvil . If you do , the tire will be bent out of shape when you begin to hammer on it . Use the least surface possible of the anvil and hammer on the edge of the tire ; the stroke of the hammer to be such that the blow will draw the tire out from the fellow . A tire too tight can be remedied this way . When bolting a wheel the tire will be out of place unless the tire has been shrunk alike on both sides of the fellow plates . A smith used to setting tires will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tire is too short , do n't stretch it with a sharp fuller that will cut down into the tire , when the tire is a little worn it will break in this cut . Draw it out with a wide fuller and smooth it down with the hammer . If it is // much too short , weld in a piece . This is easily done . Take a piece of iron Mr-inch thick , the width of the tire and the length needed , say about three inches . Taper the ends and heat it to a red heat . Place it on the tire in the fire and weld . This will give material for stretching . If the wheel has a strong back dish it can not be set right to stay with the tire alone , as a bump against the fellow is apt to throw the dish back . It is therefore safer in all back dished wheels to take the spokes out of the hole and set them right by wedges in the end of the spokes . These wedges should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spoke so that they will wedge into the spoke when the same is driven back into its place . Use glue . HOW TO PUT ON NEW TIRE When you have the bar of either steel or iron for the tire , first see if it is straight , if not be sure to make it . Next place the tire on the floor and place the wheel on top of the tire , begin in such a way that the end of the fellow will be even with the end of the tire . Now roll the wheel over the tire . If a heavy tire cut it three inches longer than the wheel , if a thin tire , two inches . Now bend the tire in the bender . Measure the wheel with the gauge , then measure the tire ; if it is a heavy wagon tire and a straight wheel cut the tire one-fourth of an inch shorter than the wheel . If it is a buggy tire cut it the size of the wheel . In welding these tires they will shorten enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIRES There are many different ideas practiced in welding tires . One smith will narrow both ends before welding ; another will cut the edges off after it is welded . This is done to prevent it from spreading or getting too wide over the weld . I hold that both these ideas are wrong . The first one is wrong because when the ends are narrowed down it is impossible to make them stay together until the weld is taken , especially if it is a narrow tire . The second idea is wrong because it cuts off the best part of the weld and weakens it . Some smiths will split the tires , others will rivet them together . This is done to hold the tire in place until it has been welded . There is no need of this trouble , but for a new beginner a rivet is all right . I shall now give my experience in welding tire , and as this experience has been in a factory where thousands of wheels are made yearly , I suppose it will be worth something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw down the ends and let them swell as much as they want to . Now let the helper take the end that is to lay on top and pull it towards the floor , the other end to rest on the anvil . This will give that end a tendency to press itself steadily against the lower end . Next place this end on top of the other end . The ends must now be hot enough to allow them to be shaped . You will now notice that the top end is wider than the tire , so is the lower end . The tire is to be so placed that the swelled parts reach over and inside of each other a little . Now // give a couple of blows right over the end of the under tire . Next tap the swelled sides down over the tire . This will hold the tire together so that it can not slip to either side , and the swelled end of the under tire will prevent it from pulling out . If the top end has been so bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , the tire will now be in a good shape to weld . Before you put the tire into the fire , let me remind you of what I have said before about the fire . Many blacksmiths are never able to weld a tire tight on the outside because of a poor , low , and unclean fire . If the fire is too old or too fresh it will not give a good heat for welding tire . If you have a good big fire high up from the tuyer , then you are all right . Place your tire in the fire and proceed as follows : No matter whether it is an iron or soft steel tire , sand is the best welding compound and nothing else should be used ; but if you lose the first heat then borax might be used as it will prevent the tire from scaling and burning . When you have the right heat , place the tire on the anvil this way ; let the tire rest against the inside edge of the anvil . If the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anvil it will cool off and can never be welded that way . Now hold the tire this way until you have the hammer ready to give the first blow . Then let the tire down and strike the first blows directly on top and over the . end of the under end . This is important and if the first blows are not directed to this very place the lower end will be too cool to weld when you get to it . Next weld down the upper // end , this done turn the tire on edge and while it is in a welding heat come down on it heavy with hammer , if a buggy tire , and with a sledge and hammer if a heavy wagon tire . Hammer it down until it is considerably narrower over the weld as it will swell out when dressed down . This way the weld has all the material in the iron and the lapped lips will help hold the weld together . A very poor smith can weld tires to stay in this manner . The edges should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tire look the same over the weld as in the iron . If there should be any trouble to weld a steel tire place a little steel borings over the weld and use borax . A blacksmith in Silver Lake , Minn. , working for a wagon maker of that place , when welding a tire failed entirely after half a dozen attempts , and he got so angry that he threw the tire down on the floor with all his might . It happened to crush the wagon makers big toe . This was more than the otherwise goodnatured man could stand , and instantly the smith was seen hurled through an open window ? the wagon maker attached . Result : separation and law suit . All this because the smith had not read my book . When a light buggy tire is to be set mistakes are often made in measuring the tire . The tire is too light in itself to resist the pressure of the gauge . The smith tries to go it light and if there is not the same pressure in measuring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give the same results ; and when the tire is put on it is either too tight or too loose . I worked for many years on a tool to hold the tire 8o MODERN BLACKSMITHING steady in order to overcome this trouble . The only device that I have ever seen for this purpose before is the anvil close up to the forge , one side of the tire on the forge , the other on the anvil . This arrangement would crowd the smith , roast his back and expose him to ridicule , but it will not help to ruin the tire . The tool I invented is a tire holder made of cast iron . It consists of a standard or frame with a shank in to fit in the square hole in the anvil ; in the standard is a slot hole from the bottom up . On the back of the standard are cogs on both sides of the slot hole . Through this goes a clutch hub with cogs in to correspond with the cogs in the standard . On the outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a tapered hole to fit over the clutch hub . This lever is tapered so that it will fit different thicknesses , while the cogs and eccentric lever will adjust it to different widths . This device is so cheap that any smith can afford to have it . Next time you buy a quart of whisky sit down and figure out which will do you more good , my tire holder or the whisky . Figure 7 is an illustration of my holder . This tool is better than an advertisement in your local paper , of which the following story will convince you . A blacksmith in a prohibition county in a northern Iowa town got into the habit of going over to a Minnesota town for a keg of beer every month . On one of his periodical visits to this place he saw a crowd of men standing around a road grader in the road . As he approached he found that the grader had a serious break-down and the men were MODERN BEACKSMITHING Sz just discussing the possibilities of getting the grader repaired in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another thought they could if they only had tools . " I know a man , " said one in the party , " that can if any man can , and he has tools I am sure . I was over to his shop the other day to have my buggy tire set , and mind you , he had the slickest tool you ever saw to hold the tire in ; I never saw a tool like that before . " " Well , " said one , " that has nothing to do with this case . " " Yes it has , " said the road boss , $ MODERN BLACKSMITHING " my father always used to say , A mechanic is known by the tools he uses , ' and when a smith has good tools in one line , he has them in another , and I shall give this man a chance . " Our traveling smith had heard enough . This was a temperance and tool lecture to him , he began to think of all the trips he had made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip for liquor and the time lost must be worth two dollars per day . He figured it out and would have turned back if he had not been so close to the place . He took a glass of beer but it did n't taste as usual and he asked for a cigar . With this he returned , and on the road home swore off for good . He bought a tire holder at once to start in with , and by this time he is one of the best smiths in the country , always at his stand ready to do the work brought to him , and his customers now know that he is to be found in his place , with tools of all kinds and a sober hand to use them with . Do thou likewise . TIRE IN SECTIONS Many of us remember the time when tires were made in sections and nailed on , at this time the wheels were more substantially made , because the tire could not be set as tight as it is now , and the wheel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost independent of the tire . Our endless tire is a great improvement over the tires made in sections . The wagon tires as they are made now are , I think , as near // right as they can be , in regard to size of iron , in proportion to the wheel . But it is different with buggy tires . I hold that they are all made too light to be of any protection to the fellows . I understand the reason why they are made this way , but if a man wants a light rig , let that be the exception and not the rule . Tire should not be less than one-fourth of an inch thick for seven-eighths wide , and five-sixteenths for an inch wide and over . EXPANSION OF THE TIRE A tire four feet in diameter will expand two inches and a quarter , or three-sixteenths of an inch to the foot . Steel tire expands less . This is the expansion of red heat . If heated less it expands less , but it is no trouble to make the tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnace for tire heating comes handy in cities where there is no chance for making a fire outside , but every smith that has room for a fire outside will do better to heat the tire that way . Do n't build a tireheating furnace in the shop if wood is to be used for fuel , because the heat and smoke will turn in your face as soon as the doors of the furnace are opened . WELDING AXLES When a worn buggy axle is to be stubbed , proceed as follows : First , measure the length of the old axle . For this purpose take a quarter inch rod of iron , bend a square bend about an inch long on one end . With this rod measure from the end of the bearing , that is , let the hook of your rod catch against the shoulder at the end where the thread begins , not against the collars , for they are worn , nor should you measure from the end of the axle , for the threaded part is not of the same length . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mark it where you want to cut it off . Cut the axle one-fourth inch longer than it should be when finished . Next heat the ends to be welded and upset them so that they are considerably thicker over the weld ; lap the ends like No. i , Figure 6 , weld and use sand , but if the ends should not be welded very well then use borax . These stubs are made of soft steel , and will stand a higher heat than tool steel , but remember it is steel . If the ends have been upset enough they will have stock enough to draw down on , // and be of the right length . If this is rightly done one can not tell where the weld is . Set the axle by the gauge , if you have one , if not , by the wheels . AXLE GAUGE A gauge to set axles by can be made in this way : When you have set an axle by the wheels so that it is right , take a piece of iron 1M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this about six inches long , with a leg on the other end . See No. 5 , Figure 8 ; the leg to be movable and set either with a wedge or a set screw to fit for wide and narrow track . The gauge to be set against the bottom side of the axle . The pitch to be given a set of buggy wheels should be from one to one and one-half inches . I would recommend one and a half inches . This will be enough to insure a plumb spoke when the vehicle is loaded . It will also insure safety to the rider from mud slinging . By pitch , I mean that the wheels are one and a half inches wider at the upper rim than they:are down at the ground . Every smith ought to have a gauge of this kind , it is easy to make and it saves a lot of work , as there is no use of the wheels being put on and an endless measuring in order to get the axle set right . GATHER GAUGE By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one-half an inch wider back than in front . Do n't misunderstand me now . I do n't mean // that the hind wheels should be wider than the front wheels , I mean that a wheel should have a little gather in front , as they are inclined to spread and throw the bearing on the nut , while , if they have a little gather , they will run right , and have a tendency to throw the bearing on the collars of the axle . If they do they will // run more steady , especially when the axle is a little worn . A gauge for this purpose can be made like Figure 8 , No. 6 . This gauge to be fitted to the front side of the axle when you make it . It can be made of i x about three feet long , the forked end to reach the center of the axle . With these two gauges axles can be set right without the wheels . " The sluggard will not ' Slow by reason of cold ; therefore he shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHAPTER V HOW TO MAKE PLOWSHARES Where are two kinds of shares : lip shares and bar shares , and they must be treated differently . We will first treat of bar shares . The first thing to do when a plow is brought for a new lay is to look over the condition of the landside . By landside is meant the bar to which the share is welded . Now if this bar is worn down so that you think it too weak to stand for a new share , then make a new one . HOW TO MAKE A LANDSIDE For a I4-inch plow take z/ x 0 , or 2% x A. For a 16-inch plow , use 2% x or 3 X i'g common iron . Cut the iron diagonally at the point . This will prepare a point on each side of the cut ; that is , you had better cut out two landsides at a time . But if you do not want to do that , then cut the iron off square . Next take a piece of common iron 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this diagonally , and it will make shins for two . Some plow factories use steel for shins , but that 88 // is not necessary , for it will not make the plowshare any better , but , on the other hand , will be quite a bother when you want to drill a hole for a fincoulter if it is hardened . Place this shin on the land side of the landside , and weld . In preparing the shoulder of the // shin for the plate use a ship upsetter . See No. 3 , Figure 8 . Not one out of 500 blacksmiths have this tool . Every smith should have one . You can not do a good and quick job without it . When you shape the point of the landside hold it vertical , that is , the edge straight up and down , or plurnb . If you do n't do this , there will be trouble in welding , especially if you have held it under . Then it will lean under the square when welded , and in such a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do you will break it up when you attempt to set it to the square . Another thing , do n't make much slant on the landside up at the joint , for , if you do , you can never weld the share good up there . Give more slant towards the point . Be sure to have the right curve . It is very important to have the landside right : r , Because it is the foundation for the plow ; 2 , if the landside is right the start is right , and then there is no trouble to get the share right . When finished place the old landside on top of the new , with the upper edges even ; do n't go by the bottom edges , as they are worn . Now mark the hole . You may leave the front hole for the foot of the beam this time . When holes are drilled , then put a bolt through the hole of the foot of beam and landside ; now place the plow on the landside and measure 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this position mark the front hole of the foot of the beam . If the beam has been sprung up you will now have remedied that . So much about a new landside , On the other side , if the old landside is not MODERN BLACKSMITHING too much worn to be used , then repair as follows : Take a piece of 0-inch thick flat iron the width of the landside about ten inches long . Cut one end off diagonally , this end to be flattened down . Why should this end be cut diagonally ? This piece of iron is to be placed on the inner side of the landside and as far back as to cover the hole that holds the plate . Now , if this iron is cut square off , and left a little too thick on that end , it will cut into the landside and weaken it ; but if cut diagonally and drawn out thin it will not weaken , nor can it break when cut in this manner . To be sure of a good strong weld , upset over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important thing in making a new lay . " No hoof , no horse " ? no landside , no plow . There are only a few blacksmiths recognizing this fact . Most of the smiths will simply take a piece of iron about half an inch square and weld it on top of the point . This is the quickest way , but it is also the poorest way , but they can not very well do it in any other way , for if you have no shin upsetter to dress and shape the shoulder for the plate , then it is quite a job to repair any other way . There are three reasons why a landside can not be repaired with a patch on top of the point : I , The shin or shoulder in an old landside is worn down sometimes to almost nothing , and the only way to get stock enough to make a good shoulder is to put a good-sized piece of iron on the inside , back and behind this shoulder . If a new plate is to be put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw down the plate to the thickness of the old shoulder , and in such a case the plate will add no strength to the share . // 2 , The landside is , in many cases , worn down on the bottom to a thin , sharp edge , and by placing the piece on top the landside will be as it was on the bottom side , where it ought to be as thick as you can make it . 3 , The weakest place in the landside is just at the shoulder of the shin , and by placing the piece on top it will not reach over this weak place , and with a new long point on , the strain will be heavier than before , and the landside will either bend or break . I have in my experience had thousands of plows that have been broken or bent on account of a poorly-repaired landside . Blacksmiths , with only a few exceptions , are all making this mistake . The landside is to the plow what the foundation is to the house . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid foundation . No practical plowsmith will ever try to make a good plow without a solid landside . For prairie or brush breakers , where no plate is used , it will be all right to repair the landside by placing a piece of iron on top of it , provided it is not much worn , and the patch reaches back far enough to strengthen the landside . But even in such cases it is better to lay it on the inner side . LANDSIDE POINT FOR SLIPSHARE We have now learned how to prepare the landside for a solid or long bar share . We shall now learn how to make a landside point for slipshares . There are // smiths that will take the old worn-out stub of a slipshare point , weld a piece to it , and then weld the share on . This is very ridiculous and silly . There is nothing left in such a point to be of any use . Make a new one ; be sure to make it high enough ? at least half an inch higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you material to weld down on . If the landside is not high enough the share will be lower ? that is , the joint of the lay will be lower than the joint of the mouldboard , and it should be the other way . On this point many an old smith and every beginner makes mistakes , and not only in this case , but in every-thing else . Whatever you have to make , be sure to have stock enough to work down on , and you will be all right . It is better to have too much than not enough . In shaping the point remember to hold it perpendic ular , and give very little slant up at the joint , but more towards the point . If too much slant up at the joint there will be difficulty in welding it . Remember this . Do n't make the point straight like a wedge ; if you do the share will be above the frog . Give it the same circle it had , and the share will rest solid on the frog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay will not have the full strength if it do n't rest on the frog , and it will not be steady , and the plow will not run good , for in a few days the share flops up and down . When a 14-inch share is finished the point , from the joint of the share to the extreme end of the point , should be ri inches , not longer , and for a i6-inch lay , 12 inches , not longer . The point acts as a lever on the plow , and if it is too long the plow will not work good , and it is liable to break . Shape the point so that when you hold it up against the plow it will be in line with the bottom of the landside , but about half an inch wider than the landside to weld on . If it is a plow where the point of the mouldboard rests on the landside point , and it is a double shin , then cut out in the landside point for the point of the mouldboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will be a guide for you when welding the share , and it will slip onto the plow easier when you come to fit it to the same . I think enough has been said about the landside to give the beginner a good idea of how to make one . And if the landside is right , it comes easier to do the rest . In making a plowshare there are many things to remember , and one must be on the alert right along , for it will give lots of trouble if any point is overlooked . We will now weld a share to a long bar landside . The landside having been finished and bolted to the beam or its foot , or to a standard , the share is to be shaped to fit . Hold the share up to the plow . First look if the angle for the point is right in the share ; if not , heat the share , and if under the angle wanted // upset up at the joint ; if over the angle wanted , drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the share over a wooden block instead of the anvil , so as not to batter the thin edge of the share . If the share has been upset so that it has a narrow rib along the point where it is to be welded , draw this down and make it level . In most blank shares the point should be raised to fit the landside point , so that when the same is placed on the floor the edge of the share will follow the floor or leveling block ( if you have it ) , from the heel right up to the point , then it will be easy to make the edge come down to the square in finishing it up . If this is not done the edge of the share from the throat back will generally be too high . In Figure 9 two shares are represented , one with the landside point on ready for welding . In this share the point of the same has been raised so that the share // comes down to the square in the throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point between Nos. 4 and 5 , resting on the extreme heel and point with gap between the edge of share and floor at No. 3 . In most blank shares the point is too straight , and the point too much bent down at No. 4 . Bend the share so that the whole length from heel to point will follow the floor . When the share is held in a position as shown in this cut , do n't fit the share to the brace , for in most old plows the brace has been bent out of shape . Fit the share to the square , and then fit the brace to the share , and you are right . Many a blacksmith will never think of this , but it is important . Next joint the share ; that is , if the joint does not fit the joint of the mouldboard , make it fit either by filing or grinding . This done , make the holes , and when you center-punch for same draw the holes a trifle ; that means make the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially for the hole next to the point . This is also an important point overlooked by most blacksmiths . The holes that hold the joints together should act as a wedge . If they do n't the joints will pull apart and leave a gap between , where dirt and straw will gather , and if a slipshare the share will soon work loose and the plow will flop . The holes having been punched and countersunk , the share should be bolted to the brace . Next put on the clamp . It is not necessary that the clamp should be put on while the share is on the plow . I never do that . I used to for many years , but there is no need of doing it , for if the share has the right angle it must // come to its place when even with the point on the outside , and a cut should be made in the landside just at the place where the point of the mouldboard rests on same , this cut will also be a guide . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 7 illustrates a clamp for this purpose . The set screw at the bottom serves to hold the landside from leaning over or under , while the setscrew at the upper end holds the share against the point . If this clamp is rightly made it works splendid . The clamp should be placed over the plowshare up at the joint , because the first heat or weld should be on the point . Some smiths ? well , for a fact , most smiths ? take the first weld up at the joint . This is wrong . The point should be welded first . Then you have a chance to set the share right and fit it snug to the point the whole way up . You can not make a good weld if the share does not fit snug against the landside point , to prevent air and cinders from playing between . Further , the share should be upset over the weld , when this is not done in the blank share ; the lower corner of the share will protrude over the landside . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken up at the joint . For welding compound use steel borings and scales from either steel or iron . After you have moistened the place where the weld is to be taken with borax , then fill in between the share and point with steel borings , and on top of this a little steel or iron scales . Do not buy any welding compound of any kind , because if you learn to know what you have in the shop you will find that there never was // a welding compound made to excel borax , steel scales , steel or iron borings , and powdered glass . All these you have without buying . In heating go slow . If you put on too strong blast the share will burn before the iron is hot enough to weld . When ready to weld let your helper take with a pair of tongs over the share and landside to hold them tight together while you strike the first blow . Use a large hammer and strike with a pressure on the hammer the first blows , until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with force . I have made it a practice , no matter how good this weld seems to be , to always take a second weld . This weld to be a light one . The share and landside are after the first weld settled , so it takes very little to weld them then . On the other hand , the first weld might look to all appearances solid , but it is not always . With this precaution I never had a share that ripped open in the weld , while it is a rare thing to find a share made by a blacksmith that does not rip . Now , then , weld down toward the point . The point should not be allowed to have any twist , for if it does , it will turn the plow over on the side . Now set the edge right , beginning at the heel . If the share is made for hard fall plowing give more suction than for a share for soft spring plowing . Grind and polish before you harden , and after it is hardened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polishing or grinding after hardening will wear off the case hardening . // SLIPSHARE We shall now weld a slipshare . When the point is finished hold it to the plow with a pair of tongs while you fit the share . When the share is fitted take the point off from the plow and fasten it to the share with the clamp . As I have said before , there is no need of fastening the share to the landside point with the plow as a guide . If the landside and share are right there can not be any mistake , and it comes easier to screw them together over the anvil . Now proceed as with a long bar share , and when the weld up at the joint has been taken , fit the share to the plow while hot . Some smiths in preparing the landside point for a slipshare will place the share so that the point is a little too short back where it rests against the end of the plate . This is a bad idea . It is claimed that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reach up against the plate . This is true , if the landside point is only high enough ; but if it is low and you lose a heat in welding , as most smiths do , then your landside point will be both too low and too short . Thousands of shares are made every year that have this fault . Therefore , whatever you are doing have stock enough . It is easy to cut off from the landside while yet hot , but it is difficult to repair if too short . No share will work steadily if the point does not rest right against the plate . In blacksmithing , every beginner , and many an old smith , makes the mistake of providing less stock than is needed for the work to be done . It is essential to I00 MODERN BLACKSMITHING have material to dress down on ; and if a heat is lost , or a weld , it will make the stock in the article weaker , and to meet these exigencies there must be material from the start , enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion as to whether the share should be welded at the point or at the joint first . While I was yet a young man and employed in a plow factory , I had an opportunity to see the different ideas set to a test . In the factory the practice was to weld MODERN BLACKSMITHING IOI the point first . A plowman from another State was engaged , and he claimed that it would be better to weld the share first up at the joint . He was given a chance to prove his assertion , and the result was that 3 per cent of his shares broke over the inner side of the landside at the joint in the hardening , and lo per cent ripped up in the weld at the same place . These are results that will always follow this method . The first , because the share was not upset over the weld ; the second , because a good weld can not be taken unless the share is dressed down snug against the point when hot . As far as the number of shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Still , this man was a good plowman , and was doing better than I ever saw a man with this idea do before . For it is a fact , that out of one thousand plowshares welded by country blacksmiths , nine hundred and ninety will rip up . I have been in different States , and seen more than many have of this kind of work , but , to tell the truth , there is no profession or trade where there is so much poor work done as in blacksmithing , and especially in plow work . Blacksmiths often come to me , even from other States , to learn my ideas of making plowshares . On inquiring , I generally find that they weld a piece on the top of the old landside and proceed to weld without touching the share or trying to fit it at all . We need not be surprised at this ignorance , when we know that it is only fifty years since John Deere reformed the plow industry entirely and made the modern plow now in use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ioa MODERN BLACKSMITHING learned this part of their business , in so short a time , successfully . Still , I have seen blacksmiths prosper and have quite a reputation as plowmen , while , for a fact , they never made a plowshare that was , from the standpoint of a practical plowman , right . i V ' He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied . " ? Proverbs . CHAPTER VI HOW TO HARDEN A PLOWSHARE If the share is of soft center steel , harden as follows : First , heat the whole point to a very low red heat ; then turn the share face down , with the heel over the fire , and the point in such a position that it is about two inches higher than the heel . This will draw the fire from the heel along towards the point , and the whole length of the share will be heated almost in one heat . Be sure to get an even heat , for it will warp or crack if the heat is uneven . When the share has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice that it is sprung up along the edge . This is the rule , but there are exceptions , and the share is then sprung down . In either case set it right ; if sprung up set it down a little under the square ; if sprung down set it a little over the square . You can not with any success set it by a table or leveling block , because this will , first , cool off the edge , second , it 103 // must be either over or under the square a little . Therefore , you must use your eye and set the share with the hammer over the anvil . This done , hold the share over the fire until it has a low red heat , as stated before ; then plunge it into a tub of hardening compound , such as is sold by the traveling man , or sprinkle the share with prussiate of potash and plunge it into a barrel of salt water . You will notice that the share will warp or spring out of shape more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat is right . Some smiths never look at the share when hot for hardening , but simply plunge it into the tub , and then they say it warped in hardening , while it was in the heating . If the share is too hot it will warp in cooling also . HOW TO POINT A SHARE Points are now sold by dealers in hardware , and every smith knows how they are shaped . There is , however , no need of buying these ; every smith has old plowshares from which points can be cut , provided you do n't use an old share too much worn . The points sold are cut with the intention that most of the point is to be placed on top of the plow point . This is all right in some instances , while it is wrong in others . When you cut a piece for a point make it the same shape at both ends . Now , when a plow needs the most of the point on top bend the end to be on top longer than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the point wants to be heaviest on the bottom side . I hold that in ordinary cases the most of the point should be on the bottom side . If it is it will wear better and keep in the ground longer , for as soon as the point is worn off underneath it comes out of the ground . Do n't monkey with old mower sections or anything like them for points , for , although the material is good , it is not the quality alone but also the quantity that goes to make up a good point . It takes only a few hours ' plowing to wear off a section from the extreme point of the share , and then there is only the iron of the plow point left to wear against , and your time spent for such a point is lost . Another thing , it takes just as much time to put on such a point as it does to put on a good one for which you charge the regular price . In putting on a point of thin material you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel before the plow point is hot . zo6 MODERN BLACKSMITHING Smiths , as a rule , draw out a round back point . They seem to be afraid of coming down on the point with the hammer for fear it will spring the point towards the land . This can be remedied by using a wooden block for anvil . Then you can set the point back without battering the edge of the share . The suck of a point should be one-eighth of an inch . Do n't split the steel of the point of a share open and wedge a point in . Make one long enough to reach around the point , say from 8 to Io inches long , and you will have a good substantial job . There is too much experimenting in putting on points yet , but the method just described is the only good one . // HOW TO SHARPEN A PLOWSHARE If the share to be sharpened is a hardened share , and it is the first time it is sharpened , then be careful not to heat it too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much the same as possible . For my part , I never follow this rule . I heat it as much as is needed to draw it out good , and then harden it over again . But beginners can sharpen a new share once without hardening it over , if the temper is not entirely out of the share . To sharpen a share without springing it some is an impossibility . No device will prevent this , and the only way to set it right is to heat it all over . In sharpening a share it is drawn out on one side , and it is natural that that side is made longer , and as a result the share must warp . In a circular saw it takes only a couple of blows on one side to get it out of shape ; then what else can we expect in a plowshare , when all the hammering is done on one side ? Some smiths turn the bottom side of the share up and hammer on that side , but this is wrong ; first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the scales on the anvil will mark the face of the share just as bad as the hammer , so nothing is gained by this . Place the share on the anvil , face up , and use a hammer with a big round face , and when you get used to this , the best result is obtained . D ( n't draw the edge out too thin . There is no need of a thin edge on a plow that has to cut gravel and snags , but for sod breaking a thin edge is wanted , and the smith has to use his best judgment even in such a case . tog MODERN BLACRSMITHING HOW TO PUT ON A HEEL Cut a piece of steel about eight inches long , three inches wide on one end , and pointed down to a sharp point on the other . Draw out one side thin to nothing . Next , draw out the heel of the share . Now place the heel piece on the bottom side of the share , and hold it in place with a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the pointed end of the piece , next heat at the heel , share down , then turn the share over , heel down ; go slow , use borax freely , and place a little steel borings between the heel piece and the share . After a little practice almost any smith ought to be able to put on a heel , while now it is only a few smiths that can do it . I never put on a heel yet but the owner of the plow would tell me that other smiths tell him it can not be done . When welded good be sure to get the right shape in the share . Grind and polish carefully , as the dirt is inclined to stick to the share in this place more easily than in any other . HOW TO REPAIR A FLOPPING PLOW When a plow is flopping or going everywhere so that the owner do n't know what is the matter the fault should be looked for first in the beam . If the beam is loose the plow will not run steady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is in the share . If the point has too little " suction , " and the edge of the share is too much rolling the plow generally acts this way . // To remedy this , sharpen the share , set the point down , and the edge of the lay from the point all the way back to the heel , and the plow will work right . HOW TO SET A PLOW RIGHT THAT TIPS ON ONE SIDE If a plow is inclined to fall over on the right handle , the fault is in the share . The share in such a case has too much suction along the edge . Heat the whole share and roll the edge of it up and the plow will work all right . If a plow tips over on the left side handle , the share in such a case is too much rolled up . Heat it all over and set the edge down to give it more suction . WHEN A PLOW RUNS TOO DEEP There are two reasons for a plow running too deep : i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the floor up to the lower side of it , then the beam should be heated over a place as far back as possible , and the same set down to its proper place . 2 , If the point of the share has too much suction the plow will also run too deep . The right suction to give a plowshare is from y to 13-g- of an inch . If a plow do n't run deep enough with this much as a draw , there must be something else out of shape ; or , if it goes too deep , the fault must be looked for in the beam or in no MODERN BLACKSMITHING the tugs with small-sized horses . The point of a share should never be bent upwards in order to prevent the plow from going too deep . Set the share right , and if the plow then goes out of its proper way the fault must be found somewhere else . WHEN A PLOW TAKES TOO MUCH LAND If a 14-inch plow takes too much land the fault is either in the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a share should stand one-eighth of an inch to land , and the beam should stand about three inches to the right . This will be right for a 14-inch plow and two horses . If for a i6-inch plow and three horses , the beam should be in line with the landside . HOW TO FIX A GANG PLOW THAT RUNS ON ITS NOSE When a gang or sulky plow runs on its nose and shoves itself through the dirt , the fault is with the share or in the beam . In most cases this fault is a set back beam , but it might also be the result of a badlybent-down and out-of-shape landside point . If it is in the beam , take it out and heat it in the arch , then bend it forward until the plow has the right shape , and it will run right . MODERN RLACKSMITHING III HOW TO HARDEN A MOULDBOARD To harden a mouldboard is no easy job in a blacksmith 's forge , and it is no use trying this in a portable forge , because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . First , dig the firepot out clean , then make a charcoal fire of two bushels of this coal , have some dry basswood or wood like it , and when the charcoal begins to get red all over then pile the wood on the outside corners of the fire . Heat the point of the mouldboard first , because this being shinned , it is thicker and must be heated first or it will not be hot enough ; then hold the mouldboard on the fire and pile the wood and hot coal on top of it . Keep it only until red hot in the same place , then move it around , especially so that the edges get the force of the fire , or they will be yet cold while the center might be too hot . HOW TO PATCH A MOULDBOARD When the mouldboard is red hot all over sprinkle with prussiate of potash , and plunge into a barrel of ice or salt water . A mouldboard will stand a good heat if the heat is even ; otherwise it will warp or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a boiler , then fill the fire place with wood and heat your mouldboard there . This will give you a very good heat . If it is a shinned mouldboard the point must be heated first in the forge , then place it under the boiler for heating . This must be done to II2 MODERN BLACKSMITHING insure a good heat on the point , which is thicker than the mouldboard and therefore would not be hot enough in the time the other parts get hot . When a mouldboard is worn out on the point a patch can be put on , if the mouldboard is not too much worn otherwise . Cut a piece of soft center steel to fit over the part to be repaired . Draw this piece out thin where it is to be welded to face of mouldboard . Hold this piece in position while taking the first weld , with a pair of tongs . Weld the point first , then the edges , last the center . The patch should be welded to face of mouldboard . When the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some live coal over it , in the fire ; use borax freely , and , when ready to weld , weld the patch while the mouldboard is in the fire , using a rod of round iron as a hammer with one end of it bent for this purpose . When the patch is thus welded in its thinnest place then take it out and weld on the anvil . In heating for the weld never place the patch down towards the tuyer , for there the blast will make // it scale , and it will never weld this way . Remember this in all kinds of welding . Figure I IA represents two shares . No . I represents a share set for spring plowing , when the ground is soft . Notice the heel of the share following the square for about one inch at c , while the heel in No. 2 rests with the extreme edge on the square , and is set for fall plowing , when the ground is hard . The line between a and b shows the suction at d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Breaking plows and large plows which are run shallow should have a wide bearing at c . In breaking plows the heel will sometimes have to be rolled up a little at this place . The reason most men do not accomplish more is because they do not attempt more . " CHAPTER VII MOWER SECTIONS IN filling a sickle bar there are two ways to remove the old sections . One way is to punch the rivets out , but in every case where the back of the section sticks out over the sickle bar they can be removed easier in this way : Just open the vise enough to receive the section , then strike with the hammer on the back of the section , and this blow will cut the rivets off . You can cut out ten to one by this method to any other . Sometimes the sickle bar is bent out of shape in the fitting . To straighten it place the sickle on the anvil , sections down ; now strike with the hammer so that it will touch the bar only on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the inner side of the curve . BABBITING When a box is to be babbited the first thing to do is to clean the box If it can be placed over the fire the old babbit with melt out easily . If the box can not be held over the fire , then chisel the old babbit out . At II4 MODERN BLACKSMITHING xis each end of the box there is a ridge to hold the babbit in the box ; that is , in cast iron boxes . On top of this ridge place a strip of leather as thick as you want the babbit to be . This done , place the shaft in the box . Pour the babbit in level with the box . Be careful about having the box dry ; if any dampness is in the box the babbit will explode . Now place a thick paper on each side of the box and put on the top box , with the bolts in to hold it in place tight , then close up at the ends with putty . In some cases it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the box is cold and there is little room for the babbit it will cool off before it can float around . In such a case the boxes should be warm and the babbit heated to a red heat . Now pour the babbit in through the oil hole . In cases where there are wooden boxes , and the babbit is to reach out against the collars , the shaft must be elevated or hung on pieces of boards on each side with notches in for the shaft to rest in . Use putty to fill up and make tight , so that the babbit must stay where wanted . For slow motion babbit with a lesscooling percentage ( tin ) ; for high speed , more-cooling ( tin ) . Grooves may be cut in the bottom box for oil . When a shaft is to be babbited all around in a solid box the shaft is inclined to stick in the babbit . To prevent this smoke the shaft a little and have it warm . When cool it will come out all right . Or wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied with strings to the shaft . I z6 MODERN BLACKSMITHING ANNEALING By gradually heating and cooling steel will be softened , brittleness reduced , and flexibility increased . In this state steel is tough and easiest drilled or filed . Tool steel is sometimes too hard to drill or file without first annealing it ; and the best way to do this is to slowly heat to a red heat , then bury the steel in the cinders and let it cool slowly . To heat and let the steel cool exposed to the air will do no good , as it cools off too quick , and when cool the steel is as hard as ever . This is air temper . HOW TO REPAIR BROKEN COGS Cogs can be inserted in a cogwheel in different ways . If the rim of the wheel is thick enough a cog can be dovetailed in . That is , cut a slot in the rim from the root of the cog down , this slot to be wider at the bottom . Prepare a cog the exact size of the cogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before you drive this cog in , cut out a chip on each end of the slot , and when the cog is driven in you can clinch the ends where you cut out . This will make a strong cog , and if properly made will never get loose . Another way : If the rim is thin , then make a cog with a shank on , or a bolt cog . If the rim is wide make two bolts . The cog can be either riveted or fastened with nuts . If only one shank is made , the same must be square up at the cog , or the cog will // turn and cause a breakdown . But a shallow slot can be cut in the rim to receive and hold the cog , and then a bolt shank will hold it in place , whether the shank is round or square . HOW TO RESTORE OVERHEATED STEEL If steel has been burnt the best thing to do is to throw it in the scraps ; but if overheated it can be improved . Heat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in salt water , while yet hot enough to be of a brown color . Repeat this a half a dozen times , and the steel will be greatly bettered . Of course , this is only in cases when a tool or something like it has been overheated which can not be thrown away without loss . By this simple method I have restored tools overheated by ignorant smiths , and in some cases the owner would declare that it was " better than ever . " HOW TO DRESS AND HARDEN STONE HAMMERS Care must be taken in heating stone hammers not to overheat them . Dress the hammer so that the edges are a little higher than the center , thus making a slight curve . A hammer dressed this way will cut better and stay sharp longer than if the face is level . Dress both ends before hardening , then harden face end first . Heat to a red heat , and cool off in cold water IIS MODERN BLACKSMITHING about one inch up , let the temper return to half an inch from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you can without changing the temper at the face . There it should be as hard as you can make it . When heating the peen end keep a wet rag over the face to prevent it from becoming hot . This end should not be tempered quite as , hard as the face . HOW TO DRILL CHILLED CAST IRON Chilled cast iron can be easily drilled if properly annealed , but it can not be annealed simply by heating and slowly cooling . Heat the iron to a red heat and place it over the anvil in a level position ; place a piece of brimstone just where the hole is to be drilled , and let it soak in . If it is a thick article place a piece on each side over the hole , as it will better penetrate and soften the iron . Next , heat it again until red , then bury it in the cinders , and let it cool slowly . To heat and anneal chilled iron is of no avail unless it is allowed to remain hot for hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , retain its hardness . The only way to anneal is to let it remain in the fire for hours . Brimstone will help considerably , but even with that it is best to let cool as slowly as your time will admit . HOW TO DRILL HARD STEEL First , make your drill of good steel , oval in form , and a little heavier than usual on point , and temper as // hard as it will without drawing the temper , the heat to be a low red cherry . Diluted muriatic acid is a good thing to roughen the surface with where you want the hole . Use kerosene instead of oil , or turpentine . The pressure on the drill should be steady so that it will cut right along as it is hard to start again if it stops cutting , but if it does , again use diluted muriatic acid . The hole should be cleaned after the use of the acid . FACTS ABOUT STEEL I have repeatedly warned against overheating steel . Do n't heat too fast , for if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be burnt , while the bar is yet too cool inside to be worked . Do n't let steel remain for any length of time in the fire at a high heat , for both steel and iron will then become brittle . This is supposed by some to be due to the formation of oxide disseminated through the mass of the metal , but many others believe that a more or less crystalline structure is set up under the influence of a softening heat , and is the sole cause of the diminution in strength and tenacity . The fiber of the steel is spoiled through overheating ; this can , to some extent , be remedied by heavy forging if it is a heavy bar . Steel is harder to weld than iron , because it contains less cinders and slag , which will produce a fusible fluid in iron that will make it weld without trouble . Steel contains from .2 to z5 per cent carbon , and varies in quality according to the per cent of carbon , and it is // claimed that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few kinds are known , and the sturdy smith discards both " physical tests and chem-ical analysis , " and he thinks he knows just as much as do those who write volumes about these tests . To weld tool steel , or steel of a high per cent of car-bon , borax must be used freely to prevent burning and promote fusing . Steel with less carbon , or what smiths call " soft steel , " " sleigh steel , " should be welded with sand only . This soft steel stands a higher heat than the harder kinds . Good tool steel will break easy when cold if it is cut into a little with a cold chisel all around , and the bar then placed with the cut over the hole in the anvil , the helper striking directly over the hole . If it is good steel it will break easy , and the broken ends are fine grain , of a light color . If it shows glistening or glit tering qualities it is a bad sign . Good steel will crumble under the hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp point , heat to a red heat , cool in salt water ; if it cuts glass it is a steel of high hardening quality . For armor piercing , frogs , tiles , safes , and crushing machinery , alloy steel is used . This steel contains chromium , manganese or nickel , which renders it intensely hard . Tungsten is another alloy that is used in iron-cutting tools , because it does not lose its hard ness by friction . Smiths should know more about steel than they do , and we would have steel to suit every need . As it is now , any poor stuff is sent to the MODERN BLACKSMITHING tsi smith . The same can be said of iron . The American wrought iron is the poorest iron that ever got the name of iron , but there are thousands of smiths using this stuff with great difficulty without ever a word said as a protest against the manufacture of the rotten material . We often get iron that is too poor to bend hot without breaking . Let us register a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to abolish the tariff , and there will be good iron manufactured in this country , or the Swedish and Norwegian iron will be used . But the result will be the same with iron as with the matches : the American manufactories will make good iron when they have to . We get iron and steel that is both " cold-shot and hot-shot . " The former breaks easy when cold , the latter when hot . We have meat and wheat inspectors ; where is the iron inspector ? Farmers know enough to ask for protection , but blacksmiths will never say a word . They use the cold-shot or hotshot iron , and when they have spent half a day in completing a little intricate work it breaks in their hands because of iron that is either cold or hot shot . Tnsist on good iron , and the steel will also be good . Deduct a little every year from the amount due your jobber for poor iron , and you can be sure if this is done by a few thousand smiths it will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no such thing as welding cast iron . The best that can be done is to melt it together ; but this is simply accidental work , and when // done do n't amount to anything . Still , I have never met a blacksmith yet who could not weld cast iron , but , at the same time , I have yet to meet the man that can do it ; and I will give twenty-five dollars to the smith that will give me a receipt for welding cast-iron shoes that will be useful when welded . All receipts I have seen for this purpose are simply bosh . Malleable iron is a different thing . Many smiths weld malleable iron and think it is cast iron . " The wish , " in such a case , " is the father of the thought , " but to weld malleable iron is not more difficult than to weld . soft steel . Malleable iron when good , and steel when soft , are about the same thing . I would therefore advise smiths to spend no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you should succeed in sticking it enough to hang together . It will in most cases be useless , because it will not be of the same shape as before . // IF a pump handle is broken use rock salt and powdered glass as a welding compound . Stick the ends together in the fire . When they are about ready to melt tap lightly on one end while your helper holds the other end steady . In one case out of a hundred it will stick enough to hang together . If you have nothing else to do this will be a nice thing to kill time with CASE HARDENING Iron and steel may be case hardened with either of the following compounds : Prussiate of potash , sal-ammoniac of equal parts . Heat the iron red hot and sprinkle it with this compound , then heat again and sprinkle , and plunge it while yet hot in a bath of salt water . Another : Cyanide of potassium ; grind it into a fine powder and sprinkle over the iron while red hot , and plunge into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coagulate if it is held against the fire so it gets warm . Be careful with this powder , as it is a strong poison . It is the best thing that I have ever tried for case hardening iron . It will case harden the softest iron so that it can not be touched with any tool . It is also good for plows , especially where it is hard to make a plow scour . The only objection is the price , as it costs more than prussiate of potash or other hardening compounds . HOW TO HARDEN SPRINGS Heat to a heat that will be discerned in the dark as a low red heat . Plunge into a bath of lukewarm water . Such a heat can not be noticed in a light sunny day , but it is just the heat required . Of course , it is the smith with practice who succeeds , as with everything else . Another way : Heat to a low red heat and bury the spring in cold sand . Another : Heat to a low red heat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND IRON AS WHITE AS SILVER Take i pound of ashes from white ash bark , dissolve in soft water . Heat your iron red , and cool in this solution , and the iron will turn white as silver . // TO MEND BROKEN SAWS Silver , 15 parts ; copper , 2 parts . These should be filed into powder and mixed . Now place your saw level with the broken ends tight up against each other ; put a little of the mixture along the seam , and cover with powdered charcoal ; with a spirit lamp and a blowpipe melt the mixture , then with the hammer set the joint smooth . TO MEND A BAND SAW If a band saw is broken file the ends bevel , and lap one end over the other far enough to take up one tooth ; place the saw in such a position that the saw will be straight when mended ; use silver , copper and brass ; file into a fine powder ; place this over the joint and cover with borax . Now heat two irons one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place one on each side of the joint , and when the powdered metal is melted have a pair of tongs ready to take hold over the joint with while it cools . File off and smooth the sides , not leaving the blade any thicker than in other places . // TO WRITE YOUR NAME ON STEEL TAKE of nitric acid 4 ozs . ; muriatic acid , 34 oz . Mix together . Now cover the place you wish to write on with beeswax , the beeswax to be warm when applied . When it is cold , write your name with a sharp instrument . Be sure to write so that the steel is discernible in the name . Now apply the mixture with a feather , well filling each letter . Let the mixture remain about five minutes or more , according to the depth desired ; then wash off the acid ; water will stop the process of the same . When the wax is removed , the inscription is plain . " 1 ' man who confesses his ignorance is on the road /a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By H. MOEN , MACHINIST , CRESCO , IOWA . WHEN the leak or weak place in the boiler is found , take a ripping chisel and cut out all of the weak , thin and cracked parts . This done , make the patch . The patch must be large , not less than an inch lap on all sides , but if double rows of rivets are wanted the lap should be two inches on all sides . Bevel or scrape the patch on all edges to allow calking . The bolt holes should be about two inches apart and countersunk for patch bolts , if patch bolts are used . Next , drill two holes in the boiler shell , one on each side of the patch , and put in the bolts . These bolts should be put in to stay and hold the patch in position while the rest of the holes are drilled and bolted . When the bolts are all in , take your wrench and tighten the bolts one after the other , harder and harder , striking at the same time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bolt heads when you tighten and draw the bolt until its head breaks off . These bolts are made 127 // for this purpose and in such a shape that the head will break at a high strain . This done use the calking iron all around the patch . The patch should be put on the inside of the boiler , especially if on the bottom of a horizontal boiler . If the patch is put on the outside in this place the sedi ment or solid matter which the water contains will quickly fill up over the patch and there is danger of overheating the boiler and an explosion may follow . HOW TO PUT IN FLUES The tools necessary to retube an old boiler are , first , a good expander of the proper size ; a roller expander preferred ; a crow foot or calking iron , made from good tool steel . A cutting-off tool can be made to do very good service , in the following manner : Take a piece of steel , say x about ten inches long . Draw one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right angle of a length just enough to let it pass inside of the flue to be cut . A gas pipe can be used for a handle . In cutting the flues set this tool just inside the flue sheet and press down on the handle . If this tool is properly made it cuts the old flues out with ease . After both ends have been cut the flues will come out . // Next , cut the tubes about / of an inch longer than the flue sheet . After the tubes are cut the proper length , and placed in the boiler , expand the same in both ends with a flue expander . After the flues are expanded until they fit the holes solid , turn them over with the peen of a hammer to make them bell shaped . Now take a crows-foot , or calking tool , and turn the ends in a uniform head and tight all around . If the flues should leak , and there is water on the boiler take a boiler expander and tighten them up . But never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is water on the boiler . HOW TO WELD FLUES In welding flues or putting new tips on old flues , you must find out how far the old tubes are damaged , and cut that part off . Next clean the scales off in a tumb ling box ; if you have none , with an old rasp . Now take a piece of tubing the size of the old , and scarf the ends down thin , the new tube to go over the old and drive them together . In welding a rest can be made in the forge to push the tube against while weld ing , to prevent the pieces from pulling apart . A three-eighths rod , with thread on one end and a head ISO MODERN BLACKSMITHING on the other , run through the flue will be found handy for holding the pipes or flues together . In welding these together do n't take them out of the fire and strike with a hammer , but take a rod Y8-inch round , and bend one end to serve as a hammer . Strike with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time turning the flue around in the fire . Use borax to pre-vent the flue from scaling and burning . FOAMING IN BOILERS There are many reasons for foaming in boilers , but the chief reason is dirty water . In some cases it is imperfect construction of boiler , such as insufficient room for the steam and a too small steam pipe or dome . When a boiler is large enough for the steam and clean water is used there is no danger of foaming . When more water is evaporated than there is steam room or heating surface for , then the boiler will foam . When a boiler is overworked more steam than its capacity will admit is required , and the engine is run at a high speed , the steam will carry with it more water than usual . When a boiler foams shut the throttle partly to check the outflow of steam and lessen the suction of water , because the water is sucked up and follows the sides of the dome up . If the steam pipe in the dome sticks through the flange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A boiler that is inclined to foam should not be filled MODERN BLACKSMITHING iii too full with dirty water ; if it is it is best to blow off a little . Foul water can be cleaned by different methods before it enters the boiler , so as to prevent foaming and scaling . BLOWING OUT THE BOILER A boiler should not be blowed out under a high steam pressure , because the change is so sudden that it has a tendency to contract the iron , and if repeated often the boiler will leak . If it is done when there is brickwork around the boiler and the same is hot it will in a short time ruin the boiler . In such a case the boiler should not be blowed out for hours after you have ceased firing . THE HORSE THE horse must have been one of the first animals subjected to the use of man , but there is no record made of it before the time of Joseph , during the great famine in Egypt , when Joseph exchanged bread for horses . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars we find the horse used especially by great men and heroes . This noble animal has always been held in high esteem by civilized people . In wars and journeys and exploits , as well as for transports , the horse is of immeasurable value . No people cared for and loved this animal as did the Arabs . The care and breeding of horses was their main occupation , therefore their horses were noted for intelligence , high speed and endurance . The English and American thoroughbred has an infusion of blood of the Arab horse , which has set the price on these animals . Pedigrees were first established by the Arabs . Each country has its own breed of horses . Horses 132 // of a cold climate are smaller in size , as also are the horses of the tropics . The best horses are found in the temperate zone . In Germany the horses are large , well formed and strong . Norway and Sweden have a race of little horses , and not until a few years ago did the people of these countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger in porportion to the size than any other race of horses . In Sweden and Norway the farmer , with wife and children , will walk many miles Sunday to church , // while the horses roam in the pasture or stand in the stable . Some farmers will not hire out their team for money . The horses of these countries are better taken care of than anywhere else , of course with the excep-tion of American race horses . HORSE-SHOEING The horse in a wild state needs no shoes , the wear and tear that the feet are subjected to while the horse is hunting for his food in a wild country on soft mead-ows , is just right to keep the hoofs down in a normal condition . But when the horse is in bondage and must serve as a burden-carrying animal , traveling on hard // roads or paved streets , the horse must be shod to prevent a foot wear which nature can not recuperate . Horseshoes were first made of iron in 48o A. D. Before that time , and even after , horseshoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is necessary in order to be a successful horse-shoer to know something about the anatomical construction of the feet and legs of the horse . Of course , any little boy can learn the names of the bones and tendons in a horse 's foot in an hour , but this does not make a horse-shoer out of him . No board of examiners should // allow any horse-shoer to pass an examination merely because he can answer the questions put to him in regard to the anatomy of the horse , for as I have said before , these names are easily learned , but practical horse-shoeing is not learned in hours ; it takes years of study and practice . It is not my intention to treat on this subject . I could not ; first , because there is not room for such a dis-course , second , there are numerous books on the sub-ject better than I could write , available to every // horse-shoer . I shall only give a few names of such parts of the anatomy as is essential to know . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot connected with the hoof , as his work is confined solely to the foot . THE WALL The wall or crust is the horny sheath incasing the end of the foot , in the front and on the sides from the coronet to the ground . It is through this crust the nail is driven , and it is upon this crust the shoe rests . In front it is deepest , towards the quarter and heel it becomes thinner . It is of equal thickness from the upper end to the ground ( from top to bottom ) . The white corored wall is the poorest , while the iron col ored wall is the toughest . The growth of the wall is // different at different ages . It grows more in a young horse and colt than in an old horse ; in a healthy foot and soft , than in a diseased foot and hard . In a young horse the hoof will grow about three inches in a year and even more , while it grows less in an old horse . The wall is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coronet to the ground . THE SOLE The horny sole is the bottom of the foot . This sole is fibrous like the wall . The sole is thickest at the border , where it connects with the wall , and thinnest at the center . The sole when in a healthy condition scales off in flakes . This scale is a guide to the farrier whereby he can tell how much to pare off . There are different opinions in regard to the paring of the sole , but that is unnecessary , for nature will tell how much to cut off in a healthy foot . In a diseased foot it is different ; then the horse-shoer must use his own good judgment . It is , however , in very few cases that the shoer needs to do more than just clean the sole . Nature does the scaling off , or paring business , better than any farrier . THE FROG The frog is situated at the heel and back part of the hoof , within the bars ; the point extending towards the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the inflection of the wall . This body is also fibrous . The frog is very elastic and is evidently designed for contact with the ground , and for the prevention of jars injurious to the limbs . // CORONET Coronet is the name of the upper margin of the foot , the place where the hair ceases and the horny hoof begins . THE QUARTER The quarter means a place at the bottom of the wall , say , about one-third the length from the heel towards the toe . THE BARS By the bars we mean the horny walls on each side of the frog , commencing at the heel of the wall and extending towards the point of the frog . Any blacksmith or horse-shoer desiring to study more thoroughly the anatomy of the horse should procure a book treating on this subject . HOW TO MAKE THE SHOE It is only in exceptional cases that the shoer turns or makes a shoe . The shoes are now already shaped , creased and partly punched , so all that is needed is to weld on the toe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the toe first , and when hot bend the heels together a little . This is done because the shoes will spread when the toe calk is welded on , and the shoe should not be too wide on the toe , as is mostly the case . If the shoe is narrow at the toe it is easier to fit the same to the foot and get the shoe to fill out on the toe . Many smiths cut too much off from the 16o MODERN BLACKSMITHING In some cases it is milder , in others more severe . In some cases it is difficult to start the horse . He will jerk up on one leg and then on the other , but when started will go along all right . For this fault there is no cure because it is a nervous affection . If there is any local disorder it is best to treat this , as it might alleviate the jerk . For the jerk itself bathe the hind quarters once a day with cold water . If this do n't help try warm water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters dry after bathing . HOW TO SHOE A KICKING HORSE Many devices are now gotten up for shoeing kicking horses . It is no use for a man to wrestle with a horse , and every horse-shoer should try to find out the best way to handle vicious horses . One simple way , which will answer in most cases , is to put a twist on one of the horse 's lips or on one ear . To make a twist , take a piece of broom handle two feet long , bore a half-inch hole in one end and put a piece of a clothes line through so as to make a loop six inches in diameter . Another way : Make a leather strap with a ring in , put this strap around the foot of the horse ; in the ring of the strap tie a rope . Now braid or tie a ring in the horse 's tail and run the rope through this ring and back through the ring in the strap , then pull the foot up . See Figure r6 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by simply buckling the strap to the // foot and throwing the strap up over the neck of the horse . Shoeing stalls are also used , but they are yet too expensive for small shops . No horse-shoer should lose his temper in handling a nervous horse and abuse the animal ; for , in nine cases out of ten , will hard treatment make the horse worse , and many horse owners would rather be hit themselves than to have anybody hit their horse . Do n't curse . Be cool , use a little patience , and you will , in most cases , succeed . To a nervous horse you should talk gently , as you would to a scared child . The horse is the noblest and most useful animal to i6z MOOERN I3LACI SMITHING man , but is often maltreated and abused . Amongst our dumb friends , the horse is the best , but few recognize this fact . HOW TO SHOE A TROTTER In shoeing a trotter it is no use to follow a certain rule for the angle , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of the horse 's foot . Every owner of a trotter will test the speed by having shoes in different shapes and sizes , as well as having the feet trimmed at different angles , and when the angle is found that will give the best results the owner will keep a record of the same and give the horse-shoer directions and points in each case . // The average weight of a horse-shoe should be eight ounces . Remember this is for a trotter . Make the shoe fit to the edges of the wall so that there will be no rasping done on the outside . In farm and draft horses this is impossible , as there is hardly a foot of such a uniform shape but what some has to be rasped off . Use No. 4 nails , or No. 5 . Do n't rasp under the clinches of the nails . Make the shoes the shape of No . I , Figure 8 . HOW TO SHOE A HORSE WITH POOR OR BRITTLE HOOFS Sometimes it is difficult to shoe so as to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In such a case the shoe should be fitted snug . Make a shoe with a toe clip . HOW TO SHOE A WEAK-HEELED HORSE In weak heels the hoof is found to be low and thin from the quarters back . The balls are soft and tender . The shoes should not touch the hoof from the quarters back to the heels . An endless bar shoe is often the best thing for this trouble , giving some frog pressure to help relieve the pressure against the heels . // FOUNDER Founder is a disease manifested by fever in the feet in different degrees from a simple congestion to a severe inflammation . It is mostly exhibited in the fore feet , being uncommon in the hind feet . The reason for this is the harder pressure , a much greater amount of weight coming on the front feet , the strain and pressure on the soft tissues heavier . The disease is either acute or chronic , in one foot or both . When both feet are diseased the horse will put both feet forward and rest upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . If only one foot is affected that foot is put forward and sometimes kept in continual motion , indicating severe pain . The foot is hot , especially around the coronary band . The disease , if not checked , will render the-horse useless . When such a horse is brought to you for shoeing it would be best to send him to a veterinarian . How to shoe : Let the horse stand in a warm mud puddle for six hours , then put on rubber pads or common shoes with feet between the web of the shoe and the hoof , with sharp calks to take up the jar . It would be best not to shoe at all , but let the horse loose in a wet pasture for a good while . " A righteous man regardeth the life of his oeast . " ? Solomon . CHAPTER XI IN this chapter the author desires to give some hints about the treatment for diseases most common to horses . COLIC There are two kinds of colic , spasmodic and flatulent . Spasmodic colic is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are moments of relief and the horse is quiet . Flatulent colic is known by bloating symptoms and the pain is continual , the horse kicks , paws , tries to roll and lie on his back . For spasmodic colic give Iz ounce laudanum , IZ pint whisky , % pint water ; mix well and give in one dose . If this does not help , repeat the dose in half an hour . For flatulant colic give , % ounce laudanum , % ounce turpentine , % pint raw linseed oil , 3 ounce chloroform , / pint water . Mix well and give in one dose . Repeat in one hour if the pain is not relieved , 165 x66 MODERN BLACKSMITHING BOTS Sometimes there is no other symptom than the hots seen in the dung , and in most cases no other treatment is needed than some purgative . MANGE Mange is a disease of the skin due to a class of insects that burrow in the skin , producing a terrible itch and scab , the hair falling off in patches , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been washed in soap-water quite warm , dry and rub in the following : 4 ounces oil of tar , 6 ounces sulphur , one pint linseed oil . LICE Make a strong tea of tobacco and wash the horse with it . WORMS There are many kinds of worms . Three kinds of tape worms and seven kinds of other worms have been found in the horse . The tape worms are very seldom found in a horse and the other kinds are easily treated by the following : One dram of calomel , i dram of tartar emetic , i dram of sulphate of iron , 3 drams of linseed meal . Mix and give in one dose for a few days ; then give a purgative . Repeat in three weeks to get rid of the young worms left in the bowels in the form of eggs , but which have since hatched out . // DISTEMPER Distemper is a disease of the blood . The symptoms are : Swelling under the jaws ; inability to swallow ; a mucous discharge from the nose . Give the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot linseed poultice to the swellings under the jaws and give small doses of cleansing powder for a few days . HYDROPHOBIA As soon as a case is satisfactorily recognized , kill the horse , as there is no remedy yet discovered that will cure this terrible disease . SPAVIN There are four kinds of spavin and it is difficult for any one but a veterinarian to tell one kind from another . In all cases of spavin ( except blood spavin ) the horse will start lame , but after he gets warmed up the lameness disappears and he goes all right until stopped and cooled off , when he starts worse than before . There are many so-called spavin cures on the market , some of them good , others worse than nothing . If you do n't want to call a veterinarian , I would advise you to use " Kendall 's Spavin Cure . " This cure is one of the best ever gotten up for this disease , and no bad results will follow the use of it if it does not cure . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lameness in the hind leg the seat of the disease will be found to be in the hockjoint , although many persons ( not having had experience ) locate the difficulty in the hip , simply because they can not detect any swelling of the hock-joint ; but in many of the worst cases there is not seen any swelling or enlargement for a long time , and perhaps never . BONE SPAVIN Bone spavin is a growth of irregular bony matter from the bones of the joint , and situated on the inside and in front of the joint . Cause , ? The causes of spavins are quite numerous , // but usually they are sprains , blows , hard work , and , in fact , any cause exciting inflammation of this part of the joint . Hereditary predisposition in horses is a frequent cause . Symptoms. ? The symptoms vary in different cases . In some horses the lameness comes on very gradually , while in others it comes on more rapidly . It is usually five to eight weeks before any enlargement appears . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he usually gets over it after driving a short distance , and , if allowed to stand for awhile , will start lame again . There is sometimes a reflected action , causing a little difference in the appearance over the hip joint , and if no enlargement has made its appearance , a person not having had experience is very liable to be deceived in regard to the true location of the difficulty . The horse will stand on either leg in resting in the stable , but when he is resting the lame leg he stands on the toe . If the joint becomes consolidated the horse will be stiff in the leg , but may not have much pain . Treatment. ? That it may not be misunderstood in regard to what is meant by a cure , would say that to stop the lameness , and in most cases to remove the bunch on such cases as are not past any reasonable hopes of a cure . But I do not mean to be understood that in a case of anchylosis ( stiff joint ) , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this is an impossibility , owing to the union of the two bones , making them as one . Neither do I mean that , in any ordinary case of // bone spavin which has become completely ossified ( that is , the bunch become solid bone ) , that , in such a case , the enlargement will be removed . In any bony growths , like spavin or ringbone , it will be exceedingly difficult to determine just when there is a sufficient deposit of phosphate of lime so that it is completely ossified , for the reason that in some cases the lime is deposited faster than in others , and therefore one case may be completely ossified in a few months , while in another it will be as many years . The cases which  --  are not completely ossified are those that I claim to remove . One of this class which I have seen removed was a large bone spavin of four or five years standing , and I think that a large per cent of cases are not fully ossified for several months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsemen say that it is impossible to cure spavins , and , in fact , this has // been the experience of horsemen until the discovery of Kendall 's Spavin Cure . It is now known that the treatment which we recommend here will cure nearly every case of bone spavin which is not past any reasonable hopes of a cure , if the directions are followed , and the horse is properly used . OCCULT SPAVIN This is similar to bone spavin in its nature , the difference being that the location is within the joint , so that no enlargement is seen , which makes it more difficult to come to a definite conclusion as to its location , and consequently the horse is oftentimes blistered and tormented in nearly all parts of the leg but in the right place . The causes and effects are the same as in bone spavin , and it should be treated in the same way . These cases are often mistaken for hip disease , because no enlargement can be seen . BOG SPAVIN The location of this kind of a spavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone spavin , and it is a soft and yet firm swelling . It does not generally cause lameness . BLOOD SPAVIN This is similar to bog spavin but more extended , and generally involves the front , inside and outside of the joint , giving it a rounded appearance . The swelling // is soft and fluctuating . Young horses and colts , especially if driven or worked hard , are more liable to have this form of spavin than older horses . This is a small , bony enlargement , and generally situated on the inside of the foreleg about three or four inches below the knee joint , and occurs frequently in young horses when they are worked too hard . SPRAIN By this is meant the sudden shifting of a joint farther than is natural , but not so as to produce dislocation. // Every joint is liable to sprain by the horse 's falling , slipping , or being overworked . These cases cause a great deal of trouble , oftentimes producing lameness , pain , swelling , tenderness , and an unusual amount of heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the horse , and if the part is found hot , as is usually the case , apply cold water cloths , changing frequently , for from one to three days until the heat has subsided , when apply Kendall 's Spavin Cure , twice or three times a day , rubbing well with the hand . If the fever is considerable , it might be well to give fifteen drops of tincture of aconite root , three times a day , for one or two days , while the cold water cloths are being applied . Allow the horse a rest of a few weeks , especially in bad cases , as it is very difficult to cure some of these cases , unless the horse is allowed to rest . STAGGERS A disease of horses , resulting from some lesion of the brain , which causes a loss of control of voluntary motion . As it generally occurs in fat horses which are well fed , those subject to these attacks should not be overfed . The cause is an undue amount of blood flowing to the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove the cause . In ordinary cases give half a pound of epsom salts , and repeat if necessary to have it physic , and be careful about overfeeding. // In mad staggers , it would be well to bleed from the neck in addition to giving the epsom salts . CERTAIN CURE FOR HOG CHOLERA Take the following ingredients well mixed together , and give one tablespoonful daily in food during sick-ness , and as a preventative two or three times a week : // HOW CORN IN THE CRIB AND HAY IN THE MOW SHOULD BE MEASURED As near as ' can be figured out , two cubic feet of corn in the ear will make one bushel shelled . To find the quantity of corn in the crib , measure length , breadth and height , multiply the breadth by the length and this product by the height ; then divide this product by two , and you have the right number of bushels of corn . It is estimated that 510 cubic feet of hay in a mow will make one ton . Multiply the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide this product by 510 , and the quotient shows the tons of hay in the mow . GRAIN SHRINKAGE Not often do the farmers gain any by keeping the grain , for it will shrink more than the price will make good . Wheat will shrink 7 per cent in seven months from the time is is thrashed . Therefore , 93 cents a bushel for wheat in September is better than $1 in // April the following year . Add to this the interest for the money you could have used in paying debts , or loaned , and it will add 4 per cent more , making it 11 per cent . Corn will shrink more than wheat , and potatoes are very risky to keep on account of the diseases they are subjected to ; the loss is estimated at 3o per cent for six months . VALUE OF A TON OF GOLD OR SILVER A ton of gold is worth in money $602,799.21 ; a ton of silver , $37,704.84. // RINGWORM Ringworm is a contagious disease and attacks all kinds of animals , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a round bald spot , the scurf coming off in scales . Cure : Wash with soap-water and dry , then apply the following once a day . Mix 25 grains of corrosive sublimate in half a pint of water and wash once a day till cured . BALKING Balking is the result of abuse . If a horse is over-loaded and then whipped unmercifully to make the victim perform impossibilities , he will resent the abuse by balking . There are many cruel methods for curing balking horses , but kindness is the best . Do n't hitch him to a load he can not easily pull . Let the man that is used to handling him drive him . Try to divert his mind from // above . Give in one dose , prepared in the form of a ball . HINTS TO BLACKSMITHS AND HORSE-SHOERS Do n't burn the shoe on . Do n't rasp under the clinchers . Do n't rasp on the outer side of the wall more than is absolutely necessary . Do n't rasp or file the clinch heads . Do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't pare the frog . Do n't cut down the bars . Do n't load the horse down with iron . Do n't lose your temper . Do n't hit the horse with the hammer . Do n't run down your competitor . Do n't continually tell how smart you are . Do n't smoke while shoeing . Do n't imbibe in the shop . Do n't run outdoors while sweaty . Do n't know it all . Always be punctual in attendance to your business . Allow your customers to know something . No man is such a great fool but that something can be learned of him . Be always polite . Keep posted on everything belonging to your trade . Read much . Drink little . Take a bath once a week . Dress well . This done , the craft will be elevated , and the man respected . // himself . Talk to him ; pat him ; give him a handful of oats or salt . But if there is no time to wait pass a chain or rope around his neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all there is needed , in most cases , is to pass the rope around and the horse will start . It is no use trying to whip a balking horse , because balking horses are generally horses of more than common spirit and determination , and they will resent abuse every time . Kindness , patience and perseverance are the best remedies . RATTLE-SNAKE BITE When a horse has been bitten by a rattlesnake , copperhead , or other venomous serpent , give the fol-lowing : One-half teaspoonful of hartshorn , r pint whisky , % pint of warm water . Mix well and give one dose . Repeat in one hour if not relieved . Burn the wound at once with a hot iron , and keep a sponge soaked in ammonia over the wound for a couple of hours . HOOF OINTMENT Rosin , 4 ounces ; bees wax , 4 ounces ; pine tar , 4 ounces ; fish oil , 4 ounces ; mutton tallow , 4 ounces . Mix and apply once a day .
