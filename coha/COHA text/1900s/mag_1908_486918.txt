The annual meeting of the Civil-Service Reform League at Pittsburgh last week was naturally an occasion of rejoicing over victories won Joseph H Choate , as president , reviewed the history of the movement , and showed the astonishing advance in forty years Practically all Federal offices were once plunder for the spoilsmen , but now nearly two-thirds are protected . Going back seven years , to the beginning of Mr Roosevelt 's Presidency , we find that in 1901 the classified service covered 108,967 persons , whereas now it embraces 220,000 It must not be forgotten , however , that some 117,000 new offices have been created When President Roosevelt entered the White House there were 127,000 officials not sheltered by the civil-service rules , to-day there are 132,000 We mention these facts only to show that , in spite of all that Mr Roosevelt has done , the struggle must be kept up incessantly In the report of the council of the League , prom:nence is given to the pending bill for taking the Census of 1910 This came up in the last session of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees should be appointed on the spoils basis At the time , this attack on the merit system was headed off , and the bill went over , but this session it has already passed the House in the old objectionable form , and the Senate Committee has agreed to report it , all dripping with spoils as it is Under these circumstances , there should be prompt action , and the stiffest kind of fight To throw the Census employees to the political wolves would not only give civil-service reform a severe check , but would cause this important work to be done wastefully and loosely The facts are beyond dispute That the average quality of the clerks engaged in the last two censuses was quite below that of persons appointed after competitive examination , was certified to by the President in his message of last January On this point the testimony of Carroll D Wright , in charge of the Eleventh Census , is perfectly conclusive . After saying that the bringing of the employees into the classified service seems to him an absolute necessity , he declares : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would have been , in my opinion , a saving of at least $2,000,000 and more than a year 's time This makes the thing look a public crime It is clearly a case for adducing that quotation from the Koran which John Stuart Mill cited in " On Liberty " A ruler who appoints any man to an office when there is in his dominions another man better qualified for it , sins against God and against the State We are aware of the defence which is made by the spoilsmen , in this particular instance They allege that the appo ntment of the 4,000 Census clerks is only " temporary , " and that the Civil Service Commission could not find or fi , rnish sufficient candidates But this the Commission itself flatly denies . It has already large numbers on its eligible lists , and stands ready to hold special examinations Another assertion of those who prefer spoils to honest and business-like methods is that , under the civil service law , which provides for a geographical distribution of appointments , efficient clerks could not be had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waive this apportionment by States All that is asked is a perfectly free and competitive examination , so that the most competent men may be chosen Ah , reply the spoilsmen , but we also propose an examination It is to be open to all " without regard to politics or personal or political endorsement " Only , it is to be a non-competitive examination . The proper comment on all th s insincerity is made by Frederick H Wines , who was Assistant Director of the Twelfth Census As a matter of fact , no persons except those recommended by Congressmen were allowed to take these perfectly " open " examinations , and , says Mr Wines There were numerous instances in which an unsuccessful applicant was granted a second , third , or fourth trial , at the request of some Senator or Representative , and to the best of my knowledge and belief it occasionally happened that the rating made by the examiner upon the papers filed was arbitrarily changed after they left his custody A rating of 75 , with proper political or other endorsement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nthlrio wIthnlit it So much for non-competitive examinations As President Roosevelt says , they are only " a cloak to hide the nakedness of the spoils system " ? and a very tattered and transparent cloak at that The subject will come up in the Senate after the holidays The spoilsmen have not a sound leg to stand upon The President is strongly against them , the Director of the Census is against them ; the best men in Congress are against them It remains for public opinion and business sense to make themselves so felt that the impairing of the whole value of the Thirteenth Census may not be permitted , merely in order that Congressmen may divide 4,000 offices . ENGLAND 'S POLITICAL LEDGER . With the prorogation of Parliament until the middle of February , a good deal of political stock-taking is going on in England The work of the session is passed in review , the drift of bye-elections pointed out , the prospects of the parties canvassed , and the possibility of a dissolution and general election next year eagerly debated . The most ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has passed through an exceedingly bad year Some successes it has had , with many failures , but the failures have been so large and sensational as to make people forget the successes Certain legislative measures have been enacted , as promised Chief among them is the old-age pension bill , which the Conservatives dared not oppose , though its principle is dangei ous , its effectiveness doubtful , and its expense enormous Another Liberal achievement is the Irish Universities bill , while the new legal protection thrown about children , and the shortening of the hours of la-bor in mines , may be adduced as a fur-ther redemption of Liberal pledges to pass laws for social betterment This would make up a fairly good record , were not the debit side of the ledger so long and lugubrious Several capital pieces of legislation have been entirely lost The Lords , it is true , were responsible for the defeat of the great Liberal temperance measure , the Licensing Bill But this should have been foreseen . The time of the House of Commons , and the strength of the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Lords were certain to throw out , unless the government had some firm and matured plan of dealing with the Lords thereafter There was , however , no such plan The Premier and members of the Cabinet had many brave words about " an irresponsible body , " but the brave words have been empty . The direct method of meeting the issue would have been to dissolve and go to the country , but with the bye-elections running so ominously against them , the Liberals had no stomach for such a fight So they are left , in this matter , chargeable with lack both of foresight and courage Vacillation has also marked their course in two other important matters They brought forward a new Education B 11 , pressed it for a few days , and then withdrew it They introduced a semi-protectionist measure relating to the English hop-industry , and shortly were forced to withdraw that also . All this gives an impression that there is want of leadership , or that the Cabinet or the party does not know its own mind . The net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a time of hesitation and despondency can not be worth much , but the shrewder opinion is that the government will neither resign nor seek the verdict of the country , at an early day . Mr Asquith declared at the National Liberal Club that the government would not dissolve " at the time prescribed at its own caprice by an irresponsible assembly " Rather , the effort will be to rally the party and rouse public opinion behind a bill which will be in itself popular , and which will force the issue against the House of Lords It is already intimated that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is drafting such a bill , or bills , in connection with the next budget They will lay new burdens upon the land , and will impose fresh and heavy taxes upon the liquor trade . Then the Lords , as the great defenders of both landlords and liquor-sellers , will be asked what they are going to do about it Tax bills they can not amend They will have to take them or leave them as the House of Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would raise the issue of the power of the purse in a way that the Conservatives would find it awkward to meet Should they , on the contrary , take the new taxes lying down , as they did the old-age pensions bill , it would stance , how in Turkey , with its motley of nationalities and faiths , the Masonic lodge would offer a national meeting-place for the friends of political progress That common cause would bring them together , and the lodges ' monotheistic creed is respectful alike of Christian , Moslem , and Jew By as much as Freemasonry may hold truer to the principle of human brotherhood than the established churches , by so much more will it go on making itself felt in the struggle of backward countries towards emancipation THE HISTORIAN AND THE DOCU-MENT A scholar like Signor Ferrero , whose views on so remote a subject as the foundation of the early Roman Empire are quoted by the column in the newspapers , has a serious handicap to overcome Thoughtful people will be suspicious of him . Can an historian who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-thumbed sources , and given to marshal his facts in accordance with a preestablished philosophy of history , be as trustworthy as he is fascinating ? To start with , brilliancy itself is disquieting It is all very well to recall that there have been scientists and scholars who have combined charm with authority , men like Huxley and Haeckel , like Gibbon and Mommsen But at bottom we are still slaves of the ideal of painful dulness which , rightly or wrongly , we associate with the spirit of modern German research We sneer at Dryasdust but are afraid of him The brilliant historian or critic is regarded as fair game for the PhD who has just finished counting his syllables One is so readable , the other is so quite the other thing  --  the readable scholar must be erratic , like most of the brilliant people we know When an historian is not only brilliant like Signor Ferrero , but , like him , assumes to write history in the light of a theory of his own , he has committed the sin of sins , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the basis of all historical truth To gather as many " sources " as one can lay hold of and to quote them without changing the spelling , that is the art of historiography in its highest manifestation as pictured to budding young scholars The old historians aril tern tPri the nn re ci-ran rn rsf with personal judgments , original interpretations , political conclusions based on such a non-political source as a great poem , a famous picture or statue , or even a popular legend Germanic rigor has done away with all that Make use of tradition ? Of course not Make use of second-hand accounts , of collateral sources , of comparative conditions somewhere else , of gossiping memoirs , of ill-informed correspondence ? No . The Document reduced to its most insoluble form , that alone will do Truth lies in the treaty of peace as it was written down on paper , in the judge 's decision as it was filed on the court 's records , in the Senate document number so and so , or in the official report of the International Reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intrusion of the personal element now or at the time of the fact ; we are after the truth alone , however uninteresting But how if the official document often turns out as untruthful as it is uninteresting ? The formalities of diplomacy have always been such as to make the written agreement only partly expressive of the living motives and acts that have produced it Two hundred years from now , an historian dealing with the economic condition of Spain in 1898 may point out how badly pressed for money the Spanish government must have been when it sold the Philippine Islands to the United States for $20,000,000 . In the course of a few months we may have documentary evidente laid up for the future , showing how Turkey foolishly gave up her soy-ereign rights over Bulgaria for so many million francs , and sold Bosnia-Herzegovina to Austria for an equal amount The future biographer of Senator Jones may prove that Jones could not have been caught in a poolroom raid on February 6 , 1909 , because on that day he was delivering a four-hour speech on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , the Senator 's speech got into the Congressional Record under " leave to print , " and Jones was really betting on the horses on that February day A candidate for a political nomination is successful by 49 votes to 48 , whereupon his nomination is made unanimous From that unanimous vote history may draw wrong conclusions as to his popularity The offi of the International Reform Association commemorates a President-elect of the United States as its principal speaker . But , as a matter of fact , the President-elect was at home that night with a bad cold The files of the New York Star for 1912 disprove the common belief that Mme Cavalcanti had been secretly married on March 11 to Signor Perugino , by reporting her glorious impersonation of " Aida " on that night . Actually , the Star 's musical critic played bridge that night , and wrote up his account from the official advance notices , so he did n't know that Mme Delmonte had been substituted for Mme. Cavalcanti . It is easy enough to overstate the case . Document can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source , and error tracked down But that is just the process which calls for brilliancy  --  intuition , imagination , the dramatic instinct  --  in the historian To suspect your document , to feel that it ought to say something else than it does , to cast it aside sometimes on the principle that men in ancient Rome were a good deal like what they are now , and consequently used official phrases that stood for very little  --  these e the qualities which Dryasdust seldom reveals He will write you the life of the late Emperor Kwang-Su on the basis of the official biography in 300 volumes , now being prepared by Chinese historians . But if Dryasdust should overlook the fact that Chinese chroniclers make an Emperor 's life what it should have been and not what it was , what a mess Dryasdust would make of Danger there is , undoubtedly , in the other method If you believe the newspapers , Signor Ferrero is doing more to destroy the ancient world than Goths , Vandals , and fanatic monks from the Thebaid ever did Quintus Horatius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fortune , and death : was not really fond of Mcenas , did not really thrill at the sight of snowcapped Soracte ; he only wrote advertisements for the Falernian and Cxcuban Wine Growers ' Association . Mark Antony did not marry Cleopatra because she was a lady of serpent-like wiles and infinite variety , but because he needed her money to conquer the Persians . Shall we find next that Medea did not sentment at Jason , but because they interfered with her club meetings ? Was Leander really training for the annual swimming Marathon of the Hellespont Athletic Club ? Did the elder Brutus sentence his son to death in order to collect the life insurance ' ? We suspect , however , that in all this there is more of the gifted young newspaper reporter than of Ferrero AFTER THE HIGHER CRITICISM -- WHAT ? A few days ago a professor in the University of Chicago was reported as saying that Christianity is not of divine or miraculous origin ? It is not a religion from a god , but an achievement of man , who created his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have them to help him in his defencelessness and ignorance , to aid him in conquering his foes , and to dispel the darkness of his future and the fear of death More and more people are giving up the idea that their religion is something handed down to them from a divine source . . . Consequently , religion is on a more rational basis , as people are cultivating it just as they cultivate music , language , science , and morality To verify this quotation is hardly necessary , for if this particular man did not say this particular thing , the words fairly represent the attitude of many of our higher critics Their comments recall the satire of Kipling 's " story of Evarra  --  man ? Maker of Gods in lands beyond the sea " It is all very well to protest , as the higher critics do , that the Bible still remains one of the noblest monuments of literature In the past people have not cared whether this book was literature or not ; the vital point was that it was the inerrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it be robbed of this authority , what , we may ask , is science offering as a substitute ' ? What is to come after higher criticism has done its work ? We put the question in no spirit of hostility Far from it . We would have the truth at any cost We are not among those who would cling to a superstition because it happens to be comfortable or because it helps to keep order among the masses of the rude and ignorant We would not dwell in a fool 's paradise If the Church rests its claims on certain traditions and documents , we would have those traditions and documents submitted to the most searrhins , tests for nothinz can be gained in the long run by building either a house or a church on a foundation of sand If we have been deceived as to the origin of the Bible and the sacraments , if the Ten Commandments were not handed down from Sinai , let us face the disagreeable facts But let us also face the facts that if the moral law is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven are illusions , the average man will not look upon life and its duties quite as he did a few decades ago Clergymen sometimes attempt to conceal the change from themselves and their followers by sticking desperately to the old phrases  --  though in a new sense  --  and by sweeping generalizations about the unvarying validity of the essential sanctions of morality . But educated people perceive the hollowness of such formulas . Accepting the methods , if not in every case the detailed results , of scientific criticism , they turn to our professed spiritual guides for some reconstruction of creed that shall touch the emotions as did the old which is now destroyed ; or , as Wilfrid Ward has put it , for something that shall keep " a truly spiritual ideal of life untainted by the maxims of an unbelieving generation , " and shall help " the affections and the imagination against an importunately visible world " There are , we grant , men of stoic temper with whom such considerations weigh little They will pursue their way steadfast and unterrified though the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made of such stern stuff For the rank and file of humanity it is not exhilarating to reflect that the night is behind and before us , that our tiny globe is but one of a million spinning through the unfathomable gulfs of the universe ; that we ourselves are but microscopic specks crawling for a little while in the dim and fleeting light ; and that our consolation and our bulwark have been a few silly fables of our own feeble invention . In a recent book which treats the lives of two devout women , " Memorials of Two Sisters , Susanna and Catherine Winkworth , " is a striking passage which in reality applies not to one sex only , but to all mankind : Women feel the frets and the anxieties of life so keenly , that they need this refuge in the larger , serener life of heavenly love . Their life seems often at once so engrossing and so trivial that they need some points above it , from which they Yren , CCIP brivv , t n11 fnrrnn na.rt of the infinite web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be realized on earth , to give it any freshness and value This recourse to " the larger , serener life of heavenly love " is impossible for persons who are convinced that this " love , " in any comprehensible sense of the term , is a fiction , and that their gods and their religion are of purely human manufacture . A cold , relentless , impersonal power , even though it make for righteousness , is not the same thing as a father that pitieth his children .

For at present most of the churches seem to be drifting without chart , compass , or pilot We hear on every side the complaint that men of character and capacity will not enter the ministry , but there was never a time when character and capacity were more needed for this great business of readjusting ancient beliefs to modern knowledge No ecclesiastical organization can retain its vitality or can serve mankind unless it can lift them above their trials and fortify them against temptation ; for what shall it profit us to turn from the doubts and hesitancies of our daily toil to the profounder doubts and more disquieting hesitancies of a stumbling , groping church , uncertain whence it came and whither it goes ?

' With his release in 1894 begins his career as a novelist ; up to that time his only literary efforts , aside from two negligible volumes of impressions of Paris and Italy , had been journalistic The founder of a Republican paper in Valencia , El Pueblo ( The People ) , at first its editor , reporter , and reviewer , he has succeeded in making it one of the most influential sheets in Spain Through his publishing-house he has directed a library of several hundred volumes of translations of European literature , for the most part works on science and sociology , by such writers as Spencer , Tolstoy , Renan , and Nietzsche It is not surpris , ng that his political activity found recognition in his election as Republican Deputy from Valencia , and that he soon became the leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service he has retired from " militant politics , " to use his own phrase , and is now devoting himself wholly to literature His one purpose has been and is to arouse his people , to stir them from their ignorance The scene of Sr Ibanez 's early novels is laid in Valencia and the surrounding district Between 1894 and 1902 he produced six novels and two volumes of short stores , which present a panorama of the life and customs of the region , portrayed with rare insight and intense sympathy The main theme of all the work of this period is the conflict between the individual and a society deep-rooted in the cruel , selfish prejudices of the past The best work of this group , " La Barraca " ( The Farmhouse ) , : s a picture of the life in the huerta  --  the market-garden district outside of Valencia  --  and the persecution of an honest farmer and his family by his neighbors , who harbor the tradition that the land of which he has become the tenant shall never be cultivated Their persecution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batiste starts out once more into the world , ruined but undaunted In marked contrast to these studies of modern perversity stands " SOnnica la Cortesana , " a romance of the siege and fall of Saguntum , in which Hannibal appears as one of the characters From the misery of to-day we are transported into the sumptuous gardens of the Greek courtesan ; we live in an exuberant , sensuous atmosphere of youth and beauty ; the air is vibrant with a sturdy patriotism With his election to the Cortes , Sr. Ibanez left the novel of manners and in the next three years produced three works ? " La Catedral , " " El Intruso , " and " La Bodega " ( The Saloon ) ? which , had he belonged to the seventeenth century , would have a nnParPa ac norn , 11-0c. +o plots of the books serve merely as a framework in which to carry his propaganda . Through the long harangues of his anarchistic heroes , Gabriel Luna , Salvatierra , and the doctor , Don Luis , he attacks mercilessly the Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these specific objects of his animadversion , lurks the real enemy , it is the people who are to blame ; their ignorance and self-seeking are the sources of their subjection and suffering . This , indeed , is the fundamental teaching of all of his novels . A French critic has observed of Sr IlAilez 's work " Il est un personage que le romancier n'a ddcrit nulle part et qui , invisible , do-mine Pceuvre ? c'est La Fatalit6 . " To make such a criticism is to misinterpret his whole philosophy of life . It is man who is the cause of the evils in this world  --  man with his pettiness , his self-centred narrowness And it is just this conviction that human suffering is the result of human weakness , and not a divinely sent curse , that inspires the author to struggle forward toward the ideal of the future , to hope for a day when charity is unnecessary and men are brothers . Without doubt , he would prefer that this progress should be a gradual development through education , but he is convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make such a growth In " El Intruso , " he says : In this country we must take a violent leap must pass , without any bridge , from the beliefs of four centuries ago  --  still intact and powerful  --  to modern life . And yet his anarchy Is never of the bomb-throwing type , Gabriel Luna perishes in the attempt to save the treasures of the Cathedral of Toledo from robbery at the hands of the very men in whom he has inculcated his teachings We may judge from Sr Ibanez 's position as Republican deputy to the Cortes that his faith is built on a pacific regeneration , none the less radical for its freedom from the horrors of revolution . His later works have shown a return to his earlier style " La Horda " ( The Rabble ) is a picture of the sordid life of the refuse collectors in the suburbs of Madrid , a subject already treated by Pio Baroja in " La Busca " " La Maja Desnuda " ( from Goya 's well known picture ) , published in 1906 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is at once an acute psychological study of the conflict between the artistic temperament and human love and a critique of Spanish art in which Goya 's realism is extolled The last of his novels " Sangre y Arena " ( Blood and Sand ) is a scathing criticism of the bull-fight , " that survivor of the auto-dale . " Despite the vigor of its inspiration , it is distinctly inferior to his previous work .
