txt The Fowler Investigating Committee of the New York Life Insurance Company wound up its existence yesterday by submitting two : reports , one of which was a general defense of the way in which the affairs of the New York Life have been administered in the past , and the other a defense of certain of the transactions that George W. Perkins put the company into . The committee justifies purchase of the New Orleans traction syndicate underwriting from the New York Security and Trust Company when that institution merged with the Continental Trust Company , absolves Mr. Perkins from any financial responsibility for applying the profits of a loan of $930,000 in which New York Life money had been used to the Nylic fund , and offers a brand new explanation of the year-end sale of $800,000 interest In the Navigation Syndicate Underwriting by Mr. Perkins of the New York Life to Mr. Perkins of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , and of its repurchase on Jan. 2 following . The meeting at which these reports were received and approved by the New York Life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Perkins , James A. Blair of Blair &; Co. , Henry Walters , an ' Norman B. Ream . The latter three , it is understood , resigned because they had been advised by counsel that life insurance Trustees could not participate in syndicates from which their company bought securities . Mr. Perkins 's resignation has been pending for months . The New York Life Trustees received the nominations yesterday of James H. Eckels , President of the Commercial National Bank of Chicago ; A. A. Raven and George F. Seward , President of the Fidelity and Casualty Company of this city , and Ii . Lurton of Nashville , Tenn . Mr. Eckels was one of the financiers who spoke extensively in defense of H. H. Rogers and the Standard Oil Company when Thomas W. Lawson first opened up on the " system " two years ago , and Standard Oil interests are said to be large factors in the bank of which he is President . Mr. Raven Is a Director of many corporations , and Mr. Seward is well known in Wall Street through his management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K. 'd , The special report of the New York Life 's investigating committee , submitted yesterday , takes up first the New Orleans traction syndicate and recites how the New York Life on March 7 , 1e04 , acquired from the New York Security and Trust Company $1,500,000 4 per cent . bonds of the New Orleans railways and an Interest in the syndicate promoting the Property of $3,895,000 , on which $2,914,432 was paid in cash . The bonds were bought at 85 and the syndicate participation at $2.500.000 and interest . The report of the Fowler Committee submitted yesterdaysays of this : " This purchase was approved by the Finance Committee On its judgment that it was a proper and advantageous investment of the funds of the company . " The report that was current in Wall Street at the time was that the interests in the Continental Trust Company made it a condition of the merger that these securities should be taken up . The Fowler Committee finds that there is no liability on the part of anybody in the matter , and adds : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars to be made without some losses , despite the exercise of care and deliberate judgment , and the loss in question was in this category . It has been asserted that the purchase of those securities was made without justification and at a price more than they were worth for the benefit and relief of the New York Security and Trust Company , ? There is in the judgment of your committee nu basis of facts for this claim or assertion . " Perkins Cleared . The second transaction considered in the supplemental report is that In which Mr. Perkins in June , 1904 , received from Kidder , Peabody &; Co. of Boston , ' on behalf of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , an offer of a participation of $1,000,000 in a loan to the Mexican Central Railway , secured by bonds . He declined it for the banking firm , decided that it would be a good thing for Nylic , a New Yak Life agents ' organization , and so ordered the bonds sent to the New York Life and arranged with Treasurer Randolph that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should put up the money involved in the loan , some $930,000 . This was done , Kidder , Peabody &; Co. not knowing that they were dealing with any one but the New York Life , as was evidenced by an indignant denial when the transaction came to light last Fall that they had ever had any dealings with Nylie . When the check for $40,903.60 profits came in , Mr. Perkins got it indorsed to him and deposited its proceeds in his own bank account , although it was payable to the New York Life , and credited it to the Nylic fund , which he managed . This is what the Fowler probers say about it : Mr. Perkins had never assumed to put the company into the venture jointly with the Boston house . The committee fails to see any basis in equity for the claim that the company is entitled to the share of the interest in the joint venture which Mr. Perkins took for the Nylie fund , and it is advised by its counsel that there is none in law or equity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company on the part of Mr. Perkins or any other officer or Trustee to account for this sum . The account of the repurchase of the $900,000 Navigation Syndicate Underwriting which the Fowler investigators give is in some respects so novel that it is printed here in full . The committee says : Navigation Syndicate Deal . In 1902 the New York Life applied for a participation of $5,000,000 in the International Mercantile Marine Company Syndicate ( known as the Navigation Syndicate ) and was allotted $4,000,000 . Of this amount $3,200,000 was called in that year . In the year 1903 $800,000 more was called and paid . Though there was no formal action by the Finance Committee respecting any disposition of this $800,000 interest . it was the understanding of the committee that if it could be disposed of to advantage It should be sold . The market value of syndicate subscriptions , unlike that of stocks and bonds generally , is as a rule to be sought and found through the syndicate managers , and in this case , therefore , through S. P. Morgan . Co @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ' Chairman of the Finance Committee , informed Mr. Randolph , Treasurer of the company , that for 3 . P. Morgan &; Co. , of which firm Mr. Perkins was a member , he would purchase the 5800,000 interest at par . It was accordingly transferred on that day by the New York Life Insurance Company to J. P. Morgan &; Co. , and a check of J. P. Morgan &; Co. for $800,000 was received on the same day by the New york Life Insurance Company and deposited to its credit in bank . Mr. Perkins later ascertained that it was not the custom for J. P. Morgan de Co. to purchase participation interest in the underwritings of any syndicate of which that firm was manager , and that to buy the underwritings of the New York Life Insurance Company would involve either a discrimination as to that company or a moral obligation to repurchase the subscription of every other subscriber who might wish to sell to the firm . After consideration , on Jan. 2 , 190i , Mr. Perkins reported to the company that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the tam that he represented both parties to the sale , the transaction would have to be annulled . The transaction was therefore on that ground annulled , and on that day the certificate was returned to the oompany and the company repaid to J. P. Morgan &; Co. the $900,000 and $3266.67 interest for two days . At the end of the year 1904 the 5800.000 participation was sold through J. P. Morgan &; Co. , and the Now York Life Insurance Company receid therefor the sum of $720,000 , being 90 per cent . Your committee Id advised by counsel and reports that there is no liability on the part of Mr. Perkins or any officer or Trustee la tonneetion with these transactions . Everybody Indorsed . The report deals with the Finance Committee , which at present consists of John Claflin , E. D. Randolph , Woodbury Langdon . George . A- Morrison , President Orr , and Darwin P. Kingsley , in much the same way as with Mr. Perkins , winding up with a general indorsement of them and their work . It then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familiar theory which was propounded by various companies during the Armstrong Committee 's investigation that if the cost of new business does more than consume the funds which the business produces the excess is made ua later on from the renewal premiums . It states as its concluelon that the new business has been acquired " economically and In accordance with sound and legitimate methods . " The committee continues : Though the officers of the company have been alert and energetic in increasing its business from year to year , there is no evidence that they have obtained it at an unduly excessive expel or procured the writing of insurance that there was reason to believe would lapse at an early day , or disregarded in any degree the rights and interests of any class of its policy holders . Whether the limitations of the new legislation will result in greater benefits to ' the policy .. holders ' time alone will tell . If they do . the good faith of the methods which they - supersede is not thereby impugned . After recommending that the foreign business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other criticisms that have been passed on the company by saying that they do not need extended consideration because all defects at any time revealed have been remedied . The report is signed by the full membership of the committee , Thomas P. Fowler , Chairman ; Norman B. Ream , Hiram R. Steele , A. G. Paine , and Clarence H. Mackay . PRESIDENT PEABODY ANGRY . Calls Accountants Careless or Ignorant ? A Crisis Near . Further evidence cf the open break between President Peabody of the Mutual Life and some of the influential Trustees in the board of that ccfmpany came yesterday when Mr. Peabody , in a statement prepared for publication , savagely attacked the report which the rest of the Truesdale Committee submitted to the board last Wednesday and denounced the work of the committee 's accouhtants for " carelessness and ignorance . " It was these same accountants , Haskins &; Sells and Price , Waterhouse &; Co. , who made up the financial statement to which the Mutual pointed in its advertisement " The Truth About the Mutual Life " as an evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Peabody 's particular grievance against the Truesdale Committee and its accountants yesterday concerned the reference in the committee 's report to a " temporary " real estate loan of 8300,000 appearing on the books of the real estate loan department on Dec. 31 , 1905 , which the Mutual 's law department was said to know nothing about it as to title , &c.; This was what Mr. Peabody said about it : " The statement made in the report of the Truesdale Committee relating to a ' 300,000 loan , namely , that the law department has no knowledge , and that rto information of title has been exhibited , is based on erroneous facts . The bond and mortgage representing this loan are on file In the bond and mortgage department . The usual proceedings as to title have been taken . The title has been guaranteed by the Title Guarantee and Trust Company , the mortgage Is guaranteed by the Bond and Mortgage Company , and the loan is as safe and sound as any loan on the company 's books . The statement in the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance of the accountants . " Mr. Truesdale was out of town yesterday , and his associate , Mr. Auchincloss , was invisible as usual . It was said at the Mutual Building that this particular loan was on the Hotel Earlington , situated in Twenty-seventh Street , between Fifth and Sixth Avenues , which was appraised by Michael Coleman , long the Mutual 's appraiser of property for real estate loans , at $525,000 . The two other loans , aggregating $110,000 , which were included in the reference of the Truesdale Committee to " discrepancies " between the books of the company - Ind those of he bond and mortgage department , have been , it is said , paid off . It is expected that there will be plenty of action soon in the present controversy . President Peabody , it is understood , is somewhat wearied of the role which ho has been obliged to play since he took office in the Mutual , and is disposed to bring matters to a crisis , so that the next few days may see soree very interesting developments in Mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
