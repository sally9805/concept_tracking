txt There were rumors yesterday that one snore change might be made in the jury which is to decide the fate of Harry K. Thaw for the killing of Stanford White . So far as the defense is concerned , there Is a great desire to begin the trial proper to-morrow , and no further changes in the jury will be assented to by Thaw 's lawyers except for very good reasons . It was reported , however , that one of the jurors sworn in last week had been connected with one phase of horse racing , and that if on investigation this turned . out to be true , it is possible the District Attorney will try to dispense with his services , and that the court will admit the justice of the application . As all the talesmen on the last two panels who have not yet been examined rare under subpoena to appear to-morrow morning , and as , until the first witness 1$ Sworn in , there is no legal obstacle to further changes , no one will be certain of the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun . The witnesses to be called by the people in the first instance will merely establish the facts of the killing of Stanford White . IAll questions of motive in a case in which the fatal shot is fired in the presence of hundreds need not be met until the defense raises the point , and Mr. Garvan , in his opening address , will not touch tupon them . Those likely to be examined to-morrow are Patrolman Martin J. Moore , who took Thaw from Madison Square Garden to the Tenderloin Police Station ; Dr. Timothy Lehane , the Coroners ' physician who examined Stanford White 's body ; Edward H. Convey , foreman of the roof garden ) of Madison Square Garden ; Paul Brude , 1 fireman in the Garden , who took the revolver from Thaw , and Patrolman Anthony Debes , who actually arrested the defendant Others who may also be called by the people early in the trial are Harry Stevens , the caterer , who had been talking to White shortly before the shooting ; Lionel L. Lawrence , manager of the ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song writer , and Halsey Warren of Little Falls , N. Y. , who was close / to White when he fell . It has been suggested that May will also be examined by the prosecution to-morrow , but as her evidence would deal with the relations of the Thaws and Stanford White , the only object Mr. Jerome could have in calling her while he is laying the foundations of his case would be to prevent her becoming a witness for the defense . Otherwise she would be one of those held in reserve to answer the theory advanced by the defense . Mr. Peabody of counsel ror Thaw admitted yesterday that there was a possibility of the defendant taking the stand , but denied emphatically that this had been decided . " Thaw has made no statements what . ever upon this point , " he said . " It might develop during the trial that he could do good by taking the stand , but we shall not come to a conclusion on . this point until the need arises . " It was declared yesterday that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make the opening address to the jury . Delphin M. Delmas , the California attorney , will be the trial lawyer , and will arrange the calling of witnesses and other details . Mr. Peabody admitted that with the trial only a couple of days off it was still an open question whether the task of outlining the defense should be intrusted to John B. Gleason or another . A large number of witnesses , has been called by the defense for the purpose , it is said , of supporting the theory of temporary insanity . Thaw 's lawyers are absolutely certain that some of their points will be Incontrovertible. - On some matters . " said Mr. , " the District Attorney can not produce any witnesses in rebuttal because there are not any . When all those present at certain incidents give one version of the facts , it is impossible to find anybody to contradict them . " It was understood that he was referring I to the early career of the defendant , to : which Mrs. William Thaw and witnesses from Pittsburg will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that from his / earliest years Thaw had a strange streak in his character to build up a picture of the man which will explain and perhaps excuse the killing on June 25 . At the I same time counsel for the defense have to be very careful not to prove too much . They must show that on one particular night their client was insane , but if they go too far Matteawan Asylum will loom up uncomfortably near . The jurors passed a quiet day yesterday . They are in excellent health and bear their confinement patiently . In the afternoon the jurors took a stroll up Fifth Avenue to Twenty-third Street . They were accompanied by their seven guards , but their little procession attracted no attention . The street was crowded , and no one realized that the jurors were all in one party , In the evening the jurors kept to their rooms , amusing themselves as best they could . They have a piano , and some of them are fair musicians . On the whole , they Lake the seclusion from the cares of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may go for a drive if the weather is fine . Capt .
