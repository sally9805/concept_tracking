SHAKESPEARE and Euripides have little enough in common , but in one respect they are provokingly alike . Each has left us a drama full of fascination and full of power , but presenting so many anomalies both as a work of art and as a representation of life that even the most impressionable and sympathetic of readers must find bewilderment largely interfering with enjoyment . Nothing can exceed the beauty and impressiveness of those portions of the Alcestis in which the heroine is presented to us , whether we consider the typical conception . of the character or its relation to the purpose and motive of the work . The very incarnation of all that exalts and glorifies womanhood from the moment she is introduced to us to the moment she passes finally from our sight , she has an inexpressible charm , appealing equally to our affections and to our moral sense . Pathos assuredly never went further than in the scenes in which she takes leave of all she loves on earth , or in the speeches which she addresses to her husband . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste it has a few false notes , is most - impressive and affecting . The choruses , regarded as compositions , have very great beauty . But side by side with all this Euripides has throughout not only introduced scenes and incidents which appear to have been designed for the express purpose of burlesquing his own work , but he has made the husband of his heroine so ludicrously despicable that disgust and contempt , mingled with laughter , for the craven object of the sacrifice so sublimely made , blend themselves with the serious passions excited by the spectacle of wifely heroism . Thus in this extraordinary play we have farce and tragedy , not introduced , as in our own Romantic Drama , realistically to reflect life or through contrast to set each other off , but mingled in utter and shocking incongruity . The apologists of Euripides have endeavored to explain this in various ways . Perhaps the least satisfactory theory is , that as there appears to have been no Satyric Drama in the trilogy with which the Alcestis was associated , it was designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Euripides had no choice ; buffoonery and farce were required from him , and these he had to supply . If he pleased himself by delineating Alcestis , he had to please his audience by degrading Admetus and Hercules . But it may be doubted whether even so daring an innovator as Euripides would deliberately venture on such a monstrous violation of aesthetic and moral propriety as to attempt to amalgamate Satyric Drama and Tragedy . We have a similar anomaly in Henry VIII . In many respects it is one of the most attractive , in some of its incidents one of the most powerful , of Shakespeare 's minor masterpieces . Katharine stands , with Imogen and Hermione , in. the very first rank of his female creations , and perhaps no scenes in any of his dramas come so directly home to our hearts as those which unfold her character and her wrongs . Second to none in his studios of human nature stands his delineation of Wolsey 's character . It required a master hand to depict and blend what had here to be exhibited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about to trample the only enemy whom he feared under his feet , Wolsey stands before - us , insolent and infatuated , the odious incarnation of all that is most detestable in the class to which he belongs and in the characteristics peculiar to it . An upstart and an adventurer , he had bought his way to where he stood , and an upstart and adventurer in everything but in position he remained . Without patriotism and without principle , all he does and all be designs centres on himself . He lives and acts for nothing but his own glorification . Innately vulgar , he squanders his ill-gotten wealth on pomp and show , and delights to insult the aristocracy whom he has spitefully impoverished by flaunting his profusion in their faces . He knows neither pity nor justice ; his laws are his lusts and his interests . A sycophant and a bully , he is as false to those to whom lie cringes as he is brutal and arrogant to those who refuse to cringe to him . At last comes retribution : the bolt falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Wolsey immediately after his fall is so sudden and so great that many have questioned whether it be true to nature . To nature it is surely profoundly true . Not gradually , but without warning and in a moment had life been reversed for him . All on which he had relied and on which he had built his hopes had collapsed . The scales- had fallen from his eyes . He saw now with what bubbles he had been sporting , for what baubles he had sold his soul . He was alone with the truths with which he had long been theoretically familiar and had practically ignored . They were all that were left to him . All this passes into the majestic pathos of the great soliloquy and into the speech addressed to Cromwell . There is a certain analogy between Wolsey and Henry IV. , as both are presented to us with equal impressiveness in their arrogant prime and in their world-weary decay , and in both cases the pathos is heightened by the contrast . Buckingham , necessarily a much slighter sketch , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecurity of life , fortune , and reputation when such men as Wolsey have the ear of kings is finely depicted in the way in which Buckingham instantly realizes the hopelessness of his position when his arch-enemy 's intrigues have secured his arrest . A net , he knows , has him in inextricable toils , it is useless to reluct , submission to Heaven 's will is all that remains . . In the account of his trial and in his last speech to the people , which is one of the moat moving ever written by Shakespeare , we have not only a companion picture to the subsequent fall of-his now exulting destroyer and an analogy to the speeches in which his destroyer 's remorse and humiliation were to find equally pathetic utterance , but an ironical anticipation of them . Each position heightens the pathos of the other , and each affects us differently . Buckingham has our pity and sympathy because of the resignation with which he meets so meekly an undeserved fate , and because lie dies blessing his enemies and forgiving those who have destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if any , very little pity . What affects us in his fate is what the Greeks called odkal'Oponria as distinguished from i'XEov . We are profoundly moved by the sudden and utter wreck of so much to which we pay , and always as men must pay , instinctive homage , and we are moved also by the sure and pitiless completeness with which the moral law has vindicated itself . In depicting the character of Henry it is quite clear that the poet was under some constraint . Imperious and autocratic , choleric and bluff , impulsive and generous , but coarsely sensual and profoundly selfish , he is in the main the King Hal of Holinshed and popular tradition . But while all that is derogatorily objectionable in these traits is softened , the darker traits of the Henry of history , his brutal cruelty , his jealousy , vindictiveness , and malice , are , if not actually concealed , kept studiously in the background . Altogether the character gives the impression that Shakespeare wished to produce such a portrait of Henry as might , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even , so perhaps he fondly hoped , Elizabeth . He must have been under similar constraint , and it is evident that lie was so , in depicting Anne Bullen , whom he had necessarily to place in contrast with Katharine . He has certainly been more successful in the contrast than in the portrait . All that made her the paragon which the Lord Chamberlain discerns in her we have to take on credit from him and others . All that we deduce from the dramatic presentation of her is that she is an affected little hypocrite . She must have known perfectly well what the King 's attentions to her meant , but she pretends that her heart , is with the discarded Queen , and that the climax of all that is most abhorrent to her would be to be a queen herself . Pomp and state would be loathsome to her , and yet what most melts her in thinking of the degraded Queen is the agony she must feel at having to part from them . As " for all the riches under heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally distasteful to her ; but the moment wealth and title are conferred on her , " more than her all is nothing " to express her gratitude and thanks . And so begins and ends Shakespeare 's presentation of the mother of Elizabeth and the successful rival of Katharine ? one of the many problems in the play . Of the minor and purely subordinate characters in the drama , Norfolk and Surrey are admirably drawn and contrasted -- Norfolk wise , staid , deliberative , sound ; Surrey rash , impulsive , and fiery . How admirable is the touch in the scene between Norfolk , Surrey , the Lord Chamberlain , and Wolsey , where the Lord Chamberlain in pity interposes to check Surrey 's rancorous tirades against their fallen foe Masterly also are the portraits of Gardiner and Cranmer , and gentle Griffith clings unforgetably to the memory . In none of the historical plays are there so many singly impressive scenes ; in none have the dramatis personcv been enriched with a greater number of memorable portraits ; in few are there passages of superior eloquence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of Shakespeare 's style teem more abundantly . But when we regard the drama from another and more important point of view and consider its structure , its motive , its ethics , and the total impressionmade by it , we must certainly pronounce it to be strangely unworthy of its author . A greater and more striking contrast between the power of a work in parts and its feebleness as a whole is probably not to be found in the drama of the world . And , indeed , we are here confronted with what it would be no exaggeration to describe as the knottiest and most insoluble problem in Shakespearian study . The letter of Sir Henry Wotton , corroborated by Lorkin and Chamberlain , places it beyond all doubt that this play was first exhibited on June 19 , 1613 . It was therefore the last work which came from Shakespeare 's hand , appearing some two years after such masterpieces as Cymbeline and The Tempest . In these and in all his mature works two characteristics are invariable ; the one is the elaborate skill with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lucidity and precision with which the ethic expresses itself . In Henry VIII . we have neither . So far from having any pretension to unity , it simply resolves itself into a series of tragic episodes , not fused but loosely tagged together . First our interest is centred , and centred with intensity , on Buckingham and his designs against Wolsey , but in the first scene of the second act Buckingham disappears . Next our interest is centred with even more intensity on Wolsey , but at the end of the third act lie disappears . Lastly our interest is centred on Katharine , and at the end of the fourth act she disappears . The fifth act , in which the interest of the drama ought to culminate , is a mere tag , the feud and long conversations between Gardiner and Crarimer , with Henry 's intervention , having no reference either to what has preceded or to what follows . That a play so essentially grave and so full of tragedy , " of things , " as the Prologue puts it , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jollification as the christening scene ? a scene which has no connection whatever with anything which has interested us in the action of the drama ? not only sets all propriety at defiance , but more than borders on bathos . Nor are the ethics of the play less infirm . No attempt is made to justify Henry in taking the step which broke his wife 's heart ; his pretended scruples wo naturally set down to hypocrisy or to the interested sophistry of a selfish voluptuary ; all our sympathies are enlisted in her favor . And yet with him is the victory ; on him and on his shallow and frivolous consort are lavished all the blessings of Providence and of prophecy . These are not the ethics of Shakespeare . Not less perplexing are the peculiarities of the style and the versification . In some parts , notably in the first and second scenes of the first act , in the scene between the old lady and Anne Bullen , in the trial scene , in the speeches interchanged between the King and Wolsey in the second scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening of the second scene of the fifth act , we have all the unmistakable characteristics of Shakespeare 's later style ? the note of aymbeline , of The Winter 's Tale and of The Tempest . But in other parts of the play ? in the third and fourth scenes , for example , of the first act , in the first and second scenes of the second act , in nearly the whole of the third act , and in the christening scene in the fifth act the note entirely changes . In the style terseness and nerve dissolve in fluidity and di ffuseness , expression takes a florid tinge , and rhetoric everywhere predominates . The ear at once perceives that in the verse rhythm and cadence have entirely changed , both have a studied variety , with , however , a monotonous insistence un redundant syllables at the end of the lines . Whoever will compare the following passages will at once perceive how in point of phrase and rhythm they are essentially distinguished : And bears his blushing honors thick upon All the rhetorical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play , dramatically speaking , belong to the portions written in this last style . Of the semblance of this style and of its general correspondence in color , tone , lexis , rhythm , and cadence to the style most characteristic of John Fletcher there can be no question . And in this fact the late Air . James Spedding found the solution of the anomalies presented by Shakespeare 's most perplexing drama . His theory was a plausible one . It is of course quite apparent that this play is , as Coleridge conjectured , a gelegenheitsgedirht , that it was designed for production on some important state occasion , such as a royal marriage which it was particularly desirable to associate with the interests of Protestantism . In the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth with the Prince Palatine of the Rhine we have precisely such an occasion ; and we know as a matter of fact that the play was produced at the Globe Theatre about three months after the marriage was celebrated . Mr. Spedding 's contention , or rather conjecture , is that Shakespeare had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry and had proceeded perhaps as far as the third act when pressure was put upon him to provide a play for the important public function ; that unable or unwilling to do so , he submitted instead his unfinished drams. and that this drama was adapted to the occasion and completed by Fletcher . This , argues Mr. Spedding , not only accounts for the infirmities in the structure of the work and in its defective ethic , but for the comparative feebleness and languor of certain portions of it , and , above all , for the characteristics of the diction and versification where they differ from those peculiar to Shakespeare 's later style . And now let us see what this theory compels us to accept . We arc to credit Fletcher with the last speeches of Buckingham , with the powerful and pathetic scene between the Oueen , Wolsey , and Campeius : with the greater part of the fall of Wolsey , with his fa- mous soliloquy , with his noble speech to Cromwell , with Griffith 's character of him , and prole Tudor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample means of judging of his powers and much which may be placed in direct parallel with what is here ascribed to him , and to say that he was equal to the composition of any of these scenes and passages is to say what is refuted by the very best of what in a similar vein he has left us . He could no more have written Wolsey 's two great speeches and the death of Katharine than he could have written Lear or Macbeth- . Fletcher was not in the habit of parodying himself , but he was very much in the habit of parodying Shakespeare . According to Mr. Sped-ding , he was the author of Cranmer 's christening speech , but in The Beggar 's Bush he puts in IIiggens ' mouth a ludicrous parody of a part of that speech . It is not a little astonishing that such a critic as Mr. Spedding could not see the absurdity of supposing that evidence based on peculiarities of metre can weigh against evidence based on such facts as these . If he wished to justify the ascription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been held to belong to Shakespeare , it was incumbent on him to show , not by statistics of line endings or any such peddling pedantries , but by adducing proof of capacity , or at least of approximate capacity , that Fletcher was equal to its composition . This he has neither done nor made any attempt to do . Another result of Mr. Spedding 's theory is that while it robs Shakespeare of most of what is best in. the play , it maims and futilizes what it leaves him . Buckingham disappears with his arrest . Wolsey becomes little more than a torso , and Katharine fares very little better . Forlorn indeed are the proportions to which Shakespeare is reduced . Speculative criticism is generally futile , and when dogmatic , disgusting . I am , therefore , very unwilling to offer any theory of my own in attempted solution of the critical problem presented by the play . But conjectures which result in such a reductio ad absurdum as Mr. Spedding 's do , surely justify counter-conjectures , which , however unsatisfactory , at least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perplexing differences in style and the numerous infirmities in the play are to be accounted for partly by the fact that it was composed in different periods of Shakespeare 's career , and partly by the fact that they are the result of an attempt to utilize for practical purposes a scheme which he had more than once abandoned because as all artist he had found it unmanageable . The probability is that he had originally conceived , as Mr. Spedding conjectures , " the idea of a great historical drama on the subject of Henry VIII. , which would have included the divorce of Katharine , the fall of Wolscy , the rise of Cranmer , the coronation of Anne Bullen , and the final separation of the English from the Romish Church . " Here was a noble theme ? a theme which may well have fascinated the poet of King John . But he must soon have discovered the immense difficulty of comprising so much within the compass of a single drama . As the important and impressive events necessarily to be woven into the plot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , came thronging on his imagination , he must have felt that he was in the position of a painter whose canvas was too narrow for what had to be crowded into it . He probably made his first experiment comparatively early in his career , about the time he was engaged on King John and Richard the Second , or possibly later . There can not be the smallest doubt that the greater part of the drama was composed in Elizabeth 's reign . Not Oranmcr 's speech only , but the pointed refer-ences to her in the play , " From this lady 1 . e. , Anne Rullenj may proceed a gem to lighten all this isle , " and more especially such a remark as Henry 's : a remark which must have been particularly offensive to Janice I. ? all place this beyond reasonable question . Elze plausibly conjectures that it may have been intended for production on the seventieth anniversary of Anne Bullen 's marriage , in 1603 , but that it was put aside in consequence of the Queen 's death . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form it was intended for production at or about that date , but that it was put aside not on account of the Queen 's death , but for other reasons . It is a play which would never for one nmment have been exhibited in the reign of the great Queen . To suppose that she would have allowed either her father or her mother to he depicted as they are depicted here . that she would have tolerated such a pathetic presentation of the woman whom her mother superseded , that she would have permitted herself to be publicly exhibited as a puking baby or to he referred to as " an aged virgin , " is to suppose what is improbable to the point of impossibility . Nor is this all . Mr. Gerald Massey was , T believe , the first to point out that Buckingham 's speech is in its most important features simply a reproduction of the speech made by Essex on the scaffold , and that the account of his trial given in the dialogue between the two gentlemen is an exact account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in 1613 ; it went home to every soul in London between 1601 and 1603 . It is quite possible that Shakespeare , then a young man , did not realize these objections to his drama , and that he may have thought that Elizabeth 's sympathies would have been with him when he thus recalled , as he did in Julius Omar , the fate of her favorite . But the moment the play was submitted to the Lord Chamberlain there could he no doubt what its fate must have been . Assuming , then , that the greater part of Henry VIII .. as we now have it , was composed early in Shakespeare 's career , no difficulties at all are presented by the style and the versification . The lexis , rhythm , and tone are simply in essentials what we find in Shakespeare 's own earlier style . The speeches of Buckingham , Wolsey , and Cranmer are simply variants on the rhythm of the earlier historical plays : the redundant syllable , if not quite , is almost as common as here in Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The infirmities in the structure of the play are probably to he accounted for by the fact that , despairing of his attempt to make it satisfactory as a work of art , and as such troubling himself no more about it , he resolved to utilize it as a court pageant . Having failed , fur the reasons stated , to do this in 1603 , he made a second attempt in 1613 . On this occasion it was particularly necessary to emphasize the triumph of Protestantism , and so , for a fifth act , he languidly set to work with hidicrous indifference to dramatic propriety . but with much relevance to the occasion , to versify Fox 's account of the events attending the birth of Anne Bullen and ( lardiner 's feud with Cranmer . He did not even take the trouble to remove from the drama what would be calculated to annoy James , satisfying himself by throwing a sop to his royal master by an awkward interpolation in a eulogy to dint monarch 's hated predeeessor . What happened is what might have been expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Chamberlain as he had probably fared with Elizabeth 's , though without being prohibited from exhibiting his play on the Bankside . Among the Rawlinson MSS. in the Bodleian is a list of the plays produced at court between the feast of St. Michael's. 1612 , and the feast of St. Michael 's , 1613 ; they are twenty-four in number , including The Tempest and Julies Cre.sar , but they do not include henry VIII . To his mortification , no doubt ? though what else could he have expected ? - he was obliged to content himself with the plaudits of the Globe . I venture to submit , then , that the whole of Henry VIII . is from Shakespeare 's pen : that the differences in its characteristics of style and verse are to be attributed to the fact that it was composed at different periods in his career , and that its infirmities as a drama are to be accounted for by the fact that when he found he had attempted an impossible task he abandoned it , but seeing that what he had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desultory way to account , ceasing , however , as an artist to have any serious interest in his work .
