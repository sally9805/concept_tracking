 |p1123  places began asking for them , and some societies thought them worth paying money for . Finally Miss Frances Willard , our National and World 's President of the W. C. T. U. , said in her sweet and gracious way that I could be of " great use " to them , and so arranged plans by which I gave my entire time to organizing and lecturing at home , and then abroad in the British and Dutch States of South Africa . On returning to America I was called to lecture in Manitoba and in some of the Northwestern States . While in Minnesota I met a woman who was ordained pastor of a Congregational church . I visited her home and her parish and was charmed with the opportunities she possessed . I thought an angel might envy her the good she could exert over the character and home life of her people . More than ever was I concerned with the thought of the special fitness of women for certain lines of pastoral work . I learned also that in this fair-minded cheery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling , and it was with great pleasure that I accepted soon a call to take charge " for six months " of a little church in which I had held a few meetings . My pastor and the board of eight elders in giving me my church letter approved of my choice of work , but expressed regret that I must go " out of my own communion to get it , " because the presbyteries yet decide that " women are not called to preach . " Now this little church had the reputation of being a difficult one . In thirteen years it had known a dozen pulpit supplies , and had " vacancies " extending over periods of months . The senior deacon said frankly they had " tried old men and young men , students and seminary-trained men , and a few possessed of some native wit and not much schooling , and they now proposed to try a woman . " The council of men and women , pastors and laymen of some twentyfive churches of " the twin cities " were Iot troubled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my oeople to confer ordination and installaLion if an examination should show my itness , and a few weeks ' mutual acquaintance between the people and me seemed : o have wrought wonders , for there was no intimation at this time of " a six months ' trial . " I remained at W for five years . I was for some time the only resident pastor of six churches on the lake shore , so that almost all funerals , marriages and christenings were in my charge . " The Preacher Lady " seemed to be able to unite all factions and all faiths . Roman Catholic and Lutheran parents brought their little children to me for baptism , while the laboring men and women of the village , the farmers ' families , and the wealthy people who had built handsome cottages on the bay , which they occupied for only a few months of the year , came to church harmoniously . It was rather a surprise to our folks when I began hiring the best trap and horse in the village the first summer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottagers . " None of their former ministers had been on terms of social equality with these people , and never called unless to ask for contributions . It seemed a sort of intuition . Of course most of them were my social equals , and I had to find out in my woman 's way who among them would really help me and my people in our best real life , and whom we could help . The ladies of the lake not only returned my calls , sometimes bringing down their husbands and city visitors , but they contributed liberally ? from our standpoint ? when we repaired and beautified our house of worship , helped pay off the parsonage debt and founded a reading room . I never asked them for contributions . I found that many of the village women had a very small range of experience and ideals . I reorganized the Ladies ' Aid Society and became president of it , so that I could come into confidential touch with them . I studied new recipes and suggested new dishes . I wrought on fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow practice than precept . I do not know if it is a rare thing between pastor and people , but these women began to feel , I think , to a remarkable degree , that I stood for them in many ways . They became interested in the accounts I gave of people and places that I knew in connection with the activities of the Church at large . They always wanted me to go to district and State associations ; to " look well " and to " make a  |p1124  good impression . " I began to succeed in coaxing more of them to attend such gatherings , and our own church activities grew in power and interest . There were fifty-five churches in our district . At my first meeting of the association , which all ministers and some laymen are supposed to attend , I was elected secretary ? the first time a woman ever occupied that position , I think . It was not given me so much because the brethren considered it an honor to me as because it entails a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three men were named before me , one declining on the pretext that he could not write legibly , and all the others making some halting excuse no better than that one . But they all seemed immensely pleased and relieved when I was at last safely elected . I always tried to avoid calling notice to any distinction in sex in my work in any line , but every one else was not so careful , and sometimes embarrassing things happened . At a large State meeting of Women 's Missionary Societies , held in a prominent city church , the two other women pastors of the State in our denomination were present , and it chanced , or was purposely planned , that we were seated together at lunch . As soon as this was noticed people began to say quite loudly : " Oh , just see the three preacher ladies eating together , " the waiters stood and stared , the people in the kitchen peeped , and mothers even called their children in to look at three very ordinary looking ladies eating their dinner ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other folks . Why should it appear such a strange thing for three little women to be trying to do a piece of work for humanity that the men of the Church had neglected , or failed in doing ? As for the ministers of my Church , and those of other faiths , they have been almost without exception , when they have once fully understood my position professionally , frankly cordial and brotherly . I have noticed that the better they do their own work , and the finer the position they themselves hold , the more ready they seem to appreciate my efforts . The people who hold longest to prejudice and preconceived opposition are the ignorant , specially the undiciplined and raw , and those who are not growing old sweetly . Soon after I went to W - a young man made some critical remarks about " a woman pastor , " and openly set forth a plan he had to fasten a live mouse in the pulpit stand in such a way that it would escape when I moved the hymn book to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got away too soon . They-told me about it afterward , and I was devoutly thankful the thing was n't there to jump at me , for I never have been able to avoid screaming when confronted by a live mouse . Yet I can not understand why this weakness should seriously impair the usefulness of a woman who has it in her heart to minister lovingly toward the spiritual growth of live children , or to comfort the bereaved friends of dead ones . This lad afterward became one of my faithful helpers . We took up Sunday afternoon service for a poverty-stricken little church three or four miles around the bay , and in the coldest or hottest or muddiest of the weather the boy would bring his own horse and drive me over , thus saving me from a care that " comes more easily to a man than to a woman . " He confessed to a sister , who was a warm personal friend of mine , that I not only could preach , but that I was brave and set an excellent example to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rains , and complain about the long ride . ' Some people will joke about even the most serious things , and then get paid up for it possibly . There was a facetious widower in my congregation . The day of my ordination the last act of my generous membership was to serve a nice lunch on a beautiful lawn near the churclbefore the visitors took train or boat for homes . As I talked to some of the young people after the friends had gone thanking them for their valuable contribution to the day 's success , this gentleman came up , saying : " Miss what would you say to me if I should ask you to marry me now ? " Without hesitation I answered : " I should say I am happy to be eligible to perform that ceremony . Who is the lady , Brothel Z ? ? " He said the " joke " was or him and went away laughing . Some months later the same gentlemar came to me with a declaration that some/ how recalled the foregoing incident , but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one did apparently , tho he slid not go away laughing , and did not say " the joke is on me . " I never married him , for altho he married a wealthy widow later on , he did not ask nie to " perform the ceremony . " I was often reminded of Dr. Andrew Murray 's wise saying : " The reward of work is more work . " I exchanged pulpits frequently with men of large and influential charges , and particularly did this request come when they wanted a temperance or missionary sermon preached . I was counted successful along these lines and with young people . They seem to be the first in the ministry to be regarded as " essentially womanly . " At first we had a few people who thought it most " improper " for a woman to officiate at the Lord 's Supper . With us this was a very simple service , yet all that it implied ? remembrance of not only what He was , but what He is . We had full congregations on these occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being specially blessed by joining us in the Holy Communion . I speak of this because I have had the same testimony in regard to this ordinance as administered by other women pastors . It is associated with a remark made to me by a man who at this time was pastor of one of the leading churches in Minneapolis : " The world will not find the Church cold nor losing its power when we have freely and generously opened the doors of its every office to the most moral and spiritual two-thirds of its membership , really welcoming them , and not merely tolerating them because in the light of God 's Word we dare not refuse their ministrations . " When I was utterly perplexed and wearied with the varied gamut of human nature , and all efforts to lift the burdens of the needy masses and the unhappy classes seemed to fail , I could always go to the lake shore , and turning from the ugly , huddled buildings of the village , and the more pretentious " cottages " of the summer people , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon God 's building . The cloudy water tipped with silver flecks sang a thousand songs in summer . The expanse of diamond-studded snow that in winter covered the solid ice , making a new highway , was painted with a hundred different pictures daily by the Hand Divine . It was His gift to the people of the region that we might keep faith with Him and with each other . But in the last analysis even if a woman should do a given work far better than a man she is very apt to succumb in time to things social , as they are and not as they ought to be . We had some new people come into our place . A few of them brought church letters from denominations that do not have the light on God 's word as the Congregationalists have it . They were not even " tolerant " concerning the ordination and ministration of women in the Church . One man whose child had been converted by my ministry a little while before , refused to bring a letter or permit his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious work as a missionary , " not for pay . " " To give this little woman six hundred dollars a year and three rooms in the parsonage rent free , " was a thing unheard of . " They could get a man for that . " The senior deacon , always loyal , always fearless , always fair , held for the administration . They had paid every man preacher eight hundred , " and the whole parsonage , if he wanted it . " " And we never had any better work done , either . " But not even the senior deacon nor the devout and faithful Mrs. Deacons were able to " corral " the tongue of the modern Jezebel . " The Preacher Lady " was on " intimate terms " with people of doubtful reputation . It was true . I had even attended two dances . Once I had spent most of the hours of a long , weary , to me utterly disgusting night in the untidy old hall where the dances and other public functions were held . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people . I knew my presence had prevented the attendance of some and checked the conduct of others . I knew there was not a man , woman or child in the village with the grace of God in his heart that did not trust me . I knew at that great clay some lives would stand before the Judge cleaner because I had  |p1126  chosen that form of service . I also knew that going home in the early dawn of a glorious spring day upon this last occasion of defeating the wiles of the Evil One I had asked the Heavenly Father if I might not be spared that sort of service again forever more . All these attacks could have been overcome . It all grew out of a form of jealousy because a woman could succeed , had succeeded , where others had failed . A brave woman would have found the fight and victory an easy one . I should have held the ground a year before . But there comes a time when the cry of the human heart for the presence , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends grows too strong . There was another call , too , to a church farther East , nearer " home . " A majority of the congregation in W were loath to accept a resignation , and afterward wished to reconsider . I had my father only a few brief years of my life , but one thing I had learned of him , " when you know you are right do not let any one persuade you from your course . " One little girl regretted my going most because they were to have " a man preacher , " and she thought that would " be horrid . " My experience for the next fifteen months in a city of sixteen thousand people , most of whom are foreign born , over a Welsh and American membership of fifty souls , planted as the only Protestant English-speaking religious body in a population of five thousand in " the factory district over the river , " our nearness to the ugliest and wickedest city on the continent , which certainly helped on our demoralization ; the small homes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an inmate ; the horrors of a boarding house filled with men of low character and habits ; the effort to " keep house " in a little flat , which with all my other duties led to an almost fatal illness ? a simple mental review of all this leaves me nearly breathless even now . Yet there were many things it is well to remember . It was not a lost battle . While I have sought not to emphasize a difference in sex , a truly thoughtful and helpful officiary and a careful choice of personal friends may save one from those acts that are counted " masculine , " and certainly there is no need of performing one 's professional duties in " a mannish way . " In my seven years as pastor , both at W ? and at H ? , I was never expected to go out alone nights . I never made myself troublesome by asking company , and if duty called me unexpectedly I went without fear . But I saw to it that the girls of my congregation did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to be shielded in the dark from possible molestation , and to certain other courtesies which I never claimed for myself , but which have usually been granted me.
