 | GENERAL HENRY W. LAWTON 'S military career began when he was but eighteen years of age . Its earlier chapters have recently become so familiar to the public that I shall content myself with the briefest outline of them . Within three days after President Lincoln 's first call for men he had enlisted as a private in the Ninth Indiana Volunteers . He served with this regiment through the Civil War , and at its close was mustered out a lieutenant-colonel , after being brevetted colonel " for gallant and meritorious services " and awarded a medal of honor for " distinguished service . " He entered the regular army as a second lieutenant in 1866 , serving in the infantry until 1869 , and then in the cavalry until 1888 . From that time until the outbreak of the war with Spain he was an inspector-general . His remarkable work in Indian campaigns on the frontier culminated in that wonderful pursuit of Geronimo , which he pushed to a successful conclusion in the face of seemingly insuperable obstacles . During this period of his service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidity and persistence of pursuit , " and " for great skill , perseverance , and gallantry . " Shortly after the declaration of war with Spain , he was made a brigadier-general of volunteers , and on the 8th of July , 1898 , was raised to the rank of major-general of volunteers . It will not soon be forgotten who asked that the order to fall back at El Caney be put in writing , and improved the time thus gained to hurl his battalions against the heights and plant his country 's flag upon their bloody crest . Unfortunately the civil work which General Lawton promptly inaugurated as Governor of the Province of Santiago is less well known than are his services in the field , and his reputation in the Philippines before his arrival there was that of " a fighter " pure and simple . Certainly no one can deny that he was a fighter ; a splendidly prepared , determined , persistent , dauntless , and invariably successful fighter quick to detect his enemy 's weakest point , and to reach it with a blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decisive victory . But those who think that he was only a fighter are in grievous error . He was an organizer and administrator of the first order . My acquaintance with him began at Manila , on the morning of March 13 , 1899 , when I clambered up the side of the transport " Grant , " which had brought him and his family into the Bay three days before . Five minutes later I was doing my best to answer keen and exhaustive questions about the islands , their people , the causes of the existing insurrection , and the means best calculated to terminate it . I saw at once that General Lawton was an extremely well-informed man , who had availed himself to the full of exist-  | ing sources of information concerning his new field of operations , and who would take up his difficult task , not only with a clear comprehension of the fact that something more than bullets and bayonets was necessary in order to bring honorable and lasting peace , but with a determination to avail himself of every legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military commander , firm in his conviction of the sufficiency of brute force and eager to crush all opposition by the exercise of it , which , I confess , popular rumor had prepared me to expect , I found a modest , quiet , moderate gentleman , who in spite of leis well-deserved reputation for striking quick and hard when he found it necessary to strike , nevertheless at once made it evident that he preferred to employ gentler methods where they would suffice . This attitude he steadfastly maintained to the day of his death . How much the country owes to him for his splendid services in the field during his Philippine campaigns can never be generally known until the detailed history of those campaigns has been written and read . In my judgment , it owes him a still heavier debt of gratitude for the admirable tact , the even-handed and prompt justice , and the open-hearted frank- ness and cordiality which characterized him in all his dealings with the natives . No other officer learned to know them so well , and the confidence which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remain , no less an honor to him and a potent factor in the restoration of peace than was the fear which he soon aroused in all who attempted to oppose him in battle . In the course of our first interview General Lawton told me frankly that , in spite of the opportunity which active service brought him , he detested war . He added that he doubted the justice of the struggle in which we were then engaged ; in fact , I remember distinctly that he characterized it as " unholy . " I did not at that time attempt to discuss the point with him , feeling sure that the first-hand acquaintance with facts which he was certain to gain would suffice to set him right . This belief was fully justified . He sought , and obtained , the truth from every available source . How completely he changed his mind as the result is a matter of common knowledge . I can only echo his wish , made solemn by the fact that he had given up his life ere the letter in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his countrymen whose misguided efforts have so long fed the flame of  | revolt in the Philippines might learn to understand the situation as well as he understood it. * General Lawton 's civilian friends saw little of him for many weeks after he landed . On March 18th , he assumed command of the first division of the Eighth Army Corps . He was at first fully occupied in familiarizing himself with his new command and with local conditions in general , and very soon entered upon active operations in the field . On April 10th , he attacked and captured Santa Cruz , an important insurgent stronghold at the eastern end of the Laguna de Bay . This movement was admirably planned , and was carried out under his personal direction . Lawton was not a man who believed in fighting battles in an unknown country at the far end of a telegraph wire . The attack was completely successful . During its progress he displayed that conspicuous personal gallantry for which he is famous , and at its close he risked his own life in emphasizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needless shot , a principle which guided him in every engagement he went into . A heavy loss was inflicted on the insurgents at Santa Cruz , and all of their steam transportation on the lake was captured . Hardly had the city been taken when it was put under guard . There was no burning nor looting . Friendly natives who had remained in their homes were granted the fullest protection , and the conduct of our troops was such that those who had fled in fear soon began to return . They were quick to note and appreciate the difference between the treatment accorded them by the Americans and that which they had received at the hands of their own armed forces . The abandonment of this important place , which was ordered a few days later from headquarters , and the resultant leaving of . natives who had shown their friendliness toward us to the mercy of our enemies , was a sore trial to General Lawton . Without presuming to express an opinion as to the military necessity of this step , I can not forbear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was most unfortunate throughout the entire lake region . No sooner had General Lawton returned to Manila than he was ordered to begin the formation of a force of approximately 4,000 men , with which he was to operate on the right flank of the insurgent troops opposing General MacArthur at the north . It should be borne in mind that in no one of his important movements did he have anything like an organized brigade placed at his disposal . He had to pick up a company here , a battalion or possibly a regiment there , in order to make up a command , which was sure to be broken up and scattered again as soon as the work assigned to it had been completed , a fresh force , differently composed , being brought together for each new undertaking . With characteristic energy and promptness , Lawton concentrated and organized his command , and on April 22d began his northward march . The territory through which he moved was known only from maps which proved utterly unreliable , showing roads where no roads existed . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies over steel ) hills , and through dense and pathless thickets , muddy swamps , and unbridged streams , without so much as a trail to guide him . No obstacle could stop him . He inspired his men with his own indomitable energy . When the intense heat killed the draft animals , officers and soldiers bent to the yoke in their places , and the expedition moved on . In one instance a terrible day 's work resulted in a gain . of but three miles . The enemy was promptly encountered , and persistently opposed his advance . Engagements varying from mere skirmishes to severe fights were of constant occurrence . Lawton continually outflanked the opposing forces , thus inflicting heavy losses on them with a minimum of casualties among his own men . The insurgents were driven in quick succession from one strong position to another , and were eventually thrown into confusion by the rapidity and persistency of his pursuit . With so small a force , no line of communications could be maintained . He buried his dead at the nearest town or village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurgents annoyed his outposts . Always ready for each new contingency , he organized scouts , taking five picked  | men , including a non-commissioned officer , from each company , and giving the command of the body thus formed to a civilian named Young , whom he personally selected for this important and dangerous honor . From that time on the enemy ceased to molest our outposts . They had work nearer home . Young eventually died of wounds received in battle , but the system thus inaugurated was continued with excellent results . Novaliches , San Jose , Norzagaray , Angat , San Rafael , and Bustos fell in quick succession . At Balivag the insurgents had made preparations for a strong stand , but Lawton , through his tact and skill in dealing with the natives , had kept himself fully informed of heir operations . He never lacked for spies or couriers who would serve him faithfully . Strong lines of intrenchments protected the town from attack in the direction of Bustos on the one side , and the railroad track on the other . By a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rear . The fight , - which opened at a range of 2,000 yards , had hardly begun when a flag of truce was shown . Captain Case and an orderly were sent forward to meet it . When they had approached to within 250 yards of it , a heavy volley was fired at them . Throwing themselves from their horses to the ground , they worked their way back toward our line , which of course instantly reopened on the enemy . The town was promptly captured . In spite of the shameful and irritating misuse of the white flag , perfect order was maintained , and when it was found that the command was to remain there for a short time , General Lawton , true to his belief that civil affairs should always be in the hands of civilians when practicable , promptly held an election and organized a municipal government with native officials . A similar course was followed at Angat , and , in fact , wherever conditions made it at all practicable . The effect of this action was far-reaching , and news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with almost miraculous promptness . The advance to the northward was soon resumed by way of San Ildefonso , Maasin , and San Miguel de Mayumo , and it ended in the capture of San Isidro , the new insurgent capital . The enemy had long since found that , to use Lawton 's own expression , he could " go to bed with them at night and get up with them in the morning , " and they  | rapidly wearied of his constant companionship . Not only did his resistless and rapid advance utterly demoralize them , but his splendid personal bravery , and his protection of the lives and property of non-combatants , no less than the considerate kindness which he showed in all his dealings with them , won for him a unique place in the ' hearts of the common people ? a place which he never lost . Meanwhile General MacArthur was pressing forward along the line of the railway , and as a result of the combined movement , which threatened the complete destruction of the insurgent army , commissions were being sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empowered to do anything practical , but came only to inquire as to our intentions and to beg for time . After San Isidro fell , Lawton was eager to press on to Tarlac . On May 17th , he wired headquarters that his provisions could be made to hold out until the 30th . He was well supplied with ammunition . Nevertheless he was ordered to fall back , and there began a retrograde movement , dispiriting to our men and full of encouragement to the enemy . Commissions ceased to arrive at Manila , and the scattered insurgent forces reassembled and attacked our columns as they withdrew through Cabiao , Arayat , and Candaba . A permanent garrison was left at Balivag . The proximity of the rainy season has been assigned as a reason for the abandonment of the forward movement . Lawton always contended that he could operate in the rain better than could the insurgents , and later in the year he proved it . Of this expedition it may be said , in general , that it inflicted heavy losses on the enemy , demoralizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it destroyed or distributed among the common people immense quantities of insurgent stores ; that its effect on the peaceable inhabitants was admirable , convincing them as it did of the falsity of the vile slanders which had been diligently circulated in regard to our troops ; and , finally , that its moral influence on the insurgent army , up to the time of the withdrawal from San Isidro , can hardly be overstated . For that withdrawal General Lawton certainly can not be held responsible . His position , with the rainy season at hand , may not have been strong , but he desired to strengthen it by advancing , not by retiring . No sooner had he returned to Manila than he was directed to gather a force and drive off the insurgents under Pio del Pilar , who were committing indescribable crimes against the inhabitants of Morong and the neighboring towns . On June 3d he attacked this force from three directions . Not only did the movement succeed in its object , but had not General Hall 's column been unexpectedly delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's entire command . For many weeks there had been a tacit truce along the south line , and negotiations had been in progress which at one time promised to end in the peaceable submission of the hostile forces in Cavite province . Unfortunately this fact became known to the insurgent leaders . General Trias , who was in command south of the Pasig River and Laguna de Bay , was accordingly removed from his post , and Baldomero Aguinaldo , a cousin of the dictator , was appointed in his stead . As a result of this change , the insurgents in Cavite province again became aggressive . On June 7th , Lawton was instructed to concentrate a force of approximately 4,000 men , and begin active operations against them . An attack was made on the morning of the 10th . It had been planned that parallel columns under Generals Wheaton and Oven-  | shine should pierce the insurgent line near San Pedro Macati . Wheaton was then to swing toward the lake , and Ovenshine toward the bay , taking the strong insurgent works at Paranaque and Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hottest of the year . No drinking water was found along the line of march , and a considerable number of the troops were fresh from the United States , and had not become acclimated . The number of heat prostrations resulting was so great that it became necessary to abandon the original plan of operations and concentrate the two columns . This was done under the personal direction of General Lawton , and the movement toward Las Pinas was then continued in the face of determined opposition . The command camped for the night close to the town . Under cover of darkness the enemy withdrew , retreating to a strong position along the southern bank of the Zapote River . At this very place a small insurgent force had inflicted a severe defeat on a vastly superior body of Spanish troops during the revolt of ' 96 , and they therefore considered it sacred ground . Before leaving Las Films they went before the native priest of that town and took a solemn oath to hold the Zapote River or die in their trenches . On the afternoon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting-top of the gunboat " Helena , " and later , after landing , went forward with a small detachment , endeavoring to exactly locate their left . During this reconnoissance several Mauser volleys , as well as a number of shrapnel shells , were fired at his little party at short range from across the river . On the following day occurred the famous battle of the Zapote River . Before it opened General Lawton took two companies , and moving along the beach , forded the stream at its mouth , passing around the left of the enemy 's line , and , under the direction of a native guide , reaching a position well in his rear . One company was left behind as a support , in order to prevent the advance from being cut off , and the other pushed on until within less than 200 yards of the only  | road along which the insurgents could retreat , when a determined Remington fire was encountered , to which the pop of the Mauser was soon added , showing that the small American force had compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reenforcements . A single company was opposed by at least a thousand men , and it is difficult see why it was not annihilated . The enemy closed in until the range was but little more than a hundred yards . As it seemed desirable to hold the position , and thus permanently weaken the insurgent force along the river , the reserve company was brought up , and a slightly sheltered spot was found for our troops , which they determinedly held . During all this time General Lawton was exposed to a fearful fire at short range . Conspicuous as he was , not only on account of his commanding stature , but because of the light uniform and white helmet which he invariably wore in battle , it is little less than a miracle that he escaped alive . The effect of his splendid example on the men can hardly be overestimated . At one time Captain Sage , in command of the advanced company , was left with nine men to face the enemy , the remainder of his force having fallen back through misunderstanding an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of but forty yards , Sage held his position , picking up the rifle of a wounded man , and himself dropping five insurgents with it . Having stationed these companies as above indicated , General Lawton then returned to the river to direct the general attack , which was promptly delivered and completely successful . An attempt to rush the bridge developed the fact that the wooden planking with which a broken stone arch had been repaired was burned out , so that it was impossible to cross . Our end of this bridge was but thirty-four yards from the insurgent trenches ; nevertheless , the guns of a battery took position on it and opened , while our troops occupied the bank , and coolly picked off every man on the opposite side who showed his head . So deadly was the fire that it was impossible for the insurgents to serve their artillery . I afterward found four bullet marks on the muzzle of one of their guns . Meanwhile our men had crossed the river between the bridge and the bay , and outflanked the trenches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great disorder , closely pressed by our troops . Just beyond Bacoor they made a final stand , but were again routed within twenty minutes , and fled in confusion toward Imus . In his official report of the engagement General Lawton said , " The bearing of officers and men throughout this battle was magnificent . The conduct of officers whose names are mentioned . . . should be entitled and characterized distinguished gallantry in the presence of the enemy at the battle of the Zapote River . . . This is probably the first time in history that a battery has been advanced and fought without cover , within thirty yards of strongly manned trenches . " He forgets to mention the fact that this gallant advance was made under his own eye , and that he stood calm and impassive beside the guns while they were being served . How much of the splendid intrepidity displayed by his officers and men on this and other occasions was due to the magnificent example of their dauntless leader ? He was the most modest of men , and would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keen eye on those who served with him , and gave them the fullest credit for all that they did . Even when exposed to hot fire , he would dictate to his aide memoranda of the brave acts of others , in order that he might forget nothing . Although he spared neither his men nor himself when duty called , he was nevertheless most considerate of those who served under hint , and he was loved and implicitly trusted by his troops . No matter how difficult or dangerous the task , his men never shrank from it , for they felt that under his leadership success was certain . The moral effect of the victory at the Zapote was tremendous . The insurgents knew that , having failed to hold this river , there was no position in Cavite which they could hope to maintain . On the morning after the fight , the General and his staff rode into Bacoor . The insurgent troops had conducted themselves shamefully before abandoning the town . One family of women and girls had suffered especially . After shooting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plundered it , even going so far as to search the persons of the unfortunate occupants for concealed jewelry . The latter had passed the remainder of the night on their knees , in constant fear of their lives , and they welcomed the General as a deliverer . They were so demonstrative in their joy that , in speaking of the occurrence afterward , he dryly remarked that only his height had saved him from having them literally fall on his neck . On the following day , the presidente of  | Imus came in to announce the voluntary surrender of his town , and to invite the Americans to garrison it , which was done . General Lawton 's attention was immediately turned to bettering the condition of the inhabitants who remained in the captured cities . They had been plundered of their belongings by their own troops , and were in a pitiable condition from lack of food . At Lawton 's request , they were supplied with meat and rice from Manila until again able to provide for themselves . As a result of this kind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to their homes . At this time I made a tour of inspection through Paranaque , Las Pinas , Bacoor , and Imus , with a view to ascertaining the feeling of the natives toward us and their needs in general . I found everywhere the heartiest appreciation of the kindly treatment which they bad received , and a willingness to cooperate with us against what they were learning to consider a common enemy ; but without organization they were helpless to act , and there was a universal and strong desire for the establishment of some form of municipal government . Having first consulted General Lawton , and found him most heartily in sympathy with my views as to the desirability of attempting such organization , I then laid the facts before General Otis , who promptly instructed Lawton to attend to the matter . At the latter 's request , I had a simple form of municipal government prepared in outline by a good Filipino lawyer . This was submitted to Senor Arrellano , president of the Manila Supreme Court , and after being slightly amended by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order of it , without changing a word , and invited me to accompany him to the various towns within his jurisdiction and aid in putting that order into effect . On the morning of July 1st , we started on our mission in an army ambulance , protected by a cavalry escort , and accompanied by Senor Felipe Calderon , a Filipino who understood both Spanish and Tagalog , and who had a wide acquaintanceship among the people of Cavite province .  | Paranaque was the first town visited . The principalia , or " headmen , " had assembled , and when we entered the house where they were awaiting us , I saw at once that they were literally quaking with fear . I asked them the reason , and was informed that when a Spanish general called the headmen of a town together , under such conditions , some of them usually got shot . I explained the situation to General Lawton , and he was on his feet in an instant . He spoke straight from the heart , simply , earnestly , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of thought which many men would not have gained in years . I translated his words literally into Spanish , and Calderon repeated them in Tagalog . Their effect was wonderful . We held a successful election on the spot . Before leaving , Lawton shook hands cordially with each of the newly chosen officials , and gave him a kindly word of congratulation and advice . When we took our departure there was a perfectly spontaneous outburst of enthusiasm , and the natives cheered him to the echo . Bacoor , Imus , and Las Pinas were then organized in the order named , two days being consumed in the work . Wherever we went , the General made the people his friends . He returned the humble salute of every poor native whom we passed by the wayside . He accepted the friendly hospitality of the people in the towns that we visited , breaking bread with them , and sleeping in their homes . There was full and instant justice for all who came to him with reasonable ground for complaint . Although not himself a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imus to attend mass on Sunday morning , and I accompanied him . The week before , when on my preliminary tour of investigation , the fine native band at Imus had'turned out in my honor , and thinking that it would promote good feeling between the people and our soldiers if they would learn to play the Star Spangled Banner , I had taught their leader the air . We were surprised and touched when that beautiful hymn was feelingly rendered as a part of the sacred music during the service . Afterward the priest told us that on account of the course which the Americans had followed in his town , our national air would continue to form a part of the sacred music in that church so long as he remained in charge of it . The system of civil government thus established proved so successful that we soon extended it to Pandacan , Santa Ana , San Felipe Nery , and Malibay , the General personally conducting the work in every case . To be sure , our native officials were , as Senor Calderon remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were either incapable of applying simple general principles or unwilling to assume the responsibility of doing so , and constantly flocked to Manila for instructions , occupying much of the time of Calderon , the General , and myself . Lawton always gave them a kindly welcome . His patience in dealing with them seemed endless , and I know that they soon learned , not only to respect and admire him , but to love him . He inspired an almost incredible amount of loyalty among them . We had ex-  | pected dishonesty and treachery , but up to the time of my departure only one man had proved unworthy of the trust imposed in him . On the whole , the troops which garrisoned our new municipalities behaved extremely well . Lawton 's orders as to the maintenance of public order were severe , and he enforced them to the letter whenever occasion arose . It was of course inevitable that there should be some clashes between the soldiers and the natives , and my relations with the latter were such that abuses were almost certain to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General with them , and I speak from personal knowledge when I say that he was tireless in his efforts to bring evil-doers to justice . One instance I recall with especial clearness . A poor native was assaulted near Mariquina by a couple of drunken soldiers , who wounded him in the arm and robbed him of a large sum of money . Two women witnessed the occurrence , but were at first afraid to testify against white men . At Lawton 's request I sent messages to them again and again , in order to persuade them to come in and bear witness . We were at last successful in getting their evidence , which proved sufficient to convict . The plaintiff went his way rejoicing , after receiving a sum equivalent to the one he had lost , the necessary amount having been deducted from the pay of his assailants . The latter were sentenced to long terms in Bilibid , while the witnesses , to their utter amazement , received proper compensation for their services . A few days later I beard all about this case from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I know both that the fame of it spread far and wide , and that the people marveled . ' They had never heard of such a thing , and could not understand it . Lawton was a thorough believer in the natives , and was very anxious to utilize them as soldiers , by forming a mixed body of scouts composed of Americans and Tagalogs . After much difficulty he succeeded in obtaining authorization to do this . He then told me that he wanted half a dozen of the worst men in Cavite province , by preference leaders of the bands of tulisanes , or professional bandits , which have infested that district from time immemorial . With the aid of Calderon , I got them . The General said that he would make good citizens of them , and he did . Other men were secured for him by Captain Lara of the native police force , and about this little nucleus yet others soon gathered . The force as finally organized numbered some forty white men and fifty-two natives . It was commanded by Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Lawton 's staff , for information as to the result of this interesting experiment . He tells me that it was a complete success . The native scouts were brave , efficient , and loyal . Not a gun was lost , nor did a man desert . When the final campaign opened in the north , they accompanied Lawton 's advance , sometimes even going a full day 's march ahead of it . On one occasion sixteen na-  | tives and two white men were given insurgent uniforms , and armed with captured Remington and Mauser rifles . Thus equipped they were sent into a village garrisoned by three riflemen and fifty bolo men , which force they captured entire , after first gathering valuable information . The white men of this command soon learned to regard their darkskinned comrades with the respect which one brave man feels toward another . The General was also keenly interested in the enlistment of a strong force from among the Macabebes , who were eager for an opportunity to fight their enemies , the Tagalog insurgents . I remember well his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization of three companies had been authorized . Captain King tells me that this number was eventually increased to five . The Macabebes were armed with cavalry carbines and put into the field at once . They did magnificent work , fighting bravely and moving very rapidly . They sometimes even kept up with the cavalry on quick marches . It should be remembered that they served under the most trying conditions . Rushed into service immediately , as they were , there was little opportunity for the establishment of discipline . The companies had but one white officer each . They were in the country of their mortal enemies , and rations were short , yet they did not loot . They proved very loyal . On two occasions they wanted to kill men whose taking off could hardly have been justified , but their officers restrained them without difficulty . They yielded to the fatigues of that terrible campaign more quickly than did the white troops , however , and as they sickened they were left behind at different towns , thirty or forty in a place . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lack of discipline and attempted to commit abuses , but they were promptly and vigorously punished . General Lawton considered the experiment a pronounced success , and he was in a position to know . It is not my purpose to attempt to describe even in outline Lawton 's last campaign , which , as the Secretary of War has well said , " was the chief factor in the destruction of the insurgent power , and was the crowning achievement of his arduous life . " He conclusively demonstrated the fact that American troops , under such a leader , can operate successfully against native forces in the Philippines in spite of the most trying climatic conditions . Floods of rain and seas of mud were powerless to check his impetuous advance . He kept the enemy so busy running that they had little time to fight . When he could no longer move his transportation , he abandoned it , living off the country , but never forgetting to pay for what he took . Toward the end of the campaign his hungry and warworn soldiers lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any sort , only to rise in the morning and push on again . His presence and example inspired them to deeds of bravery and endurance which will make one of the brightest pages in the history of the American army . His reputation had preceded him , and the common people welcomed him , but the insurgents complained that his troops seemed to rise out of the very ground . In spite of the exhaustion which he must have felt after such arduous duty , he remained in Manila but a day on his return from the north , and then took the field again , riding all night through the rain in order to personally direct the ill-fated operations against San Mateo , arriving before that town in the early morning of December 18th . Always thoughtful of his . officers and men , and forgetful of himself , it is characteristic of him that he should have given up his life while trying to aid another . The fight had hardly opened when Lieutenant P , reckinridge of his staff was severely wounded . The General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers , carried him to a ditch grown full of bushes , which seemed to promise shelter , but it was found that the insurgent fire came directly down it . The General set out to search for a safer place . He had found one , and was returning when met by Captain King . At that instant he raised his hand and brushed his coat over the left breast , uttering a low exclamation . King said , " What is it , General ? " IIe replied , " I am hit . " King asked , " Where , General ? " " Through the lung , " came the answer . Those were his last words . He wavered , made a desperate effort to recover himself , and sank into the arms of King and Fuller . A surgeon was at hand , but in less than a moment from the time he was struck life had flown . So he died , as I know he would have preferred to die , quickly , painlessly , at the post of duty , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are those who say that he was reckless . This is far from the truth . He was too brave a man to expose himself needlessly ; but if he felt that a thing ought to be done , he would do it , no matter how thick the bul-  | lets flew . In order that he might the better perform his whole duty , he took the best possible care of his physical well-being . I know that during his entire stay in the Philippines he never allowed a drop of alcoholic stimulant to pass his lips under any circumstances whatsoever . He did not use tobacco in any form , nor would he touch coffee or tea . It is true that he often exposed himself . He told me that the Zapote River fight was the twenty-seventh occasion on which he had been under hot fire in the Philippines , and he added that he knew his turn would come sooner or later , if the war continued , on the mere law of chances . When he sat on his great horse where the bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because his was that higher courage which can look death in the face without blenching . IIe felt that , with the force at his disposal and the work which he was called upon to do , his personal presence on the firing line was often a necessity . He was unwilling to take the chance of a little delay , cr of a mistake on the part of a subordinate , which might lead to a reverse . The distinctive costume which he always wore in the field was intended to make his presence known to his own men . He believed that when they knew he was with them , sharing their hardships and their dangers , they would never fail him , and he was right . On the night that I bade him good-by , he told me that his one anxious thought was for the devoted wife who had followed him to the Far East to make a home for him , and for the children that gladdened it . His friends take untold comfort in the fact that the only fear which ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banished by the generosity of his countrymen . Who can fittingly sum up , in a few words , the character of such a man ? Simple in all his ways ; true as steel ; a born leader of men ; ever successful , yet modest as a girl ; always seeking to give credit to others and forgetful of self ; loyal to his superiors ; patient under hostile criticism and unjust suspicion ; loved not alone by his comrades and friends , but by the natives with whom he came in contact one can not put it all in words . He was Lawton , and " only a regular . " It is needless to say that his death brought deepest sorrow to his countrymen . But they were not the only ones to mourn his loss . Native women came to mingle their tears with those of the wife and mother who was left desolate . The spokesman who tried to say a few words in behalf of the officials of the towns which he had organized broke down completely and cried like a child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Cemetery , and saw lying on it the wreaths that dusky hands had placed there in far-off Manila , I felt that I had lived to see the first-fruits of the great work which America has undertaken in the Far East ? a work which General Lawton prosecuted with all his boundless energy , ennobled by his example , and consecrated with his life 's blood . Surely it can not be said that he has died in vain .
