A DECADE or two ago somebody thought he had made a wonderful discovery for testing the freshness of eggs . The old method had been to drop them in water . If they sank they were good ; if they bobbed about uncertainly they had better be buried than broken . It was the same test used for witches centuries ago , and almost as decisive . Then the " candling " process came into existence , and it was convincing . The careful housewife may do it herself if she wishes , before she pays her egg bill . Clasp your hand tightly about an egg and hold it against a brilliant light ? electricity , gas , a kerosene lamp , or even the flame of a candle , provided it shines directly through the egg . You may find a full , clear ball , rosy red and clean shelled . That is a perfectly fresh egg . An egg which is eatable and wholesome enough , may have the clearness and rosiness of the first one , but at one end you will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white has gone . An egg a trifle older will have more vacuum and you can see the yolk shift about with the movement of the hand . This may be classed as a cooking egg , fresh after a fashion , only it should be broken carefully , if you wish to separate the yolk from the white . Then one goes down the list , to eggs where the yolk is a dark spot stuck to the shell or where the whole egg is opaque as leather . This is the variety tanners buy for their business at a few cents a dozen . It was found recently that " candling " eggs was a process old in the seventeenth century . There is proof positive in a quaint old painting , Proving Eggs , which hangs to-day in the Dresden gallery . It was painted by Godfried Schalcken , who was born in 1643 and died in 1706 . The buxom Dutch housewife holding an egg against the glow of an ancient oil lamp " candled " her eggs exactly as we do it in 1903 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market every egg is candled and separated into the various lots a housewife knows as western , eastern , northern , local or " strictly fresh laid . " The prices on the row of baskets range from a difference of five to twenty-five cents . The " purely fresh laid " eggs may have been in cold storage five months , the others no longer , only there were conditions in their early care which prevented their keeping so well . HOW EGGS ARE CANDLED The candling process in a cold storage house is done in a dark room , where one spot of electric light glows inside a dark green metal shade with one hole in its side . Against this the egg is laid and an electric ray penetrates its very being . For months during the egg gathering business a force of men stand at these holes of light candling eggs with marvelous rapidity , then sorting them into boxes which an elevator is carrying ceaselessly to a cold storage room . WHERE THEY KEEP FRESH FOR INDEFINITE PERIOD A glimpse into this spacious room is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a wide , whitewashed apartment threaded by a network of pipes which sparkle with frost . The temperature is kept at thirty degrees Fahrenheit  | by a circulation of brine which goes on through the pipes exactly as hot water or steam warms our homes in the winter . The air of the storehouse is sweet and wholesome , for it is immaculately clean . With a lack of cleanliness would follow spoiled eggs . Around the room are tiers upon tiers of wooden boxes . Inside these are packed the eggs , layer upon layer , separated by a thickness of cork shavings , then a tray of strawboard , and more shavings . The insides of these boxes are as clean smelling as the storage room . If an egg should break it would immediately freeze , and frozen leakage has no odor . A glance at the business end of the cold storage egg system is of interest . The busy season for the incoming of eggs begins with February . Then the southern hens are beginning to lay , and from Kentucky , Louisiana and Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kansas , Virginia and the middle states , so in March come further consignments of eggs from these localities . In April all through the east and the far west sounds the cheerful cackle which means an egg , or rather , millions of eggs ; then the egg packer and the cold storage man work night and day . It is no unusual occurrence during the busy season for thirty or forty carloads of eggs tobe sent out by an egg packer in one week . Each car contains four hundred cases of thirty dozens each , in all probably one hundred and forty thousand eggs . These are unpacked as promptly as possible , and quite frequently before the end of the season a thousand carloads , something like one hundred and forty million eggs in all , are in readiness for winter consumption . BIDDY 'S FREE , OUTDOOR LIFE To go west and see whence come the millions of eggs is almost as interesting as a glimpse of the great storage house . The hennery on a great prairie farm is uncaged . Hundreds of fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ground scratching is the best food for eggs . Usually the egg income represents the pin money of the farmer 's wife , so she gives her hens the best of care . Every week her eggs go to the village store to be exchanged for necessities and occasionally for luxuries . By the nearest big egg packer the storekeeper is supplied with empty cases , and each week he ships them full to the great egg house , where they are candled , sorted into " cleans , cracks , rots and dirties , " and packed ready to go into the cold storage . As soon as there are cases enough ready to fill a car it is refrigerated and rushed through as fast as a freight engine will take it . There is double quick work again in getting the eggs from the refrigerator car to cold storage ; a rise in temperature would mean the loss of a good sum of money . June is the latest warm month in which eggs are received in cold storage . All the eggs produced between June and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are saved to tide over the long , chill interval when laying is a rare process . ADVANTAGES OF COLD STORAGE EGGS There is a prejudice against cold storage eggs , although the cold storage people assert , not without a good show of reason , that they are more evenly sound than " fresh laid " eggs . The producer has no facilities for storing them prop- erly ; they have not been " candled , " and it is more than likely that the supply has been saved a week or two for the batch to be consigned to the store . With the untested product , moreover , there conies a certain percentage of eggs which have been gathered from stray nests where the rain beat down and the sun blazed fiercely day after day . RAPIDLY INCREASING CONSUMPTION Once in every five years the consumption of eggs in this country doubles . Before cold storage came into existence , to save in time of plenty against time of famine , the prices of eggs during the winger soared to almost any figure , because the supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority of winter-laying fowls . Then limed eggs were to be bought in small quantities ? only the fastidious eater preferred to eschew them , for they tasted of lime and their roughened shells told of a lime barrel . Cold storage maintains a balance in prices . This fact is easily realized when the egg supply is not equal to the demand , a situation which occurred during 1902 . In February of that year cold storage eggs gave out and prices soared till in the large cities one dollar a dozen was paid for fresh eggs . At the even prices maintained all winter , eggs are not a luxury ; they have grown to be a necessity , even in families where strict econoniy is the rule . THE VAST TRAFFIC IN EGGS The modest egg is yearly becoming a more important factor in the food supply of this continent , and a more expensive one . The estimated production in 901 , according to the highest authority , was 1,472,043,730 dozens of eggs ? too vast a number for the most hospitable imagination to entertain all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants is estimated at 150,000,000 dozen . Therefore , granting that all the available space in the refrigerating houses is filled with eggs during the storage season ( which is not probable ) , ninety per cent of the egg crop of the country is consumed as it is produced . The average increase in egg production for the ten years from 1890 to 1900 is placed at ten per cent yearly . The chances are that the next ten years will show a greater increase . PRICES STEADILY ADVANCING It has been many years since poultry and eggs have averaged so high in price for a twelvemonth as during 1902 , and poultry has not brought so high a price since 1867 . Why ? During July and August , 1901 , there swept over nearly the entire continent ? and especially the great agricultural districts which produce the eggs and poultry ? a sort of simoon , wilting up in two or three days ' township after township of grain and corn . The impoverished farmers thereupon sold off entire herds of cattle , their hogs and sheep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1902 was produced , therefore , from a greatly depleted stock . Then it encountered new misfortune . Of the young birds in 1902 , a considerable percentage died of the prevailing clampness or were drowned in the floods . The cold storage people , anticipating a shortage of eggs , made higher bids than usual , and the price during the storage period last year was accordingly three or four cents higher than usual . To the conditions making for high prices we may add the widespread industrial prosperity , which increases the consumption of eggs , and the high price of meat , which operates in the sane pay . Eggs and poultry are cheaper than meats , prices and food values taken into account . ENTER THE GREAT PACKERS A new and interesting feature of the situation is the recent entrance into the field of three of the great meat packing houses . These firms now own a large number of poultry and egg buying stations in the choice locations of the producing sections and are constantly adding to them . They own their refrigerator cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling eggs and poultry . Through their branch houses in the . great distributing centers , these goods can be placed in the hands of the consuming trade without the payment of any commission for selling . The holding of eggs in cold storage has two effects . The demand for eggs to put in the " coolers " makes prices a little higher from March i to May 20 than would otherwise be the case , and the throwing of the cold storage eggs onto the market in the winter keeps prices down and prevents unreasonable advances , though in times of severely cold weather , blizzards and snow , the markets do sometimes soar . WHERE IS POULTRYLAND ? The state which boasted the greatest number of chickens and of eggs produced , according to the census of 1900 , was Iowa , with Illinois a fairly close second . Texas leads in the number of turkeys , and Kentucky in geese . Iowa , again , is first in ducks . The other great poultry raising states are Indiana , Ohio , Michigan , Kansas and Missouri . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly , during the spring and summer . Eggs can usually be bought at retail for seven to ten cents a dozen . Prices last year were higher than in many years ; perhaps nine to thirteen would cover the range . Five years ago California did not produce enough eggs for home consumption . In the winter , dealers in Chicago and neighboring points found a large and profitable market in this far western country for their cold storage eggs . It 's entirely different now , thanks to ' the labors of men of science . During the spring of 1902 , Chicago dealers purchased entire carloads ( four hundred cases of thirty dozen each ) in California , shipping them each by express , for sale on a very short market . This was an extraordinary proceeding , but shows something of the present situation . Reliable statisticians place the increased production this year over 1902 at from thirty to forty per cent . Eggs can be purchased at retail in California through the most of the year somewhere near fifteen and eighteen cents . Eggs laid between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , in northern latitudes . Sometimes as early as late December or the fore part of January fresh northern eggs come to the great markets ? New York , Boston , Chicago and other cities ? in liberal quantities , but it is not usual for them to come in the largest quantities until late January or February . The south , by the way , is producing a great deal more poultry than it did only a few years ago . Said a St Louis commission merchant to the present writer : " We used to ship quite freely at Christmas , Thanksgiving and New Year 's , turkeys , chickens , ' clucks , geese , etc , to New Orleans , Memphis , Vicksburg , Little Rock , Hot Springs , Galveston , Texas ; Mobile , Alabama , and to many minor points . Now they not only supply their own wants but are free shippers in this direction at certain times . Mississippi , for instance , and west Tennessee , as well as Arkansas , Indian Territory , Oklahoma and northern Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carload . " Then he added : " Eggs are steadily advancing in price every year , as the records will show . "  |
