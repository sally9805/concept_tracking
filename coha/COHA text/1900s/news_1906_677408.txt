txt We strongly urge our readers who have a vote in New York County to be sure to vote against the candidates for the Supreme Court who owe their nomination to the Hearst-Murphy deal . So far as concerns this city , and in great degree the whole State also , the defeat of this deal is quite as important as the defeat of the curious demagogue who bought his own nomination by means of it . There are some good men on the Hearst-Murphy ticket ; two of them are also on the Nominators ' and the Republican ticket ; as to the rest , despite the fair character of one or two of them , they should not be elected ; they represent and embody the very worst methods and aims of corrupt politics . Such politics is bad enough in the Governor 's chair and in the Legislature . It is far worse , more Insidious , demoralizing , and dangerous when its influence extends to the bench . We use the phrase " corrupt politics " advisedly. - There is no milder one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Buffalo Convention was a complete and audacious outrage upon the ground principle of representative party management . Nothing could be more openly defiant of that principle than the throwing out of the honestly and legally chosen delegates . That act tainted with fraud and vitiated the outcome of the Convention . It released every decent voter of the party from all obligation to support the candidate of the convention ; it justified every voter of the party in opposing that candidate . It was a scandalous betrayal of the party 's interest and honor . The price demanded and obtained for this perfidy by Mr. MtJaPErr made it even more despicable and revolting . He took his pay in the support of Mr. HZA.RST and his organization for the judicial candidates of his choice . From his standpoint it was ample pay . It assured to his favorites , if elected , fourteen years upon the bench . It gave him a controlling voice in the bestowal of a million and a half of dollars in salaries for the half-dozen candidates of his selection . It gave him indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in condemnation proceedings , refereeships , and so on , and In the fruits of such patronage which in lax hands are enormous . Above all , It gave him an indefinable but incalculably valuable " pull " with the Judges who should owe their places to him . Never before in our history have so many Judges been chosen at a single election : never has so fat a reward invited the efforts of a greedy boss to Control them : never has a boss resorted to more reprehensible means to accomplish his ends . He should be balked , and every candidate of his should be defeated . happily , the opposition to the Hearst-Murphy deal ticket is practically united . The Nominators and the Republicans have named the same candidates with one exception . It makes no great difference which ticket is voted , but one or the other should receive the sup port of every voter who wants free , independent , honorable , and efficient Judges on the bench of the Supreme Court .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
