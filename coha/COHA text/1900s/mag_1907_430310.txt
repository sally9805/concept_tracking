FOR many years I have wanted to write something about Dr J. H. Kellogg and his work , but I have always been met with an earnest request not to do so , both from Dr Kellogg and his co-workers . It is contrary to their principles , they say ? and I know them to prove by their action the sincerity of their statementsso I have hitherto withheld my pen , even though it was against my judgment as well as my desire . A short time ago , however , when the editor of this magazine asked me to give his readers my impressions of Dr Kellogg , I felt that I must break away from the bonds that had hitherto been imposed upon me . I was not writing for glorification of any object or person , but for the benefit and edification of mankind . I also felt that his many years of public work entitled the world at large to know something of Dr Kellogg 's personality . He is the embodiment of tireless energy , ever at work , and his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of Dr Kellogg . His nature is so intense , so full of concentrated energy , that his work is himself . To me he exemplifies more of the Christ spirit in his life than any other man I know . To have soothed those doomed to a bed of lifelong pain ; to have given new hope to those who were despondent through long continued sickness ; to have restored to health by skill and simple , natural methods those who deemed themselves permanently diseased , and to have done it all for love of kind rather than for money , is surely to walk in the footsteps of him who " went about doing good . " The chief tenets of the Seventh Day Adventists are , the keeping of Saturday as the original Sabbath , the second coming of Christ , and what I would term the religion of the body . Of the two former of these I have nothing to say ; it is to the latter that the existence of the Battle Creek sanitarium is due . In 1866 it was organized as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its management was Dr Kellogg 's father , hence the son , John Harvey , came naturally by his interest in ' the institution . At the request of his father he took up the study of medicine . He was young , full . of the enthusiasm of the divine gift of faith that accomplishes things . He became superintendent of the Health Institute and reorganized it upon its present basis . Little by little it grew and sent out its sons and daughters to teach health to the world and to organize other similar institutions . In February , 1902 , the old building was burned , and in its place has risen the present remarkable structure . I was first brought into close contact with Dr Kellogg some eight years ago . I had just written a book on the social conditions of Chicago 's " submerged tenth . " Dr Kellogg had invited me to come to the sanitarium to rest and recuperate a little , and while there we talked of the evil conditions existent in Chicago and all great cities . As I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes flashed fire and then softened into tears , and at last , in his quick , nervous voice he asked : " Will you tell our people in the tabernacle of these things ? " After I said Yes it was not long before I faced an audience of two or three thousand people . They were interested in the announcement that had been made . Two hours ' earnest talk of conditions as they were aroused these good people to a determination to try to improve them . A fund was raised ; Drs Kellogg and Meloy of the sanitarium came out with me to Chicago ; we looked over the field ; we . saw the dire need ; and ere long a medical mission was established in the heart of one of Chicago 's slum districts , where men and women alike were taught the way to health of body , mind and soul . Into the work of this mission Dr Kellogg threw untiring energy , though of course his chief work was at Battle Creek . Living miles away , he went every Saturday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night or early Monday morning in time for his regular duties . During one of the severe winters he authorized the making of large quantities of soup and the giving of it with a piece of bread to all who applied at a penny a bowl . Dr Kellogg is the embodiment of calm ,  | serene , childlike , unquestioning faith in the direct , intimate , personal helpfulness of God manifested by the Christian world in its earlier centuries , combined with the restless , active , scientific spirit of questioning of the twentieth century . He is a Christian Don Quixote , clothed in the garb of a modern scientist , but living within his own soul the serene , quiet life of the genial philosopher of the sixteenth century . The words of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament are living words to him . He seeks to follow them implicitly , to live the Christ life absolutely . Let inc make clear what I mean , by concrete facts . It was always Dr Kellogg 's habit , in conducting this mission , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal together , where they could confer as to the best methods of carrying on the work more successfully . I shall never forget the story of how the mission got its farm . Let me tell it as nearly as I can as the doctor told it to me : " We knelt down and prayed earnestly that if God approved of our stewardship he would send us in some way a farm to use to his honor in the benefiting of the lives of the poor outcasts of Chicago . I returned to Battle Creek to my work and we all went on with our regular duties . A week went by , another , and a third . The fourth began , but no signs of any answer to our prayer . I felt perfectly at rest about it . I knew if we were found worthy the farm would come . Finally the last day arrived , but no farm or reference to it . I still rested in the Lord and his promises . " In the afternoon a man came in who , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . He was so sure he was going to die he had made his will and distributed a large share of his property . As he came into my office and shook hands he said : Do you remember me , doctor ? ' I said , Yes ! You 're Mr . ' ' Yes ! ' he replied , I am , I 've come in today to see if I ca n't do something for you . You know I was given up almost ' for dead when I came here five years ago , and you brought me back to life . I 've been wonderfully prospered and made another fortune and now I want to do something for you . ' I told him I did n't need anything , but that our mission in Chicago was praying for a farm . A farm ! ' he cried . ' What do you want a farm for ? ' When I told him he said : ' Then that 's what it all means . I was sent here to give you that farm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can have your pick of them . ' " He described these farms to me as well as he could and I made a choice of one , praying all the time that I might be guided aright in my choice , that it might be just what was needed for those poor Chicago fellows . I sent for our lawyer . My friend did not have the deeds , but he described it as well as he could , and the deed of gift was made out and signed before sunset that day ; thus our prayer of the month before was answered . " As I commented upon the wonderful incident , viewed either as a remarkable coincidence , a psychic phenomenon , or a direct answer to prayer , Dr Kellogg broke in : " But I have n't told you all yet about that farm . We entered into possession , but did not have it long before the donor died and the heirs sued us for repossession owing to the fact that the deed was made out to me and that it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois was clear on that point . Neither I nor my lawyer knew anything about that law , and everybody we consulted said the case was sure to go against us . Indeed we were advised by prominent lawyers that we consulted not to contest the suit , and all our people agreed with them . But I had a private season of thought and prayer on the matter . I was fully assured that God had sent that farm to us for those men in answer to prayer , and that , therefore , he wanted us to have it for them . This was a testing of our stewardship . If we would give up the Lord 's gift merely because a rich heir thought he wanted a few more acres we should not be worthy any stewardship , so I finally decided , on my own responsibility , that we would appear in the suit and try to keep the farm . We lost the case , purely on the technical side in the lower courts , as everyone , even our own lawyers , said we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The judge of the supreme court sent for me . He asked me all about the farm . He asked if it was generally known , and if so , how , that the farm was given to me for the benefit of the poor men we saved from the streets of Chicago . I told him that when I announced it at the meeting at our mission I said it belonged to the men ; that all the attendants who came to the mission knew it was for the men ; that the newspapers who had had reporters present had reported that it  | belonged to the men , and that in every way , to everybody , I had made the same statement . He then dismissed me . " Several weeks went by and there was no decision . I had to go to Europe . I went . Several weeks more elapsed . No decision was yet rendered , and I left Europe after my work there was done . without a word as to ally decision . One night , in mid-ocean , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the message : That farm case is decided . It is yours ! ' I noted down the exact time this occurred . When the vessel reached New York and I started down the gang plank I heard a telegraph messenger calling Dr Kellogg ! ' 1 answered . He gave me the yellow evelope . I opened it , and the first thing I saw on landing on American soil was the message : Farm case appeal decided . The judge gives us the farm ! ' Tears of gratitude and thankfulness welled up into my eyes and I walked on praising God for his goodness . " And even as he spoke tears came again and the doctor 's voice choked as he told of the great benefit the farm had been to those for whom it was given . " You see , " said he , in concluding the story , " the law said that a declaration of trust must be made at the time of acknowledging the gift , and the judge exercised his discretion in receiving the declaration made by me in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the requirements of the law . " Incredible though it may seem to many , the sanitarium has been during the nearly forty years of its existence , a philanthropic enterprise . No private pocket has ever been enriched by its operations . The compensation of the physicians and managers does not exceed that paid to ordinary teachers in the public schools . Some of the most important places in the institution are filled by men who for many years have given their whole time to the enterprise without financial compensation of any sort . Dr Kellogg 's part in this philanthropic phase of the work is not small . His salary from the sanitarium is less than a hundred dollars a month , and for many years he has refused to receive one cent for it . Yet in 1903 he personally performed surgical operations that ? independent of those done for the poor for which no charge was made or compensation received ? must have brought in not less than from twenty to twenty-five thousand dollars . Dr Kellogg 's working hours are never less than eighteen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rides a bicycle when the weather is favorable in order to gain needed exercise . He eats but one meal a day , and no more at that than I eat at one of the three meals which I deem suitable for myself . He edits Good Health and writes scientific and other articles for each number ; he is the president of the American Medical Missionary college and professor of clinical surgery and physiologic therapeutics , and therefore has classes before which he gives regular courses of lectures . As a surgeon there are few men in the world who perform as many serious operations as he . He has conducted 165 operations for ovariotomy and all were successful . In all important cases he makes personal examinations and regularly receives reports of their conditions . As an inventor his appliances are known throughout the world . His electric light baths are used everywhere , the physicians of King Edward of England and the Emperor William of Germany recently had them put in for their use . In his surgical work a number of instruments used are of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wide and commanding , sensitive nostrils , mobile mouth partly hidden by silk mustache and beard , skin healthy and clear as a baby 's , standing about medium hight , you have Dr Kellogg before you . He is a perfect bundle of nerves ? active , alert , alive at every moment . The home life of Dr Kellogg is singularly beautiful . Mrs Kellogg is an able and valued worker in lines of reform and is known throughout the world . But they never have been blessed with children of their own . So they have adopted other children . And in doing this they have been singularly " Kelloggian . " These children are not put into a " home " or an asylum , or an institution , but in actual verity ( as far , of course , as other children can become as if they were of one 's own blood ) they become Dr and Mrs Kellogg 's children . They have all the personal care and love of father and mother . The home is theirs ; the family table is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neigborhood of thirty children have been so adopted . At the present time there are fourteen in the family . Several have grown and are married , with happy homes of their own . Most of them were legally adopted ; and to all , whether  | adopted by legal form or not , Dr Kellogg has given his name . Some people have suggested to me that the secret of Dr Kellogg 's good fortune in his adopted children is that his scientific knowledge has enabled him to select only those children " who would turn out well . " Let me answer by telling the true story of one of his children ? one who is as bright , as happy and as good as any of the others . Dr Kellogg was in the Chicago mission one day when a poor , dirty , ragged , tattered little urchin of three or four years strolled in , seeking what he might pick up to eat . He was horribly diseased , having a fearful eruption which covered the whole scalp . " Whose is this child ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At once , with heart and mind alert , the doctor started out to find his parents . With the child clinging to one hand , he went into stores and saloons . At last , in one of the worst dens in the city , where a number of prostitutes were drinking , he found out . " That kid ? He 's Nell's. " replied one of the women . " Where does she live ' ? " When he was informed he went directly to the place , found the mother , who belonged to the lowest of the low , and then the father , who was even worse than the mother . Immediately he made up his mind as to what he wished to do . " Will you give me this boy ' ? " he inquired . " Take the kid along . I 'll be glad to get rid of him , " exclaimed the unnatural mother . A lawyer soon drew up the necessary papers , the court heard the story and in due course bound the child to its new parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a happy , healthy , bright and good member of Dr Kellogg 's family at Battle Creek . Here is a real , living belief in the fatherhood of God . The earthly sources of birth may be polluted , but behind and over them is the one great Source , who is all love , all wisdom , all purity . Of his food inventions , his food factories , the orphan asylum of which he is the president , his literary work , his lectures to the scientific bodies of the country , his assistance to the various sanitariums that are organized throughout the country on the Battle Creek idea , and a score and one other important occupations I have no room here to speak . I do wish , however , to state one fact which , it seems to me , should be known in this age of pelf and greed and amassing of fortunes regardless of method . It can well be seen that the various enterprises in which he is interested , if properly financed , could be made very profitable to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit from his food inventions , his manufactories , his books , his literary work , his lectures , and so he does ! But how is it expended ' ? As I have before shown , his salary from the sanitarium is never taken by him . It goes back to further the work and increase its efficiency . And he receives from all his other industries only enough to pay the current expenses of running his household ? without any surplus for a reserve fund ? the balance being likewise turned into the common fund for the benefit of the work .  |
