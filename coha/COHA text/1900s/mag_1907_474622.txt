IT was noon . In the railway yard a group of yardmen were making up a train . They were pushing cars about , one by one , swinging them around on turn-tables , and ignoring the efforts of a solitary shifting-engine which every now and then would steam busily back and forth with piercing whistles and dazzling puffs of steam . A blue-bloused switchman ran up and down the tracks , throwing levers , blowing sharp blasts upon his horn . Since the train of the early morning there had been no sound within the station . The ticket-windows had been drawn down , the throng of porters had vanished , the platforms had been left deserted . In the waiting-room a group of dusty peasants had lain asleep , stretched out on the benches , their heads pi/lowed on their striped blankets . Long lines A cars had waited motionless on the tracks within the shadow of the shed , or stretched beyond into the yard and the glare of a midday Spanish sun , Two o'clock . It was the hour of departure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch of the train-shed . From my corner in the carriage I could see the platforms filled again with people : passengers hurrying up and down , peering through the open doors of the ears , looking anxiously for seats ; station porters in patched and bagging corduroys , struggling with valises : yelling venders ; pompous railway officials ; civil guards , stiff and straight beneath their triangular leather hats . I watched the train-guard with amusement as he hurried back and forth , unlocking and locking doors , crowding third-class passengers roughly into their seats , ignoring those travelling second , bowing and obsequious to holders of first-class tickets , end gallantly escorting a bevy of senoritas , painted and bepowdered , to the berlina which had been reserved for them . My compartment filled up rapidly . The racks groaned with luggage . VOL . CAV. ? No. 590 ? 115Packages were thrust beneath the seats . The air was soon full of the smoke of cigarettes . In the dim light within the car , the passengers appeared large and vague and indistinct . All at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was followed by a whistle , and leaning out the window , I could see the engine coming slowly down upon the line of crowded cars . It was little and grotesque , sitting low upon the track , with toy wheels , tall lean smoke-stack , and trimmings of shining brass . I thought of the locomotive of America , a mighty mass of iron , huge , black , irresistible . panting beneath the vast dome of the terminal . Here in Spain the engineer looked absurdly big and out of place as he stood beside his levers . As the switchman lifted the coupling-chain the station gong clanged loudly . The last trunk was tossed on beard . Late passengers came rushing up and scrambled into the already crowded carriages . Again the gong ? the slamming of many doors , the click of many locks ; a piping whistle from the guard ; a shriek from the locomotive ; the creak of axles and the hiss of steam ; and the train pulled slowly out into the open . Andalusia , bleak , rugged , barren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jagged against the sky . White towns perched upon the cliffs . Ragged clouds mounting from the west , and through the rifts , glimpses into depths of blue . We were creeping up a winding roadbed between two cactus hedges , the little engine puffing , the cars jolting over the rough joints of the rails . The windows were alive with heads . The passengers were leaning out , blowing whiffs of smoke from their cigarettes . and jesting with the guard as he worked his way along the running-hoard collecting tickets . He was a sallow , narrow-chested man with a ragged coat that blew loosely about him as he climbed in and out of the carriages . was escorted between two civil guards to the office of the Jefe de Estacion to receive the reward of his conscientiousness . The doors of the third-class cars are narrow . I remember at one of the mountain towns how a fat priest kept the train waiting with his efforts to get out . Tie was huge and round , with a red face full of wrinkles , and shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown expanse of cassock . He got wedged tightly in the door and could move neither in nor out . His face grew apoplectic . Perspiration streamed down his forehead . His hat rolled beneath the train . He dropped his bag upon the platform . and as it fell , it burst open . Glass crashed ; cigars were scattered all about . As the bell sounded he began to shout . The guard came running . The station idlers crowded up . They tugged at him , pulling at his hands , his robe , his fat striped legs . Over his shoulder within the car you could sec men pushing from behind . Sinidenly he came through with a rush , his cassock torn and flying . his little eyes wide with fright . I looked hack as the train moved off . He was lying back panting on a bench , his feet spread wide , the crowd standing sympathetically about , while a woman was pouring something down his throat . There is no haste about a Spanish train . It rests comfortably at the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps it lies for hours drawn up on a siding awaiting patiently the passing of other trains long overdue . The engineer deserts his engine and paces up and down the platform rolling cigarettes . The guard flirts with the dark-eyed daughter of the station-master . The soldiers in the third-class carriage get off boisterously , tripping over their swords , and toast each other at the counter with little bumpers of white wine . Buxom water-women , witb hare arms , their dripping jars upon their hips , yell lustily along t h e line of open doors . Beggars reap a harvest at the first-class windows . Their persistent monotone rises above the general clamor . " Perru , perro , senoritor In the rainy seas o n , when for weeks the mountains have la i hidden behind a veil of mist , when streams are swollen and torrents gush across the tracks , the Spanish train creeps warily along a doubtful road-bed . The engineer peers anxiously ahead , his hand firm upon the throttle ; in his box the guard is on the alert . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swirl of yellow water ; or maybe the bank has vanished and the rails hang limply above a rush of foam and mud . If so . the train is stalled . The passengers gaze out hopelessly . There is nothing to be done . They must go back . But if a town be near , the guard may be persuaded to flounder out towards it , and by and by a train of donkeys , spattered and bedraggled , will come plodding up across the flooded fields . The drivers , drenched and dripping , sit sideways on the burros , shouting . whacking them with sticks , digging their heels into their ribs . They splash up to the cars , and the passengers , after loud-tongued bargaining , scramble on behind . The procession of laden donkeys struggles off into the rain . The line of umbrellas bobs and melts into the mist . Beyond the hill the next town lies , and the hope of another train . The sun had set and the air was blowing cold as we pulled up at the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far distant from its town , which could be seen , with its white houses and medieval belfry , rising on the hillside a mile or so away . The road from the station to the town stretched straightand white across the valley . Low in the west , beneath a drifting bank of clouds , the crescent moon was shimmering . The platform was full of people . It looked as though the whole town had turned out to meet the train . The men were dusty from their tramp . Some had their blankets wrapped about them against the chill of the evening air . The women had ridden on the donkeys which were standing huddled together behind the station , with drooping ears and dangling tassels . Over the heads of the people , on the white wall of the station , flared a poster of the coming bull-fight in Madrid . As the train stopped , the crowd made for one of the rear cars . A door opened and a young man stepped down ? a slim young fellow , with features strongly cut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sling . He was greeted with a burst of shouts and cheers ? a t moult of excited Spanish . " Vasquez ! Vasquez ! Viva ! Viva ! Bien venidol Chiquito ! " Men threw themselves upon him regardless of his bandaged arm ; kissing hint , clapping him on the back ecstatically , wringing his uninjured hand . Women hung about his neck , some weeping , some laughing hysterically . Children loitered on the outskirts of the throng , gaping and open-eyed . The train emptied itself on to the platform . The guard , the engineer , and some of the more eager passengers climbed up to the roofs of the cars in order to see better . The cheering swelled louder . Of a sudden the slim young man was swung high upon the shoulders of the crowd and carried slowly down the road towaril the town . His head could be seen rising above a waving mass of outstretched hands , of sombreros , and of flying scarfs . Behind the shouting throng a cloud of dust arose and drifted off into the gathering twilight. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so noisily by a hamlet lying quiet and isolated among the Andalusian hills . I turned inquiringly to the traveller at my left  --  dark-skinned Spaniard who had been deep in the pages of the latest number of the Fiesta Nacional . He looked at me with mild astonishment . " That , senor , " he said , " was Chiquito do Gonzales , the espada who was hurt in the corrida last Sunday . Amargos is his birthplace . He is one of our best fighters , but he was a bit slow last week , so he has come home to get over the effects of the bull . " The bell jangled ; the passengers resumed their seats . The line of doors slammed to , and with a shriek from the toy engine the train resumed its journey . Ten o'clock . The train for once was running swiftly , plunging through an impenetrable blackness . No signals winked ahead ; there were no lights , save now and then , at a cross-road as we rushed by , a woman could be seen standing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a twinkle from all approaching town . Within the ear the lamp in the roof flickered dimly . It threw a wavering light about the compartment . Shadows leaped over the floor and ceiling . In one corner sat two officers of the royal guard who had come in at the last station . They talked in gutturals , shrugging their narrow shoulders and spreading out their palms , and as they gesticulated the glowing ends of their cigarettes described fantastic circles . The feeble yellow rays of the lamp fell upon their high cheek - bones , gleamed upon their buttons , and ran along the polished steel of their scabbards . I dozed within my corner , watching them drowsily through half-closed eyes . Every little while would come a whistle and the jar of brakes and the train would stop abruptly . Through the window I would see a station lamp throwing black radiating shadows , the guard going busily to and fro with his bell , a crowd of midnight idlers on the platform , and would hear the jabbering of Spanish . Then the ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more . I must have fallen asleep . A cold wind blew upon me , and I opened my eyes . The car was empty . At the open dour a crowd of porters were looking at me euriously . I heard the lapping of water and smelled the salt air of the sea . It was Algeciras . Gibraltar glimmered across the bay . My journey was over .
