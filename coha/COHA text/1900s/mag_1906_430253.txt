EDUCATED women find themselves driven to live on less than servant 's wage , and farsighted , more fortunate ones live as closely as possible to provide for days ahead . So the hallrooms are never without their clientele , from the girl , tired of her comfortable country home , who brings her suit case instead of trunk , hangs up her Japanese gown , her silk petticoat and her other frock in the closet , spreads her silver toilet set on the bureau , tacks up her photographs and takes her meals out . At the other end of the hall is the woman with graying hair who teaches by the hour , and does secrecy 's work , does up fine laces , sells old furniture on commission , renovates gowns , writes for the magazines , embroiders shirt waists ? what does she not do as the chance conies , glad if she can count on five dollars a week through the ear : The rent , in modest streets in Boston , is $1.25 and $1.50 for the seven by ten " side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-story houses , where the lime trees and the horse-chestnuts bloom and screen the dormer window front and the backroom looks perhaps into a bit of garden in the rear , with a pear tree and an old grapevine . Or perhaps not , as the Carlyles used to say with vigor . What unspeakable dreariness mould it lift from many lives if people only made their back yards pleasant ! One who lives in lodgings learns of varieties of housekeeping on the same floor , from the detestable folk who fry bacon over the gas and make raw onion salads in the bedrooms , to the nice girls who cook wheat germ and make toast and coffee under the rose , one may say , without annoyance to their neighbors . As cozy and practical an arrangement as I can recall is that of a business woman , compelled to make the most of five dollars a week after a lifetime of liberal things . She protested against the dust and fluff of carpets , and the floor was stained light oak-brown , with shellac finish . Neither folding-bed nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was precious and her own wooden divan was just large enough , and a foot of room to spare . Under the divan , instead of a dress-box , a bag of denim was lashed with twine to the frame , wood strips holding the corners out , and this was dustproof storage for gowns , wraps and the odds and ends needed where the seasons overlap , as in this climate . Bags of lavender , cedar chips and sandalwood sawdust strewn to keep out moths yield a blended odor of potpourri , the cloth lid and flap tie closely , and the big couch cover tells no tales of the pockets hidden at the foot where duster and floor cloth , washed and dried after each using , hang beside dustpan and brush , out of sight . The whole ways cheap enough with cotton mattress four inches thick , big cushion stuffed with excelsior and a feather pillow with cretonne cover tied on by day . Head and foot rails can be unslipped or turned down in daytime , as it is hard to keep pillows and bedclothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is figured denim , bought for fifty cents at a rummage sale , and holds neither dust nor smells . The same denim curtains the closet recess , which is boarded overhead to make a high shelf above the hangers , where bandbox and shirt waist box are stored , and a frilled denim from the ceiling keeps off dust . The dressing case goes between the head of the divan and the window . Rather high over the divan are bracket shelves for books ? the brackets cost five cents a set and the shelves are the thin boards on which merchants fold cloths ? with a green leatherette fall over the front edge . A small bracket at one end holds a pretty tencent iron candlestick and wax candle , at the other end a Japanese hanging vase holds a growing vine , rooted in moss . For domestic arrangements , a packing box , twelve by fifteen inches , a yard long , stands on end in , the corner by the window opposite the bureau . Covered with dark green figured cretonne , with a door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cambric inside , it makes a very pretty stand . Inside are shelves covered with laceedged paper , where stand two cups and saucers , small enameled white plates , and  | bowls , sugar , pickles in a glass can with screw top , with spoons , knives and forks , all stored in a very clean grape basket of the smaller size , convenient for setting table . A tin cakebox on the lower shelf holds everything that could tempt mice . A cretonne frilled box , which is the only seat beside the small rocker , holds gas tubing and burner , the tubing carefully folded in a thick paper bag , not to be smelly , also the enameled cooking things , none of which cost over ten cents apiece . The vegetable knife , corkscrew , can opener , etc , are kept in loops of tape inside the lid , readily seen when it is lifted . A large board , in cretonne case , is leaned on edge against the wall . For tea , the cupboard box is drawn out. , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hooks and staples underneath . Its cover of gray linen with two-inch hemstitched border is copied from the fine gray napery of the Laboratory kitchen lunch rooms . The feature of the room is the pocket border of deep green twill against the wall at the Night of a chair rail , on which are green and bronze pockets and bags of various sizes ; as there is not room to lay things down , they must be hung up , as in the cabins of an ocean steamer . The sides of the bureau are also given up to pockets , for brush and comb and toilet things in the upper row , the lower for slippers and rubbers , concealed by flaps of the material , buttoned down . A broad hinged shelf lies against the wall when not in use , but when its front legs are slipped in their sockets it is a writing table . Higher on the wall is a tiny cabinet , made of a wooden candy box lined with bronze green mercerized cotton and covered with small figured stuff the same shading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , a square of window glass bound with velvet makes the door , and here the ink and mucilage rest safely with half a dozen choice souvenirs , away from dust . Dust , however , is nearly unknown , the polished floor being wiped daily with a damp cloth , which is at once washed , dried and tucked in its own pocket . The length of heavy ingrain which forms the rug is rubbed off with the cloth wrung dry . In the window may be seen a fernball drooping lacy fronds , and pots of lemon verbena and apple-scented salvia , presents from friends who know what to give . If we stay to tea , the jardiniere outside the window gives up its pots of cream and butter kept cool in wet sponge . Everything is wiped with soft paper afterward , so the dish washing is no horror . Ice ? ? yes , frozen distilled water by the five cents ' worth in a stone pot with its wadded cover kept in the wind . No comfort is wanting , and there is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were not all bought at once .. The housekeeping began with a cup , a plate , an old knife and fork , one tin saucepan for coffee and a five-inch fryingpan . Ten cents a week was devoted to buying ' things at first , later the allowance rose to twenty-five cents , Much taste and contrivance went to the furnishing for over a year to bring it to its present state , and nice care keeps its dainty condition .  |
