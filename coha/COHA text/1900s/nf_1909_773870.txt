The attitude of impatient incredulity toward the stories of our patients , typified by the story of that great surgeon , but greater bear , Dr. John Abernethy , has passed , never to return . When a lady of rank came into his consulting-room , and , having drawn off her wraps and comfortably settled herself in her chair , launched out into a luxurious recital of symptoms , including most of her family history and adventures , he , after listening about ten minutes pulled out his watch and looked at it . The lady naturally stopped , openmouthed . " Madam , how long do you think it will take you to complete the recital of your symptoms ? " " Oh , well , " ? the lady floundered , embarrassed , ?

In only one class of patients is this valuable aid to knowledge absent , and that is in very young children ; and yet , by what may at first sight seem like a paradox , they are , of all others , the easiest in whom to make not merely a provisional , but a final , diagnosis . They can not yet talk with their tongues and their lips , but they speak a living language in every line , every curve , every tint of their tiny , translucent bodies , from their little pink toes to the soft spot on the top of their downy heads . Not only have they all the muscle-signs about the face-dial , of pain or of comfort , but , also , these are absolutely uncomplicated by any cross-currents of what their elders are pleased to term " thought .

In addition , not only will he turn pale or flush , and his little muscles contract or relax , but so elastic are the tissues of his surface , and so abundant the mesh of blood-vessels just underneath , that , under the stroke of serious illness , he will literally shrivel like a green leaf picked from its stem , or wilt like a faded flower .

Nothing could be further from the truth than the prevailing impression that , because babies ca n't talk , it is impossible , especially for a young doctor , to find out what is the matter with them . If they ca n't talk , neither can they tell lies , and when they yell " Pin ! " they mean pin and nothing else . In fact , the popular impression of the puzzled discomfiture of the doctor before a very small , ailing baby is about as rational as the attitude of a good Quaker lady in a little Western country town , who had induced her husband to subscribe liberally toward the expenses of a certain missionary on the West Coast of Africa . On his return , the missionary brought her as a mark of his gratitude a young half-grown parrot , of one of the good talking breeds . The good lady , though delighted , was considerably puzzled with the gift , and explained to a friend of mine that she really did n't know what to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to talk and tell her what it wanted ! CIIAPTER IV COLDS AND HOW TO CATCH THEM ANCIENT vibrations are hard to stop , and still harder to control . Whether they date from our driving back by the polar ice-sheet , together with our titanic Big Game , the woolly rhinoceros , the mammoth , and the sabre-toothed tiger , from our huntinggrounds in Siberia and Norway , or from recollections of hunting parties pushing north from our tropical birth-lands , and getting trapped and stormbound by the advance of the strange giant , Winter , certain it is that our subconsciousness is , full of ancestral memories which send a shiver through our very marrow at the mere mention of " cold " or " sleet " or " wintry blasts . " From the earliest dawn of legend cold has always been ranked , with hunger and pestilence and storm , as one of the demons to be dreaded and fought . And , at a little later date , the ancient songs and sayings of every people have been full of quaint warnings against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or damp sheets . There is , of course , a bitterly substantial basis for this feeling , as the dozens of stiffened forms whose only winding-sheet was the curling snowdrift , or whose coffin the frozen sleet , bear ghastly witness . It was , however , long ago discovered that when we were properly fed and clothed , the Cold Demon could be // absolutely defied , even in a tiny hut made out of pressed snow and warmed by a smoky seal-blubber lamp ; that the Storm King could be baffled just by burrow-ing into his own snowdrifts and curling up under the crust , like an Eskimo dog . Hence , nearly all the legends depict the hero as finally conquering the Storm King , like Shingebis in the Song of Hiawatha . The ancient terror , however , still clings , with a hold the more tenacious as it becomes narrowed , to one large group of these calamities believed to be produced by cold , ? namely , those diseases supposed to be caused by exposure to the weather . Even here , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general trend of opinion among thoughtful physicians is that this basis is much narrower than was at one time supposed , and is becoming still more restricted with the progress of scientific knowledge . For instance , fifty years ago , popular opinion , and even the majority of medical belief , was that consumption and all of its attendant miseries were chiefly due to exposure to cold . Now we know that , on the contrary , abundance of pure , fresh , cold air is the best cure for the disease , and foul air and overcrowding its chief cause . An almost equally complete about-face has been executed in regard to pneumonia . Prolonged and excessive exposure to cold may be the match that fires the mine , but we are absolutely certain that two other things are necessary , namely , the presence of the diplococcus , and a lowered and somewhat vitiated state of bodily resistance , due to age , overwork , underfeeding , or over-indulgence in alcohol . // Not only do these two diseases not occur in the land of perpetual cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized visitors , ? and scarce a single death from pneumonia has ever yet occurred in the crew of an Arctic expedition , ? but it has actually been proposed to fit up a ship for a summer trip through the Arctic regions , as a floating sanatorium for consumptives , on account of the purity of the air and the brilliancy of the sunlight . There is one realm , however , where the swing of this ancient superstition vibrates with fullest intensity , and that is in those diseases which , as their name implies , are still believed to be due to exposure to a lowered temperature ? " common colds . " Here again it has a certain amount of rational basis , but this is growing less and less every day . The present attitude of thoughtful physicians may be graphically indicated by the flippant inquiry of the riddle-maker , " When is a cold not a cold ? " and the answer , " Two-thirds of the t:im e . " This much we are certain of already : that the majority of so-called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a low temperature , that they are entirely misnamed , and that a better term for them would be fouls . In fact , this proportion can be clearly and definitely proved and traced as infections spreading from one victim to another . The best place to catch them is not out-of-doors , or even in drafty hallways , but in close , stuffy , infected hotel bedrooms , sleeping cars , churches , and theatres . Two arguments in rebuttal will at once be brought forward , both apparently conclusive . One is that colds // are vastly more frequent in winter , and the other that when you sit in a draft until you feel chilly , you inevitably have a cold afterward . Both these arguments alike , however , are based upon a misunderstanding . The frequency of colds in winter is chiefly due to the fait that , at this time of the year , we crowd into houses and rooms , shutting the doors and windows in order to keep warm , and thus provide a ready-made hothouse for the cultivation and transmission from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliant young English pulmonary expert , Dr. Leonard VVil liams , puts it , " a constant succession of colds implies a mode of life in which all aerial microbes are afforded abundant opportunities . " At the same time , we take less exercise and sit far less in the open air , thus lowering our general vigor and resisting power and making us more susceptible to attack . Those who live out-of-doors winter and summer , and who ventilate their houses properly , even in cold weather , suffer comparatively little more from colds in the winter-time than they do in summer ; although , of course , the most vigorous individual , in the best ventilated surroundings , will occasionally succumb to some particularly virulent infection . The second fact of experience , catching cold after sitting in a draft or a chilly room until you begin to cough or sneeze , is one to which a majority of us would be willing to testify personally , and yet it is based upon something little better than an illusion . It is a well-known peculiarity of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient complains // of shiverings up and down his spine , his finger-nails and his lips become blue , in extreme cases his teeth chatter , and his limbs begin to twitch and shake , and he ends up in a typical ague fit . The best known , because most striking , illustration is malaria , or fever and ague , " chills and fever , " as it is variously termed . But this form of attack , milder and much slighter in degree , may occur in almost every known infection , such as pneumonia , typhoid , tuberculosis , scarlet fever , measles , and influenza . It has nothing whatever to do with either external or internal temperature ; for if you slip a fever-thermometer under your chilling patient 's tongue , it will usually register anywhere from 102 to 105 ? . This method of attack is especially common , not only in influenza , but also in all the other so-called " common colds . " In fact , when we begin to shiver and sneeze and hunt around for an imaginary draft or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are actually in the first stage of the development of an infection which was contracted hours , or even days , before . When you begin to shiver and sneeze and run at the eyes you are not " catching " cold ; you have already caught it long before , and it is beginning to break out on you . Mere exposure to cold will never cause sneezing . It takes a definite irritation of the nasal mucous membrane , by gas or dust from without , or toxins from within , to produce a sneeze . As to mere exposure to cold weather and wet and storm being able to produce it , it is the almost unani88 PREVENTABLE DISEASES mous testimony of Arctic explorers that , during their sojourn of from two to three years in the frozen North , they never had so much as a sneeze or a sore throat , even though frequently sheltered in extemporized huts , and running short of adequate food-supply before spring . Within a week of their return to civilization they would begin sneezing and coughing , and catch furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alaska give similar testimony . I have talked with scores of these pioneers , visiting them , in fact , in their camps under conditions of wet , cold , and exposure that would have made one afraid of either pneumonia or rheumatism before morning , and found that , so long as they remained up in the mountains or out in the snow , and no case of influenza , sore throat , or cold happened to be brought into the camp , they would be entirely free from coughs and colds ; but that , upon returning to civilization and sleeping in the stuffy room of a rude frontier hotel , they would frequently catch cold within three days . One unusually intelligent foreman of a lumber camp in Oregon told me that an experience of this kind had occurred to him three different times that he could distinctly recollect . It is difficult to catch a cold or pneumonia unless the bacilli are there to be caught . Boswell has embalmed for us , in the amber of his matchless biography , the fact that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of one of the Faroe Islands never had colds in the head except on the rare occasions when // a ship would touch there ? usually not oftener than once a year . Then , within a week , half the population would be blowing and sneezing . The great Samuel commented upon the fact at length , and advanced the ingenious explanation that , as the harbor was so difficult of entry , the ships could beat in only when the wind was in a certain quarter , and that quarter was the nor'east . Hine illae lacrim ( c l ( Hence these weeps ! ) The colds were caused by the northeast wind of unsavory reputation ! How often the wind got into the northeast without bringing a ship or colds he apparently did not speculate . To come nearer yet , did you ever catch cold when camping out ? I have waked in the morning with the snow drifting across the back of my neck , been wet to the skin all day , and gone to bed in my wet clothes , and slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a November gale , in a hollow scooped in the half-frozen ground of the duck-marsh , and felt never a hair the worse . Scores of similar experiences will rise up in the minds of every camper , hunter , or fisherman . You may catch cold during the first day or two out , before you have got the foul city air , with its ( lust and bacteria , out of your lungs and throat , but even this rarely happens . How seldom one catches cold from swimming , no matter how cold the water ; or from boating , or fishing , ? even without the standard prophylactic ; or from picnicking , or anything that is done during a day in the open air . So much for the negative side of the evidence , that // colds are not often caught where infectious materials are absent . Now for the positive side . First of all , that typical cold of colds , influenza , or the grip , is now unanimously admitted by authorities to be a pure infection , due to a definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most contagious diseases known . Each of the great epidemics of it ? 1830 ? 33 , 1836 ? 37 , 1847 ? 48 , and , of most vivid and unblessed memory , 1889 ? 90 ? can be traced in its stately march completely across the civilized world , beginning , as do nearly all our world-epidemics , ? cholera , plague , influenza , etc. , ? in China , and spreading , via India or Turkestan , to Russia , Berlin , London , New York , Chicago . Moreover , its rate of progress is precisely that of the means of travel : camel-train , post-chaise , railway , as the case may be . The earlier epidemics took two years to spread from Eastern Russia to New York ; the later ones , forty to sixty days . Soon it will beat Jules Verne or George Francis Train . So intensely " catching " is it , that letters written by sufferers have been known to infect the correspondents who received them in a distant town , and become the starting-point of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when we have proved the grip to be a definite infection , we have taken it out of the class of " colds " altogether , and that its bacterial origin proves nothing in regard to the rest . Bnt a rather interesting state of affairs developed during the search for the true bacillus of influenza : this was that a dozen other bacilli and cocci were discovered , each of which seemed capable of causing all the // symptoms of the grip , though in milder form . So that the view of the majority of pathologists now is that these " influenzoid , " or " grip-like " attacks , under which come a majority of all common colds , are probably due to a number of different milder microorganisms . The next fact in favor of the infectious character of a cold is that it begins with a drill , followed with a fever , runs a definite self-limited course , and , barring complications , gets well of itself in a certain time , just like the measles , scarlet fever , pneumonia , or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or toxic attacks in other organs of the body , lungs , stomach , bowels , heart , kidneys , nerves , etc. , just like diphtheria , scarlet fever , or typhoid , only , of course , of milder form and less frequently . Last , but not least practically convincing , colds may be traced from one victim to another , may " run through " households , schools , factories , may occur after attending church or theatre , may be checked by isolating the sufferers ; and are now most effectually treated by the inhalation of non-poisonous germicidal or antiseptic vapors and sprays . One of my first experiences with this last method occurred in a most unexpected field . An old friend , a most interesting and intelligent German , was the proprietor of a wild-animal depot , importing foreign animals and birds and selling them to the zoological gardens and circuses . I used often to drop in there to see if he had anything new , and he would come up // to see me , to tell me his troubles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds . One day he came up in a state of great excitement , with a very dead and dilapidated parrot in his hand . " Choost look , Dogdor ; here 's one of dose measley new pollies I god in from Zingapore . De rest iss coffin ' an ' sneezin ' to plow dere peaks off , an ' all de utter caitches iss kitchen him . " As parrots are worth from fifteen to thirty dollars apiece , " green " ( not in color , but training ) , and he had fifty or sixty in the store , the situation was distinctly serious . Now , I was no specialist in the peculiar diseases of parrots , but something had to be done , and , with a boldness born of long practice , I drew my bow at a venture and let fly this suggestion : ? " Try formalin ; it ' s pretty fierce on the eyes and nose , but it wo n't kill ' em ; and , if you put a teaspoonful in the bottom of each cage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cage will live long enough to do any harm . " Five days later back he came , red-eyed but triumphant . " Dogdor , dot vormaleen iss de pest shtuff I effer saw . It mos ' shteenk me out of de shtore , an ' de pollies nearly sneeze dere fedders off , but it shtopt de spret , an ' it 's cureenall de seek ones , an ' I het a cold in de het , an ' it ' s curt me . " Before using it he had fourteen cases and three deaths ; after , only three new cases and no more deaths . I would , however , hardly advise any human " coldic " to try such heroic treatment offhand , for the pungency // and painfulness of formalin vapor is something ferocious , though the French physicians , with characteristic courage , are making extensive use of it for this purpose , with excellent results under careful supervision . Another curious straw pointing in the direction of the infectious nature of colds is the " annual cold , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us suffer . When we have had it we usually feel fairly safe from colds for some months at least , often for a year . The only explanation that seems in the least to explain is that colds , like other infections , confer an immunity against another attack ; only , unlike scarlet fever , measles , smallpox , etc. , this immunity , instead of for life , is only for six months or a year . This immunity is due to the formation in the blood of protective substances known as anti-bodies , which destroy or render harmless the invading germs . Flabby , under-ventilated individuals , who are always " catching cold , " have such weak resisting powers that they form hardly enough anti-bodies to terminate the first attack , without having enough left to protect them from another for more than a few weeks or months . llr . Leonard Williams describes chronic cold-catchers as " people who wear flannel next their skins , . . . who know they are in a draft because it makes them sneeze ; who , in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vigorous individuals may form enough to last them a year , or even two years . Now comes the question , " What are we going to do about it ? " Obviously , we can not " go gunning " for // these countless billions of germs , of fifteen or twenty different species . Nor can we quarantine every one who has a cold . Fortunately , no such radical methods are necessary . All we have to do is to take nature 's hint of the anti-bodies and improve upon it . Healthy cells can grow fat on a diet of such germs , and , if we keep ourselves vigorous , clean , and well ventilated , we can practically defy the " cold " devil and all his works . Here is the leitmotif of the whole fascinating drama of infection and immunity . We can study only one phrasing here . We shall , of course , catch cold occasionally , but will throw it off quickly , and probably form anti-bodies enough to last us a year or more . How can this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping as much as possible in the open air . This helps in several different ways . First , by increasing the vigor and resisting power of our bodies ; second , by helping to burn up , clean , and rid our tissues of waste products which are poisons if retained ; third , by greatly reducing the risks of infection . You ca n't catch cold by sitting in a field exposed to the draft from an open gate ; though I understand that casuists of the old school of the " chill-and-damp " theory of colds are still discussing the case of the patient who " caught his death o ' cold " by having his gruel served in a damp basin . The first thing to do is to get the outdoor habit . This takes time to acquire , but , once formed , you would n't exchange it for anything else on earth . The next thing is to learn to sit or sleep in a gentle current of air all the time you are indoors . You ought to feel uncomfortable // unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then you are reasonably sure it is fresh , and it is the only way to be sure of it . But drafts are so dangerous ! As the old rhyme runs , But when a draft blows through a hole , Make your will and ixiend your soul . Pure superstition ! It just shows what ' s in a name . Call it a gentle breeze , or a current of fresh air , and no one is afraid of it . Call it a " draft , " and up go hands and eyebrows in horror at once . One of our highest authorities on diseases of the lungs , I ) r . Norman Bridge , has well dubbed it " The Draft Fetich . " It is a fetich , and as murderous as Moloch . The draft is a friend instead of an enemy . What converted most of us to a belief in the beneficence of drafts was the open-air treatment of consumption ! Hardly could there have been a more spectacular proof , a more dramatic defiance of the bogey . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hectic one hour and a drenching sweat the next , lie out exposed to the November weather all day and sleep in a ten-knot gale at night ! It looked little short of murder ! So much so to some of us , that we decided to test it on ourselves before risking our patients . I can still vividly recall the astonishment with which I woke one frosty December morning , after sleeping all night in a breeze across my head that literally made Each particular hair to stand on end , Like quills upon the fretful porcupine , not only without the sign of a sniffle , but feeling as if I 'd been made new while I slept . // Then we tried it in fear and trembling on our pa-tients , and the delight of seeing the magic it worked ! That , is an old story now , but it has never lost its charm . To see the cough which has defied " dopes " and syrups and cough mixtures , domestic , patent , and professional , for months , subside and disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry up within a week ; the appe-tite come back ; the fever fall ; the strength and color return , as from the magic kiss of the free air of the woods , the prairies , the seacoast . There 's nothing else quite like it on the green earth . Do you wonder that we become " fresh-air fiends " ? The only thing we dread in these camps is the im-ported " cold . " Dr. Lawrence Flick was the first to show us the way in this respect as in several others . He put up a big sign at the entrance of White Haven Sana-torium , " No persons suffering from colds allowed to enter , " and traced the only epidemic of colds in the sanatorium to the visit of a butcher with the grip . I put up a similar sign at the gate of my Oregon camp , and never had a patient catch cold from tenting out in the snow and " Oregon mists " until the small son of the cook came back from the village school , shivering and sneezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " within a week . What will cure a consumptive will surely not kill a healthy man . I am delighted to say that it shows signs of becoming a fad now , and sleeping porches are being put on houses all over the country . No house in Cali-fornia is considered complete without them . The ideal bedroom is a small dressing-room , opening on // a wide screened porch , or balcony , with a door wide enough to allow the bed to be rolled inside during storms or in severest weather . Sleep on a porch , or in a room with windows on two sides wide open , and the average living-room or office begins to feel stuffy and " smothery " at once . Apply the same treatment here . Learn to sit in a gentle draft , and you ' 11 avoid two-thirds of your colds and threefourths of your headaches . It may be necessary in winter to warm the draft , but do n't let any patent method of ventilation delude you into keeping your windows shut any hour of the day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the widespread delusion that because air is cold it is necessarily pure . Some of the vilest air imaginable is that shut up in those sepulchres known as " best bedrooms , " which chill your very marrow . The rheumatism or snuffles you get from sleeping between their icy sheets comes from the crop of bacilli which has lurked there since they were last aired . The " no heat in a bedroom " dogma is little better than superstition , born of those fecund parents which mate so often , stinginess and puritanism . Practically , the room which will never have a window opened in it in winter is the one without any heat . Similarly , the air in an underheated church , hall , or theatre is almost sure to be foul . The janitor will keep every opening closed in order to get the temperature up . Some churches are never once decently ventilated from December to May . The same old air , with an ever richer crop of germs , is reheated and served up again every Sunday . The " odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perspiration of successive generations . Cleanliness may be next to godliness , but it is sometimes in astonishingly long step behind it . 7'he next important step is to keep clean , both externally and internally : externally , by cold bathing , internally , by exercise . The only reason why a draft ever hurts us is because we are full of self-poisons , or germs . The self-poisons can be best got rid of by abundant exercise in the open air and plenty of pure , cold I1.0 , internally and externally . Food has very little to do with these autotoxins , and they are as likely to form on one diet as another . In fact , they form normally and in states of perfect health , and are poisonous only if retained too long . It is simply a question of burning them up , and getting rid of them quickly enough , by exercise , with its attendant deep breathing and perspiration . The lungs are great garbage-burners . Exercise every day till you puff and sweat . A blast of cold air suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws them on the lungs , liver , or kidneys . The resulting disturbance is the second commonest form of a " cold , " and covers perhaps a third of all cases occurring . This is the cold that can be prevented by the cold bath . Keep the skin hardened and toned up to such a pitch that no reasonable chill will stop it from excreting , and you are safe . Never depend on clothing . The more you pile on , the more you choke and " flabbify " the skin and make it ready to " strike " on the first breath of cold air . Too heavy flannels are cold-breeders , and chest-protectors invenCOLDS // tions of the evil one . Trust the skin ; it is one of the most important and toughest organs in the body , if only given half a chance . But the most frequent way in which drafts precipitate a cold is by temporarily lowering the vital resistance . This gives the swarms of germs present almost constantly in our noses , throats , stomachs , bowels , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break through the cell barrier and run riot in the body . So long as the pavement-cells of our - raucous membranes are healthy , they can keep them out indefinitely . Lower their tone by cold , fatigue , underfeeding , and their line is pierced in a dozen places at once . One of the many horrifying things which bacteriology has revealed is that our bodies are simply alive with germs , even in perfect health . One enthusiastic dentist has discovered and described no less than thirty-three distinct species , each one numbering its billions , which inhabit our gums and teeth . Our noses , our stomachs , our intestines , ? each boasts a similar population . Most of them do no harm at all ; indeed , some probably assist in the processes of digestion ; others are camp-followers , living on our leavings ; others , captive enemies which have been clubbed into peaceful behavior by our leucocyte and anti-body police . For instance , not a few healthy noses and throats contain the bacillus of diphtheria and the diplococcus of pneumonia . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching . Like camp-followers elsewhere , they carry knives , and , are not above using them on the wounded after dark . In fact , they have a l s // cheerful habit of taking a hand in any disturbance that starts in their bailiwick , and usually on the side against the body-cells . Finally , while clearly realizing that the best defense is attack , and that our chief reliance should be upon keeping ourselves in such fighting trim that we can " eat ' em alive " at any time , there is no sense in running easily avoidable risks , and we should keep away from infection as far as possible . If a child comes to school heavy-eyed , hoarse , and snuffling , the teacher should send him home at once . He will only waste his time attempting to study in that trim , and may infect a score of others . Moreover , it may be remarked , parenthetically , that these are also symptoms of the beginning of measles , scarlet fever , and diphtheria , and two-thirds of all cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one else if this procedure were the rule . If your own child develops a cold , if mild , keep him playing out-of-doors by himself ; or if severe , keep him in bed , in a well-ventilated room , for three or four days . He ' 11 get better twice as quick as if at school , and the , rest of the household will escape . When you wake with a stuffed head and aching bones , stay at home for a few days if possible , out of regard for your customers , your fellow-clerks , or your office force , as well as yourself . If one of your employees comes to work shivering , give him three days ' vacation on full pay . If it runs through the force , you 'll lose five times as much in enforced sick-leaves , slowness , and mistakes . Above all , do n't go to any public // gatherings , ? to church , the theatre , or parties , ? when you are snuffling and coughing . You are not exactly a joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . It is advisable , and well worth the trifling trouble . and expense , to fumigate thoroughly with formalin all . churches , theatres , and schoolrooms at least once a month . Reasonable and public-spirited precautions of this sort are advisable , not only to avoid colds themselves , which are disagreeable and dangerous enough , but because mild infections of this sort are far the commonest single means of making a breach in our bodyramparts through which more serious diseases like consumption , pneumonia , and rheumatism may force an entry . Colds do not " run into " consumption or pneumonia , but they bear much the same relation to them that good intentions are said to do to the infernal regions . They release the lid of a perfect Pandora 's box of distempers ? tuberculosis , pneumonia , rheumatism , bronchitis , Bright 's disease , neuritis , endocarditis . A cold is no longer a joke .

Intelligently regarded and handled , they are the least harmful of diseases ; neglected , one of the most dangerous , because there are such legions of them . To sum up , if you wish to revel in colds , all that is necessary is to observe the following few and simple rules : ? Keep your+windows shut . // Avoid drafts as if they were a pestilence . Take no exercise between meals . Bathe seldom , and in warm water . Wear heavy flannels , chest-protectors , abdominal bandages , and electric insoles . Have no heat in your bedroom . Never let anything keep you away from church , the theatre , or parties , in winter . Never go out-of-doors when it ' s windy , or rainy , or wet underfoot , or cold , or hot , or looks as if it was going to be any of these . Be just as intimate and affectionate as possible with every one you know who has a cold . Do n't neglect them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEIR CAUSE AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES IN all ages it has been accounted a virtue to keep your mouth shut ? chiefly , of course , upon moral or prudential grounds , for fear of what might issue from it if opened .

Oddly enough , in this instance , both morality and science have been beside the mark to the degree that they have been mistaking a symptom for a cause . This has led us to absurd and injurious extremes in both cases . On the moral and prudential side it has led to such outrageous exaggerations as the well-known and oft-quoted proverb , " Speech is silver , but silence is golden . " Articulate speech , the chiefest triumph and highest single accomplishment of the human species , the handmaid of thought and the instrument of progress , is actually rated below silence , the attribute of the clod and of the dumb brute , the easy refuge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is informing , educative , helpful in some modest degree ; while fully that proportion of silence is due to lack of ideas , cowardice , or designs that can flourish only in darkness . It is not the abundance of words , but the scarcity of ideas , // that makes us flee from " the plugless word-spout " and avoid the chatterbox . Similarly , upon the physical side , because children who breathe through the mouth are apt to have a vacant expression , to be stupid and inattentive , undersized , pigeon-breasted , with short upper lip and crowded teeth , we have leaped to the conclusion that it is a fearsome and dangerous thing to breathe through your mouth . All sorts of stories are told about the dangerousness of breathing frosty air directly into the lungs . Invalids shut themselves scrupulously indoors for weeks and even months at a stretch , for fear of the terrible results of a " blast of raw air " striking into their bronchial tubes . All sorts of absurd instruments of torture , in the form of " respirators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep out the fog , " are invented , and those who have the slightest tendency to bronchial or lung disturbances are warned upon pain of their life to wrap up their mouths whenever they go out-of-doors . As a matter of fact , there is exceedingly little evidence haled directly into the lungs . In fact , a considerable proportion of us , when swinging along at a lively gait on . the country roads , or playing tennis or football , or engaged in any form of active sport , will be found to keep our lips parted and to inhale from a sixth to a third of our breath in this way , and with no injurious results whatever . Nine-tenths of all the maladies believed to be due to breathing even the coldest and rawest of air are now known to be due to invading germs. w // Nevertheless , mouth-breathing in all ages has been regarded as a bad habit , and with good reason . It was only about thirty years ago that we began to find out why . A Danish throat surgeon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , discovered , in studying a number of children who were affected with mouth-breathing , that in all of them were present in the roof of the throat curious spongy growths , which blocked up the posterior opening of the nostrils . As this mass was made up of a number of smaller lobules , and the tissue appeared to be like that of a lymphatic gland , or " kernel , " the name " adenoids " ( gland-like ) was given to them . Later they were termed post-nasal growths , from the fact that they lay just behind the rear opening of the nostrils ; and these two names are used interchangeably . Our knowledge has spread and broadened from this starting-point , until we now know that adenoids are the chief , yes , almost the sole primary cause , not merely of mouth-breathing , but of at least two-thirds of the injurious effects which have been attributed to this habit . Mouth-breathing is not simply a bad habit , a careless trick on the part of the child . We have come to realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral ones , have a definite physical cause , and that no child ever becomes a mouth-breather as long as he can breathe comfortably through his nose . This clears the ground at once of a ' considerable amount of useless lumber in the shape of advice to train the child to keep his mouth shut . I have even known mothers who were in the habit of going around // after their helpless offspring were asleep and gently but firmly pushing up the little jaw and pressing the lips together until some sort of an attempt at respiration was made through the nostrils . Advertisements still appear of sling-like apparatuses for holding the jaws closed during sleep . To attempt to stop mouth-breathing before providing abundant air-space through the nostrils is not only irrational , but cruel . Of course , after the child has once become a mouth-breather , even after the nostrils have been made perfectly free , it will not at once abandon its habit of months or years , and disciplinary measures of some sort may then be needed for a time . But the hundred-times-repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut your mouth ! Do n't go around with it hanging . open like that ! " unless preceded by proper treatment of the nostrils , will have just about as much effect upon the habit as the proverbial water on a duck 's back . No use trying to close his mouth by any amount of opening of your own . Fortunately , as does not always happen , with our discovery of the cause has come the knowledge of the cure ; and we are able to say with confidence that , widespread and serious as are disturbances of health and growth associated with mouth-breathing , they can be absolutely prevented and abolished . What , then , is the cause of this nasal obstruction , and when does it begin to operate ? The primary cause is catarrhal inflammation , with swelling and thickening of the secretions , and it may begin to operate anywhere from the seventh month to the seventh year . A negADENOIDS , // lected attack , or series of attacks , of " snufes , " colds in the head , catarrhs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow inflammation of this glandular mass at the back of the nostrils ? a tonsil , by the way ? and start its enlargement . Whether we know anything about adenoids themselves or not , we are all familiar with their handiwork . The open mouth , giving a vacant expression to the countenance , the short upper lip , the pinched and contracted nostrils , the prominent and irregular teeth , the listless expression of the eyes , the slow response to request or demand , we have seen a score of times in every schoolroom . Coupled with these facial features are apt to be found on closer investigation a lack of interest in both work and play , an impaired appetite , restlese sleep , and a curious general backwardness of development , both bodily and mental , so that the child may be from one to four inches below the normal height for his years , from five to fifteen pounds under weight-and from one to three grades behind his proper school position . Very often , also , his chest is inclined to be narrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abdomen larger in girth than his chest . Is it possible that the mere inhaling of air directly into the lungs , even though it be imperfectly warmed , moistened , and filtered , as compared with what it would be if drawn through the elaborate " steam-coils " in the nostrils for this purpose , can have produced this array of defects ? It is incredible on the face of it and unfounded in fact . Fully two-thirds of these can be traced to the direct influence of the adenoids. // These adenoids , it may briefly be stated , are the result of an enlargement of a tonsil , or group of small tonsils , identical in structure with the well-known bodies of the same name which can be seen on either side of the throat . They have the same unfortunate faculty as the other tonsils for getting into hot water , flaring up , inflaming , and swelling on the slightest irritation . And , unfortunately , they are so situated that their capacity for harm is far greater than that of the other tonsils . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting man , ready to be knocked off at the lightest touch and plunge the whole body into a scrimmage . Their position is a little difficult to describe to one not familiar with the anatomy of the throat , especially as they can not be seen except with a laryngeal mirror ; but it may be roughly stated as in the middle of the roof of the throat , just at the back of the nostrils , and above the soft palate . From this coign of vantage they are in position to produce serious disturbances of two of our most important functions , ? respiration and digestion , ? and three out of the five senses , ? smell , taste , and hearing . We will begin with their most frequent and most serious injurious effect , though not the earliest , ? the impairment of the child 's power of attention and intelligence . So well known is their effect in this respect that there is scarcely an intelligent and progressive teacher nowadays who is not thoroughly posted on adenoids . Some of them will make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician ; and when once they suspect their presence , they will leave // no stone unturned to secure an examination of the child by a competent physician , and the removal of the growths , if present . They consider it a waste of time . to endeavor to teach a child weighted with this handicap . How keenly awake they are to their importance is typified by the remark of a prominent educator five or six years ago : ? " When I hear a teacher say that a child is stupid , my first instinctive conclusion is either that the child has adenoids , or that the teacher is incompetent . " The lion 's share of their influence upon the child 's intelligence is brought about in a somewhat unexpected and even surprising manner , and that is by the effects of the growths upon his Daring . You will recall that this third tonsil was situated at the highest point in the roof of the pharynx , or back of the throat . The first effect of its enlargement is naturally to block the posterior opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vantage-ground for'harm in its peculiar position . Only about three-fourths of an inch below it upon either side open the mouths of the Eustachian tubes , the little funnels which carry air from the throat out into the drum-cavity of the ear . You have frequently had practical demonstrations of their existence , by the wellknown sensation , when blowing your nose vigorously , of feeling something go " pop " in the ear . This sensation was simply due to a bubble of air being driven out through this tube from the back of the throat , under pressure brought to bear in blowing the nose . The luckless position of the third tonsil could hardly have been better planned if it had been devised for the // special purpose of setting up trouble in the mouths of these Eustachian tubes . Just as soon as the enlargements become chronic , they pour out a thick mucous secretion , which quickly becomes purulent , or , in the vernacular , " matter . " This trickles down on both sides of the throat , and drains right into the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these Eustachian tubes are the remains of the first gill-slits of embryonic life , and , like all other gill-slits , have a little mass of this same lymphoid or tonsilar tissue surrounding them . This also becomes infected and inflamed , clogs the opening , and one fatal day the inflammation shoots out along the tube , and the child develops an attack of earache . At least two-thirds of all cases of earache , and , indeed , fivesixths of all cases of deafness in children , are due to adenoids . Earache is simply the pain due to acute inflammation in the small drum-cavity of the ear . This in the large majority of cases will subside and drain back again into the throat through the Eustachian tube . In a fair percentage of instances , however , it will break in the opposite direction , and we have the familiar ruptured drum and discharge from the ear . In either case the drum becomes thickened , so that it can no longer vibrate properly ; the delicate little chain of bones behind it , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child becomes deaf , whether a chronic discharge be present or not . This is the secret of his " inattention , " his " indifference , " ? even of his apparent disobedience and reADENOIDS , // heinousness . What other children hear without an effort he has to strain every nerve to catch . He misunderstands the question that is asked of him , makes an absurd answer , and is either scolded or laughed at . It is n't long before he falls into the attitude : " Well , I ca n't get it right , anyhow , no matter how I try , so I do n't care . " Up to five or ten years ago the puzzled and distracted teacher would simply report the child for stupidity , indifference , and ' even insubordination . In nine cases out of ten , when children are naughty or stupid , they are really sick. * Not content with dulling one of the child 's senses , these thugs of the body-politic proceed to throttle two others ? smell and taste . Oliviously the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . And if this be more or less , or completely , blocked up , and its delicate mucous membranes coated with a thick , ropy discharge , you wilt not be able to distinguish anything but the crudest and rankest of odors . But what has this to do with taste ? Merely that twothirds of what we term " taste " is really smell . Seal the nostrils and you ca n't " tell chalk from cheese , " not even a cube of apple from a cube of onion , as scores of experiments have shown . We all know how flat tea , coffee , and even our own favorite dishes taste when we have a bad cold , and this , remember , is the permanent condition of the palate of the poor little mouth-breather . No wonder his appetite is apt to be poor , and that even what food he eats will not produce a flow of " appetite juice " in the stomach , which Pavloff has shown to be so necessary to digestion . No wonder his digestion is // apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chronic discharge down the back of his throat ; his bowels to become clogged and his abdomen distended . But the resources for mischief of this pharyngeal " Old Man of the Sea " are not even yet exhausted . Next comes a very curious and unexpected one . We have all heard much of " the struggle for existence " among plants and animals , and have had painful demonstrations of its reality in our own personal experience . But we hardly suspected that it was going on in our own interior . Such , however , is the case ; and when once one organ or structure falls behind the others in the race of growth , its neighbors promptly begin to enrcoach upon and take advantage of it . Emerson was right when he said , " I am the Cosmos , " the universe . Now , the mouth and the nose were originally one cavity . As Huxley long ago remarked , " When Nature undertook to build the skull of a land animal she was too lazy to start on new lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for air-breathing purposes . " And a clumsy job she made of it ! It may be remarked , in passing , that mouth-breathing , as a matter of history , is an exceedingly old and respectable habit , a reversion , in fact , to the method of breathing of the fish and the frog . " To drink like a fish " is a shameful and utterly unfounded aspersion upon a blameless creature of most correct habits and model deportment . What the poor goldfish in the bowl is really doing with his continual " gulp , gulp ! " is breathing ? not drinking . // This remodeling starts at a very early period of our individual existence . A horizontal ridge begins to grow out on either side of our mouth-nose cavity , just above the roots of the teeth . This thickens and widens into a pair of shelves , which finally , about the third month of embryonic life , meet in the middle line to form the hard palate or roof of the mouth , which forms also the floor of the nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-known " cleft-palate , " and , if this failure extends forward to the jaw , " hare-lip . " In the growth of a healthy child a balance is preserved between these lower and upper compartments of the original mouth-nose cavity , and the nose above growing as rapidly in depth and in breadth as the mouth below , the horizontal partition between ? the floor of the nose and the roof of the mouth ? is kept comparatively flat and level . In adenoids , however , the nostrils no longer being adequately used , and consequently failing to grow , and the mouth cavity below growing at the full normal rate , it is not long before the mouth begins to encroach upon the nostrils by pushing up the partition of the palate . As soon as this upward bulge of the roof of the mouth occurs , then there is a diminution of the resistance offered by the horizontal healthy palate to the continual pressure of the muscles of the cheeks and of mastication upon the sides of the upper jaw , the more readily as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the roof of the mouth . These are pushed inward , the arch of the jaw and of the teeth is narrowed , the front teeth are made to project , and , instead of erupting , with plenty // of room , in even , regular lines , are cro ' ded against and overlap one another . When from any cause the lower jaw habitually hangs down , as in the open mouth , it tends to be thrown slightly forward in its socket . Then , when the jaws close again , the arches of the upper and lower teeth no longer meet evenly . Instead of " locking " at almost every point , as they should , they overlap , or fall behind , or inside , or outside , of each other . So that instead of every tooth meeting its fellow of the jaw above evenly and firmly , they strike at an angle , slip past or even miss one another , and thus increase the already existing irregularity and overlapping . Each individual tooth , missing its best stimulus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise against its fellow in the jaw above or below , gets a twist in its socket , wears away irregularly , and becomes an easy prey to decay , while from failure of the entire upper and lower arches of the teeth to meet squarely and press evenly and firmly against one another , the jaws fail to expand properly and the tendency to narrowing of the tooth-arches and upward vaulting of the palate is increased . In short , we are coming to the conclusion that from half to two-thirds of all cases of " crowded mouth , " irregular teeth , and high-arched palate in children are due to adenoids . Progressive dentists now are insisting upon their little patients , who come to them with these conditions , being examined for adenoids , and upon the removal of these , if found , as a preliminary measure to mechanical corrective treatment . Cases are now on // record of children with two , three , or even four generations of crowded teeth and narrow mouths behind them , but who , simply by being sharply watched for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of these latter as soon as they have put in an appearance , have grown up with even , regular , welldeveloped teeth and wide , healthy mouths and jaws . Unfortunately , attention to the adenoids will not remove these defects of the jaws and teeth after they have been produced . But , if the child be under ten , or even twelve , years of age , their removal may yet do much permanently to improve the condition , and is certainly well worth while on general principles . Take care of the nose , and the jaws will take care of themselves . An ounce of adenoids-removal in the young child is worth a pound of orthodontia ? teethstraightening ? in the boy or girl ; though both are often necessary . The dull , dead tone of the voice in these children is , of course , an obvious effect of the blocked nostrils . Similarly , the broken sleep , with dreams of suffocation and of " Things Sitting on the Chest , " are readily explained by the desperate efforts that the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discharges , blown and sneezed out in the daytime , dry and accumulate during sleep , until , half-suffocated , it " lets go " and draws in huge gulps of air through the open mouth . No child ever became a mouth-breather from choice , or until after a prolonged struggle to continue breathing through its nose . This brings us to the question , What are these ade.116 PREVENTABLE DISEASES noids , and how ( lo they come to produce such serious disturbances ? This can be partially answered by saying that they are tonsils and with all a tonsil 's susceptibility to irritation and inflammation . But that only raises the further question , What is a tonsil ? And to that no answer can be given but Echo 's . They are one of the conundrums of physiology . All we know of them is that they are not true glands , as they have neither duct nor secretion , but masses of simple embryonic tissue called lymphoid , which has a habit of grouping itself about the openings of disused canals . This is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no known useful function . The two largest , or throat-tonsils , surround the inner openings of the second gill-slits of the embryo ; the lingual tonsil , at the base of the tongue below , encircles the mouth of the duct of the thyroid gland ( the goitre gland ) ; and our own particular Pandora 's Box above , in the roof of the pharynx , is grouped about the opening of another disused canal , which performs the singular and apparently most uncalled-for office of connecting the cavity of the brain with the throat . They can all of them be removed completely without any injury to the general health , and they all tend to shrink and become smaller ? in the case of the topmost , or pharyngeal , almost disappear ? after the twelfth or fourteenth year . Not only have they an abundant crop of troubles of their own , as most of us can testify from painful experience , but they serve as a port of entry for the germs of many serious diseases , such as tuberculosis , rheumatism , diphtheria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pear to be a strange sort of survival or remnant , ? not even suitable for the bargain-counter , ? a hereditary leisure class in the modern democracy of the body , a fertile soil for all sorts of trouble . Here , then , we have this little bunch of idle tissue , about the size of a small hazelnut , ready for any mischief which our Satan-bacilli may find for its hands to do . A child kept in a badly ventilated room inhales into his nostrils irritating dust or gases , or , more commonly yet , the floating germs of some one or more of those dozen mild infections which we term " acommon cold . " Instantly irritation and swelling are set up in the exquisitely elastic tissues of the nostrils , thick , sticky mucous , instead of the normal watery secretion , is poured out , the child begins to sneeze and snuffle and " run at the nose , " and either the bacteria are carried directly to this danger sponge , right at the back of the nostrils , or the inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nose have an abundance of vitality , ? like most hard workers , ? and usually react , overwhelm , and destroy the invading germs , and recover from the attack ; but the useless and half-dead tissue of the pharyngeal tonsil has much less power of recuperation , and it smoulders and inflames , though ultimately , perhaps , it may swing round to recovery . Often , however , a new cold will be caught before this has fully occurred , and then another one a month or so later , until finally we get a chronically thickened , inflamed , and enlarged condition of this interesting , but troublesome , body . What its capabilities are in this respect may be gathered from the fact // that , while normally of the size of a small hazelnut , it is no uncommon thing to find a mass which absolutely blocks up the whole of the upper part of the pharynx , and may vary from the size of a robin 's egg to that of a large English walnut , or even a small hen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the throat . Dirt has been defined as " matter out of place , " and the pharyngeal tonsil is an excellent illustration . Nature is said never to make mistakes , but she is apt to be absent-minded at times , and we are tral ; ing now not a few of the troubles that our flesh is heir to , to little oversights of hers ? scraps of inflammable material left lying about among the cogs of the body-machine , such as the appendix , the gall-bladder , the wisdom teeth , and the tonsils , One day a spark drops on them , or they get too near a bearing or a " hot-box , " and , in a flash , the whole machine is in a blaze . Never neglect snuffles or " cold in the head " in a young child , and particularly in a baby . Have it treated at once antiseptically , by competent hands , and learn exactly what to do for it on the appearance of the earliest symptoms in the future , and you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfort and distress , ? for it is perfect torment to a child to breathe through its mouth at first , ? but you will ward off many of the most serious troubles of infancy and childhood . We can hardly expect to prevent all development of adenoids by these prompt and painless stitches in time , for some children seem to be born peculiarly subject to them , either from the inheritance of a particular shape of nose and throat , " the family nose , " // as it has been called , ? or from some peculiar sponginess and liability to inflammation and enlargement of all these tonsilar or lymphoid " glands " and " kernels " of the body generally ? the old " lymphatic temperament . " We are , however , now coming to the opinion that this so-called " hereditary " narrow nose , short upper lip , and high-arched palate are , in a large percentage of cases , the result of adenoids in infancy in each successive generation of parents and grandparents . At all events , there are now on record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known to have been mouth-breathers , and who have on that account been sharply watched for the possible development of adenoids in early life , and these removed as soon as they appeared , and they have grown up with well-developed , wide nostrils , broad , flat palates , and regular teeth , overcoming " hereditary defect " in a single generation . Curiously enough , their origin and ancestral relations may have an important practical bearing , even in the twentieth century . At the upper end of this curious throat-brain canal lies another mass , the so-called pituitary body . This has been found to exert a profound influence over development and growth . Its enlargement is attended by giantism and another curious giant disease in which the hands , feet , and jaws enlarge enormously , known as acromegaly . It also pours into the blood a secretion which has a powerful effect upon both the circulation and the respiration . It is found shrunken and wasted in dwarfs . Some years ago it was // suggested by my distinguished friend , the late Dr. Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarfing and growth-retarding effects of adenoids might be due to a reflex influence exerted on their old colleague , the pituitary body . This view has found its way into several of the textbooks . Blood is thicker than water , and old ancestral vibrations will sometimes be set up in most unexpected places . Now comes the cheerful side of the picture . I should have hesitated to draw at such full length and in such lugubrious detail the direful possibilities and injurious effects of adenoids if its only result could have been to arouse apprehensions which could not be relieved . Fortunately , just the reverse is the case , and there are few conditions affecting the child , so common and such a fertile source of all kinds of mischief , and at the same time so completely curable , and whose cure will be attended by such gratifying improvement on the part of the little sufferer . In the first place , as has been said , their formation may usually be prevented altogether by intelligent and up-to-date hygienic care of the nose and the throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and developed to a considerable degree , they can be removed by a trifling and almost painless operation , and , if taken early enough , all their injurious effects overcome . If , however , they have been neglected too long , so that the child has passed the eighth or ninth year before any interference has been attempted , and still more , of course , if it has passed the twelfth or thirteenth year , then only a part of the disturbances that have been caused can be remedied by their removal . // So soft and pulpy are these growths , so poorly supplied with blood-vessels or nerves , and so slightly connected with the healthy tissues below them , that they may , in skilled hands , be completely removed by simply scraping with a dull surgical spoon ( curette ) or curved forceps , but never anything more knife-like than this . In fact , in the first seven years of life , when their removal is both easiest and will do most good , it is hardly proper to dignify the procedure by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same degree of risk and of hemorrhage as the extraction of a tooth , and by less than half the amount of pain . But , trifling and free from danger as is the operation , there is nothing in the entire realm of surgery which is followed by more brilliant and gratifying results . It seems almost incredible until one has seen it in half a dozen successive cases . Not merely doctors , but teachers and nurses , develop a positive enthusiasm for it . This was the operation that led to the comical , but pathetic , " Mothers ' Riots " in the New York schools . The word went forth , " The Krishts are cutting the throats of your children " ; and , with the shameful echoes of Kishineff ringing in their ears , the Yiddish mothers swarmed forth to battle for the lives of their offspring . It is no uncommon thing to have a child of seven jump three to five inches in height , six to twelve pounds in weight , and one to three grades in his schooling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intelligence and hygienic teaching should see this scourge of childhood completely wiped out , or at // least robbed of its possibilities for harm . When this is done , at least two-thirds of all cases of deafness , more than half of all cases of arrested development , and three-fourths of those of backwardness in children will disappear . CHAPTER VI TUBERCULOSIS , A SCOTCHED SNAKE I ONE of the darling habits of humanity is to discover that we are facing a crisis . One could safely offer a large prize for a group of ten connnencement orations , or political platforms , at least a third of which did not announce this momentous fact . Either we are facing it or it confronts us , and unutterable things will happen unless we " gird up our loins , " and vote the right ticket . An interesting feature about these loudly heralded crises is that they hardly ever " crise . " The real crisis either strikes us so hard that we never know what hit us , or is over before we recognize that anything was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are after ones ? trying to explain what caused it . In fact , in public affairs , as in medicine , a crisis is a sign of recovery . Its occurrence is an indication that nature is preparing to throw off the disease . Nowhere is this truth more vividly illustrated than in the tuberculosis situation . When , about thirty years ago , the world began to awake from its stupor of centuries , and to realize that this one great disease alone was killing one-seventh of all people born under civilization , and crippling as many more ; that its killed and wounded every year cast in the shade the bloodiest wars ever waged , and that it was a PREVENTABLE DISEASES parently caused by the civilization which it ravaged , ? no wonder that we were appalled at the outlook . Here was a disease of civilization , caused by the conditions of that civilization . Could it be cured with-out destroying its cause and reverting to barbarism ? Yet this very apprehension was a sign of hope , a pro , mise of improvement . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were shaking off the old fatalistic attitude toward disease , ? as inevitable or an act of Providence . It was brought about by the more accurate and sys tematic study of disease . We had long been sadly familiar with the fact that death by consumption , by " slow decline , " by " wasting " or " slow fever , " was frightfully common . " To fall into a decline " and die was one of the standard commonplaces of romantic literature . But that was quite different from knowing in cold , hard figures and inescapable percentages ex actly how many of the race were killed by it . It is one of the striking illustrations of the advantages of good bookkeeping . Boards and departments of health had just fairly got on their feet and started an accurate system of state accounts in matters of deaths and births . We were beginning to recognize national health as an asset , and to scrutinize its fluctuations with keen interest accordingly . We may decry statistics as much as we like , but when we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black and white we have no longer any idea of submitting to it as inevitable . We are going to get right up and do some fighting . " One-seventh of all the deaths " has literally become the war cry of our // new Holy War against tuberculosis . Still another stir-ring phrase of inestimable value in rousing us from our torpor was that coined by the brilliant and lovable physician-philosopher , Oliver Wendell Holmes : " The Great White Plague of the North . " This vivid epithet , abused as it may have been in later years , was of enor-mous service in fixing the public mind on consumption as a definite , individual disease , something to be fought and guarded against . Before that , we had been in-clined to look upon it as just a natural failing of the vital forces , a thing that came from within , and was in no sense caused from without . The fair young girl , or the delicate boy whose vitality was hardly sufficient to carry him through the stern battle of life , under some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a decline , gradually waste away , and die . What could be done in such a case , except to bow in submission to the inscrutable ways of Providence ? It seems incredible now , but such was the light in which smallpox was regarded by physicians of the Arabian and mediaeval schools : a natural oozing forth of " peccant humors " in the blood of the young , a dis-agreeable , but perfectly natural , and even necessary , process . For if the patient did not get rid of these hu-mors either he would die or his growth would be seri-ously impaired . Now smallpox has become little more than a memory in civilization , and consumption is due to follow its example . Sanitary pioneers had already begun casting about eagerly for light upon the influence of housing , of drainage , of food , in the causation of tuberculosis , // when a new and powerful weapon was suddenly placed in their hands by the infant science of bacteriology . This was the now world-famous discovery by Robert hock that consumption and other forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacillus . No tubercle bacillus ? no consumption . At first sight this discovery appeared to be anything but encouraging . In fact , it seemed to make the situation and the outlook even more hopeless . And when within a few years it was further demonstrated in rapid succession that most of the diseases of the spine in children , of the group of symptoms associated with enlarged glands or kernels in the neck and known as " scrofula " or struma , most cases of hip-joint disease , of white swelling of the knee , a large percentage of chronic ulcerations of the skin known as lupus , a common form of fatal bowel disease in children , and many instances of peritonitis in adults , together with fully half of the fatal cases of convulsions in children , were due to the activity of this same ubiquitous bacillus , it looked as if the enemy were hopelessly entrenched against attack . And when it was further found that a similar bacillus was almost as common a cause of death and disease in cattle , particularly dairy cattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens above and the earth beneath were so thickly strewn and so hopelessly infested with the germs that to war against them , or hope to escape from them , was like fighting back the Atlantic tides with a broom . But this chill of discouragement quickly passed . Our foe had come down out of the clouds , and was // spread out in battle array before us , in plain sight on the level earth . We were ready for the conflict , and proposed to " fight it out on this line if it takes all summer . " It was not long before we began to see joints in the enemy 's armor and weaknesses in his positions . Then , when we lowered our field-glasses and turned to count our forces and prepare for the defense , we discovered with a shock of delighted relief that whole regiments of unexpected reinforcements had come up while we were studying the enemy 's position . These new allies of ours were three of the great , silent forces of nature , which had fallen into line on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement , without even a bugle-blast to announce their coming . The first was the great resisting power and vigor of the human organism , which we had gravely underestimated . The second , that power of adaptation to new circumstances , including even the attack of infectious diseases , which we call " survival of the fittest . " The third , that great , sustaining , conservative power of nature ? heredity . More cheering yet , these forces came , not merely fully armed , but bearing new weapons fitted for our hands . The vigor and unconquerable toughness of the human animal presented us with three glittering weapons , sunshine , food , and fresh air . " If the deadly bacillus breaks through the lines , put me in the gap ! With these weapons , with this triad , I will engage to hurl him back , shattered and broken . " " Equip your vanguard with them , and the enemy will never break the line . " The survival of the fittest held out to us two weapons // of strange and curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other " quarantine . " " Give me a little time , " she said , " and with the first of these I will make seven-tenths of the soldiers in your army proof against the spears of the enemy , as Achilles was when dipped in the Styx . With the other , surround and isolate every roving band of the enemy that you can find ; drive him out of the holes and caves in which he lives , into the sunlight . Hold him in the open for forty-eight hours , and he will die of light-stroke and starvation . Divide and conquer ! " These reinforcements of ours have proved no mere figure of speech . They have won many a battle for us already upon the tented field . They have not merely made good their promises , but gone beyond them , and we are only just beginning to appreciate their true worth , and how absolutely we can rely upon them . The first outpost of the enemy was captured with the sunshine-food-air weapons , and a glorious victory it was , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral effect and its encouragement for the future . To pronounce an illness " consumption " had been from time immemorial equivalent to signing a death-warrant . Even the doctors could hardly believe it , when the first open-air enthusiasts began to claim that they had actually cured cases of genuine consumption . For long there was a tendency to mutter in the beard , " Well , it was n't genuine consumption , or it would n't have got better . " But after a period of incredulity this gave way to delighted confidence . The open-air method would cure , // and did cure , and the patients remained cured for years afterward . Our first claims were barely for twenty-five or thirty per cent of the threatened victims . Then we were able to increase it to fifty per cent ; sixty , seventy , and finally eighty were successively reached . But with the increase of our power over the cure of this disease came a realization of our knowledge of its limitations . It quickly proved itself to be no sovereign and universal panacea , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indiscriminately it was applied . And emphatically it had to be mixed with brains , on the part both of the physician and of the patient . In the first place , the likelihood of a cure depended , with almost mathematical certainty , upon the earliness of the stage at which it was begun . Eight or ten years ago the outlook crystallized itself into the form which it has practically retained since : of cases put under treatment in the very early stage , from seventy to ninety per cent were practical cures ; of ordinary so-called " firststage " cases , sixty to seventy per cent ; second-stage cases , or those in whom the disease was well developed , thirty to sixty per cent ; and well-advanced cases , fifteen to thirty per cent of apparent cures . The crux of the whole proposition lies in the early recognition of the disease by the physician , and the prompt acceptance of the diagnosis by the patient , and his willingness to drop everything and fight intelligently and vigorously for his life . Physicians are now thoroughly awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and study upon methods of recognition at the earliest possible stages . At ' the same time those mag130 PREVENTABLE DISEASES nificent associations for the study and prevention of tuberculosis , international , national , state , and local , ? the greatest of which , the International Tuberculosis Congress , has just honored America by meeting in Washington , ? are straining every nerve to educate the public to understand the importance of recognizing the earliest possible symptoms of this disease , no matter how trivial they may appear , and making every other consideration bend to the fight . This new Word of Power , the open-air treatment , alone has transformed one of the most hopeless , most pathetic , and painful fields of disease into one of the most cheerful and hopeful . The vantage-ground won is something enormous . No longer need the family physician hang back , in dread and horror , from allowing himself even to recognize that the slow loss of weight , the increasing weakness , the flushed evening check , and the restless sleep , are signs of this dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doom , he knows now that he has everything to gain and nothing to lose by promptly warning him of his danger , even while it is still problematical . On the other hand , the patient need no longer recoil in horror when told that he has consumption , and either go home to set his house in order and make his will , or hunt up another medical adviser who will take a more cheerful view of his case . All that he has to do is to turn and fight the disease vigorously , intelligently , persistently , with the certain knowledge that the chances are live to one in his favor ; and that 's a good fighting chance for any one . // Even should there be reasonable ground for doubt as to the positive nature of the disease , he has nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking the steps required to cure it . There is nothing magical or irrational , least of all injurious , in any way about them . Simply rest , abundant feeding , and plenty of fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his tissues , this treatment will relieve the conditions of depression from which he is suffering , and which would sooner or later render him a favorable lodging-place for this omnipresent , tiny enemy . If he has the disease the treatment will cure it . If he has n't got it , it will prevent it ; and the gain in vigor , weight , and general efficiency will more than pay him for the time lost from his business or his study . It al ways pays to take time to put yourself back into a con dition of good health and highest efficiency . It was early recognized that the campaign could not be won with this weapon alone . Inexpressibly valuable and cheering as it was , it had obvious limitations . The first of these was the obvious reflection that it was idle to cure even eighty per cent of all who actually devel oped tuberculosis , unless something were done to stop the disease from developing at all . " Eighty per cent of cures , " of course , sounds very encouraging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . But even a twenty per cent mortality from such a common disease , if it were to proceed un checked , would make enormous inroads every year upon our national vigor . Secondly , it was quickly seen that those who recov132 PREVENTABLE DISEASES ered from the disease still bore the scars ; that while they might recover a fair degree of health and vigor , yel , they were always handicapped by the time lost and the ( Imnage inflicted by this slow and obstinate malady ; that many of them , while able to preserve good health under ideal conditions , were markedly and often distressingly limited in the range of their business activities for years after , and even for life . Finally , that as these cases were followed further and further , it was found that even after becoming cured they were sadly liable to relapse under some unexpected strain , or to slacken their vigilance and drop back into their former bad physical habits ; while the conviction began to grow steadily upon men who had devoted one , two , or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most resorted to for its cure , that the general vigor and vitality of these cured consumptives were apt to be not of the best ; that their duration of life was not equal to the average ; and that , even if they escaped a return of the disease , they were apt to go down before their normal time under the attack of some other malady . In short , cure was a poor weapon against the disease as compared with prevention . But before this , a careful study of the enemy 's position and investigation of our own resources had brought another most important and reassuring fact to light , and that is , that while a distressingly large number of persons died of tuberculosis , these represented only a comparatively small percentage of all who had actually been attacked by the disease . One of the reasons why consumption had come to be regarded as // such a deadly disease was that the milder cases of it were never recognized . It was , and is yet , a common phrase in the mouths of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seriously threatened with consumption " ; " She came very near falling into a decline , " ? but they recovered . If they did n't die of it , it was n't " real " tuberculosis . Now we have changed all that , and have even begun to go to the opposite extreme , of declaring with the German experts , " Jeder Mann ist am ende ein bischen taberkealose . " ( Every one is some time or another a little bit tuberculous . ) This sounds appalling at first hearing , but as a matter of fact it is immensely encouraging . Our first . suspicion of it came from the records of that gruesome , but pricelessly valuable , treasure-house of solid facts in pathology ? the post-mortem room , the dead-liouse . Systematic examinations of all the bodies brought to autopsy in our great hospitals and elsewhere revealed at first thirty , then , as the investigation became more minute and skillful , forty , sixty , seventy-five per cent of scars in the apicesof the lungs , remains of healed cavities , infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubercle bacillus . Of course , the skeptic challenged very properly at once : ? " But how do you know that these masses of chalkymaterial , these enlarged glands , are the result of tuberculosis ? They may be due to some half-dozen other infections . " Almost before the question was asked a test was made by the troublesome but convincing method of cutting open these scars , dividing these enlarged glands , // scraping materials out of their centre , and injecting them into guinea pigs . Result : from thirty to seventy per cent of the guinea pigs died of tuberculosis . In other eases it was not necessary to inoculate , as scrapings or sections from these scar-masses showed tubercle bacilli , clearly recognizable by their staining reaction . Here , then , we have indisputable evidence of the fact that the tubercle bacillus may not only enter some . of the openings of the body , ? the nostrils , the mouth , the lungs , ? but may actually form a lodgment and a growth-colony in the lungs themselves , and yet be completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissues of the body , prevented from spreading throughout the rest of the lung , most of the invaders destroyed , and the crippled remnants imprisoned for life in the interior of a fibroid or chalky mass . It gave one a distinct shock at the meeting of the British Medical Association devoted to tuberculosis , some ten years ago , to hear Sir Clifford Allbutt , one of the most brilliant and eminent physicians of the English-speaking world , remark , on opening his address , " Probably most of us here have had tuberculosis and recovered from it . " Here is evidently an asset of greatest and most practical value , which changes half the face of the field . Instead of saving , as best we may , from half to two-thirds of those who have allowed the disease to get the upper hand and begin to overrun their entire systems , it places before us the far more cheering task of building up and increasing this natural resisting power of the human body , until not merely seventy per cent of all // who are attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-five , ninety ! We can plan to stop consumption by preventing the consumptive . A very small additional percentage of vigor or of resisting power ? such as could be produced by but a slight improvement in the abundance of the food-supply , the lighting and ventilating of the houses , the length and " fatiguingness " of the daily toil ? might be the straw which would be sufficient to turn the scale and prevent the tuberculous individual from becoming consumptive . Here comes in one of the most important and valuable features of our splendid sanatorium campaign for the cure of tuberculosis , and that is the nature of the methods employed . If we relied for the cure of the disease upon some drug , or antitoxin , even though we might save as many lives , the general reflex or secondary effect upon the community might not be in any way beneficial ; at best it would probably be only negative . But when the only " drugs " that we use are fresh air , sunshine , and abundant food , and the only antitoxins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when , in fact , we are using for the cure of consumption precisely those agencies and influences which will prevent the well from ever contracting it , then the whole curative side of the movement becomes of enormous racial value . The very same measures that we rely upon for the cure of the sick are those which we would recommend to the well , in order to make them stronger , happier , and more vigorous . If the whole civilized community could be placed upon a moderate form of the open-air treatment , it // would be so vastly improved in health , vigor , and efficiency , and saved the expenditure of such enormous sums upon hospitals , poor relief , and sick benefits , that it would be well worth all that it would cost , even if there were no such disease as tuberculosis on earth . This is coming to be the real goal , the ultimate hope of i.lie far-sighted leaders in our tuberculosis campaign , ? to use the cure of consumption as a lever to raise to a higher plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . Enormously valuable as is the open-air sanatorium as a means of saving thousands of valuable and beloved lives , its richest promise lies in its function as a school of education for the living demonstration of methods by which the health and happiness of the ninety-five per cent of the community who never will come within its walls may be built up . Every ' consumptive cured in it goes home to be a living example and an enthusiastic missionary in the fresh-air campaign . The ultimate aim of the sanatorium will be to turn every farmhouse , every village , every city , into an open-air resort . When it shall have done this it will have fulfilled its mission . Our plan of campaign is growing broader and more ambitious , but more hopeful , every day . All we have to do is to keep on fighting and use our brains , and victory is certain . Our Teutonic fellow soldiers have already nailed their flag to the mast with the inscription : ? " No more tuberculosis after 1930 ! " So much for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon which we depend for the heavy , mass fighting and the great frontal attacks . But what of the right and the left wings , and the cloud of skirmishers and cavalry which is continually feeling the enemy 's position and cutting off his outposts ? Upon the right stretch the intrenchments of the bacteriologic brigade , with the complicated but marvelously effective weapons of precision given us by the discovery of the definite and living cause of the disease , the Bacillus tuberculosis . Upon the left wing lie camp after camp of native regiments , whose loyalty until of very recent years was more than doubtful , ? heredity , acquired immunity , and the so-called improvements of modern civilization , steam , electricity , and their kinsmen . To the artillerymen of the bacteriologic batteries appears to have been intrusted the most hopeless task , the forlorn hope , ? the total extermination of a foe so tiny that he had to be magnified five hundred times before he was even visible , and of such countless myriads that he was at least a billion times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the centre of the battle-line , when we once made up our minds to fight , we were not long in discovering points of attack and weapons to assault him with . First , and most fundamental of all , came the consoling discovery that though there could be no consumption without the bacillus , not more than one individual in seven , of fair or average health , who was exposed to its attack in the form of a definite infection , succumbed to it ; and that , as strongly suggested by the // post-mortem findings already described , even those who developed a serious or fatal form of the disease had llu ? own off from five to fifteen previous milder or slighter infections . So that , to put it roughly , all that would be necessary practically to neutralize the injuriousness of the bacillus would be to prevent about one-twentieth of the exposures to its invasion which actually occurred , The other nineteen-twentieths would take care of themselves . The bacilli are not the only ones who can be numbered in their billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . We are not mere units ? scarcely even individuals ? except in a broad and figurative sense . We are confederacies of billions upon billions of little , living animalcules which we call cells . These cells of ours are no Sunday-school class . They are old and tough and cunning to a degree . They are war-worn veterans , carrying the scars of a score of victories written all over them . They are animals ; bacteria , bacilli , micrococci , and all their tribe are vegetables . The daily business , the regular means of livelihood of the animal cell for fifteen millions of years past has been eating and digesting the vegetable . And all that our body-cells need is a little intelligent encouragement to continue this performance , even upon disease germs ; so that we need n't be afraid of being stampeded by sudden attack . The next cheering find was that the worst enemies of Hie bacillus were our best friends . Sunlight will kill them just is certainly as it will give us new life . The germs of tuberculosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp , unventilated quarters , just pre- // cisely such surroundings as are provided for them in the inside bedrooms of our tenements , and the dark , cellar-like rooms of many a peasant 's cottage or farmhouse . In bright sunlight they will perish in from three to six hours ; in bright daylight in less than half a day . This is one of the factors that helps to explain the apparent paradox , that the dust collected from the floors and walls of tents and cottages in which consumptives were treated was almost entirely free from tuberculous bacilli , while dust taken from the walls of tenement houses , the floors of street-cars , the walls of churches and theatres in New York City , was found to be simply alive with them . One of the most important elements in the value of sunlight in the treatment of consumption is its powerful germicidal effect . CHAPTER VII TUBERCULOSIS , A SCOTCHED SNAKE II CLOSELY allied to the discovery that sunlight and fresh air are fatal to the microorganisms of tuberculosis came the consoling fact that these bacilli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens above and the earth beneath , had neither wings nor legs , and were absolutely incapable of propelling themselves a fraction of an inch . They do not move ? they have to be carried . More than this , like all other disease-germs , while incredibly tiny and infinitesimal , they have a definite weight of their own , and are subject to the law of gravity . They do not flit about hither and thither in the atmosphere , thistledown fashion , but rapidly fall to the floor of whatever room or receptacle they may be thrown in . And the problem of their transference is not that of direct carrying from one victim to the next , but the intermediate one of infected materials , such as are usually associated with visible dust or dirt . In short , keep dust or dirt from the floor , out of our food , away from our fingers or clot Ling or anything that can be brought to or near the mouth , and you will practically have abolished the possibility of the transference of tuberculosis . The consumptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is only his filthy or unsanitary surroundings . Put a consumptive , who is careful of his sputum and cleanly in his habits , in a well-lighted , well-ventilated room , or , better still , out of doors , and there will be exceedingly little danger of any other member of his family or of those in the house with him contracting the disease . Wherever there is dirt or dust there is danger , and there almost only . Thorough and effective housereform ? not merely in tenements , alas ! but in myriads of private houses as well ? would abolish twothirds of the spread of tuberculosis . It is not necessary to isolate every consumptive in order to stop the spread of the disease . All that is requisite is to prevent the bacilli in his sputum from reaching the floor or the walls , to have both the latter well lighted and aired , and , if possible , exposed to direct sunlight at some time during the day , and to see that dust from the floor is not raised in clouds by dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle upon food , fingers , or clothing , and that children be not allowed to play upon such floors as may be even possibly contaminated . These precautions , combined with the five-to-one resisting power of the healthy human organism , will render the risk of transmission of the disease an exceedingly small one . To what infinitesimal proportions this risk can be reduced by intelligent and strict sanitation is illustrated by the fact , already alluded to , of the almost complete germ-freeness of the dust from walls and floors of sanitorium cottages , and by the even more convincing and conclusive practical result , that scarcely a single case is on record of the // transmission of this disease to a nurse , a physician , or a servant , or other employee in an institution for its cure . There is absolutely no rational basis for this panicst.rieken dread of an intelligent , cleanly consumptive , or for the cruel tendency to make him an outcast and raise the cry of the leper against him : " Unclean ! Unclean ! " It can not be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor ; and if this relaystation be kept sterile there is little danger of its transmission by other means . Practically all that is needed to break this link is the absolute suppression of what is universally and overwhelmingly regarded as not merely an unsanitary and indecent , but a filthy , vulgar , and disgusting habit ? promiscuous expectoration . There is nothing new or unnatural in this repression , this tabu on expectoration . In fact , we are already provided with an instinct to back it . In every race , in every age , in every grade of civilization , the human saliva has been regarded as the most disgusting , the most dangerous and repulsive of substances , and the act of spitting as the last and deepest sign of contempt and hatred ; and if directed toward an individual , the deadliest and most unbearable insult , which can be wiped out only by blood . Primitive literatu re and legend are full of stories of the poisonousness of human saliva and the deadliness of the human bite . I I. was the " bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to see how science has finally , thousands of years afterward , shown the substantial basis of , and gone far to justify , this instinctive horror and Ioathing. // Not merely are the fluids of the human mouth liable to contain the tubercle bacillus , and that of diphtheria , of pneumonia , and half a dozen other definite disorders , but they are in perfectly healthy individuals , especially where the teeth are in poor condition , simply swarming with millions of bacteria of every sort , some of them harmless , others capable of setting up various forms of suppuration and septic inflammation if introduced into a wound , or even if taken into the stomach . Even if there were no such disease as tuberculosis a campaign to stamp out promiscuous expectoration would be well worth all it cost . Of course , as a counsel of perfection , the ideal procedure would be promptly to remove each consumptive , as soon as discovered , from his house and place him in a public sanatorium , provided by the state , for the sake of removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of placing him under those conditions which alone can offer a hopeful prospect of cure , and of preventing the further infection of his surroundings . The only valid objections to such a plan are those of the expense , which , of course , would be very great . It would be nof. merely best , but kindest , for the consumptive himself , for his immediate family , and for the community . And enormous as the expense would be , when we have become properly aroused and awake to the huge and almost incredible burden which this disease , with its one hundred and fifty thousand deaths a year , i now imposing upon the United States , ? five times as great as that of war or standing army in the most mili144 1'ItEVENTABLE DISEASES tary-mad state in Christendom , ? the community will ultimately assume this expense . So long , however , , as our motto inclines to remain , " Millions for cure , but not one cent for prevention , " we shall dodge this issue . ' There can be no question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand inhabitants ought to provide an open-air camp or colony of sufficient capacity to receive all those who are willing to take the cure but unable to meet the expense of a private institution ; and , also , some institution of adequate size , to which could be sent , by process of law , all those consumptives who , either through perversity , or the weakness and wretchedness due to their disease , or the apathy of approaching dissolution , fail or are unable to take proper precautions . When we remember that the careful investigations of the various dispensaries for the treatment of tuberculosis in our larger cities , New York , Boston , Cleveland , report that on an average twenty to thirty per cent of all children living in the same room or apartment with a consumptive member of their family are found to show some form of tuberculosis , it will be seen how well worth while , from every point of view , this provision for the removal and sanatorium treatment of the poorer class of these unfortunates would be . These dispensaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign against the disease , one or more visiting nurses , who , whenever a patient with tuberculosis is brought into the dispensary , visit him in his home , show him how to ventilate and light // his rooms as well as may be , give practical demonstrations of the methods of preventing the spread of the disease , advise him as to his food , and see that he is supplied with adequate amounts of milk and eggs , and , finally , round up all the children of the family and any adults who are in a suspicious condition of health , and bring them to the dispensary for examination . Distressing as are these findings , reaching in some cases as high as fifty and sixty per cent of the children , they have already saved hundreds of children , and prevented hundreds of others from growing up crippled or handicapped . It must be remembered that the tubercle bacillus causes not merely disease of the lungs in children but also a large majority of the crippling diseases of the bones , joints , and spine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a large group of intestinal diseases and of brain lesions , resulting in convulsions , paralysis , hydrocephalus , and death . The battle-ground of the future against tuberculosis is the home . We speak of the churchyard as " haunted , " and we recoil in horror from the leper-house or the choleracamp . Yet the deadliest known hotbed of horrors , the spawning ground of more deaths than cholera , smallpox , yellow fever , and the bubonic plague combined , is the dirty floor of the dark , unventilated living-room , whether in city tenement or village cottage , where children crawl and their elders spit . It is scarcely to the credit of our species that for convincing , actual demonstrations of what can be // done toward stamping out tuberculosis , by measures directed against the bacillus alone , we are obliged to turn to the lower animals . By a humiliating paradox we a re never quite able to put ourselves under those conditions which we know to be ideal from a sanitary point of view . There are too many prejudices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reckoned with . But with the lower animals that come under our care we have a clear field , free from obstruction by either our own prejudices or those of others . In this realm the stamping out of tuberculosis is not merely a rosy dream of the future but an accomplished fact , in some quarters even an old story . Two illustrations will suffice , one among domestic animals , the other among wild animals in captivity . The first is among pure-bred dairy cattle , the pedigreed Jerseys and Holsteins . No sooner did the discovery of the bacillus provide us with a means of identification , than the well-known " perlsucht " of the Germans , or " grapes " of the English veterinarians ? both names being derived from the curious rounded masses or nodules of exudate found in the pleural cavity and the peritoneum ( around the lungs and the bowels ) , and supposed to resemble pearls and grapes respectively ? were identified asp tuberculosis , and cows were found very widely infected with it . This unfortunately still remains the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the more intelligent breeders owning valuable cattle proceeded to take steps to protect them . The first step was to test their cows with tuberculin , // promptly weeding out and isolating all those that reacted to the disease . It was at first thought necessary to slaughter all these at once . But it was later found that , if they were completely isolated and prevented from communicating the disease to others , this extreme measure was necessary only with those extensively diseased . The others could be kept alive , and if their calves were promptly removed as soon as born , and fed only upon sterilized or perfectly healthy milk , they would be free from the disease . And thus the breeding-life of a particularly valuable and high-bred animal might be prolonged for a number of years . They must , however , be kept in separate buildings and fields , and preferably upon a separate farm from the rest of the herd . Those cows found healthy were given the best of care , including a marked diminution of the amount of housing or confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months , several times , to weed out any others which might still have the infection in their systems . In a short time all signs of the disease disappeared , and no other cases developed in these herds unless fresh infection was introduced from without . To guard against this , each farm established a quarantine station , where all new-bought animals , after having been tested with tuberculin and shown to be free from reaction , are kept for a period of at least a year , for careful observation and study , before being allowed to mix with the rest of the herd . It is now a common requirement among intelligent breeders of pedigreed cattle to demand , as a formal condition of sale , their submission to the tuberculin test , or the certificate of // a competent veterinarian that the animal has been so tested without reacting . Protected herds have now been in existence under these conditions , notably in Denmark , where the method was first reduced to a system under the able leadership of Professor Bang , of Copenhalgen , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only a fraction of one per cent of calves from the most diseased mothers are born diseased . Not only is the method spreading rapidly among the more intelligent class of breeders , but many progressive countries of Europe and states of our Union require the passing of the tuberculin test as a requisite to the admission within their borders of cattle intended for breeding purposes . So that , while the problem is still an enormous one , it is now confidently believed that complete eradication of bovine tuberculosis is only a question of time . The other instance furnishes a much more crucial test , as it is carried out upon wild animals under the unfavorable conditions of captivity in a strange climate , like our slum-dwellers from sunny Italy , and comes home to us more closely in many respects , inasmuch as it is concerned with our nearest animal relatives on the biological side ? monkeys and apes , in zoological gardens . Tuberculosis is a perfectly frightful scourge to these unfortunate captives , causing not infrequently thirty , fifty , and even sixty per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in keeping with their frightful general mortality . The collection of monkeys in the London Zoo , for instance , some fifteen years ago , was absolutely // exterminated by disease and started over afresh every three years , a death-rate of thirty-five per cent per an num as compared with our human rate of about two per cent per annum . IIere , it would seem , was an in-stance where there was little need to call in the bacillus . Brought from a tropical climate to one of raw , damp fog and smoke , from the freedom of the air-roads through the tree-tops to the confinement of dismal and often dirty cages in a stuffy , overheated house , con demned to a diet which at best could be but a feeble and far-distant imitation of their natural food , it seemed little wonder that they " jes ' natcherly pined away an ' died . " But let the results speak . A thorough system of quar antine was enforced , beginning with one of the Vienna gardens , and finally reaching one of its most brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Bronx . All animals pur chased or donated were tested with tuberculin , and those that reacted were either painlessly destroyed or disposed of . Those which appeared to be immune were kept in a thoroughly healthy , sanitary quarantine sta tion for six months or a year , and again tested by tuber culin before being introduced into the cages . The origi nal stock of monkeys was treated in the same manner or else destroyed completely , and the houses and cages thoroughly cleaned and sterilized or new ones con structed . Keepers employed in the monkey-house were carefully tested for signs of tuberculosis , and rejected or excluded if any appeared . Signs were posted for-bidding any expectoration or feeding of the animals // ( which latter is often done with nuts or fruit which had been cracked or bitten before being handed to the monkeys ) by the general public , and these rules were strictly enforced . At the same time the houses were thoroughly ven tilated and exposed to sunlight as much as possible , and the animals were turned out into open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result the mortality from tuberculosis promptly sank from thirty per cent to five or six per cent . In our Bronx Zoo , for instance , it has become decidedly rare as a cause of death in monkeys , no case having occurred in the mon key-house for eighteen months past . What is even more gratifying , the general mortality declined also , though in less proportion , so that , instead of losing twenty-five to thirty per cent of the animals in the house every year , a mortality of ten to fifteen per cent is now considered large . And to think that we might achieve the same results in our own species if we would only treat ourselves as well as we do our monkey captives ! To " make a mon key of one 's self " might have its advantages from a sanitary point of view . " But this method , " some one will remind us , " would silence only a part of the enemy 's infection batteries . " Even supposing that we could prevent the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con sumpt ives and their deadly bacilli ? If the milk that we drink , and the beef , pork , and poultry that we eat , are liable to convey the infection , what hope have we of ever stopping the invasion ? // The question is a serious one . But here again a thorough and careful study of the enemy 's position has shown the danger to be far less than it appeared at first sight . Even bacilli have what the French call " the defects of their virtues . " Their astonishing and most disquieting powers of adjustment , of accommodation to the surroundings in which they find themselves , namely , the tissues and body-fluids of some particular host whom they attack , bring certain limitations with them . Just in so far as they have adjusted themselves to live in and overcome the opposition of the body-tissues of a certain species of animals , just to that degree they have incapacitated themselves to live in the tissues ( If any other species . Some of the most interesting and far-reachingly important work that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has concerned itself with the changes that have taken place in different varieties and strains of tubercle bacilli as the result of adjusting themselves to particular environments . The subject is so enormous that only the crudest outlines can be given here , and so new that it is impossible to announce any positive conclusions . But these appear to be the dominant tendencies of thought in the field so far . Though nearly all domestic animals and birds , and a majority of wild animals under captivity , are subject to the attack of tuberculosis , practically all the infections hitherto studied are caused by one of three great varieties or species of the tubercle bacillus : the human , infesting our own species ; the bovine , attacking cattle ; and the avian , inhabiting the tissues of birds , i5 PREVENTABLE DISEASES especially the domestic fowl . These three varieties or species so closely resemble one another that they were at one time regarded as identical , and we can well re-member the wave of dismay which swept over the medical world when Robert Koch announced that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuberculosis due to an unmistakable tubercle bacillus . But as these varieties were thoroughly and carefully studied , it was soon found that they presented definite marks of differentiation , until now they are universally admitted to be distinct varieties , each with its own life peculiarities , and , according to some authorities , even distinct species . " But , " we fancy we hear some one inquire impa tiently , " what do those academic , technical distinctions matter to us ? Whether the avian tuberculosis germ is a variety or a true species may be left to the taxono mists , but it is of no earthly importance to us . " On the contrary , it is of the greatest importance . For the distinctive feature about a particular species of parasite is that it will live and flourish where another species will die , and , vice versa , will die in surround ings where its sister species might live and thrive . One of the first differences found to exist among these three types of bacteria was the extraordinary variation in their power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rabbit could lie readily inoculated with human bacilli , they could only be infected with difficulty by cultures of the borliw bacillus ; while the only animal that could be inoculated at all with the avian or bird bacillus was the rabbit , // and he only occasionally . In fact , bacteriologists soon came to the consoling conclusion that the avian bacillus might be practically disregarded as a source of danger to human beings , so widely different were the condi tions in their moist and moderately warm tissues to those of the dry and superheated tissues of the bird to which it had adjusted itself for so many generations . And next came the bold pronunciamento of no less an authority than Koch himself , that the bovine bacil lus also was so feebly infective to human beings that it might be practically disregarded as a source of danger . This promptly split the bacteriologists of the world into two opposing camps , and started a warfare which is still being waged with great vigor . As the question is still under hot dispute by even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pronounce any definite con clusions . But the net result to date appears to be that while Koch made a serious error of judgment in de claring that meat and milk as a source of danger to human beings of tuberculosis might be disregarded , yet , for practical purposes , his position is , in the main , correct : the actual danger from the bovine bacillus to human beings is relatively small . There was nothing whatever improbable , in the first place , in the correctness of Koch 's position . It is one of the few consoling facts , well known to all students of comparative pathology or the diseases of the different species of animals , how peculiarly special ized they are in the choice of their diseases , or , per haps , to put it more accurately , how particular and re stricted disease-germs are in their choice of a host . For // instance , out of twenty-eight actually infectious diseases which are most common among the domestic animals and nian , other than tuberculosis , only one ? rabies ? is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? anthrax , tetanus , and foot-and-mouth disease ? are communicable to two species ; while the remainder are almost absolutely confined to one species , even though this be thrown into closest contact with half a dozen others . Again , we have half a dozen similar instances in the case of tuberculosis itself . The horse and the sheep , for instance , are both most intimately associated with cattle , pastured in the same fields , fed upon the same food , and yet tuberculosis is almost unknown in sheep and decidedly uncommon in horses , and when it does occur in them is from a human source . The goat is almost equally immune from both human and bovine forms , while the cat and the dog , although developing the infection with a low degree of frequency , almost invariably trace that infection to a human source . There is , therefore , no a priori reason whatever why we should be any more susceptible to bovine tuberculosis than the remainder of the domestic animals . It is only fair to say , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembles ours , the hog , is quite fairly susceptible to bovine tuberculosis if fed upon the milk or meat of tuberculous cattle . Next came the particularly consoling fact that although nothing has been more striking than the great increase in the amounts of meat and milk consumed by the mass of the community during our last twenty // years ' progress in civilization , this has been accompanied not by any increase of tuberculosis , but by a diminution of from thirty-five to forty-five per cent . The allegation so frequently made that there has been an increase in the amount of infantile tuberculosis has been shown , upon careful investigation by Sherman of Edinburgh , Guthrie of London , Kossel in Germany , Comby in France , Bovaird in New York , and others , to be practically without foundation . Then , while repetitions of Loch 's experiment , upon which his announcement was based , of inoculating calves and young cattle with human bacilli have proved that a certain number of them can be , under appropriate circumstances , made to develop tuberculosis , that number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in many cases the infection has been a local one , or of a mild type , which has resulted in recovery . Lastly , while a number of bacilli , with bovine culture and other characteristics , have been recovered from the bodies of children dying of tuberculosis , and these bacilli have proved virulent to calves when injected into them , yet , as a matter of historical fact , the actual number of instances in which children or other human beings have been definitely proved to have contracted the disease from the milk of a tuberculous cow is still exceedingly and encouragingly small . A careful study of the entire literature of the past twenty years , some three years ago , revealed only thirty-seven cases ; and of these thirty-seven Koch 's careful investigations have since disproved the validity of nine . On the other hand , it is anything but safe to accept // Loch 's practical dictum and neglect the meat and milk of cattle as a source of danger in tuberculosis . First , because the degree of our immunity against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , be-cause , while bacteriologists are fairly agreed that the avian , the bovine , and the human represent three dis-tinct and different variations , if not species , of the bacil-lus , they are almost equally agreed that they are prob-ably the descendants of one common species , which may possibly be a bacillus commonly found upon meadow grasses , particularly the well-known timothy , and hence very frequently in the excreta of cattle , and known as the grass bacillus or dung bacillus of Moeller . This bacillus has all the staining , morphological , and even growth characteristics of the tubercle bacillus ex-cept that it produces only local irritation and little nod-ular masses , if injected into animals . Our knowledge of its existence is , however , of great practical import-ance , inasmuch as it warned us that in our earlier studies of the bacilli contained hi milk and butter we have been mistaking this organism for a genuine tuber-cle bacillus . As a consequence , of late years our tests for the presence of tubercle bacilli in milk are made not only by searching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centrifugated sediment of the infected milk into guinea pigs , to see if it proves infec-tious . Many of our earlier statements as to the pre-sence of tubercle bacilli in milk and butter are now invalidated on this account . Not only are the three varieties of tubercle bacilli probably of common origin , but they may , under cer- // tain peculiar conditions , be transformed into one another , or , at least , enabled to live under the conditions favorable to one another . This was shown nearly fifteen years ago by the ingenious experiments of Nocard , the great veterinary pathologist . IIe took a culture of bovine bacilli , which were entirely harmless to fowls , and , inclosing them in a collodion capsule , inserted them into the peritoneal cavity of a hen . The collodion capsule permitted the fluids of the body to enter and provide food for the bacilli , but prevented the admission of the leucocytes to attack and destroy them . After several weeks the capsule was removed , the bacilli found still alive , and transferred to another capsule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some five or six times , the last generation of bacilli was injected into another fowl , which promptly developed tuberculosis , showing that by gradually exposing the bacilli for successive generations to the high temperature of the bird 's , body ( from five to fifteen degrees above that of the mammal ) , they had become acclimated , as it were , and capable of developing . So that it is certainly quite conceivable that bovine bacilli introduced in milk or meat might manage to find a haven of refuge or lodgment in some out-of-the-way gland or tissue of the human body , and there avoid destruction for a sufficiently long time to become acclimated and later infect the entire system . This is the method which several leaders in bacteriology , including Behring ( of antitoxin fame ) , believe to be the principal source and method of infection of the human species . The large majority , however , of // bacteriologists and clinicians are of the opinion that ninety per cent of all cases of human tuberculosis are contracted from some human source . So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against tuberculosis in either cattle or birds , and should encourage in every way veterinarians and breeders to aim for its total destruction , ? a consummation which would be well worth all it would cost them , purely upon economic grounds , just as the extermination of human tuberculosis would be to the human race , ? yet we need not bear the burden of feeling that the odds against us in the fight for the salvation of our own species are so enormous as they would be , had we no natural protection against infection from animals and birds . The more carefully we study all causes of tuberculosis in children , the larger and larger percentage of them do we find to be clearly traceable to infection from some member of the family or household . In Berlin , for instance , Kayserling reports that seventy per cent of all cases discovered can be traced to direct infection from some previous human case . Lastly , what of the left wing of our army of extermination , composed of those light-horse auxiliaries ? the general progress and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual of the experiences of his ancestors , which we designate by the term " heredity " ? For many years we were in serious doubt how far we could depend upon the loyalty of this group of auxiliaries , and many of the faint-hearted among us were inclined to regard their sympathies as really // against us rather than with us , and prepared to see them desert to the enemy at any time . It was pointed out , as of great apparent weight , that consumption was decidedly and emphatically a disease of civilization ; that it was born of the tendency of men to gather themselves into clans and nations and crowd themselves into villages and those hives of industry called cities ; that the percentage of deaths from tuberculosis in any community of a nation or any ward of a city was high in direct proportion to the density of its population ; and that the whole tendency of civilization was to increase this concentration , this congestion of ground space , this piling of room upon room , of story upon story . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had caused the disease could help us to cure it ? But the improbable has already happened . Never has there been a more rapid and extraordinary growth of our great cities as contrasted with our rural districts , never has there been a greater concentration of population in restricted areas than during the past . thirty-five years . And yet , the prevalence of tuberculosis in that time , in all civilized countries of the earth , has shown not only no increase , but a decrease ( f from thirty-five to fifty per cent . To-day the world power which has the largest percentage of its inhabitants gathered within the limits of its great cities , England , has the lowest death-rate in the civilized world from tuberculosis , although closely pressed within the last few years by the United States , whose percentage of urban population is almost equally large , while England 's sister island ,
