 |p503  WE have seen the divine Raphael pass through life as if on wings , serenely beautiful , untouched by the great sorrows of the world , helped all along by kindness and applause . So we have seen Michelangelo an example of life full of sadness within a glory that accompanied him from youth to extreme old age . With him another of the g : eat artists , Rembrandt the only one to be placed by him , perhaps has some connection of deep feeling , of an interior life revealed only by his work , of an extraordinary aptitude and application as a workman , and of struggle against adverse fates . But while Michelangelo began and ended his long life in full recognition of his preeminence , leaving name and fortune to a family , Rembrandt , beginning in fair repute , continuing in deserved reputation , ends obscurely , less and less appreciated , misunderstood , disappearing in a shadow like that which envelopes the mystery of his paintings . This darkness closes upon him and his story , so as to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , indeed , even during the success of his life , the man himself is hidden . Of what he really was we can know but little except through his paintings , his etchings , his drawings . His extreme absorption in work , which during his good days was a happiness and during his bad days a relief , separated him as a great worker , little known to the men of his day , in such a way , at least , as we might have fairly expected . Now , at length , we know all the ordinary facts of his life , the legends have melted away , and we can follow year by year the quiet accomplishments of his  |p504  enormous tasks . Whatever of make-believe romance has faded , the real Rembrandt is still a poetic character from the very simplicity of his life and the feelings we have of an interior one that fills his work and is only known thereby . His fame has increased year by year to such an extent that he represents in the story of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which did not understand him . No one who has been to Holland but has felt the importance of his name , and his memory pervades the cities in which he somewhat obscurely worked . Rembrandt was born at Leyden , by a branch of the Rhine whose name his father had taken , and from which he gets his full name of Rembrandt Van Rijn . His father 's name was Harmen , hence his other name of Harmensz ; that is to say , Rembrandt , the son of Harmen of the Rhine . This was in 1606 . He was one of six children in a family of burghers of moderate wealth and the owners of a mill which has played some part in the legends of Rembrandt 's youth . It used to be said , and there may be something in it , that his pleasure in light and shadow , by which we know him most , began with his watching the sunlight fall into the gloom of the old mill . He was enrolled as a boy among the students of Latin literature at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , certainly for exemptions from taxation belonging to the members . The professors are still famous to this day . for law , literature , and theology . Among  |p505  them are Scaliger , Lipsius , Vossius , and that Arminus whose name remains for us in the story of the Calvinistic struggle . The printing-presses of Leyden were celebrated , and their fame remains . Leyden was , therefore , a city of intellectual and liberal culture , and it had also some masterpieces of earlier art . When the boy began to show in the usual way his predilection for art , and was wisely allowed by the family to begin its study at fifteen , he found a teacher in an artist of standing there , now almost forgotten , Van Swanenburch . We are told that under this gentlemanly painter the boy so distinguished himself during his three years of apprenticeship , that his fellow-citizens were interested in him , that his parents agreed that he should go to a more important artistic center , and that he was sent to Amsterdam to study under Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which to imagine the future Rembrandt to develop . He was an " Italianizer . " So the men were called who , having studied in Italy , brought back , as We do today from Paris , certain academic tendencies and imitations . Always in the beginnings of national work the prejudice is in favor of some art ready-made which can be copied . Though Rembrandt returned to Leyden after a few months ' study , he retained for some time , and perhaps through his entire life , certain smaller likings derived from this  |p506  influence . He also absorbed the tendencies of the men about him ; certainly the Dutch fidelity to nature , the observation of light and shade as a manner of enforcing this , and most certainly that excellent workmanship which seems to us outsiders an integral part of the Dutch character . Painting as a profession , as a trade , was possessed in perfection by the Dutch painters . They may be bold , or they may be timid ; they may have nothing to say , or a great deal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lesson as to the importance of knowing one 's trade . Therefore young Rembrandt had not to struggle against the difficulties of unlearning methods of mechanical work , and is not separated by his execution , even when most consummate , from the admirable scholastic qualities of the other men whom he overtopped by the simple fact that he was Rembrandt . Already by 1627 the " St. Paul in Prison , " which is the work of a youth , dry and harsh , shows that something more which he was to express , and which to express fully he needed a more accomplished and more skillful technique . This power developed rapidly . The St. Paul has already the type of what Rembrandt is about to give us -- the look of a portrait of a man actually known to the painter , represented with those incidents of ordinary life meant to convince us still more of the thing having really happened , of history being always the same ; even if , as often with him and other Dutch-  |p509  the anxiety to go still further in pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He remains pleased , sometimes triumphant , but not satisfied . Before him open still greater possibilities of more comprehensive achievement , either greater force , or greater sweetness , or greater synthesis . He seems to have been rapidly appreciated , to have been fairly paid , and so to have been taken to the greater center of Amsterdam as early as 1631 . We know where he lived in Amsterdam , and the house he purchased later , where much of his great work was done , and the little house at the end of the Canal of the Roses where he passed his last days of hard work and relative poverty . At first all went well with him . He married a girl of fortune , of good family , Saskia Van Uilenburg . He drew from her , and he painted her many times . He may have painted her before his marriage ; we have a sketch three days afterwards , as he has written on the margin . And he loved to place her in many attitudes , and in costumes more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing for himself . Never are these pictures sad or troubled . They represent a pleasant mind , perhaps a gay one , painted by a great mind , in youth and happiness , and the painter seems to have been happy . We see this in his portraits of himself and his friends . He paints and engraves and etches for many patrons and purchasers . All this work is successful , sometimes extraordinary in qualities of execution and vision of reality ; but as yet that special mark which is to distinguish him later , that of a deep penetration of his subject , has not appeared . Nothing interrupts his constant production . At some moment , perhaps with the loss of the sunshine of Saskia , who dies quite young ( 1642 ) , the expression of his work becomes more intense ; but no personaI distress loss of loved ones , loss of friends , of money and reputation ? appears to place any hindrance in the continual flow of his work . His sincerity of mind and love of nature show through all the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensation of what he sees is each time fairly and independently represented ; his mind sees further and further the make and quality of what he looks at . The singular perception of the mind of the subject of his portrait or imagined figure belongs to a later period . The beggars whom he liked to draw , the Jews who served him as models , are at first merely shown from the outside . Little by little we feel in the representation of poverty and of pain a growing sympathy , which is to be the mark of the greater Rembrandt . His sketches and etchings , as well as his paintings , describe home life his own or that of others ? in all the details of domesticity , with more and more sympathy , as if he sought for the very type of the study of the home . The Mother and the Child pass more and more into a typical representation . Family affections are embodied more and more distinctly in the pictures or the etchings . He is slowly passing into the power of representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps the steadiness of home allows him to see more distinctly the meaning and value of unheroic life ; of the life of any one , rich or poor ; of ordinary happiness or misfortune . His relations with the Jews ? the degraded , the poor , the wealthy , and the intellectual -- connect with his wish to use the Pible as the subject for these intuitions , and the sense of pity for man becomes more apparent . The fashion of his day allowed for such representations . No longer the great church paintings , meant to teach doctrine or to adorn a splendid worship , could be used as the method of expression of a painter 's feelings . In Holland , influenced by the Reformation , all , whether Catholic or Protestant , had dropped the ancient forms . But the Bible remained as a human inspiration , and any allusion to its study was easily understood . Upon these themes Rembrandt worked , bringing the events of a far-back epoch into dreams of ordinary life . All his study of the ordinary sights of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a true form to what he pictured , and to himself and to us the effect of a thing actually seen ; of a picture , not composed , but revealed at one blow , as if before the artist a curtain had risen and fallen . Whatever of convention he used , he tried to bring back to a knowledge of the Orient , with which he was well acquainted , as we know from his drawings made for himself . The costumes of the Jews whom he saw about him he modified by that acquired information . To us to-day , with a greater knowledge of the East as it is , these details are sometimes in the way . At his day they may have served the same purpose as our accuracies of the present , or the accuracies of various epochs which are always transient . We have said that we know of his uneventful life nothing but the actual documentary facts that belong to every one who his parents were ; that he studied ; that he painted ; that he married ; that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was successful , and had pupils , and was apparently in an assured position as an artist ; that he collected works of art which he studied assiduously ; that he accumulated also those masses of rubbish upon which painters depend for details and for encouragement of their belief in the reality of what they do ; and we have , by great luck , of all these a full catalogue , because they were sold by his creditors . We know that all this collection , worth great sums before and after that day , went for nothing , along with his paintings and his drawings , and the very linen put out to wash ; that the great war in which Holland was entangled had ruined him , with many others , by lowering all values suddenly , and stopping the purchase of such luxuries as paintings ; that he withdrew from his house , sold over his head , to small quarters and poor lodgings ; that his son , now growing up , and a trusted servant protected him in adversity by some legal arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , though daily producing work which grew more and more important , and reached the highest grade of technical power known to the art of painting ; that his son died ; that he married again , and died obscurely in that house on the Canal of the Roses . All this is an ordinary story , such as has always happened , and is only of value because it happened to him , and that we hope to know him better by these small details ; that is to say , that we may , perhaps , follow his course of development by the marks of exterior accidents ; but there is no clue that way to the constant progress and affirmation of power which follow him to the end . Misfortune or poverty seems to give still greater strength to his faculties and to his absorption in his profession . Only one thing can be traced ? that the lessons of life enrich his mind and are part of his work . More and more does his sympathy go out to the feelings of others . More and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of it , its perpetual lessons ? is embodied in every drama that he paints or draws , in the very portraits that he paints . The men and women , whoever they may be ? the artisan , the theologian , the nobleman , the professional man , the plain people or the wealthy ? are looked at each as having a history behind him . Something of an individual soul , unlike any other individual spirit , with special experience , shines within his portraits of imagined faces in a way that no one before or after him has attained , or even , perhaps , has dreamed of attaining . Each and all of these portraits are , as it were , historic . They are important , even if we have no idea of what they represent ; and , indeed , it is in those cases that this individuality of previous existence appeals to us most strongly . They are the nearest approach ever made to actual being , and perhaps exist more powerfully in the pictures than our unperceptive eyes could make out had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great portraits the refined crowd gazing upon them in the galleries seems tamer and less valuable . They are the common people , and Rembrandt 's paintings of any ordinary acquaintance are the elect and the wonderful . Within what antiquity called the person ? that is to say , the part we play in life ? appears the enormous value of the human soul . Something like this we feel before all great portraits , even when not painted with the multitude of details or the easy synthesis of Rembrandt . Something like this we feel in Raphael 's portraits , even if they belong to methods of painting early and tentative . Something like this with Velasquez , but reversely from Rembrandt . He goes no further than what is sufficient to express a character and to express a position in life , seeing what a gentleman may see without pretending to judge or fathom . Of course , in the continuous work of Rembrandt as a mere workman following his trade of painting to live by it , there are pieces which are necessarily the task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of the workman was tired . Even then these are masterpieces of some side of the painter 's art . Nor would it have been within the habit of his nation to throw away a work always honestly made as work ; and it may be worth our while today to notice that these very great artists are primarily workmen , without any pose or assumption of doing more than a daily task . They seem almost devoid of ambition . Their work is sufficient for them . The great applause of a contest with others appears alien to the integrity of the mind looking only at its own existence . I have spoken of the portraits , not only because they are famous and wonderful and well known , and we can appreciate them according to the gradations of our perceptions , but because that study of the actual fact seen , that we call realism , is the foundation upon which Rembrandt stood when he invented the probable appearance of things he had not seen , but which his mind wished to appear before  |p511  him ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes to the expression of feeling in his imaginary paintings or etchings . " Christ Healing the Sick , " the famous etching known as the HundredGuilder Print , tells the story in the nearest approach ever made to a realization of its importance . A description of it might make it appear too much to be the accumulation of facts . Others than Rembrandt might have thought of similar necessary details , but who could have brought them together so that one is inseparable from the other ? All the resources of what we call art -- that is to say , the arrangement of lines and spaces , the divisions of light and shade , the insisting on certain points and the elision of others ? are there , but so covered up that all seems accidental . But the real picture as it happened in its day would have been more accidental , and its meaning less visible . Who can forget the expression of the Christ , the manner in which he welcomes with blessing the embarrassed mother bringing up her unconscious child at the same time that He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to have Him troubled ? His extended hand welcomes the misery addressing him , and gently , with the same movement , puts aside the too great officiousness of Peter . All around Him are grouped the supplicants ? the paralytic faintly stretching out a helpless hand ; a daughter in expectant prayer ; the leper in agony of hope ; the disabled , patient cripple ; the impotent , blind old man , led by his aged wife ; the friends and relatives timidly recommending their charges ? the gay child , in perfect health , looking at it all as a piece of play ; and on the other side , in the full light of reason , the wise men and the Pharisees , watching with some curiosity and some interest this curious performance , while the apostles gaze steadily , in full belief , one of them half turning to argue , as if accustomed to such remonstrance ; while the elegant young man of fine sensibility looks on with sympathy , yet annoyed at the coarseness and ill-flavor of the miserable crowd . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine of representation and expression in art , of which Rembrandt is the great exponent , which he has made so completely his that we know him mostly through  |p512  it . It is what the language of the studios calls " chiaroscuro " ; that is to say , if we can define so complex a thing , the manner in which what we see merges from shade into light or retreats within the shadows . It has always been felt by painters and by all the sculptors who are complete . We like to see the form made more distinct by the indistinctness of a part . It marks the beauty of those times of the day where part of what we see passes into indistinct air , bringing out all the more into relief what is strongly lit . A struggle to express this can be seen in the Italian paintings , let us say of the Venetians or of Correggio , who used it as a form of sentiment ; in Leonardo , who studied it as science ; even in the arrangement of Michelangelo 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the distribution of his story ; and its secrets were being studied by the Dutchmen around Rembrandt . Rembrandt has insisted so much upon this , has made it so much a means of telling his story , has so used it to make certain things important and others relative , and to impart the mystery of the half seen to what he wished to be felt and understood , but which might distract the eye from what he wished it to see in perfect clearness , that this method of enlisting our interest and increasing our  |p513  belief in what he shows us seems to belong particularly to him . He has used it for all purposes , from the mere embellishment of an ordinary representation to the suggestion of sentiment or the vision of the supernatural . See how the light trembles around the mystic formula which appears at the call of Dr. Faustus , held up by guessed-at bands . See how , above it , the calm , steady fight of the big library window tells us how quiet the place was before the incantation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessary that it should contain , as it does , the initials that represent the name of the Saviour . Or , again , in the picture of " The Good Samaritan , " painted at a time when he must have wished for help ( 1648 ) , behold the story of the falling shadows ; for it is almost night , and in a moment , as soon as the kindly preserver has reached the door above the steps , the wounded , pitiful wayfarer will be safe and cared for . The painting is full of details of observation which many a painter would not dare to drown in shade as Rembrandt has done ? the dreamy landscape ; the quiet inn yard , with its stabled horses ; the tired beast , that has carried the burden ; and the boy at the reins , who looks over to see how ill this man may be ; the accuracy in rendering the different strength of the man and the boy carrying in the wounded ? all these homely observations are but a background for the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portrait forever of a helpless sufferer . Out of the gloom appears his face , his eyes half closed , one brow lifted , and his lips opened with a tired groan half of relief and half of pain . His chest sinks in , his body drops , and his naked legs turn one around the other . One feels how much he feels himself what a trouble he is to those who help him . Of the actual painting all has been said in praise ; but one can not exaggerate the interest with which every detail is followed , not one trifle more than is necessary , but fully made out where necessary , and all rendered with a sincerity which has not the slightest sign of cleverness . All through Rembrandt 's work , and it is his mark , except in the work of the mere boy pleased with his success , there is no sign that the painter knew how wonderfully he had succeeded . Not even later , when he has gained at length , just before the end , that complete connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime . Or , again , around the head of the Christ at Emmaus as he breaks bread and the disciples recognize him , the light in the dark room has a something of phosphorescence , of a tone and color which belong to that face of the dead man risen after having suffered , and whose hands break bread slowly , as if to give time to the astonished disciples to realize who is with them . As I said , all this telling of a story by light and shade presupposes below its sentiment and romance and mystery the solid foundation of profound attention to form and gesture . Drawing for its own sake , color for its own sake , do not exist for Rembrandt . They are all so fused together that in such . a picture as that just mentioned the execution is so simple and yet so involved that no one would dare to think of the possibility of copying it . And yet for many there has been a great desire to imitate him in some obvious ways , and his pupils were many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of the master . We do not know what he taught . It must have been of extraordinary importance , for it involves all that there is in the art of painting . He might have shown them the secrets of his earlier work , which is more connected with the work of the Dutchmen around them . He was careful , apparently , of their individuality , and taught them separately ; though also they must have helped him , as was the fashion of all in those days . They did , even in his etchings , the method of which is more personal than can be that of painting , because there are fewer steps between the beginning and the end ; while painting , which is made up of surfaces covered one by the other , may allow indefinite amount of work , well directed by one man , to be covered completely by the last veilings and touches , which are really the painting that we see . Why did he change as he went along ? Why was he not suited with his manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Dr. Tulp addresses the regents or inspectors of the hospital ? Surely this masterpiece of his early days ( for he was only twenty years old ) is a work sufficiently perfect and complete . We recognize that his great characteristic is the anxiety to express still more in the same direction . The painter of appearances had early attained a power of formulation sufficient for a great place in art . Apparently the student and worker kept on observing the infinite modifications of nature . These studies were accompanied by the experiences of life . To express that succession of experience and feeling , which was himself , some more intimate , more delicate , more powerful means were necessary than what might do to paint  |p514  a handsome face , or brilliant eyes , or the velvets and satins which make , for instance , the portraits of Burgomaster Van Beeresteyn and his wife ( owned by Mr. H. 0 . Havemeyer ) so delicious to the eye , so sincere and honest in the rendering of the things seen . As time went on he risked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain details . He had for his use only his past habits ? his own and those of his school ? for he differs only from them by being what we call Rembrandt . He had about him common models , or , at the best , people whose forms were not heroic . The habits about him were vulgar where they were not plain and orderly . The costumes were sober , or , if rich , were eccentric . He had little of what is called exquisite taste , nor did he differ in that from those about him . He seems to have admired it in the men of the past , but to have had a perfect wisdom which prevented his gathering what he could not fully use , what he could not test by the life of every day . What is bad taste in him belongs to others around him . What is distinct and beautiful is apparently his alone . For the building of the great structure of the painter , the planes and directions of planes , the intersection of lines , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings must have made him master . Even in the paintings occasionally , in the obscurity of corners , he resorts to those abbreviations which his etchings and drawings show , a manner of starting only a few points which the mind fills in . I remember in a painting of " The Christ at Emmaus " which is at Copenhagen , and which I copied in my youth , trying to follow , touch by touch , a great dog lost in the shade , appearing occasionally to the eye as if a little more light might make him more distinct ; and this beast was made only of five or six touches of definite space and color , being in paint what the few scratchings of his etchings suggest to us in black and white . Perhaps , after all , the etchings and drawings tell us more about himself , about his completeness of study , his intensity of perception , and the extraordinary sympathy and feeling which separate him from all other artists . There he could for he was Rembrandt throw away the greater part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he worked entirely for himself , we see still more intimately the mind of the master . But they are so subtle , they appeal to such a perception of nature , such a sympathy with the expression of the soul , that they require in the mind that looks at then a sympathy that all can not give . At my age and after long experience I can say so . As a younger man I only guessed at it . With the great public and for us of the profession , the famous picture , painted seven years before his death , known as " The Syndicate of the Drapers ' Guild , " represents , perhaps , the result of all his work as a mere painter . In it he is young again , notwithstanding his approaching age ; but all that he has learned , his thoughts during life , have helped him make it . All the more do we feel this , because this one picture brings in nothing but portraits , all separate and individual , but so connected that one sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in " The Lesson on Anatomy . " They are doing nothing in particular more than what would take them around a table to listen to the reading of accounts , and yet the appearance of importance of a number of men chosen for a purpose of decision has never before or afterwards been so well expressed . They almost speak , but do not open their lips . They are not posed . They are there . The slightest change , and they would be sitting for their portraits , but they are not . They have , as it were , been surprised by somebody 's opening the door , by some paper brought to them , and one sees what they have been doing before , and what they will return to . The painting as mere painting is as wonderful as that of the most beautiful surfaces ever covered by the brush . Rembrandt has joined here to deep appreciation of character that observation of life as it looks , which was the aim of his art ; that is , of the artist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , apart from a few paintings , is better seen through the etchings or the drawings . They have all the superiority that belongs to the dependence on few things and a careful selection in those . Not that they are separated from his pictures in any way , nor can we disentangle them . But we see in them his predilections and the external things on which he bases his dreams . For , after all , it is as the great dreamer that Rembrandt stands almost alone , unless we choose to think of him with such other dreamers as Michelangelo or Shakespeare . He remains the great exponent of the pity and tenderness of Bible story , of its being of all times and a synopsis of all human life ; and he remains , as well , the master of many realities , the poet of the mystery of light , and the painter of the individual human soul .
