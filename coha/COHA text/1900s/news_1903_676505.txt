txt The embarrassment of J. William Middendorf &; Co. of this city and John L. Williams &; Sons of Richmond , the two banking houses that have developed the Seaboard Air Line Railroad-Company , caused a little uneasiness in financial circles to-day , but no trouble or excitement . The greatest sympathy is manifested for Mr. Williams and " Mr. Middendorf , not only among financiers in Baltimore , but also 144 New York and Philadelphia . This message came from Edwin Gould : " Hope you will speedily arrange temporary difficulties . You have our best wishes , and we wish we could help you in some way further . " The chief creditors of the two banking houses are understood to be several Baltimore banks and banking houses in Now York , Philadelphia , Pittsburg , and several in New England that loaned money on Seaboard securities or collateral . Two or three Baltimore firms-reported to have been caught heavy by the drop in Seaboard have been tided over by the banks withholding any calls for margins and by not placing any Seaboard stock &; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the banks here as well as in other cities are helping the situation and will do all they can to sustain the Seaboard . Mr. Williams said this afternoon : " Our assets are more than sufficient to pay our obligations , and no person will lose a cent . Neither . the Seaboard nor any of the other corporations in which we are interested can possibly be injured by our embarrassment . " Mr. Williams said the . report he had resigned the Presidency of the Seaboard was absolutely . untrue . The committee to take charge of affairs of both houses held a pre ' liminary conference this afternoon . The 1 situation is being investigated to determine I the proper recommendation to be made to creditors . The only cause of the embarrassment of Williams &; Son and Middendorf &; Co. was the continued ' decline in Seaboard during the past year from 30 ' for common to ' 12% , which it touched to-day . Mr. Williams said to-night that the selection of B. F. Yoakum , the President of the St. Louis and San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seaboard was decided upon two weeks ago , and bore no relation to the present situation . Some time ago Williams and Middendorf and their friends gave an option on 125,000 shares to a syndicate , which included B. P. Yoakum , H. Clay Pierce , Chairman of the Mexican Central Railroad ; B. F. Guinness of Ladenburg , Thalmann &; Co. , and Okleigh Thorne , President of the North Amer .. lean Trust Company . This option is to run one year more . For common stock the syndicate agreed to pay $20 a share and for preferred $35 . The syndicate has exercised the option on 30,000 shares , leaving 05,000 shares still to be taken . It is their evident intention to buy.sufficient stock in the open market to give them control and then sell the property to the Rock Island system . Williams and Middendorf and their friends still own 75 per cent . of the Seaboard stock. , , , ? . ; , - ? - : ; . ' . , Douglas H. Thomas , President " of the Merchants ' National Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wok- into the condition of the two firms , said to-day : " When it becomes generally understood how exacting an examination was made of the Seaboard Air Line before Yoakum , Pierce , and their associates went into the property there will be a quick change in the view as to the value of its securities . They have enlisted international bankers in the proposition and regard it as a railroad property with one of the best futures of any in the country . " Before making any investment they had a physical examination of the property made . They found its condition to be very good . They also had the books of the company audited , and found that after making the most liberal allowance for operating expenses and maintenance and the payment of all fixed charges , there was a surplus of $800,000 for the year . " The advisory committee which met and made a part:al examination of the books of Middendorf &; Co. this afternoon states that it found everything satisfactory . The committee also received assurances from New York and Baltimore parties of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerning the great amount of money made by the Baltimore parties and Seaboard securities when the boom was on , one large holder says he was getting rich so fast that lie was frightened and actually afraid to go to sleep lest he wake up and find it was but a glittering dream . " It is well-known in local financial circles that on the dissolution of the old firm of Middendorf . Oliver &; Co . William B. Oliver retired with a snug fortune , said to be considerably over $500,000 , the bulk of which was made from Seaboard securities . Those concerned with the promotion of the property had extended credit both here and in New York , and borrowed freely , for the im-. provements contemplated . " There was no disturbance in financial circles here to-day . After the first surprise was over there was evidence on all sides that the local . financial situation was in a healthy condition . Leading bankers and brokers were ready to lend helping hands to prevent any temporary unsettlement of the market from going too far , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there would be a joint meeting of bankers and brokers for this purpose , bat it was not held . Inquiry among the heads of banking institutions developed the fact that the general feeling was that the local situation did not need any help , and that:as soon as people began to view conditions clearly it would show an improvement . This view was so widely held that the suggestion of a meeting to take action to protect holders of securities was dropped .
