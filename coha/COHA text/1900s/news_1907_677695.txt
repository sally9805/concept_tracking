Virginia Ida Barlsh , 17 years old , of 410 East Seventy-ninth Street , was attacked by nine men at North Beach on Wednesday , and is now violently insane in the Kings County Hospital . None of her assailants has been found . Another case is reported from Linoleumville . S. I. , where five-year-old Annie - Powkowski wandered home terribly injured .

Police Commissioner Bingham said yesterday that during the epidemic of this tort of crime it would be well for the mothers of the city to keep their children indoors as much as possible , and to keep watch over them more closely than ever . Every member of the police force has been ordered to be particularly on the alert , especially where young girls and children congregate , and where : ley can be reached by men of suspicions appearance . The police have been instructed to place under arrest at once any man whom they have the slightest cause to suspect . Pollee Say Courts Do n't Ald.

There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young girl wus allowed to go free , despite the fact that the pence declared that they had strong evidence against him . The Police Inspector of the district in which the assault occurred reported the result of the hearing before the Magistrate to Commissioner Bingham . The Commissioner said yesterday he appreciated that the conditions were such now that drastic action was needed , but that the police could not always get the assistance of the courts when prisoners were carried before the bar . " I quite appreciate that this wave of assault has grown to Increased proportions of late . " he said , " and while I can not entirely account for It , I do not I think it is entirely due to neglect on the ' part of the police or to the immigrants thatcome to this city .

" Then , too , there Is the same old reason that prevents the police from doing good work . There are not enough men to patrol the city properly , especially those parts of It where crimes such as we are dicussing are likely to occur . " I do not know why there was no patrolman near the scene of the crime at North Beach when little Mies Bariab was attacked on Wednesday , as charged by Deputy Sheriff Talbot of Queens County . I have , however , ordered Inspector Nally to make a sweeping investigation of the circumstances and report to me as soon as possible . " In the meantime I have also ordered that every available man be put to work tracing the assailants of young girls who have not already been arrested , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I will know the reason why . " The opinion was expressed at Police Headquarters yesterday was that the plin:shment for this crime was not sufficient to meet the conditions . It was shown that while a man Could be imprisoned for life for the offense , there was no law that prevented the cases being treated as simple assaults with punishment of one month or more in prison . It was suggested that efforts be made to procure legislative enactments that would prevent the imposition of light sentences in these cases . Some of the Cages on Record .

Last Wednesday afternoon , while Deputy Sheriff Talbot of Queens County was walking along the shore at the north end of Bowery Bay , North Beach , he saw a scantily clad young girl run out of a clump of bushes and plunge into the surf . She appeared to be getting as far from the shore as possible , with the intention of drowning herself . Talbot plunged into the water and made his way to the young woman , all the time yelling for assistance . He managed to reach her side , but she used every possible effort to shake him off . Finally , with the assistance of several men who had answered his call , the girl was brought to the shore , where she was covered with men 's coats and quieted as much as possible . When she had been calmed she told of having been lured to the woods and attacked by nine men . She led the party to the woods . where her skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing scattered about , torn into shreds .

It was suggested last night that possibly the girl 's story grew from an already disordered mind , though this did not account for the bruises found on her body and the clothes found in the woods . It was said at North Beach that during the afternoon she was alone and played a number of the games along the shore . When called upon to pay she said she had no money .
