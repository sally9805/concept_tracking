 | WHEN the nineteenth century reached its appointed end , the bells rang out in joyous peal , as for the accession of a new sovereign . They rang for the boys and the young men . For those whom the new-comer found grey-bearded and stricken with years , the bells were as the rolling of muffled drums ; for them the bells proclaimed a funeral , rather than a coronation . Their youth and lustihood belong to the century that has just gone ; well for them if their work does not also belong to the years that are past ! As I write this paper I find myself , naturally , speaking from an English point of view . In many ways , American readers will contrast their own institutions with ours . They will perceive that we have been steadily , yet often unconsciously , drifting more and more toward their ways and their views . I shall abstain from commenting on things distinctively American , because they are American and not English . Most of the " burden " of which I speak is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that which concerns the whole of humanity ? is , above all , American . The burden of the nineteenth century , so far as England is concerned , may be summed up in two clauses : ( 1 . ) It had to get rid of its predecessor ; ( 2 . ) It had to prepare the way for its successor . That is to say , it inherited a mass of ideas , prejudices , practices , inequalities , evils of every kind , which had , somehow , before anything new could be attempted , to be unloaded and shovelled into the dust bin . It had , next , to prepare for its successor by founding and beginning many new things : by the extension of education ; by the developments of science ; by the preaching and teaching of wider views as to civil rights and responsibilities ; by the application to philanthropy of methods formed upon a study  | of human laws and tendencies , and by many other ways of which it was itself , perhaps , unconscious . The separation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because we retained the forms of the old aristocracy , while we swept away its powers ; and we kept the name of an Established Church , while we abolished its exclusive privileges . Yet the separation has been so great as to amount to a revolution more drastic even than that of the sixteenth century . And , as for the work of preparation for the present century , it was accompanied by an intellectual activity which has done even more for science than the Renaissance did for literature . I desire , here , to show briefly how the breaking away from the eighteenth century was necessary before the practical application of the new ideas was possible ; and how , when this had been partially accomplished , the achievements , the developments , the inventions , the discoveries and the research which followed have an been contributions to , and preparations for , the heritage of work which we are now handing on to our successors of the twentieth century . Let us consider the work of destruction and the work of preparation as they went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main lines . First , in the line of religion . What we found , when the nineteenth century succeeded to the eighteenth , as the dominant religion , whether in the Church or among the Nonconformists , was a fiery , fierce and aggressive Calvinism . There are many still living who can remember the despair , the hopeless misery , of millions , due to the continued discussions and sermons on Free Will , Election and Predestination . I can myself recall the solemn voice of the preacher who warned us , almost every Sunday ? remember that he firmly believed what he said ? that but very few of his congregation had the least chance of being saved ; that , from eternity , and before the world was mad , nearly all of us were predestined to everlasting torture . Well , we have silenced these speculations ; men of learning , men of science , men of culture , refuse any longer to discuss questions as unfathomable as that of the beginning and the end of space . This abandonment of Calvinism is part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preparation , has not been so happy . It was , perhaps , inevitable that , with the decay of the Cal- vinistic school , and with the adoption of a more humane creed , there should be revived the old controversy of Man versus Priest . The Church of England is now entering anew upon an acute form of that controversy ? so acute that , if it is followed up , the Church will undoubtedly be rent in twain and the National Church will cease to exist . There are already within its divided fold two well formed camps : the one containing those who want no priest and will acknowledge no priestly pretensions ; the other , those who find rest in the shelter of authority , accepting , as the price to be paid , the domination of the priest over their lives , their thoughts , their reason , their sense , and their philosophy . Before Disestablishment actually takes place , there will be mountains of literature to be read ; there will be a flood of talk . But the most effective arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , not to speak of our great Colonies , religion takes no harm where there is no Established Church . Some of us will regret the loss of an institution venerable and beautiful ; glorious for the saints and divines , the martyrs and confessors , the scholars and teachers who have adorned its history . But we shall let it go in full confidence that , as in America , so here , religion does not need a National Creed . But the way for such a settlement of a quarrel , never to be adjusted while the disputants live under the same roof , had to be prepared , and it has taken us a hundred years of work , mostly unconscious work , in that direction . First , the claims of the sacerdotal party were advanced , formulated , defended , and , as far as possible , made popular . This was done with great craft and subtlety . Its advocates enlisted on their side the growing desire for art in everything : beauty in buildings ; beauty in ritual ; beauty in decoration ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attraction of services which no longer offended the artistic and esthetic sense . On the other hand , the old intolerance , which drove the Nonconformist out of society , had to be wholly swept away . This , if you think of it , was part of the necessary preparation for the schism of the immediate future . Formerly , a Nonconformist could not enter the House of Commons ; nor could he hold any municipal office ; nor could he accept a commission in the AI my or in the Navy ; nor could he take a degree at Oxford or Cambridge ; nor could he become a barrister ; nor could he be married or buried ,  | except according to the rites of the Church of England . All this is now changed ; every restriction has been removed ; the former social inferiority of the Dissenter is vanishing , and things are nearly , if not quite , ready for the great measure of Disestablishment which is part of the Burden of the Twentieth Century . Let us next turn to the Government . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axe , had to be applied . The eighteenth century bequeathed us government by an oligarchy . A small caste ruled the country . The very stronghold of liberty , the Folk Mote , the House of Commons , had been transformed into a stronghold of caste . The ruling party consisted of a few hundred families ; there were hardly enough of them for the division of the spoils . They had seized and held for themselves all the power and all the places ; they were Ministers and Secretaries of State ; they ruled all the Departments ; they commanded the army and the fleets ; they commanded the regiments and the ships ; all the posts of honor , all the distinctions , all the lucrative preferments were in the hands of the caste . The Ministry and the Opposition both belonged to the caste ; the House of Commons was filled with younger sons of the caste ; they sat on opposite sides , but they were agreed upon one point , viz. : that there should be no Reform of Parliament , and that the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by right divine . It is , I believe , difficult to get an American , unless he is a student of history , to understand the conditions of government under which the nineteenth century began its work . It is equally difficult for him to understand the immense work of destruction and reconstruction that has been accomplished during the century . Both destruction and reconstruction have been carried through in the same direction . That is to say , every step has been a step forward toward the government of the people by the people . Thus the House of Commons now represents all people , including the caste itself , and every class , rank and degree of the people . There is , practically , universal suffrage in Great Britain ; the Civil Service , the Army , and the Navy , are all thrown open to competition . We now see , not only the younger sons but also the peers themselves becoming candidates for election at County Councils , School Boards and Borough Councils ; while the House of Lords , receiving every year new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly whose function is , practically , to take care  | that important measures shall not be passed until they are clearly proved to be the will of the people . This represents a good body of work . How far is it incomplete ? And what remains for the twentieth century by way of completion in this branch ? There are two tasks , at least , before the new century , in carrying on the work of construction . First , it is not enough to give the people the machinery of government ; they must also be instructed in the use of the machinery . In other words , it is not enough to place the representation of the country in the hands of the people ; the people must also be taught the duty of exercising their rights . It would be , in fact , far better for the people even to continue in the hands of a ruling caste , who were at least patriotic and who had clean hands , than to be in the power of needy adventurers and interested demagogues who rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neglect of electors . The duty of the citizen is a lesson the teaching of which must be seriously undertaken , and , once begun , must be never again allowed to slip out of sight . The other task is the opening up of all the intellectual careers to lads who are capable , clever , and ambitious ; though their poverty has hitherto been an insuperable bar to their advancement . Everything , it is true , is nominally open . Practically , however , to the poor British lad , there are but two lines of life possible , outside the craft to which he belongs : he may become a teacher in a Board school ; or a reporter and a journalist . Before the entrance gate of every profession , whether that of barrister , solicitor , physician , surgeon , officer , architect , artist , clergyman , or teacher of the higher class , there stands a turnpike , and at the gate is the turnpike man , whose name is Rhadamanthus . He comes out scowling , and holds out an inexorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not , you shall not enter here . " How can this inflexible guardian be abolished ? That , you see , is part of the work of our successors . They must find out the way . Perhaps they may be induced to look across the ocean . There they will see colleges whose fees are low ; where the cost of living is small , whose degrees in themselves confer the right to practice any profession , the art and mystery of which they teach . We must , on the one hand , teach our lads the dignity and the worthiness of crafts , arts , and industries , but we must throw  | open the door to those lads who crave for the intellectual life and will be content with none other . We have already begun with ladders of scholarships , to lift such lads up to the level of the learned professions : but that is only a beginning . The difficulty is one which belongs to the whole question of education . The nineteenth century inherited from its predecessor a baleful legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly dangerous to educate the people . This prejudice lingers yet in some quarters . We have so far got rid of it , however , that we enjoy at last a system of free national education , the right of every child . This is a great step ; it sweeps away old ideas , as so much lumber ; but it is only a step ; it is a beginning . It opens a door to an empty hall : we have to furnish this hall . We have , in fact , to find out what national education should mean . For thirty years , we have been carrying on a succession of experiments , learning little or nothing from other countries , and paying small heed to their experience . I doubt if there is a single member of the London School Board who could pass an examination on the American system of national education , even though it is conceded , by all who have examined into it , to be better than our own . The history , however , of these experiments is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have still to invent , or to discover , a system of education broad enough , and elastic enough , to include not only the ambitious and clever lad , but also the children destined for crafts , industries , and arts of all kinds ; one that will make them good citizens , not ignorant of their civic rights , and alive to their civic duties . At present , our School Boards , by means of classes in shorthand , classes in commercial law , classes in foreign languages , and in other things which do not belong to the crafts and arts , are doing their mischievous best to persuade the people that the life of a clerk , with its long hours , its drudgery , and its miserable pay , is better , more " respectable " and more dignified than the life of the engine-room and the workshop . No greater blunder was ever made in the history of National Education . I come next to the important question of trades unions . Here , indeed , we have broken clean away from the eighteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only made a beginning . It is , again , the opening of the door to empty chambers . " Covins , " i. e. , combinations of craftsmen , were forbidden , and rigidly suppressed ,  | for seven hundred years in the City of London . With great difficulty , and only by persistence , we have succeeded in removing the legal prohibitions , bit by bit . The crafts can now form unions as much as they please . So far , we have prepared the way . We hand over to the twentieth century the trades unions , whose right to exist has been firmly established by ourselves . We hand over very little more than that right . It is a mass of raw material for Our successors to work upon . Hitherto , the unions have had but one object , the exaction of shorter hours and higher pay . This has been the first exercise of their rights . It is , of course , a natural beginning . Just as on the simple instinct of self-preservation has been erected the whole structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoveries ; so , resting on the simple desire of greater ease and comfort , the trades unions were first created and have been successfully established . They are now , perhaps , ready for the higher developments . These will include jealousy for the craft itself , for its worthiness and its dignity ; special education in the craft ; pensions and sick funds for the craft ; the maintenance of civic responsibilities and duties ; an ever careful watch over the material interests of the craft , the weekly wage , the production , foreign competition , the markets , the trade interests , as protected by legislation ; and the provision of arbitration when the two sides , hitherto irreconcilable ? Capital and Labor ? disagree . A very noble piece of work for the twentieth century ! If we turn next to the daily manners and customs , it is wonderful to consider in how many ways we have broken clean away from the eighteenth century . For instance , there are the old habits of drinking . At a certain election dinner , about the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down at five o'clock and continued sitting over their wine and punch the whole night through . At the great City dinners it was not , formerly , unusual for men to drink three , and sometimes six , bottles of port ; on Sunday morning , when the good folks were on their way to church , they would have to pass dozens of men , dead drunk , laid out on the pavement to recover in the cold air . Nay , this excessive drinking was carried on well into the middle of the century . I myself can remember , as a common sight , the bottle nose ; the nose decorated with red blossoms ; the pendulous nose , caused by punch and port . I have been assured by a veteran  | officer that , when he joined his regiment in the thirties , he had to sit every evening for three hours after dinner , drinking port ; and this at the age of sixteen ! At Oxford and Cambridge , the resident Fellows used to sit over their port every evening for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port . A physician , who died in 1890 at the age of seventy-two , told me that , when he began to go into society , the dinners , which were simple , were finished by half past seven ; that , after the dinner , the men sat over their port till eleven or so ; that many of them drank their three bottles ; that they then adjourned to the drawing-room , where they were offered hot brandy and water ! He added that it was very rare for these topers to get past the age of fifty . At all events , we have changed all this . At the clubs , or the restaurants , it is rare , indeed , to find any one drinking wine after dinner . In private houses , I think , no one does so ; at dinner parties , the sitting after the ladies has become a mere form ? a survival of the old custom : our ancestors will , no doubt , be grateful to us for introducing this moderation . It is , however , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach the working man to combat his perpetual thirst , which is but a bad habit , not a disease . At present , he is ready at all times of the day for his " half pint . " We have checked or destroyed drunkenness in our Navy ; we have been unable , so far , to destroy it in the Army . In the lowest classes , in the city slums , drinking is still common among the women . There is a great deal to be done in this branch , even though much has already been done . Of late years , our own activity in the cause of temperance may compare favorably with the American endeavors in the same direction . Drinking is only one of the customs we have improved . Remember that the eighteenth century gave us , as a part of our inheritance , a widespread custom of gambling . High and low , the people gambled : there were the hells for the aristocracy , where whole estates were lost in a single night ; there were the smaller gaming tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stolen money . Every year there were lotteries , during which the whole nation went mad with the excitement of gambling . Where is that habit gone ? There are now no hells , great or small . It is whispered that certain men gamble , but it is with closed doors ; it is rumored that play is carried on here and  | there for high stakes , but there is no mention of estates changing hands in a single night . The " Hooligan " and the lads of the gutter are gamblers , the Polish Jews are gamblers ; men " back their fancy " for a horse race ; but gambling , as a national vice , has been scotched , if not killed . Again , we inherited a callous habit of brutal sports . We were encouraged by our predecessors to bait bull and bear , to draw the badger , to maintain the cockpit , to encourage the prizering . We have suppressed , in the interests of posterity , most of these amusements . The desire for them , even the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made certain inquiries as to the form and internal arrangements of the cockpit . I can hear of only two specimens surviving , and these are imperfect . Yet , a hundred years ago , there was not a village without its cockpit . Here , again , our work is good from a destructive point of view , but it is incomplete . We have swept away , with sports that were brutal , sports that were manly . It will be a part of the work of our successors to revive and to restore the latter . They will institute , in every town , physical education , under the guise of sport ; the gymnasium , foot-racing , wrestling , athletics , even single-stick practice and boxing , will be restored to our lads , as part of the national training . Again , we found our prisons hot-beds of infectious fever ; in these horrible places , besides the criminals , there were languishing debtors , sometimes for a few shillings , locked up for life , doomed to semi-starvation . Every evil that one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now cleansed our prisons ; gaol fever is no more known ; we have put an end to the more flagrant evils of the past . Next , we have tried our hands at prison discipline and prison reform . Our experiments in this branch of work have proved a series of horrible failures . There is no country in the world where the prison system is so hard , so cruel , so terrible , as our own ; it is an ironclad system , which takes his manhood , his self-respect , his power of will , out of the wretch who serves his sentence . It leaves him pitifully submissive , slavishly docile . To watch this poor caitiff , on the day when he returns to the world , is to bring tears of pity and of shame to the eyes . We hand over this gigantic failure to our successors . " Do better , " we say ? " you can not do worse ? for the poor prisoners . While you make their punishment sharp and real , leave them their manhood and  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too much ? oh ! my brothers ! ? for these poor backsliders ! " In the nature of communications , internal and oceanic , we may at least congratulate ourselves . We inherited a fine system of high roads , a well appointed service of stage coaches , a good postal service , and a magnificent fleet of sailing vessels . We also inherited a population mainly rural , and practically tied to the soil . The people of one town saw nothing of any other town ; foreign travel was unknown ; the insular ignorance of our people , as regards foreign nations , was colossal . We have now introduced new methods of communication ; we travel rapidly and cheaply ; we travel all over our country , and all over the world . All classes travel . Parties of workingmen are made up for the Continent . Board-school teachers arc carried to Florence for a fortnight 's study of art . The suburban shopman is met in Switzerland . The clerk runs all over the country in his three weeks ' holiday . We can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all round the world in two months . If increased rapidity of communication is an advance in civilization we have truly advanced . Well , rapidity of communication should certainly be an instrument of advance . Yet our work is , after all , one of preparation . We have discovered a new force with which we have already done great things ; we talk to each other across thousands of miles by means of it , we light our cities and our houses with it , we drive engines with it ; we have only , so far , begun to understand its possibilities . It is for our successors to make this force a servant of humanity far more useful , far more obedient , far more intelligent than steam . What will our successors do with this force ? If one may be allowed to prophesy , I would point to our ships . We have increased their speed from six or eight knots an hour to five and twenty , or even thirty . Is there no simpler machinery than the steam-driven screw and the paddle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies over the water ; she does not plough through it ; she presents a smooth round breast , and she beats the surface rapidly with her strong pinions . The ship of the future will be shallow and round in build , like the duck ; she will be provided with a row of wing-like propellers ; she will not plough the waters , but will skim them with her electric wings , and her speed will be , not thirty knots , but a hundred and fifty ; and it  | will take no longer to get from Liverpool to New York than it now takes to get from London to Marseilles . As regards law and its administration , we inherited a fine old cumbrous collection of courts and procedures . It seems difficult to understand how people could ever be induced to enter upon an action at law , considering the delays , the cost , and the doubt attending any action . A case dragged on for year after year , from one decade to another ; the estate , meanwhile , was bleeding at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their part , accepted the situation ; they even encouraged the delays , out of sympathy with their former brethren of the bar . We have improved things in this respect , but some of the cumbrous methods remain . The suitor can not , as in the United States , place his case directly in the hands of the barrister , nor arrange with him as to the cost of proceedings , and ? a formidable obstacle in the way of justice ? he is always liable to pay the costs of the other side . In other words , justice for a poor man is , practically , still most difficult , if not impossible . Moreover , everything is done by the Courts themselves to make an action terrible and an ordeal even to the strongest . The witness is raised high above the whole court in a box , a position in itself most trying to a nervous person ; and though the ancient bullying of the Bar has now become mitigated , some of it still exists ; the traditions of brow-beating and terrifying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , always that terrible danger of being ordered to pay the costs of the other side . It will be for our successors to make justice accessible to every one , to remove the terrors of an action , to allow any one to plead in person , or to have direct access to a barrister ; to plead in forma pauperis ; to be treated by the Bar with courtesy ; not to be set in pillory above all the people ; and no longer to be saddled with lie danger of paying the costs of the other side . If these reforms are ever carried , it will be against the whole weight and influence of Bench and Bar , unless Bench and Bar change their present mind ; but it will result in multiplying cases by the hundred ? in other words , in causing the Courts of Law to be regarded as the natural arbitrators of every dispute , instead of a few only : in giving work to many hundreds of lawyers ; in amalgamating the two branches ; and all to the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity , or of income , to the profession .  | After the law , medicine . Here , indeed , we hand over a mass of work incomplete , but splendid with illustrious beginnings . We have introduced sanitary reforms into our towns , our streets , and our houses ; we have cleansed and purified our hospitals ; we have sent women back ? with honor ? to their old work of nursing , but nursing trained and scientific ; we have learned how to see the very inside of a living man ; we have discovered how , without giving him pain , to cut open any part of him , and to operate upon him for almost any length of time . The last discovery is beyond everything admirable and worthy of praise and thanksgiving . But it is commonly spoken of as the end , whereas it is only the beginning . The operation is painless ? that is true ; but , after the operation , where is then our anesthetic ? When the wounds have to be dressed ? that is , daily ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ready to hand and it is freely used ; in the houses and in Nursing Homes , it can not be used without setting in motion a whole machinery of doctors called in for the purpose . " Give us , " we say to our successors , " an anesthetic which can be easily and readily applied in the long hours and days of pain that follow the operation , as well as in the agony intolerable of the operation itself . So will the bed of sickness lose its terrors , and the soul , if it has to leave the body , will not be torn out of it with throes of suffering , but will gently pass away in painless roma . " There is a great deal more for medical students of the next century : we put into their hands , indeed , plenty of failures . We have failed to cure gout , asthma , rheumatism , cancer , consumption , and paralysis , without speaking of other " plaguy diseases " which afflict mankind . All that we can do at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventive . We can cure none of these diseases . Will our successors prove more competent than ourselves ? We have , at least , prepared the way for a more scientific treatment ; we have discovered bacillus , and bacteria : we have invented antiseptic treatment . Perhaps , by their aid , our children will cease to regard disease as an evil which science may alleviate but can never remove . In no branch of intellectual endeavor does the sense of incompleteness weigh upon us so strongly as in the branch of medicine ; yet in no branch have the achievements of the nineteenth century been more remarkable .  | I must pass over much that remains . Our care of the poor has been another egregious failure . We have not made up our minds about out-door relief : we have made the " House " a prison ; we have failed to devise a working scheme of pensions , and the respectable poor regard with horror the necessity of taking refuge in the gloomy mansion where the unfortunate paupers are ordered about like criminals , and ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only one out of hundreds , could one find space enough . There is a question , as old as history itself , always disputed , never settled . This question should , if the present order continues , receive an answer during the present century . The question is whether political society is to be a machinery for enabling a few to keep the many in subjection ; or whether every man shall be allotted his equal share in government , and his equal opportunities of working for the community . In other words , is government by the people possible ? Is it desirable ? Is it better for the people than government by an aristocracy ? And shall it prevail ? It is not to us , nor to any European state , that the world looks for an answer to this most momentous question . It is to America , and to America alone , that we must look . You have now had for more than a hundred years a government by the people ; it is not a passing experiment , like one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settled form ; an American , even of the second generation , has it in his blood . We have had , as you have seen , an enormous amount of destructive legislation to get through before we could get the people into their place . You started without any obstructive caste . But the answer to the question proposed above must be based on a long experience . After two hundred years , let the world turn to America for an answer . Never before has the experiment of popular government been made on so great a scale , or for so long a time ; never before have the conditions been free from caste , aristocracies or oligarchies . It is a question the importance of which , to the future of humanity , can not be exaggerated . Would that in the year 1999 or 2000 one could come back to earth , in order to hear the answer . May it be favorable to democracy . And may it be final !               @ @ @ @ @ @
