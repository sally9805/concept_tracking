txt The bottom fell out of the Erie Railroad Yards in Weehawken about noon yesterday Into the Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel . There is an immense circular hole in the yards fully 50 feet across and as many deep . Inside are coal cars tilted at a dizzy angle , twisted rails , broken trucks , and one freight car overturned and lying with wheelo . The floor of the tunnel Is about ninety feet below the track level at this point . Four or five tracks were torn to pieces by the cave-in . Standing on them were laden cars , all of which fell into the cavernous opening with a crash . Watchmen and Erie trainmen were afraid to go within ten feet of the side of the chasm for fear the earth would fall under their feet . According to official information ? as near official as as it was possible to get ? nobody was hurt . But about twenty minutes after the cave-in Andrew Ezeban was carried to St. Mary 's Hospital in Hoboken , suffering from a compound fracture of the right leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the tunnel people reported that Ezeban had been hurt in an elevator . The police feel fairly certain that he was injured by the cave-in . Contractor O'Rourke was met coming across the Erie tracks an hour after the accident . " Any lives lost in the cave-in ? " he was asked . " No ; it was not a serious accident ? did n't amount to much , " he replied . " It does n't mean much delay id the work . " A big blast at 11 o'clock probably had something to do with the accident . The police in the station up the hill from the shaft heard a loud explosion then , and it Was only half an hour afterward that the earth , tracks , and freight cars fell in . The tunnel must be very large under that point now to accommodate such a mass of stuff as disappeared from sight . There were dozens of workmen busy in the tunnel at the time  --  directly below the section that fell . But they heard the muttering in time to draw away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harm 's Iway they looked back and saw the roof ' falling in . They got to the shaft as soon as their legs could carry them . Men in the contractors little office near by said the delay dire to the cave-in " would not amount to much . " Nearly everybody met in the tunnelAnclosure was inclined to make light of the accident : but the look of the big black hole full of crippled freight cars indicated that it would be a long time before the tunnelers could resume their work . At the engineer 's office it was learned that the work now consists in tunneling rock . A great deal of blasting is necessary . As fast as huge boulders of rock are broken loose wooden embers are put in place to prevent accidents such as yesterday 's . The fact that the Erie yards above the further end of the tunnel are mostly of " made " land would naturally have made the workmen more than usually careful . The furthest point reached in the tunnel work is still five or six hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessary , therefore , for the men to work under artificial air pressure " et . Capt . Messner of the Weehawken Police Station said yesterday : " If I or.any of my men go over there to ask about anything , the folks digging the tunnel  --  tell us it 's private property and we'r'e got no right there , even if we are police . They have watchmen guarding everything- , even the holes In the ground . as if they reared some one would take ' em away . I heard a big blast over there at 11 o'clock . The cave-in occurred at half past . If those two events did n't have ' some connection it 's funny to me . I heard another blast at 2 o'clock this afternoon , so they must he at work again . " Superintendent Groves went into the tunnel directly after the cave-in and stayed for hours . Getting the freight cars out will be a difficult job , as there is no way of telling how near to the hole either a man or a wrecking engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
