The scope of Part II is due in part to a desire for brevity , but chiefly to the hope of furnishing an epitome that shall follow the course of the natural and historical differentiation of the general philosophical problem. @# Finally , I have in Part III sought to present the tradition of philosophy in the form of general types . My purpose in undertaking so difficult a task is to acquaint the reader with philosophy in the concrete ; to show how certain underlying principles may determine the whole circle of philosophical ideas , and give them unity and distinctive flavor . Part II offers a general classification of philosophical problems and conceptions independently of any special point of view . But I have in Part III sought to emphasize the point of view , or the internal consistency that makes a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of philosophy . In such a division into types , lines are of necessity drawn too sharply . There will be many historical philosophies that refuse to fit , and many possibilities unprovided for . I must leave it to the individual reader to overcome this abstractness through his own reflection upon the intermediate and variant stand-points. @# Although the order is on the whole that of progressive complexity , I have sought to treat each chapter with independence enough to make it possible for it to be read separately ; and I have provided a carefully selected bibliography in the hope that this book may serve as a stimulus and guide to the reading of other books. @# The earlier chapters have already appeared as articles : Chapter I in the International Journal of Ethics , Vol .

I am indebted to the editors of these periodicals for permission to reprint with minor changes. @# In the writing of this , my first book , I have been often reminded that a higher critic , skilled in the study of internal evidence , could probably trace all of its ideas to suggestions that have come to me from my teachers and colleagues of the Department of Philosophy in Harvard University . I have unscrupulously forgotten what of their definite ideas I have adapted to my own use , but not that I received from them the major portion of my original philosophical capital . I am especially indebted to Professor William James for the inspiration and resources which I have received from his instruction and personal friendship. @# RALPH BARTON PERRY. @# CAMBRIDGE , March , 1905. @# FOOTNOTES : @# vii : A Edw .

Philosophy suffers the distinction of being regarded as essentially an academic pursuit . The term philosophy , to be sure , is used in common speech to denote a stoical manner of accepting the vicissitudes of life ; but this conception sheds little or no light upon the meaning of philosophy as a branch of scholarship . The men who write the books on " Epistemology " or " Ontology , " are regarded by the average man of affairs , even though he may have enjoyed a " higher education , " with little sympathy and less intelligence . Not even philology seems less concerned with the real business of life . The pursuit of philosophy appears to be a phenomenon of extreme and somewhat effete culture , with its own peculiar traditions , problems , and aims , and with little or nothing to contribute to the real enterprises of society . It is easy to prove to the satisfaction of the philosopher that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more serious matter to bridge over the very real gap that separates philosophy and common-sense . Such an aim is realized only when philosophy is seen to issue from some special interest that is humanly important ; or when , after starting in thought at a point where one deals with ideas and interests common to all , one is led by the inevitableness of consistent thinking into the sphere of philosophy. @# Sidenote : Life as a Starting-point for Thought. @# Sect. 2 . There is but one starting-point for reflection when all men are invited to share in it . Though there be a great many special platforms where special groups of men may take their stand together , there is only one platform broad enough for all . This universal stand-point , or common platform , is life . It is our more definite thesis , then , that philosophy , even to its most abstruse technicality , is rooted in life ; and that it is inseparably bound up with the satisfaction of practical needs , and the solution of practical problems. @# Every man knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verify those features of the adventure that stand out conspicuously . To begin with , life is our birthright . We did not ask for it , but when we grew old enough to be self-conscious we found ourselves in possession of it . Nor is it a gift to be neglected , even if we had the will . As is true of no other gift of nature , we must use it , or cease to be . There is a unique urgency about life . But we have already implied more , in so far as we have said that it must be used , and have thereby referred to some form of movement or activity as its inseparable attribute . To live is to find one ' s self compelled to do something . To do something  --  there is another implication of life : some outer expression , some medium in which to register the degree and form of its activity . Such we recognize as the environment of life , the real objects among which it is placed ; which it may change , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find our lives as unsolicited active powers , but find , as well , an arena prescribed for their exercise . That we shall act , and in a certain time and place , and with reference to certain other realities , this is the general condition of things that is encountered when each one of us discovers life . In short , to live means to be compelled to do something under certain circumstances. @# There is another very common aspect of life that would not at first glance seem worthy of mention . Not only does life , as we have just described it , mean opportunity , but it means self-conscious opportunity . The facts are such as we have found them to be , and as each one of us has previously found them for himself . But when we discover life for ourselves , we who make the discovery , and we who live , are identical . From that moment we both live , and know that we live . Moreover , such is the essential unity of our natures that our living must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminate our living . Consider the allegory of the centipede . From the beginning of time he had manipulated his countless legs with exquisite precision . Men had regarded him with wonder and amazement . But he was innocent of his own art , being a contrivance of nature , perfectly constructed to do her bidding . One day the centipede discovered life . He discovered himself as one who walks , and the newly awakened intelligence , first observing , then foreseeing , at length began to direct the process . And from that moment the centipede , because he could not remember the proper order of his going , lost all his former skill , and became the poor clumsy victim of his own self-consciousness . This same self-consciousness is the inconvenience and the great glory of human life . We must stumble along as best we can , guided by the feeble light of our own little intelligence . If nature starts us on our way , she soon hands over the torch , and bids us find the trail for ourselves . Most men are brave enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some despair on account of it . In either case it is admittedly the true story of human life . We must live as separate selves , observing , foreseeing , and planning . There are two things that we can do about it . We can repudiate our natures , decline the responsibility , and degenerate to the level of those animals that never had our chance ; or we can leap joyously to the helm , and with all the strength and wisdom in us guide our lives to their destination . But if we do the former , we shall be unable to forget what might have been , and shall be haunted by a sense of ignominy ; and if we do the second , we shall experience the unique happiness of fulfilment and self-realization. @# Life , then , is a situation that appeals to intelligent activity . Humanly speaking , there is no such thing as a situation that is not at the same time a theory . As we live we are all theorists . Whoever has any misgivings as to the practical value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human life , it is true to say that there is no practice that does not issue at length from reflection . That which is the commonest experience of mankind is the conjunction of these two , the thought and the deed . And as surely as we are all practical theorists , so surely is philosophy the outcome of the broadening and deepening of practical theory . But to understand how the practical man becomes the philosopher , we must inquire somewhat more carefully into the manner of his thought about life. @# Sidenote : The Practical Knowledge of Means. @# Sect. 3 . Let anyone inspect the last moment in his life , and in all probability he will find that his mind was employed to discover the means to some end . He was already bent upon some definite achievement , and was thoughtful for the sake of selecting the economical and effectual way . His theory made his practice skilful . So through life his knowledge shows him how to work his will . Example , experience , and books have taught him the uses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enabled to reach the goal he has set for the next hour , day , or year of his activity . The long periods of human life are spent in elaborating the means to some unquestioned end . Here one meets the curious truth that we wake up in the middle of life , already making headway , and under the guidance of some invisible steersman . When first we take the business of life seriously , there is a considerable stock in trade in the shape of habits , and inclinations to all sorts of things that we never consciously elected to pursue . Since we do not begin at the beginning , our first problem is to accommodate ourselves to ourselves , and our first deliberate acts are in fulfilment of plans outlined by some predecessor that has already spoken for us . The same thing is true of the race of men . At a certain stage in their development men found themselves engaged in all manner of ritual and custom , and burdened with concerns that were not of their own choosing . They were burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which they must now proceed to justify with myth and legend , in order to render intelligible to themselves the deliberate and self-conscious repetition of them . Even so much justification was left to the few , and the great majority continued to seek that good which social usage countenanced and individual predisposition confirmed . So every man of us acts from day to day for love ' s sake , or wealth ' s sake , or power ' s sake , or for the sake of some near and tangible object ; reflecting only for the greater efficiency of his endeavor. @# Sidenote : The Practical Knowledge of the End or Purpose. @# Sect. 4 . But if this be the common manner of thinking about life , it does not represent the whole of such thought . Nor does it follow that because it occupies us so much , it is therefore correspondingly fundamental . Like the myth makers of old , we all want more or less to know the reason of our ends . Here , then , we meet with a somewhat different type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of a life purpose . It is obvious that most ends are selected for the sake of other ends , and so are virtually means . Thus one may struggle for years to secure a college education . This definite end has been adopted for the sake of a somewhat more indefinite end of self-advancement , and from it there issues a whole series of minor ends , which form a hierarchy of steps ascending to the highest goal of aspiration . Now upon the face of things we live very unsystematic lives , and yet were we to examine ourselves in this fashion , we should all find our lives to be marvels of organization . Their growth , as we have seen , began before we were conscious of it ; and we are commonly so absorbed in some particular flower or fruit that we forget the roots , and the design of the whole . But a little reflection reveals a remarkable unitary adjustment of parts . The unity is due to the dominance of a group of central purposes . Judged from the stand-point of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from life just what he wishes . But a candid searching of our own hearts will incline us to admit that , after all , the way we go and the length we go is determined pretty much by the kind and the intensity of our secret longing . That for which in the time of choice we are willing to sacrifice all else , is the formula that defines the law of each individual life . All this is not intended to mean that we have each named a clear and definite ideal which is our chosen goal . On the contrary , such a conception may be almost meaningless to some of us . In general the higher the ideal the vaguer and less vivid is its presentation to our consciousness . But , named or unnamed , sharp or blurred , vivid or half-forgotten , there may be found in the heart of every man that which of all things he wants to be , that which of all deeds he wants to do . If he has had the normal youth of dreaming , he has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if he has been somewhat more thoughtful than the ordinary , his reason has defined it , and adopted it for his vocation ; if neither , it has been present as an undertone throughout the rendering of his more inevitable life . He will recognize it when it is named as the desire to do the will of God , or to have as good a time as possible , or to make other people as happy as possible , or to be equal to his responsibilities , or to fulfil the expectation of his mother , or to be distinguished , wealthy , or influential . This list of ideals is miscellaneous , and ethically reducible to more fundamental concepts , but these are the terms in which men are ordinarily conscious of their most intimate purposes . We must now inquire respecting the nature of the thought that determines the selection of such a purpose , or justifies it when it has been unconsciously accepted. @# Sidenote : The Philosophy of the Devotee , the Man of Affairs , and the Voluptuary. @# Sect. 5 . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned this obviously depends upon what is possible , upon what is expected of us by our own natures , and upon what interests and concerns are conserved by the trend of events in our environment . What I had best do , presupposes what I have the strength and the skill to do , what I feel called upon to do , and what are the great causes that are entitled to promotion at my hands . It seems that practically we can not separate the ideal from the real . We may feel that the highest ideal is an immediate utterance of conscience , as mysterious in origin as it is authoritative in expression . We may be willing to defy the universe , and expatriate ourselves from our natural and social environment , for the sake of the holy law of duty . Such men as Count Tolstoi have little to say of the possible , or the expedient , or the actual , and are satisfied to stand almost alone against the brutal facts of usage and economy . We all have a secret sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like devotion . But that which in such moral purposes appears to indicate a severance of the ideal and the real , is , if we will but stop to consider , only a severance of the ideal and the apparent . The martyr is more sure of reality than the adventurer . He is convinced that though his contemporaries and his environment be against him ; the fundamental or eventual order of things is for him . He believes in a spiritual world more abiding , albeit less obvious , than the material world . Though every temporal event contradict him , he lives in the certainty that eternity is his . Such an one may have found his ideal in the voice of God and His prophets , or he may have been led to God as the justification of his irresistible ideal ; but in either case the selection of his ideal is reasonable to him in so far as it is harmonious with the ultimate nature of things , or stands for the promise of reality . In this wise , thought about life expands into some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life itself , in respect of its fundamental attachment to an ideal , implies some belief concerning the fundamental nature of its environment. @# But lest in this account life be credited with too much gravity and import , or it seem to be assumed that life is all knight-errantry , let us turn to our less quixotic , and perhaps more effectual , man of affairs . He works for his daily bread , and for success in his vocation . He has selected his vocation for its promise of return in the form of wealth , comfort , fame , or influence . He likewise performs such additional service to his family and his community as is demanded of him by public opinion and his own sense of responsibility . He may have a certain contempt for the man who sees visions . This may be his manner of testifying to his own preference for the ideal of usefulness and immediate efficiency . But even so he would never for an instant admit that he was pursuing a merely conventional good . He may be largely imitative in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some time or race ; nevertheless none would be more sure than he of the truth of his ideal . Question him , and he will maintain that his is the reasonable life under the conditions of human existence . He may maintain that if there be a God , he can best serve Him by promoting the tangible welfare of himself and those dependent upon him . He may maintain that , since there is no God , he must win such rewards as the world can give . If he have something of the heroic in him , he may tell you that , since there is no God , he will labor to the uttermost for his fellow-men . Where he has not solved the problem of life for himself , he may believe himself to be obeying the insight of some one wiser than himself , or of society as expressed in its customs and institutions . But no man ever admitted that his life was purely a matter of expediency , or that in his dominant ideal he was the victim of chance . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , there dwells the conviction that such living is appropriate to the universe ; that it is called for by the circumstances of its origin , opportunities , and destiny. @# Finally , the man who makes light of life has of all men the most transparent inner consciousness . In him may be clearly observed the relation between the ideal and the reflection that is assumed to justify it. @# " A Moment ' s Halt  --  a momentary taste Of Being from the Well amid the Waste  --  And Lo !  --  the phantom Caravan has reach ' d The Nothing it set out from  --  . . . " @# " We are no other than a moving row Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go Round with the Sun-illumin ' d Lantern held In Midnight by the Master of the Show. " @# Where the setting of life is construed in these terms , there is but one natural and appropriate manner of life . Once believing in the isolation and insignificance of life , one is sceptical of all worth save such as may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s ideas and experiences are no concern of the world ' s , but incidents of a purely local and transient interest , they will realize most when they realize an immediate gratification . Where one does not believe that he is a member of the universe , and a contributor to its ends , he does well to minimize the friction that arises from its accidental propinquity , and to kindle some little fire of enjoyment in his own lonely heart . This is the life of abandonment to pleasure , accompanied by the conviction that the conditions of life warrant no more strenuous or heroic plan. @# Sidenote : The Adoption of Purposes and the Philosophy of Life. @# Sect. 6 . In such wise do we adopt the life purpose , or justify it when unconsciously adopted . The pursuit of an ideal implies a belief in its effectuality . Such a belief will invariably appear when the groundwork of the daily living is laid bare by a little reflection . And if our analysis has not been in error , there is something more definite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical wisdom of our fundamental ideals ; but we believe , besides , that such wisdom involves the sanction of the universe as a whole . The momentousness of an individual ' s life will be satisfied with nothing less final than an absolutely wise disposition of it . For every individual , his life is all his power and riches , and is not to be spent save for the greatest good that he can reasonably pursue . But the solution of such a problem is not to be obtained short of a searching of entire reality . Every life will represent more or less of such wisdom and enlightenment ; and in the end the best selection of ideal will denote the greatest wealth of experience . It is not always true that he who has seen more will live more wisely , for in an individual case instinct or authority may be better sources of aspiration than experience . But we trust instinct and authority because we believe them to represent a comprehensive experience on the part of the race as a whole , or on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know best what is finally worth living for . On this account , most men can see no more reasonable plan of life than obedience to God ' s will , for God in the abundance of his wisdom , and since all eternity is plain before him , must see with certainty that which is supremely worthy. @# We mean , then , that the selection of our ideals shall be determined by the largest possible knowledge of the facts pertaining to life . We mean to select as one would select who knew all about the antecedents and surroundings and remote consequences of life . In our own weakness and finitude we may go but a little way in the direction of such an insight , and may prefer to accept the judgment of tradition or authority , but we recognize a distinct type of knowledge as alone worthy to universe in its totality . Such knowledge does not involve completeness of information respecting all parts of reality . This , humanly speaking , is both unattainable and inconceivable . It involves rather a conception of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unnecessary that we should know many matters of fact , or even specific laws , provided we are convinced of the inner and essential character of the universe . Some of the alternatives are matters of every-day thought and speech . One can not tell the simplest story of human life without disclosing them . To live the human life means to pursue ideals , that is , to have a thing in mind , and then to try to accomplish it . Here is one kind of reality and power . The planetary system , on the other hand , does not pursue ideals , but moves unconscious of itself , with a mechanical precision that can be expressed in a mathematical formula ; and is representative of another kind of reality and power . Hence a very common and a very practical question : Is there an underlying law , like the law of gravitation , fundamentally and permanently governing life , in spite of its apparent direction by ideal and aspiration ? Or is there an underlying power , like purpose , fundamentally and permanently governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the apparent control of blind and irresistible forces ? This is a practical question because nothing could be more pertinent to our choice of ideals . Nothing could make more difference to life than a belief in the life or lifelessness of its environment . The faiths that generate or confirm our ideals always refer to this great issue . And this is but one , albeit the most profound , of the many issues that arise from the desire to obtain some conviction of the inner and essential character of life . Though so intimately connected with practical concerns , these issues are primarily the business of thought . In grappling with them , thought is called upon for its greatest comprehensiveness , penetration , and self-consistency . By the necessity of concentration , thought is sometimes led to forget its origin and the source of its problems . But in naming itself philosophy , thought has only recognized the definiteness and earnestness of its largest task . Philosophy is still thought about life , representing but the deepening and broadening of the common practical thoughtfulness. @# We who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered together the haven of philosophy . It is not a final haven , but only the point of departure for the field of philosophy proper . Nevertheless that field is now in the plain view of the man who occupies the practical stand-point . He must recognize in philosophy a kind of reflection that differs only in extent and persistence from the reflection that guides and justifies his life . He may not consciously identify himself with any one of the three general groups which have been characterized . But if he is neither an idealist , nor a philistine , nor a pleasure lover , surely he is compounded of such elements , and does not escape their implications . He desires something most of all , even though his highest ideal be only an inference from the gradation of his immediate purposes . This highest ideal represents what he conceives to be the greatest worth or value attainable in the universe , and its adoption is based upon the largest generalization that he can make or borrow . The complete justification of his ideal would involve a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such knowledge he substitutes either authority or his own imperfect insight . But in either case his life is naturally and organically correlated with a thought about the universe in its totality , or in its deepest and essential character . Such thought , the activity and its results , is philosophy . Hence he who lives is , ipso facto , a philosopher . He is not only a potential philosopher , but a partial philosopher . He has already begun to be a philosopher . Between the fitful or prudential thinking of some little man of affairs , and the sustained thought of the devoted lover of truth , there is indeed a long journey , but it is a straight journey along the same road . Philosophy is neither accidental nor supernatural , but inevitable and normal . Philosophy is not properly a vocation , but the ground and inspiration of all vocations . In the hands of its devotees it grows technical and complex , as do all efforts of thought , and to pursue philosophy bravely and faithfully is to encounter obstacles and labyrinths innumerable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brood of problems , little and great . But whether we be numbered among its devotees , or their beneficiaries , an equal significance attaches to the truth that philosophy is continuous with life. @# @# CHAPTER II @# POETRY AND PHILOSOPHY @# Sidenote : Who is the Philosopher-Poet ? @# Sect. 7 . As the ultimate criticism of all human interests , philosophy may be approached by avenues as various as these interests . Only when philosophy is discovered as the implication of well-recognized special interests , is the significance of its function fully appreciated . For the sake of such a further understanding of philosophy , those who find either inspiration or entertainment in poetry are invited in the present chapter to consider certain of the relations between poetry and philosophy. @# We must at the very outset decline to accept unqualifiedly the poet ' s opinion in the matter , for he would not think it presumptuous to incorporate philosophy in poetry . " No man , " said Coleridge , " was ever yet a great poet without being at the same time a great philosopher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great philosopher , and more too . We shall do better to begin with the prosaic and matter of fact minimum of truth : some poetry is philosophical . This will enable us to search for the portion of philosophy that is in some poetry , without finally defining their respective boundaries . It may be that all true poetry is philosophical , as it may be that all true philosophy is poetical ; but it is much more certain that much actual poetry is far from philosophical , and that most actual philosophy was not conceived or written by a poet . The mere poet and the mere philosopher must be tolerated , if it be only for the purpose of shedding light upon the philosopher-poet and the poet-philosopher . And it is to the philosopher-poet that we turn , in the hope that under the genial spell of poetry we may be brought with understanding to the more forbidding land of philosophy. @# Sidenote : Poetry as Appreciation. @# Sect. 8 . Poetry is well characterized , though not defined , as an interpretation of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness , and active pursuit of ends . An interpretation of life is , then , a selection and account of such values in human experience as are actually sought or are worth the seeking . For the poet all things are good or bad , and never only matters of fact . He is neither an annalist nor a statistician , and is even an observer only for the sake of a higher design . He is one who appreciates , and expresses his appreciation so fittingly that it becomes a kind of truth , and a permanently communicable object . That " unbodied joy , " the skylark ' s song and flight , is through the genius of Shelley so faithfully embodied , that it may enter as a definite joy into the lives of countless human beings . The sensuous or suggestive values of nature are caught by the poet ' s quick feeling for beauty , and fixed by his creative activity . Or with his ready sympathy he may perceive the value of some human ideal or mastering passion , and make it a reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the base and hateful , his attitude is still appreciative . The evil is apprehended as part of a dramatic whole having positive moral or aesthetic value . Moral ideas may appear in both poetry and life as the inspiration and justification of struggle . Where there is no conception of its moral significance , the repulsive possesses for the poet ' s consciousness the aesthetic value of diversity and contrast . Even where the evil and ugly is isolated , as in certain of Browning ' s dramatic monologues , it forms , both for the poet and the reader , but a part of some larger perception of life or character , which is sublime or beautiful or good . Poetry involves , then , the discovery and presentation of human experiences that are satisfying and appealing . It is a language for human pleasures and ideals . Poetry is without doubt a great deal more than this , and only after a careful analysis of its peculiar language could one distinguish it from kindred arts ; but it will suffice for our purposes to characterize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry , we may now look for that aspect of it whereby it may be a witness of philosophical truth. @# Sidenote : Sincerity in Poetry . Whitman. @# Sect. 9 . For the answer to our question , we must turn to an examination of the intellectual elements of poetry . In the first place , the common demand that the poet shall be accurate in his representations is suggestive of an indispensable intellectual factor in his genius . As we have seen , he is not to reproduce nature , but the human appreciative experience of nature . Nevertheless , he must even here be true to his object . His art involves his ability to express genuinely and sincerely what he himself experiences in the presence of nature , or what he can catch of the inner lives of others by virtue of his intelligent sympathy . No amount of emotion or even of imagination will profit a poet , unless he can render a true account of them . To be sure , he need not define , or even explain ; for it is his function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be able to speak the truth , and , in order to speak it , he must have known it . In all this , however , we have made no demand that the poet should see more than one thing at a time . Sincerity of expression does not require what is distinctly another mode of intelligence , comprehensiveness of view . It is easier , and accordingly more usual , to render an account of the moments and casual units of experience , than of its totality . There are poets , little and great , who possess the intellectual virtue of sincerity , without the intellectual power of synthesis and reconciliation . This distinction will enable us to separate the intelligence exhibited in all poetry , from that distinct form of intelligence exhibited in such poetry as is properly to be called philosophical. @# The " barbarian " in poetry has recently been defined as " the man who regards his passions as their own excuse for being ; who does not domesticate them either by understanding their cause or by conceiving their ideal goal. " 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition to Walt Whitman . What little unity there is in this poet ' s world , is the composition of a purely sensuous experience , @# " The earth expending right hand and left hand , The picture alive , every part in its best light , The music falling in where it is wanted , and stopping where it is not wanted. " @# In many passages Whitman manifests a marvellous ability to discover and communicate a fresh gladness about the commonest experiences . We can not but rejoice with him in all sights and sounds . But though we can not deny him truth , his truth is honesty and not understanding . The experiences in which he discovers so much worth , are random and capricious , and do not constitute a universe . To the solution of ultimate questions he contributes a sense of mystery , and the conviction @# " That you are here  --  that life exists and identity , That the powerful play goes on , and you may contribute a verse. " @# His world is justly described by the writer just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impressive , but monotonous and hard to distinguish in memory , like the waves of the sea or the decorations of some barbarous temple , sublime only by the infinite aggregation of parts. " 30 : 2 @# As is Walt Whitman , so are many poets greater and less . Some who have seen the world-view , exhibit the same particularism in their lyric moods ; although , generally speaking , a poet who once has comprehended the world , will see the parts of it in the light of that wisdom . But Walt Whitman is peculiarly representative of the poetry that can be true , without being wise in the manner that we shall come shortly to understand as the manner of philosophy . He is as desultory in his poet raptures as is the common man when he lives in his immediate experiences . The truth won by each is the clear vision of one thing , or of a limited collection of things , and not the broad inclusive vision of all things. @# Sidenote : Constructive Knowledge in Poetry . Shakespeare. @# Sect. 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt , but the very differences between these poets serve to mark out an interesting affinity . Neither has put any unitary construction upon human life and its environment . Neither , as poet , is the witness of any world-view ; which will mean for us that neither is a philosopher-poet . As respects Shakespeare , this is a hard saying . We are accustomed to the critical judgment that finds in the Shakespearian dramas an apprehension of the universal in human life . But though this judgment is true , it is by no means conclusive as respects Shakespeare ' s relation to the philosophical type of thought . For there can be universality without philosophy . Thus , to know the groups and the marks of the vertebrates is to know a truth which possesses generality , in contradistinction to the particularism of Whitman ' s poetic consciousness . Even so to know well the groups and marks of human character , vertebrate and invertebrate , is to know that of which the average man , in his hand to hand struggle with life , is ignorant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it enabled him to reconstruct human life . He did not merely perceive human states and motives , but he understood human nature so well that he could create consistent men and women . Moreover , Shakespeare ' s knowledge was not only thus universal in being a knowledge of general groups and laws , but also in respect of its extensity . His understanding was as rich as it was acute . It is true , then , that Shakespeare read human life as an open book , knowing certainly the manner of human thinking and feeling , and the power and interplay of human motives . But it is equally true , on the other hand , that he possessed no unitary conception of the meaning and larger relations of human life . Such a conception might have been expressed either by means of the outlook of some dominating and persistent type of personality , or by a pervading suggestion of some constant world-setting for the variable enterprise of mankind . It could appear only provided the poet ' s appreciation of life in detail were determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shakespeare apparently possessed no such interpretation . Even when Hamlet is groping after some larger truth that may bear upon the definite problems of life , he represents but one , and that a strange and unusual , type of human nature . And Hamlet ' s reflections , it should be noted , have no outcome . There is no Shakespearian answer to the riddles that Hamlet propounds . The poet ' s genius is not less amazing for this fact ; indeed , his peculiar distinction can only be comprehended upon this basis . Shakespeare put no construction upon life , and by virtue of this very reserve accomplished an art of surpassing fidelity and vividness . The absence of philosophy in Shakespeare , and the presence of the most characteristic quality of his genius , may both be imputed by the one affirmation , that there is no Shakespearian point of view. @# This truth signifies both gain and loss . The philosophical criticism of life may vary from the ideal objectivity of absolute truth , to the subjectivity of a personal religion . Philosophy aims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a point of view that shall comprehend their relations , and effect such reconciliations or transformations as shall enable them to constitute a universe . Philosophy always assumes the hypothetical view of omniscience . The necessity of such a final criticism is implicit in every scientific item of knowledge , and in every judgment that is passed upon life . Philosophy makes a distinct and peculiar contribution to human knowledge by its heroic effort to measure all knowledges and all ideals by the standard of totality . Nevertheless it is significant that no human individual can possibly possess the range of omniscience . The most adequate knowledge of which any generation of men is capable , will always be that which is conceived by the most synthetic and vigorously metaphysical minds ; but every individual philosophy will nevertheless be a premature synthesis . The effort to complete knowledge is the indispensable test of the adequacy of prevailing conceptions , but the completed knowledge of any individual mind will shortly become an historical monument . It will belong primarily to the personal life of its creator , as the articulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound justification for such a conclusion of things in the case of the individual , for the conditions of human life make it inevitable ; but it will always possess a felt unity , and many distinct features , that are private and subjective . Now such a projection of personality , with its coloring and its selection , Shakespeare has avoided ; and very largely as a consequence , his dramas are a storehouse of genuine human nature . Ambition , mercy , hate , madness , guilelessness , conventionality , mirth , bravery , deceit , purity  --  these , and all human states and attributes save piety , are upon his pages as real , and as mysterious withal , as they are in the great historical society . For an ordinary reader , these states and attributes are more real in Hamlet or Lear than in his own direct experience , because in Hamlet and Lear he can see them with the eye and intelligence of genius . But Shakespeare is the world all over again , and there is loss as well as gain in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a brilliant pageantry it is ; but human life as varied and as problematic as it is in the living . Shakespeare ' s fundamental intellectual resource is the historical and psychological knowledge of such principles as govern the construction of human natures . The goods for which men undertake , and live or die , are any goods , justified only by the actual human striving for them . The virtues are the old winning virtues of the secular life , and the heroisms of the common conscience . Beyond its empirical generality , his knowledge is universal only in the sense that space and time are universal . His consciousness contains its representative creations , and expresses them unspoiled by any transforming thought . His poetic consciousness is like the very stage to which he likens all the world : men and women meet there , and things happen there . The stage itself creates no unity save the occasion and the place . Shakespeare ' s consciousness is universal because it is a fair field with no favors . But even so it is particular , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all enter together there is anarchy and a babel of voices . All Shakespeare is like all the world seen through the eyes of each of its inhabitants . Human experience in Shakespeare is human experience as everyone feels it , as comprehensive as the aggregate of innumerable lives . But human experience in philosophy is the experience of all as thought by a synthetic mind . Hence the wealth of life depicted by Shakespeare serves only to point out the philosopher ' s problem , and to challenge his powers . Here he will find material , and not results ; much to philosophize about , but no philosophy. @# Sidenote : Philosophy in Poetry . The World-View . Omar Khayyam. @# Sect. 11 . The discussion up to this point has attributed to poetry very definite intellectual factors that nevertheless do not constitute philosophy . Walt Whitman speaks his feeling with truth , but in general manifests no comprehensive insight . Shakespeare has not only sincerity of expression but an understanding mind . He has a knowledge not only of particular experiences , but of human nature ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is a kind of knowledge possessed by neither , the knowledge sought by coordinating all aspects of human experience , both particular and general . Not even Shakespeare is wise as one who , having seen the whole , can fundamentally interpret a part . But though the philosopher-poet may not yet be found , we can not longer be ignorant of his nature . He will be , like all poets , one who appreciates experiences or finds things good , and he will faithfully reproduce the values which he discovers . But he must justify himself in view of the fundamental nature of the universe . The values which he apprehends must be harmonious , and so far above the plurality of goods as to transcend and unify them . The philosopher-poet will find reality as a whole to be something that accredits the order of values in his inner life . He will not only find certain things to be most worthy objects of action or contemplation , but he will see why they are worthy , because he will have construed the judgment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omar Khayyam is a philosopher-poet . To be sure his universe is quite the opposite of that which most poets conceive , and is perhaps profoundly antagonistic to the very spirit of poetry ; but it is none the less true that the joys to which Omar invites us are such as his universe prescribes for human life. @# " Some for the Glories of This World ; and some Sigh for the Prophet ' s Paradise to come ; Ah , take the Cash , and let the Credit go , Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum. " @# Herein is both poetry and philosophy , albeit but a poor brand of each . We are invited to occupy ourselves only with spiritual cash , because the universe is spiritually insolvent . The immediately gratifying feelings are the only feelings that the world can guarantee . Omar Khayyam is a philosopher-poet , because his immediate delight in " youth ' s sweet-scented manuscript " is part of a consciousness that vaguely sees , though it can not grasp , " this sorry scheme of things entire. " @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor why ; Drink for you know not why you go , nor where. " @# Sidenote : Wordsworth. @# Sect. 12 . But the poet in his world-view ordinarily sees other than darkness . The same innate spiritual enterprise that sustains religious faith leads the poet more often to find the universe positively congenial to his ideals , and to ideals in general . He interprets human experience in the light of the spirituality of all the world . It is to Wordsworth that we of the present age are chiefly indebted for such imagery , and it will profit us to consider somewhat carefully the philosophical quality of his poetry. @# Walter Pater , in introducing his appreciation of Wordsworth , writes that " an intimate consciousness of the expression of natural things , which weighs , listens , penetrates , where the earlier mind passed roughly by , is a large element in the complexion of modern poetry . " We recognize at once the truth of this characterization as applied to Wordsworth . But there is something more distinguished about this poet ' s sensibility even than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested , though not made explicit , by Shelley ' s allusion to Wordsworth ' s experience as " a sort of thought in sense . " Nature possessed for him not merely enjoyable and describable characters of great variety and minuteness , but an immediately apprehended unity and meaning . It would be a great mistake to construe this meaning in sense as analogous to the crude symbolism of the educator Froebel , to whom , as he said , " the world of crystals proclaimed , in distinct and univocal terms , the laws of human life . " Wordsworth did not attach ideas to sense , but regarded sense itself as a communication of truth . We readily call to mind his unique capacity for apprehending the characteristic flavor of a certain place in a certain moment of time , the individuality of a situation . Now in such moments he felt that he was receiving intelligences , none the less direct and significant for their inarticulate form . Like the boy on Windermere , whom he himself describes , @# " while he hung Loitering , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart the voice Of mountain torrents ; or the visible scene Would enter unawares into his mind , With all its solemn imagery , its rocks , Its woods , and that uncertain heaven received Into the bosom of the steady lake. " @# For our purpose it is essential that we should recognize in this appreciation of nature , expressed in almost every poem that Wordsworth wrote , a consciousness respecting the fundamental nature of the world . Conversation , as we know , denotes an interchange of commensurable meanings . Whatever the code may be , whether words or the most subtle form of suggestion , communication is impossible without community of nature . Hence , in believing himself to be holding converse with the so-called physical world , Wordsworth conceives that world as fundamentally like himself . He finds the most profound thing in all the world to be the universal spiritual life . In nature this life manifests itself most directly , clothed in its own proper dignity and peace . But it may be discovered in the humanity that is most close to nature , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsophisticated delights of children ; and , with the perspective of contemplation , even " among the multitudes of that huge city. " @# So Wordsworth is rendering a true account of his own experience of reality when , as in " The Prelude , " he says unequivocally : @# " A gracious spirit o ' er this earth presides , And in the heart of man ; invisibly It comes to works of unreproved delight , And tendency benign ; directing those Who care not , know not , think not , what they do. " @# Wordsworth is not a philosopher-poet because by searching his pages we can find an explicit philosophical creed such as this , but because all the joys of which his poet-soul compels him to sing have their peculiar note , and compose their peculiar harmony , by virtue of such an indwelling consciousness . Here is one who is a philosopher in and through his poetry . He is a philosopher in so far as the detail of his appreciation finds fundamental justification in a world-view . From the immanence of " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning , but by the immediate experience of its propriety , a conception of that which is of supreme worth in life . The highest and best of which life is capable is contemplation , or the consciousness of the universal indwelling of God . Of those who fail to live thus fittingly in the midst of the divine life , Walter Pater speaks for Wordsworth as follows : @# " To higher or lower ends they move too often with something of a sad countenance , with hurried and ignoble gait , becoming , unconsciously , something like thorns , in their anxiety to bear grapes ; it being possible for people , in the pursuit of even great ends , to become themselves thin and impoverished in spirit and temper , thus diminishing the sum of perfection in the world at its very sources. " 42 : 3 @# The quiet and worshipful spirit , won by the cultivation of the emotions appropriate to the presence of nature and society , is the mark of the completest life and the most acceptable service . Thus for Wordsworth the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In apprehending that which is good and beautiful in human experience , he was attended by a vision of the totality of things . Herein he has had to do , if not with the form , at any rate with the very substance of philosophy. @# Sidenote : Dante. @# Sect. 13 . Unquestionably the supreme philosopher-poet is Dante . He is not only philosophical in the temper of his mind , but his greatest poem is the incarnation of a definite system of philosophy , the most definite that the world has seen . That conception of the world which in the thirteenth century found argumentative and orderly expression in the " Summa Theologiae " of Thomas of Aquino , and constituted the faith of the church , is visualized by Dante , and made the basis of an interpretation of life. @# The " Divina Commedia " deals with all the heavens to the Empyrean itself , and with all spiritual life to the very presence of God . It derives its imagery from the cosmology of the day , its dramatic motive from the Christian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sin is punished because of the justice of God ; knowledge , virtue , and faith lead , through God ' s grace and mercy manifested in Christ , to a perpetual union with Him . Hell , purgatory , and paradise give place and setting to the events of the drama . But the deeper meaning of the poem is allegorical . In a letter quoted by Lowell , Dante writes : @# " The literal subject of the whole work is the state of the soul after death , simply considered . But if the work be taken allegorically the subject is man , as by merit or demerit , through freedom of the will , he renders himself liable to the reward or punishment of justice. " 43 : 4 @# In other words , the inner and essential meaning of the poem has to do not with external retribution , but with character , and the laws which determine its own proper ruin or perfection . The punishments described in the " Inferno " are accounts of the state of guilt itself , implications of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is damnable and deadening , but the knowledge that the soul that sinneth shall die is the first way of emancipation from sin . The guidance of Virgil through hell and purgatory signifies the knowledge of good and evil , or moral insight , as the guide of man through this life of struggle and progress . The earthly paradise , at the close of the " Purgatorio , " represents the highest state to which human character can attain when choice is determined by ordinary experience , intelligence , and understanding . Here man stands alone , endowed with an enlightened conscience . Here are uttered the last words of Virgil to Dante , the explorer of the spiritual country : @# " Expect no more or word or sign from me . Free , upright , and sane is thine own free will , and it would be wrong not to act according to its pleasure ; wherefore thee over thyself I crown and mitre. " 44 : 5 @# But moral self-reliance is not the last word . As Beatrice , the image of tenderness and holiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads him from the summit of purgatory into the heaven of heavens , and even to the eternal light ; so there is added to the mere human , intellectual , and moral resources of the soul , the sustaining power of the divine grace , the illuminating power of divine truth , and the transforming power of divine love . Through the aid of this higher wisdom , the journey of life becomes the way to God . Thus the allegorical truth of the " Divina Commedia " is not merely an analysis of the moral nature of man , but the revelation of a universal spiritual order , manifesting itself in the moral evolution of the individual , and above all in his ultimate community with the eternal goodness. @# " Thou shouldst not , if I deem aright , wonder more at thy ascent , than at a stream if from a high mountain it descends to the base . A marvel it would be in thee , if , deprived of hindrance , thou hadst sat below , even as quiet by living fire in earth would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is Dante ' s world-view , so suggestive of the freer idealistic conceptions of later thought as to justify a recent characterization of him as one who , " accepting without a shadow of a doubt or hesitation all the constitutive ideas of mediaeval thought and life , grasped them so firmly and gave them such luminous expression that the spirit in them broke away from the form. " 46 : 7 @# But it must be added , as in the case of Wordsworth , that Dante is a philosopher-poet not because St. Thomas Aquinas appears and speaks with authority in the Thirteenth Canto of the " Paradiso , " nor even because a philosophical doctrine can be consistently formulated from his writings , but because his consciousness of life is informed with a sense of its universal bearings . There is a famous passage in the Twenty-second Canto of the " Paradiso , " in which Dante describes himself as looking down upon the earth from the starry heaven. @# " ' Thou art so near the ultimate salvation , ' began Beatrice , ' that thou oughtest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere thou further interest it , look back downward , and see how great a world I have already set beneath thy feet , in order that thy heart , so far as it is able , may present itself joyous to the triumphant crowd which comes glad through this round ether . ' With my sight I returned through each and all the seven spheres , and saw this globe such that I smiled at its mean semblance ; and that counsel I approve as the best which holds it of least account ; and he who thinks of other things maybe called truly worthy. " @# Dante ' s scale of values is that which appears from the starry heaven . His austere piety , his invincible courage , and his uncompromising hatred of wrong , are neither accidents of temperament nor blind reactions , but compose the proper character of one who has both seen the world from God , and returned to see God from the world . He was , as Lowell has said , " a man of genius who could hold heartbreak at bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till he had done his task " ; and his power was not obstinacy , but a vision of the ways of God . He knew a truth that justified him in his sacrifices , and made a great glory of his defeat and exile . Even so his poetry or appreciation of life is the expression of an inward contemplation of the world in its unity or essence . It is but an elaboration of the piety which he attributes to the lesser saints of paradise , when he has them say : @# " Nay , it is essential to this blessed existence to hold ourselves within the divine will , whereby our very wills are made one . So that as we are from stage to stage throughout this realm , to all the realm is pleasing , as to the King who inwills us with His will . And His will is our peace ; it is that sea whereunto is moving all that which It creates and which nature makes. " 47 : 8 @# Sidenote : The Difference between Poetry and Philosophy. @# Sect. 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosopher-poet from the philosopher himself . The philosopher-poet is one who , having made the philosophical point of view his own , expresses himself in the form of poetry . The philosophical point of view is that from which the universe is comprehended in its totality . The wisdom of the philosopher is the knowledge of each through the knowledge of all . Wherein , then , does the poet , when possessed of such wisdom , differ from the philosopher proper ? To this question one can give readily enough the general answer , that the difference lies in the mode of utterance . Furthermore , we have already given some account of the peculiar manner of the poet . He invites us to experience with him the beautiful and moving in nature and life . That which the poet has to express , and that which he aims to arouse in others , is an appreciative experience . He requires what Wordsworth calls " an atmosphere of sensation in which to move his wings . " Therefore if he is to be philosophical in intelligence , and yet essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate experience . He must be one who , in seeing the many , sees the one . The philosopher-poet is he who visualizes a fundamental interpretation of the world . " A poem , " says one poet , " is the very image of life expressed in its eternal truth. " @# The philosopher proper , on the other hand , has the sterner and less inviting task of rendering such an interpretation articulate to thought . That which the poet sees , the philosopher must define . That which the poet divines , the philosopher must calculate . The philosopher must dig for that which the poet sees shining through . As the poet transcends thought for the sake of experience , the philosopher must transcend experience for the sake of thought . As the poet sees all , and all in each , so the philosopher , knowing each , must think all consistently together , and then know each again . It is the part of philosophy to collect and criticise evidence , to formulate and coordinate conceptions , and finally to define in exact terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily in religion , which is a general conception of the world made the basis of daily living. @# For religion there is no subjective correlative less than life itself . Poetry is another and more circumscribed means of restoring thought to life . By the poet ' s imagination , and through the art of his expression , thought may be sensuously perceived . " If the time should ever come , " says Wordsworth , " when what is now called Science , thus familiarized to men , shall be ready to put on , as it were , a form of flesh , and blood , the Poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration , and will welcome the Being thus produced , as a dear and genuine inmate of the household of man. " 50 : 9 As respects truth , philosophy has an indubitable priority . The very sternness of the philosopher ' s task is due to his supreme dedication to truth . But if validity be the merit of philosophy , it can well be supplemented by immediacy , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sound philosophy , and we may say with Shelley , of his handiwork , that " it is the perfect and consummate surface and bloom of all things ; it is as the odor and the color of the rose to the texture of the elements which compose it , as the form and splendor of unfaded beauty to the secrets of anatomy and corruption . " " Indeed , " as he adds , " what were our consolations on this side of the grave  --  and our aspirations beyond it  --  if poetry did not ascend to bring light and fire from those eternal regions where the owl-winged faculty of calculation dare not ever soar ? " 51 : 10 @# The unity in outlook , attended by differences of method and form , which may exist between poet and philosopher , is signally illustrated by the relation between Goethe and Spinoza .

Mind and heart , understanding and sense , were drawn together with an inevitable elective affinity , and this at the same time produced an intimate union between individuals of the most different types.

The least religious experience is so mysterious and so complex that a moderate degree of reflection upon it tends to a sense of intellectual impotence . " If I speak , " says Emerson , " I define and confine , and am less . " One would gladly set down religion among the unspeakable things and avoid the imputation of degrading it . It is certain that the enterprise of defining religion is at present in disrepute . It has been undertaken so often and so unsuccessfully that contemporary students for the most part prefer to supply a list of historical definitions of religion , and let their variety demonstrate their futility . Metaphysicians and psychologists agree that in view of the differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament that have been true of different religions in different times and places , one may as well abandon the idea that there is a constant element. @# But on the other hand we have the testimony afforded by the name religion ; and the ordinary judgments of men to the effect that it signifies something to be religious , and to be more or less religious . There is an elementary logical principle to the effect that a group name implies certain common group characters . Impatience with abstract or euphemistic definitions should not blind us to the truth . Even the psychologist tends in his description of religious phenomena to single out and emphasize what he calls a typical religious experience . And the same applies to the idealist ' s treatment of the matter. 54 : 1 Religion , he reasons , is essentially a development of which the true meaning can be seen only in the higher stages . The primitive religion is therefore only implicit religion . But lower stages can not be regarded as belonging to a single development with higher stages , if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , or some element which endures throughout . It is unavoidable , then , to assume that in dealing with religion we are dealing with a specific and definable experience. @# Sidenote : The Profitableness of Defining Religion. @# Sect. 16 . The profitableness of undertaking such a definition is another matter . It may well be that in so human and practical an affair as religion , definition is peculiarly inappropriate . But is there not a human and practical value in the very defining of religion ? Is there not a demand for it in the peculiar relation that exists between religion and the progress of enlightenment ? Religion associates itself with the habits of society . The progress of enlightenment means that more or less all the time , and very profoundly at certain critical times , society must change its habits . The consequence is that religion is likely to be abandoned with the old habits . The need of a new religion is therefore a chronic one . The reformer in religion , or the man who wishes to be both enlightened and religious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and undefiled from definite discredited practices and opinions . And the solution of the problem turns upon some apprehension of the essence of religion . There is a large amount of necessary and unnecessary tragedy due to the extrinsic connection between ideas and certain modes of their expression . There can be no more serious and urgent duty than that of expressing as directly , and so as truly as possible , the great permanent human concerns . The men to whom educational reform has been largely due have been the men who have remembered for their fellows what this whole business of education is after all for . Comenius and Pestalozzi served society by stripping educational activity of its historical and institutional accessories , and laying bare the genuine human need that these are designed to satisfy . There is a similar virtue in the insistent attempt to distinguish between the essential and the accessory in religion. @# Sidenote : The True Method of Defining Religion. @# Sect. 17 . Although declining to be discouraged by the conspicuousness of past failures in this connection , one may well profit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen to be consistent with their common nature . The religious experience must not only be found , but must also be reconciled with " the varieties of religious experience . " The inadequacy of the well-known definitions of religion may be attributed to several causes . The commonest fallacy is to define religion in terms of a religion . My definition of religion must include my brother ' s religion , even though he live on the other side of the globe , and my ancestor ' s religion , in spite of his prehistoric remoteness . Error may easily arise through the attempt to define religion in terms of my own religion , or what I conceive to be the true religion . Whatever the relation between ideal religion and actual religion , the field of religion contains by common consent cults that must on their own grounds condemn one another ; religions that are bad religions , and yet religions. @# A more enlightened fallacy , and a more dangerous one , is due to the supposition that religion can be defined exclusively in terms of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion in terms of feeling , intellect , and conduct respectively . But it is always easy to overthrow such a description , by raising the question of its application to evidently religious experiences that belong to some other aspect of life . Religion is not feeling , because there are many phlegmatic , God-fearing men whose religion consists in good works . Religion is not conduct , for there are many mystics whose very religion is withdrawal from the field of action . Religion is not intellection , for no one has ever been able to formulate a creed that is common to all religions . Yet without a doubt one must look for the essence of religion in human nature . The present psychological interest in religion has emphasized this truth . How , then , may we describe it in terms of certain constant conditions of human life , and yet escape the abstractness of the facultative method ? Modern psychology suggests an answer in demonstrating the interdependence of knowledge , feeling , and volition. 58 : 2 The perfect case of this unity is belief . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional as well in content . I believe what I take for granted ; and the object of my belief is not merely known , but also felt and acted upon . What I believe expresses itself in my total experience. @# There is some hope , then , of an adequate definition of the religious experience , if it be regarded as belonging to the psychological type of belief. 58 : 3 Belief , however , is a broader category than religion . There must be some religious type of believing . An account of religion in terms of believing , and the particular type of it here in question , would , then , constitute the central stem of a psychology of religion , and affords the proper conceptions for a description of the religious experience . Even here the reservation must be made that belief is always more than the believing state , in that it means to be true. 59 : 4 Hence to complete an account of religion one should consider its object , or its cognitive implications . But this direct treatment of the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present chapter we shall have come to appreciate the inwardness of the religious consciousness . To this end we must permit ourselves to be enlightened by the experience of religious people as viewed from within . It is not our opinion of a man ' s religion that is here in question , but the content and meaning which it has for him. @# " I would have you , " says Fielding , in his " Hearts of Men , " " go and kneel beside the Mahommedan as he prays at the sunset hour , and put your heart to his and wait for the echo that will surely come . . . . I would have you go to the hillman smearing the stone with butter that his god may be pleased , to the woman crying to the forest god for her sick child , to the boy before his monks learning to be good . No matter where you go , no matter what the faith is called , if you have the hearing ear , if your heart is in unison with the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 59 : 5 @# Sidenote : Religion as Belief. @# Sect. 18 . The general identification of religion with belief is made without serious difficulty . The essential factor in belief , is , as we have seen , the reaction of the whole personality to a fixed object or accepted situation . A similar principle underlies common judgments about a man ' s religion . He is accounted most religious whose religion penetrates his life most intimately . In the man whose religion consists in the outer exercise of attendance upon church , we recognize the sham . He appears to be religious . He does one of the things which a religious man would do ; but an object of religious faith is not the constant environment of his life . He may or may not feel sure of God from his pew , but God is not among the things that count in his daily life . God does not enter into his calculations or determine his scale of values . Again , discursive thinking is regarded as an interruption of religion . When I am at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and for common opinion doubt is identical with irreligion . In so far as I am religious , my religion stands in no need of justification , even though I regard it as justifiable . In my religious experience I am taking something for granted ; in other words I act about it and feel about it in a manner that is going to be determined by the special conditions of my mood and temperament . The mechanical and prosaic man acknowledges God in his mechanical and prosaic way . He believes in divine retribution as he believes in commercial or social retribution . He is as careful to prepare for the next world as he is to be respectable in this . The poet , on the other hand , believes in God after the manner of his genius . Though he worship God in spirit he may conduct his life in an irregular manner peculiar to himself . Difference of mood in the same individual may be judged by the same measure . When God is most real to him , brought home to him most vividly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious . When , on the other hand , God is merely a name to him , and church a routine , or when both are forgotten in the daily occupations , he is least religious . His life on the whole is said to be religious in so far as periods of the second type are subordinated to periods of the first type . Further well-known elements of belief , corollaries of the above , are evidently present in religion . A certain imagery remains constant throughout an individual ' s experience . He comes back to it as to a physical object in space . And although religion is sporadically an exclusive and isolated affair , it tends strongly to be social . The religious object , or God , is a social object , common to me and to my neighbor , and presupposed in our collective undertakings . This reduction of religion to the type of the believing state should thus provide us with an answer to that old and fundamental question concerning the relative priority of faith and works . The test of the faith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as they are the expression of the faith . Religion is not the doing of anything nor the feeling of anything nor the thinking of anything , but the reacting as a whole , in terms of all possible activities of human life , to some accepted situation. @# Sidenote : Religion as Belief in a Disposition or Attitude. @# Sect. 19 . We may now face the more interesting but difficult question of the special character of religious belief . In spite of the fact that in these days the personality of God is often regarded as a transient feature of religion , that type of belief which throws most light upon the religious experience is the belief in persons . Our belief in persons consists in the practical recognition of a more or less persistent disposition toward ourselves . The outward behavior of our fellow-men is construed in terms of the practical bearing of the attitude which it implies . The extraordinary feature of such belief is the disproportion between its vividness and the direct evidence for it . Of this we are most aware in connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile to ourselves . We are always more or less clearly in the presence of our friends and enemies . Their well-wishing or their ill-wishing haunts the scene of our living . There is no more important constituent of what the psychologists call our " general feeling tone . " There are times when we are entirely possessed by a state that is either exuberance in the presence of those who love us , or awkwardness and stupidity in the presence of those whom we believe to suspect and dislike us . The latter state may easily become chronic . Many men live permanently in the presence of an accusing audience . The inner life which expresses itself in the words , " Everybody hates me ! " is perhaps the most common form of morbid self-consciousness . On the other hand , buoyancy of spirits springs largely from a constant faith in the good-will of one ' s fellows . In this case one is filled with a sense of security , and is conscious of a sympathetic reinforcement that adds to private joys and compensates for private sorrows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can feel the presence of a " great man , " a " formidable person , " a superior or inferior , one who is interested or indifferent to our talk , and all the subtlest degrees of approval and disapproval. @# A similar sensibility may quicken us even in situations where no direct individual attitude to ourselves is implied . We regard places and communities as congenial when we are in sympathy with the prevailing purposes or standards of value . We may feel ill at ease or thoroughly at home in cities where we know no single human soul . Indeed , in a misanthrope like Rousseau ( and who has not his Rousseau moods ! ) the mere absence of social repression arouses a most intoxicating sense of tunefulness and security . Nature plays the part of an indulgent parent who permits all sorts of personal liberties. @# " The view of a fine country , a succession of agreeable prospects , a free air , a good appetite , and the health I gain by walking ; the freedom of inns , and the distance from everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conspire to free my soul , and give boldness to my thoughts , throwing me , in a manner , into the immensity of things , where I combine , choose , and appropriate them to my fancy , without restraint or fear . I dispose of all nature as I please. " 64 : 6 @# Sidenote : Religion as Belief in the Disposition of the Residual Environment , or Universe. @# Sect. 20 . In such confidence or distrust , inspired originally by the social environment , and similarly suggested by other surroundings of life , we have the key to the religious consciousness . But it is now time to add that in the case of religion these attitudes are concerned with the universal or supernatural rather than with present and normal human relationships . Religious reactions are " total reactions. " @# " To get at them , " says William James , " you must go behind the foreground of existence and reach down to that curious sense of the whole residual cosmos as an everlasting presence , intimate or alien , terrible or amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses . This sense of the world ' s presence , appealing as it does to our peculiar individual temperament , makes us either strenuous or careless , devout or blasphemous , gloomy or exultant about life at large ; and our reaction , involuntary and inarticulate and often half unconscious as it is , is the completest of all our answers to the question , ' What is the character of this universe in which we dwell ? ' " 65 : 7 @# This residual environment , or profounder realm of tradition and nature , may have any degree of unity from chaos to cosmos . For religion its significance lies in the idea of original and far-reaching power rather than in the idea of totality . But that which is at first only " beyond , " is practically the same object as that which comes in the development of thought to be conceived as the " world " or the " universe . " We may therefore use these latter terms to indicate the object of religion , until the treatment of special instances shall define it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s sense of the disposition of the universe to himself . We shall expect to find , as in the social phenomena with which we have just dealt , that the manifestation of this sense consists in a general reaction appropriate to the disposition so attributed . He will be fundamentally ill at ease , profoundly confident , or will habitually take precautions to be safe . The ultimate nature of the world is here no speculative problem . The savage who could feel some joy at living in the universe would be more religious than the sublimest dialectician . It is in the vividness of the sense of this presence that the acuteness of religion consists . I am religious in so far as the whole tone and temper of my living reflects a belief as to what the universe thinks of such as me. @# Sidenote : Examples of Religious Belief. @# Sect. 21 . The examples that follow are selected because their differences in personal flavor serve to throw into relief their common religious character . Theodore Parker , in describing his own boyhood , writes as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the terrible effect the doctrine of eternal damnation had on me . How many , many hours have I wept with terror as I lay on my bed , till , between praying and weeping , sleep gave me repose .

But for years , say from seven till ten , I said my prayers with much devotion , I think , and then continued to repeat , ' Lord , forgive my sins , ' till sleep came on me. " 67 : 8 @# Compare with this Stevenson ' s Christmas letter to his mother , in which he says : @# " The whole necessary morality is kindness ; and it should spring , of itself , from the one fundamental doctrine , Faith .

Indeed , he ought not only to be the same , but much more , in his inward disposition of soul ; because he professes to serve a God who sees the inward parts , a searcher of the heart and reins , a God and Father of spirits : and therefore , since we are always in His sight , we should be exceedingly careful to avoid all impurity , all that may give offence to Him whose eyes can not behold iniquity . We should , in a word , so far as mortal and frail nature can , imitate the blessed angels in all manner of holiness , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His presence . . . . And good men have always this notion of the thing . For they depend upon God for the success of all they do , even of their best and wisest undertakings. " 68 : 10 @# Such is to be the practical acknowledgment of God in the routine of life . The more direct response to this presence appears abundantly in St. Augustine ' s conversation and reminiscence with God. @# " How evil have not my deeds been ; or if not my deeds my words ; or if not my words my will ? But Thou , O Lord , art good and merciful , and Thy right hand had respect unto the profoundness of my death , and removed from the bottom of my heart that abyss of corruption .

Now was my soul free from the gnawing cares of seeking and getting . . . . And I babbled unto Thee my brightness , my riches , and my health , the Lord my God. " 69 : 11 @# In these two passages we meet with religious conduct and with the supreme religious experience , the direct worship of God . In each case the heart of the matter is an individual ' s indubitable conviction of the world ' s favorable concern for him . The deeper order of things constitutes the real and the profoundly congenial community in which he lives. @# Sidenote : Typical Religious Phenomena : Conversion. @# Sect. 22 . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain typical religious phenomena : conversion ; piety ; and religious instruments , symbolisms , and modes of conveyance . Although recent study of the phenomenon of conversion has brought to light a considerable amount of interesting material , there is some danger of misconceiving its importance . The psychology of conversion is primarily the psychology of crisis or radical alteration , rather than the psychology of religion . For the majority of religious men and women conversion is an insignificant event , and in very many cases it never occurs at all . Religion is more purely present where it is normal and monotonous . But this phenomenon is nevertheless highly significant in that religion and irreligion are placed in close juxtaposition , and the contribution of religion at its inception thereby emphasized . In general it is found that conversion takes place during the period of adolescence . But this is the time of the most sudden expansion of the environment of life ; a time when there is the awakening consciousness of many a new presence . This is sometimes expressed by saying that it is a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over against its inheritance ; the whole setting of life sweeps into view . Some solution of the life problem , some coming to terms with the universe , is the normal issue of it . Religious conversion signifies , then , that in this fundamental adjustment a man defines and accepts for his life a certain attitude on the part of the universe . The examples cited by the psychologists , as well as the generalizations which they derive , bear out this interpretation. @# " General Booth , the founder of the Salvation Army , considers that the first vital step in saving outcasts consists in making them feel that some decent human being cares enough for them to take an interest in the question whether they are to rise or sink. " 71 : 12 @# The new state is here one of courage and hope stimulated by the glow of friendly interest . The convert is no longer " out in the cold . " He is told that the world wishes him well , and this is brought home to him through representations of the tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who mediate it . But somehow the convert must be persuaded to realize all this . He must believe it before it can mean anything to him . He is therefore urged to pray  --  a proceeding that is at first ridiculous to him , since it involves taking for granted what he disbelieves . But therein lies the critical point . It is peculiar to the object in this case that it can exist only for one who already believes in it . The psychologists call this the element of " self-surrender . " To be converted a man must somehow suffer his surroundings to put into him a new heart , which may thereupon confirm its object . Such belief is tremendously tenacious because it so largely creates its own evidence . Once believe that " God , in the long run , means kindness by you , " and you are likely to stand by it to the end  --  the more so in this case because the external evidence either way is to the average man so insufficient . Such a belief as this is inspired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers of suggestion that personality and social contagion can afford. @# Sidenote : Piety. @# Sect. 23 . The psychologists describe piety as a sense of unity . One feels after reading their accounts that they are too abstract . For there are many kinds of unity , characteristic of widely varying moods and states . Any state of rapt attention is a state of unity , and this occurs in the most secular and humdrum moments of life . Nor does it help matters to say that in the case of religion this unity must have been preceded by a state of division ; for we can not properly characterize any state of mind in terms of another state unless the latter be retained in the former . And that which is characteristic of the religious sense of unity would seem to be just such an overcoming of difference . There is a recognition of two distinct attitudes , which may be more or less in sympathy with one another , but which are both present even in their fullest harmony . Were I to be taken out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably lose that sense of sympathy from which arises the peculiar exultation of religious faith , a heightened experience of the same type with the freedom and spontaneity that I experience in the presence of those with whom I feel most in accord . The further graces and powers of religion readily submit to a similar description . My sense of positive sympathy expresses itself in an attitude of well-wishing ; living in an atmosphere of kindness I instinctively endeavor to propagate it . My buoyancy is distinctly of that quality which to a lesser degree is due to any sense of social security ; my power is that of one who works in an environment that reenforces him . I experience the objective or even cosmical character of my enterprises . They have a momentum which makes me their instrument rather than their perpetrator . A paradoxical relation between religion and morality has always interested observers of custom and history . Religion is apparently as capable of the most fiendish malevolence as of the most saintly gentleness . Fielding writes that , @# " When religion is brought out or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon in the world it has no effect either for good or evil . Its effect is simply in strengthening the heart , in blinding the eyes , in deafening the ears . It is an intensive force , an intoxicant . It doubles or trebles a man ' s powers . It is an impulsive force sending him headlong down the path of emotion , whether that path lead to glory or to infamy . It is a tremendous stimulant , that is all. " 74 : 13 @# Religion does not originate life purposes or define their meaning , but stimulates them by the same means that works in all corporate and social activity . To work with the universe is the most tremendous incentive that can appeal to the individual will . Hence in highly ethical religions the power for good exceeds that of any other social and spiritual agency . Such religion makes present , actual , and real , that good on the whole which the individual otherwise tends to distinguish from that which is good for him . In daily life the morally valid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the ethical religion makes the valid urgent. @# Sidenote : Religious Instruments , Symbolism , and Modes of Conveyance. @# Sect. 24 . The instruments of religion are legion , and it is in order here only to mention certain prominent cases in which their selection would seem to have direct reference to the provocation and perpetuation of such a sense of attitude as we have been describing . This is true in a general way of all symbolism . There is no essential difference between the religious symbol and such symbols as serve to remind us of human relationships . In both cases the perceptual absence of will is compensated for by the presence of some object associated with that will . The function of this object is due to its power to revive and perpetuate a certain special social atmosphere . But the most important vehicle of religion has always been personality . It is , after all , to priests , prophets , and believers that religious cults have owed their long life . The traits that mark the prophet are both curious and sublime . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the universe . Whether it be due to lack of a sense of humor or to a profound conviction of truth , is indifferent to our purpose . The power of such men is undoubtedly in their suggestion of a force greater than they , whose designs they bring directly and socially to the attention of men . The prophet in his prophesying is indeed not altogether distinguished from God , and it is through the mediation of a directly perceptible human attitude that a divine attitude gets itself fixed in the imagination of the believer . What is true of the prophet is equally true of the preacher whose function it is not to represent God in his own person , but to depict him with his tongue . It is generally recognized that the preacher is neither a moralizer nor a theologian . But it is less perfectly understood that it is his function to suggest the presence of God . His proper language is that of the imagination , and the picture which he portrays is that of a reciprocal social relationship between man and the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define God or prove God , but introduce Him and talk about Him . And at the same time the association of prayer and worship with his sermon , and the atmosphere created by the meeting together of a body of disciples , will act as the confirmation of his suggestions of such a living presence. @# The conveyance of any single religious cult from generation to generation affords a signal illustration of the importance in religion of the recognition of attitude . Religions manage somehow to survive any amount of transformation of creed and ritual . It is not what is done , or what is thought , that identifies the faith of the first Christians with that of the last , but a certain reckoning with the disposition of God . The successive generations of Christians are introduced into the spiritual world of their fathers , with its furnishing of hopes and fears remaining substantially the same ; and their Christianity consists in their continuing to live in it with only a slight and gradual renovation . To any given individual God is more or less completely represented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and through them he fixes as the centre of his system an image of God his accuser or redeemer. @# Sidenote : Historical Types of Religion . Primitive Religions. @# Sect. 25 . The complete verification of this interpretation of the religious experience would require the application of it to the different historical cults . In general the examination of such instances is entirely beyond the scope of this chapter ; but a brief consideration may be given to those which seem to afford reasonable grounds for objection. @# First , it may be said that in primitive religions , notably in fetichism , tabooism , and totemism , there is no recognition of a cosmical unity . It is quite evident that there is no conception of a universe . But it is equally evident that the natural and historical environment in its generality has a very specific practical significance for the primitive believer . It is often said with truth that these earliest religions are more profoundly pantheistic than polytheistic . Man recognizes an all-pervading interest that is capable of being directed to himself . The selection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deification possessed by the individual object itself , but to the tacit presumption that , as Thales said , " all things are full of gods . " The disposition of residual reality manifests to the believer no consistency or unity , but it is nevertheless the most constant object of his will . He lives in the midst of a capriciousness which he must appease if he is to establish himself at all. @# Sidenote : Buddhism. @# Sect. 26 . Secondly , in the case of Buddhism we are said to meet with a religion that is essentially atheistic. @# " Whether Buddhas arise , O priests , or whether Buddhas do not arise , it remains a fact and the fixed and necessary constitution of being , that all its constituents are transitory. " 78 : 14 @# The secret of life lies in the application of this truth : @# " O builder ! I ' ve discovered thee ! This fabric thou shalt ne ' er rebuild ! Thy rafters all are broken now , And pointed roof demolished lies ! This mind has demolition reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 78 : 15 @# The case of Buddha himself and of the exponents of his purely esoteric doctrine , belong to the reflective type which will presently be given special consideration . But with the ordinary believer , even where an extraneous but almost inevitable polytheism is least in evidence , the religious experience consists in substantially the same elements that appear in theistic religions . The individual is here living appropriately to the ultimate nature of things , with the ceaseless periods of time in full view . That which is brought home to him is the illusoriness and hollowness of things when taken in the spirit of active endeavor . The only profound and abiding good is nothingness . While nature and society conspire to mock him , Nirvana invites him to its peace . The religious course of his life consists in the use of such means as can win him this end . From the stand-point of the universe he has the sympathy only of that wisdom whose essence is self-destruction . And this truth is mediated by the imagination of divine sympathy , for the Blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# Sidenote : Critical Religion. @# Sect. 27 . Finally there remains the consideration of the bearing of this interpretation upon the more refined and disciplined religions . The religion of the critically enlightened man is less naive and credulous in its imagery . God tends to vanish into an ideal or a universal , into some object of theoretical definition . Here we are on that borderland where an assignment of individual cases can never be made with any certainty of correctness . We can generalize only by describing the conditions that such cases must fulfil if they are properly to be denominated religious . And there can be no question of the justice of deriving such a description from the reports of historical and institutional religions . An idealistic philosophy will , then , be a religion just in so far as it is rendered practically vivid by the imagination . Such imagination must create and sustain a social relationship . The question of the legitimacy of this imagination is another matter . It raises the issue concerning the judgment of truth implied in religion , and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious experience may be realized by virtue of the metaphorical or poetical representation of a situation as one of intercommunication between persons , where reflective definition at the same time denies it . The human worshipper may supply the personality of God from himself , viewing himself as from the divine stand-point . But whatever faculty supplies this indispensable social quality of religion , he who defines God as the ultimate goodness or the ultimate truth , has certainly not yet worshipped Him . He begins to be religious only when such an ideal determines the atmosphere of his daily living ; when he regards the immanence of such an ideal in nature and history as the object of his will ; and when he responds to its presence in the spirit of his conduct and his contemplation. @# FOOTNOTES : @# 54 : 1 Cf.

In the case of religion this disposition is attributed to the more or less vaguely conceived residual environment that is recognized as lying outside of the more familiar natural and social relations . After the rise of science this residual environment tends to be conceived as a unity which is ultimate or fundamental , but for the religious consciousness it is more commonly regarded as a general source of influence practically worthy of consideration . Such a belief , like all belief , is vitally manifested , with such emphasis upon action , feeling , or intellection as temperament and mood may determine. @# Sidenote : Religion Means to be True. @# Sect. 29 . But if the psychology of belief is the proper starting-point for a description of the religious experience , it is none the less suggestive of the fact that religion , just because it is belief , is not wholly a matter for psychology . For religion means to be true , and thus submits itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion is misleading when accepted as a substitute for philosophical criticism . The religious man takes his religion not as a narcotic , but as an enlightenment . Its subjective worth is due at any rate in part to the supposition of its objective worth . As in any case of insight , that which warms the heart must have satisfied the mind . The religious experience purports to be the part of wisdom , and to afford only such happiness as increasing wisdom would confirm . And the charm of truth can not survive its truthfulness . Hence , though religion may be described , it can not be justified , from the stand-point of therapeutics . Were such the case it would be the real problem of religious leaders to find a drug capable of giving a constantly pleasant tone to their patient ' s experience. 83 : 1 There would be no difference between priests and physicians who make a specialty of nervous diseases , except that the former would aim at a more fundamental and perpetual suggestion of serenity . Now no man wants to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwell constantly in a fictitious world , even if it be after his own heart . He may from the cynical point of view actually do so , but if he be religious he thinks it is reality , and is satisfied only in so far as he thinks so . He regards the man who has said in his heart that there is no God as the fool , and not because he may have to suffer for it , but because he is cognitively blind to the real nature of things . Piety , on the other hand , he regards as the standard experience , the most veracious life . Hence , it is not an accident that religion has had its creeds and its controversies , its wars with science and its appeals to philosophy . The history of these affairs shows that religion commonly fails to understand the scope of its own demand for truth ; but they have issued from the deep conviction that one ' s religion is , implicitly , at least , in the field of truth ; that there are theoretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general fact being admitted , there remains the task to which the present discussion addresses itself , that of defining the kind of theoretical judgment implied in religion , and the relation to this central cognitive stem of its efflorescences of myth , theology , and ritual . It is impossible to separate the stem and the efflorescence , or to determine the precise spot at which destruction of the tissue would prove fatal to the plant , but it is possible to obtain some idea of the relative vitality of the parts. @# Sidenote : Religion Means to be Practically True . God is a Disposition from which Consequences May Rationally be Expected. @# Sect. 30 . The difficulty of reaching a definite statement in this matter is due to the fact that the truth in which any religious experience centres is a practical and not a scientific truth . A practical truth does not commit itself to any single scientific statement , and can often survive the overthrow of that scientific statement in which at any given time it has found expression . In other words , an indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . An instance of this is the consistency with my expectation of the alternation of day and night , of either the Ptolemaic or Copernican formulation of the solar system . Now expectation that the sun will rise to-morrow is an excellent analogue of my religious belief . Celestial mechanics is as relevant to the one as metaphysics to the other . Neither is overthrown until a central practical judgment is discredited , and either could remain true through a very considerable alteration of logical definition ; but neither is on this account exempt from theoretical responsibility . In so far as religion deliberately enters the field of science , and defines its formularies with the historical or metaphysical method , this difficulty does not , of course , exist . Grant that the years of Methuselah ' s life , or the precise place and manner of the temptation of Jesus , or the definition of Christ in the terms of the Athanasian Creed , are constitutive of Christianity , and the survival of that religion will be determined by the solution of ordinary problems of historical or metaphysical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his religion is only externally and accidentally related to such propositions , since they are never or very rarely intended in his experience . As religious he is occupied with Christ as his saviour or with God as his protector and judge . The history of Jesus or the metaphysics of God essentially concern him only in so far as they may or may not invalidate this relationship . He cares only for the power and disposition of the divine , and these are affected by history and metaphysics only in so far as he has definitely put them to such proof. @# For my religion is my sense of a practical situation , and only when that has been proved to be folly has my religion become untrue . My God is my practical faith , my plan of salvation . My religion is overthrown if I am convinced that I have misconceived the situation and mistaken what I should do to be saved . The conception of God is very simple practically , and very complex theoretically , a fact that confirms its practical genesis . My conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the disposition of the universe toward my interests , and some working plan for the reconciliation of these two terms . These three elements form a practical unity , but each is capable of emphasis , and a religion may be transformed through the modification of any one of them . It appears , then , as has always been somewhat vaguely recognized , that the truth of religion is ethical as well as metaphysical or scientific . My religion will be altered by a change in my conception of what constitutes my real interest , a change in my conception of the fundamental causes of reality , or a change in my conception of the manner in which my will may or may not affect these causes . God is neither an entity nor an ideal , but always a relation of entity to ideal : reality regarded from the stand-point of its favorableness or unfavorableness to human life , and prescribing for the latter the propriety of a certain attitude. @# Sidenote : Historical Examples of Religious Truth and Error . The Religion of Baal. @# Sect. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but certain of these are especially calculated to emphasize the application of a criterion to religion . Such is the case with Elijah ' s encounter with the prophets of Baal , as narrated in the Old Testament. @# " And Elijah came near unto all the people , and said , How long halt ye between two opinions ? If Yahweh be God , follow him : but if Baal , then follow him . . . . And call ye on the name of your god , and I will call on the name of Yahweh : and the God that answereth by fire , let him be God . . . . And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal , Choose you one bullock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under . And they took the bullock which was given them , and they dressed it , and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon , saying , O Baal , hear us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . . . . And it came to pass at noon , that Elijah mocked them , and said , Cry aloud : for he is a god ; either he is musing , or he is gone aside , or he is in a journey , or peradventure he sleepeth , and must be awaked . And they cried aloud , and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances , till the blood gushed out upon them . . . . But there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded. " 88 : 2 @# The religion of the followers of Baal here consists in a belief in the practical virtue of a mode of address and form of ritual associated with the traditions and customs of a certain social group . The prophets of this cult agree to regard the experiment proposed by Elijah as a crucial test , and that which is disproved from its failure is a plan of action . These prophets relied upon the presence of a certain motivity , from which a definite response could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make ; but though " they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening oblation , " there was none that regarded. @# Sidenote : Greek Religion. @# Sect. 32 . An equally familiar and more instructive example is the refutation of the Greek national religion by Lucretius . The conception of life which Lucretius finds unwarranted is best depicted in Homer . There we hear of a society composed of gods and men . Though the gods , on the one hand , have their own history , their affairs are never sharply sundered from those of men , who , on the other hand , must constantly reckon with them , gauge their attitude , and seek their favor by paying tribute to their individual humors and preferences . In the Ninth Book of the " Iliad , " Phoenix addresses himself to the recalcitrant Achilles as follows : @# " It fits not one that moves The hearts of all , to live unmov ' d , and succor hates for loves . The Gods themselves are flexible ; whose virtues , honors , pow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bend their breasts as we bend ours . Perfumes , benign devotions , savors of offerings burn ' d , And holy rites , the engines are with which their hearts are turn ' d , By men that pray to them. " 90 : 3 @# Here is a general recognition of that which makes sacrifice rational . It is because he conceives this presupposition to be mistaken , that Lucretius declares the practices and fears which are founded upon it to be folly . It is the same with all that is practically based upon the expectation of a life beyond the grave . The correction of the popular religion is due in his opinion to that true view of the world taught by Epicurus , whose memory Lucretius thus invokes at the opening of the Third Book of the " De Rerum Natura " : @# " Thee , who first wast able amid such thick darkness to raise on high so bright a beacon and shed a light on the true interests of life , thee I follow , glory of the Greek race , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . For soon as thy philosophy issuing from a godlike intellect has begun with loud voice , to proclaim the nature of things , the terrors of the mind are dispelled , the walls of the world part asunder , I see things in operation throughout the whole void : the divinity of the gods is revealed and their tranquil abodes which neither winds do shake nor clouds drench with rains nor snow congealed by sharp frost harms with hoary fall : an ever cloudless ether o ' ercanopies them , and they laugh with light shed largely round . Nature too supplies all their wants and nothing ever impairs their peace of mind . But on the other hand the Acherusian quarters91 : 4 are nowhere to be seen , though earth is no bar to all things being descried , which are in operation underneath our feet throughout the void. " 91 : 5 @# In another passage , after describing the Phrygian worship of Cybele , he comments as follows : @# " All which , well and beautifully as it is set forth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the nature of gods must ever in itself of necessity enjoy immortality together with supreme repose , far removed and withdrawn from our concerns ; since exempt from every pain , exempt from all dangers , strong in its own resources , not wanting aught of us , it is neither gained by favors nor moved by anger . . . . The earth however is at all time without feeling , and because it receives into it the first-beginnings of many things , it brings them forth in many ways into the light of the sun. " 91 : 6 @# If the teaching of Epicurus be true it is evident that those who offered hecatombs with the idea that they were thereby mitigating anger , or securing special dispensation , were playing the fool .

The history of religion contains no more impressive and dramatic chapter than that which records the development of the religion of the Jews . Passing over its obscure beginnings in the primitive Semitic cult , we find this religion first clearly defined as tribal self-interest sanctioned by Yahweh. 92 : 8 God ' s interest in his chosen people determines the prosperity of him who practices the social virtues. @# " The name of Yahweh is a strong tower : the righteous runneth into it , and is safe. " @# " He that is steadfast in righteousness shall attain unto life. " @# " To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice. " 93 : 9 @# But in time it is evident to the believer that his experience does not bear out this expectation . Neither as a Jew nor as a righteous man does he prosper more than his neighbor . He comes , therefore , to distrust the virtue of his wisdom. @# " Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ' s eyes are in his head , and the fool walketh in darkness : and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all . Then said I in my heart , As it happeneth to the fool , so will it happen even to me ; and why was I then more wise ? Then I said in my heart , that this also was vanity . For of the wise man , even as of the fool , there is no remembrance forever ; seeing that in the days to come all will have been already forgotten . And how doth the wise man die even as the fool ! So I hated life ; because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me : for all is vanity and a striving after wind. " 93 : 10 @# It is evident that he who expects the favor of fortune in return for his observance of precept is mistaken . The " work that is wrought under the sun " makes no special provision for him during his lifetime . Unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a reinterpretation of the promise of God . This appears in the new ideal of patient submission , and the chastened faith that expects only the love of God . And those whom God loves He will not forsake . They will come to their own , if not here , then beyond , according to His inscrutable but unswerving plan. @# " The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit : a broken and a contrite heart , O God , thou wilt not despise. " @# " For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity , whose name is Holy : I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. " 94 : 11 @# In this faith Judaism merges into Christianity. 94 : 12 In the whole course of this evolution God is regarded as the friend of his people , but his people learn to find a new significance in his friendship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires and the expectation which it determines . The practical ideal which the relationship sanctions , changes gradually from that of prudence to that of goodness for its own sake . God , once an instrument relevant to human temporal welfare , has come to be an object of disinterested service. @# No such transformation as this was absolutely realized during the period covered by the writings of the Old Testament , nor has it even yet been realized in the development of Christianity . But the evolution of both Judaism and Christianity has taken this direction . The criterion of this evolution is manifestly both ethical and metaphysical . A Christian avows that he rates purity of character above worldly prosperity , so that the former can not properly be prized for the sake of the latter . Furthermore , he shares more or less unconsciously such philosophical and scientific opinions as deny truth to the conception of special interferences and dispensations from a supernatural agency . Therefore he looks for no fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice . But his religion is nevertheless a practical expectation . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and sustains him . He believes that there obtains between himself , in so far as good , and the universe sub specie eternitatis , a real sympathy and reciprocal reenforcement . He believes that he secures through the profoundly potent forces of the universe that which he regards as of most worth ; and that somewhat is added to these forces by virtue of his consecration . The God of the Christians can not be defined short of some such account as this , inclusive of an ideal , an attitude , and an expectation . In other words the God of the Christians is to be known only in terms of the Christlike outlook upon life , in which the disciple is taught to emulate the master . When moral and intellectual development shall have discredited either its scale of values , or its conviction that cosmical events are in the end determined in accordance with that scale of values , then Christianity must either be transformed , or be untenable for the wise man . If we have conceived the essence of Christianity too broadly or vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its essence is , at any rate , some such inwardness of life resolving ideality and reality into one , and drawing upon objective truth only to the extent required for the confirming of that relation. @# Sidenote : The Cognitive Factor in Religion. @# Sect. 34 . We conclude , then , our attempt to emphasize the cognitive factor in religion , with the thesis that every religion centres in a practical secret of the universe . To be religious is to believe that a certain correlation of forces , moral and factual , is in reality operative , and that it determines the propriety and effectiveness of a certain type of living . Whatever demonstrates the futility , vanity , or self-deception of this living , discredits the religion . And , per contra , except as they define or refute such practical truth , religion is not essentially concerned with theoretical judgments. @# Sidenote : The Place of Imagination in Religion. @# Sect. 35 . But neither religion nor any other human interest consists in essentials . Such a practical conviction as that which has been defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nourishment every spontaneity of human nature . If it be said that only the practical conviction is essential , this is not the same as to say that all else is superfluous . There may be no single utterance that my religion could not have spared , and yet were I to be altogether dumb my religion would , indeed , be as nothing . For if I believe , I accept a presence in my world , which as I live will figure in my dreams , or in my thoughts , or in my habits . And each of these expressions of myself will have a truth if it do but bear out my practical acceptance of that presence . The language of religion , like that of daily life , is not the language of science except it take it upon itself to be so . There is scarcely a sentence which I utter in my daily intercourse with men which is not guilty of transgressions against the canons of accurate and definite thinking . Yet if I deceive neither myself nor another , I am held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance and accident , material purposes and spiritual causes , and though I vow that the sun smiles or the moon lets down her hair into the sea . Science is a special interest in the discovery of unequivocal and fixed conceptions , and employs its terms with an unalterable connotation . But no such algebra of thought is indispensable to life or conversation , and its lack is no proof of error . Such is the case also with that eminently living affair , religion . I may if I choose , and I will if my reasoning powers be at all awakened , be a theologian . But theology , like science , is a special intellectual spontaneity . St. Thomas , the master theologian , did not glide unwittingly from prayer into the quaestiones of the " Summa Theologiae , " but turned to them as to a fresh adventure . Theology is inevitable , because humanly speaking adventure is inevitable . For man , with his intellectual spontaneity , every object is a problem ; and did he not seek sooner or later to define salvation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not practically reckon with any . But this is similarly and independently true of the imagination , the most familiar means with which man clothes and vivifies his convictions , the exuberance with which he plays about them and delights to confess them . The imagination of religion , contributing what Matthew Arnold called its " poetry and eloquence , " does not submit itself to such canons as are binding upon theology or science , but exists and flourishes in its own right. @# The indispensableness to religion of the imagination is due to that faculty ' s power of realizing what is not perceptually present . Religion is not interested in the apparent , but in the secret essence or the transcendent universal . And yet this interest is a practical one . Imagination may introduce one into the vivid presence of the secret or the transcendent . It is evident that the religious imagination here coincides with poetry . For it is at least one of the interests of poetry to cultivate and satisfy a sense for the universal ; to obtain an immediate experience or appreciation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And where a poet elects so to view the world , we allow him as a poet the privilege , and judge him by the standards to which he submits himself . That upon which we pass judgment is the fitness of his expression . This expression is not , except in the case of the theoretical mystic , regarded as constituting the most valid form of the idea , but is appreciated expressly for its fulfilment of the condition of immediacy . The same sort of critical attitude is in order with the fruits of the religious imagination . These may or may not fulfil enough of the requirements of that art to be properly denominated poetry ; but like poetry they are the translation of ideas into a specific language . They must not , therefore , be judged as though they claimed to excel in point of validity , but only in point of consistency with the context of that language . And the language of religion is the language of the practical life . Such translation is as essential to an idea that is to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediacy is essential to an idea that is to enter into the appreciative consciousness of the poet . No object can find a place in my religion until it is conjoined with my purposes and hopes ; until it is taken for granted and acted upon , like the love of my friends , or the courses of the stars , or the stretches of the sea. @# Sidenote : The Special Functions of the Religious Imagination. @# Sect. 36 . The religious imagination , then , is to be understood and justified as that which brings the objects of religion within the range of living . The central religious object , as has been seen , is an attitude of the residuum or totality of things . To be religious one must have a sense for the presence of an attitude , like his sense for the presence of his human fellows , with all the added appreciation that is proper in the case of an object that is unique in its mystery or in its majesty . It follows that the religious imagination fulfils its function in so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those which lend vividness and reality to the normal social relations. @# The presence of one ' s fellows is in part the perceptual experience of their bodies . To this there corresponds in religion some extraordinary or subtle appearance . The gods may in visions or dreams be met with in their own proper embodiments ; or , as is more common , they may be regarded as present for practical purposes : in some inanimate object , as in the case of the fetish ; in some animal species , as in the case of the totem ; in some place , as in the case of the shrine ; or even in some human being , as in the case of the inspired prophet and miracle worker . In more refined and highly developed religions the medium of God ' s presence is less specific . He is perceived with @# "  --  a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused , Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns , And the round ocean and the living air , And the blue sky , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in an interpretation of the common and the natural , rather than in any individual and peculiar embodiment . And here the poet ' s appreciation , if not his art , is peculiarly indispensable. @# But , furthermore , his fellows are inmates of " the household of man " in that he knows their history . They belong to the temporal context of actions and events . Similarly , the gods must be historical . The sacred traditions or books of religion are largely occupied with this history . The more individual and anthropomorphic the gods , the more local and episodic will be the account of their affairs . In the higher religions the acts of God are few and momentous , such as creation or special providence ; or they are identical with the events of nature and human history when these are construed as divine . To find God in this latter way requires an interpretation of the course of events in terms of some moral consistency , a faith that sees some purpose in their evident destination. @# There is still another and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of address and conversation . And men have invariably held a similar intercourse with their gods . To this category belong communion and prayer , with all their varieties of expression . I have no god until I address him . This will be the most direct evidence of what is at least from my point of view a social relation . There can be no general definition of the form which this address will take . There may be as many special languages , as many attitudes , and as much playfulness and subtlety of symbolism as in human intercourse . But , on the other hand , there are certain utterances that are peculiarly appropriate to religion . In so far as he regards his object as endowed with both power and goodness the worshipper will use the language of adoration ; and the sense of his dependence will speak in terms of consecration and thanksgiving. @# " O God , thou art my God ; early will I seek thee : My soul thirsteth for thee , my flesh longeth for thee , In a dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary , To see thy power and thy glory . For thy loving-kindness is better than life ; My lips shall praise thee " @# These are expressions of a hopeful faith ; but , on the other hand , God may be addressed in terms of hatred and distrust. @# " Who is most wretched in this dolorous place ? I think myself ; yet I would rather be My miserable self than He , than He Who formed such creatures to his own disgrace. @# " The vilest thing must be less vile than Thou From whom it had its being , God and Lord ! Creator of all woe and sin ! abhorred , Malignant and implacable. " 104 : 13 @# In either case there may be an indefinite degree of hyperbole . The language of love and hate , of confidence and despair , is not the language of description . In this train of the religious consciousness there is occasion for whatever eloquence man can feel , and whatever rhetorical luxuriance he can utter. @# Sidenote : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such considerations as these serve to account for the exercise and certain of the fruits of the religious imagination , and to designate the general criterion governing its propriety . But how is one to determine the boundary between the imaginative and the cognitive ? It is commonly agreed that what religion says and does is not all intended literally . But when is expression of religion only poetry and eloquence , and when is it matter of conviction ? If we revert again to the cognitive aspect of religion , it is evident that there is but one test to apply : whatever either fortifies or misleads the will is literal conviction . This test can not be applied absolutely , because it can properly be applied only to the intention of an individual experience . However I may express my religion , that which I express , is , we have seen , an expectation . The degree to which I literally mean what I say is then the degree to which it determines my expectations . Whatever adds no item to these expectations , but only recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows that it is entirely impossible from direct inspection to define any given expression of religious experience as myth , or to define the degree to which it is myth . It submits to such distinctions only when viewed from the stand-point of the concrete religious experience which it expresses . Any such given expression could easily be all imagination to one , and all conviction to another . Consider the passage which follows : @# " And I saw the heaven opened ; and behold , a white horse , and he that sat thereon , called Faithful and True ; and in righteousness he doth judge and make war . And his eyes are a flame of fire , and upon his head are many diadems ; and he hath a name written , which no one knoweth but he himself . And he is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood : and his name is called The Word of God. " 106 : 14 @# Is this all rhapsody , or is it in part true report ? There is evidently no answer to the question so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious feeling it would have some specific proportion of literal and metaphorical significance , according to the degree to which its detail contributes different practical values to me . It might then be my guide-book to the heavens , or only my testimony to the dignity and mystery of the function of Christ. @# The development of religion bears in a very important way upon this last problem . The factor of imagination has undoubtedly come to have a more clearly recognized role in religion . There can be no doubt that what we now call myths were once beliefs , and that what we now call poetry was once history . If we go back sufficiently far we come to a time when the literal and the metaphorical were scarcely distinguishable , and this because science had not emerged from the early animistic extension of social relations . Men meant to address their gods as they addressed their fellows , and expected them to hear and respond , as they looked for such reactions within the narrower circle of ordinary intercourse . The advance of science has brought into vogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result has been that men , continuing to use the same terms , essentially expressive as they are of a practical relationship , have come to regard them as only a general expression of their attitude . The differences of content that are in excess of factors of expectation remain as poetry and myth . On the other hand , it is equally possible , if not equally common , for that which was once imagined to come to be believed . Such a transformation is , perhaps , normally the case when the inspired utterance passes from its author to the cult . The prophets and sweet singers are likely to possess an exuberance of imagination not appreciated by their followers ; and for this reason almost certainly misunderstood . For these reasons it is manifestly absurd to fasten the name of myth or the name of creed upon any religious utterance whatsoever , unless it be so regarded from the stand-point of the personal religion which it originally expressed , or unless one means by so doing to define it as an expression of his own religion . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the poetical story of Samson , " as parts of the pre-Christian Judaic religion , exhibits a total loss of historical sense . The distinction between cognition and fancy does not exist among objects , but only in the intending experience ; hence , for me to attach my own distinction to any individual case of belief , viewed apart from the believer , is an utterly confusing projection of my own personality into the field of my study. @# Sidenote : The Philosophy Implied in Religion and in Religions. @# Sect. 38 . Only after such considerations as these are we qualified to attack that much-vexed question as to whether religion deals invariably with a personal god . It is often assumed in discussion of this question that " personal god , " as well as " god , " is a distinct and familiar kind of entity , like a dragon or centaur ; its existence alone being problematical . This is doubly false to the religious employment of such an object . If it be true that in religion we mean by God a practical interpretation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality of God must be a derivative of the attitude , and not of the nature of the world . Given the practical outlook upon life , there is no definable world that can not be construed under the form of God . My god is my world practically recognized in respect of its fundamental or ultimate attitude to my ideals . In the sense , then , conveyed by this term attitude my god will invariably possess the characters of personality . But the degree to which these characters will coincide with the characters which I assign to human persons , or the terms of any logical conception of personality , can not be absolutely defined . Anthropomorphisms may be imagination or they may be literal conviction . This will depend , as above maintained , upon the degree to which they determine my expectations . Suppose the world to be theoretically conceived as governed by laws that are indifferent to all human interests . The practical expression of this conception appears in the naturalism of Lucretius , or Diogenes , or Omar Khayyam . Living in the vivid presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as leading their own lives in some remote realm which is inaccessible to my petitions , or as regarding me with sinister and contemptuous cruelty . In the latter case I may shrink and cower , or return them contempt for contempt . I mean this literally only if I look for consequences following directly from the emotional coloring which I have bestowed upon them . It may well be that I mean merely to regard myself sub specie eternitatis , in which case I am personifying in the sense of free imagination . In the religion of enlightenment the divine attitude tends to belong to the poetry and eloquence of religion rather than to its cognitive intent . This is true even of optimistic and idealistic religion . The love and providence of God are less commonly supposed to warrant an expectation of special and arbitrary favors , and have come more and more to mean the play of my own feeling about the general central conviction of the favorableness of the cosmos to my deeper or moral concerns . But the factor of personality can not possibly be entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between man and the universe . Such an interpretation of life is not a case of the pathetic fallacy , unless it incorrectly reckons with the inner feeling which it attributes to the universe . It is an obvious practical truth that the total or residual environment is significant for life . Grant this and you make rational a recognition of that significance , or a more or less constant sense of coincidence or conflict with cosmical forces . Permit this consciousness to stand , and you make some expression of it inevitable . Such an expression may , furthermore , with perfect propriety and in fulfilment of human nature , set forth and transfigure this central belief until it may enter into the context of immediacy. @# Thus any conception of the universe whatsoever may afford a basis for religion . But there is no religion that does not virtually make a more definite claim upon the nature of things , and this entirely independently of its theology , or explicit attempt to define itself . Every religion , even in the very living of it , is naturalistic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealistic , or pessimistic . And there is in the realm of truth that which justifies or refutes these definite practical ways of construing the universe . But no historical religion is ever so vague even as this in its philosophical implications . Indeed , we shall always be brought eventually to the inner meaning of some individual religious experience , where no general criticism can be certainly valid. @# There is , then , a place in religion for that which is not directly answerable to philosophical or scientific standards . But there is always , on the other hand , an element of hope which conceives the nature of the world , and means to be grounded in reality . In respect of that element , philosophy is indispensable to religion . The meaning of religion is , in fact , the central problem of philosophy . There is a virtue in religion like that which Emerson ascribes to poetry . " The poet is in the right attitude ; he is believing ; the philosopher , after some struggle , having only reasons for believing . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , philosophy is the justification of religion , and the criticism of religions . To it must be assigned the task of so refining positive religion as to contribute to the perpetual establishment of true religion . And to philosophy , with religion , belongs the task of holding fast to the idea of the universe . There is no religion except before you begin , or after you have rested from , your philosophical speculation . But in the universe these interests have a common object . As philosophy is the articulation and vindication of religion , so is religion the realization of philosophy . In philosophy thought is brought up to the elevation of life , and in religion philosophy , as the sum of wisdom , enters into life. @# FOOTNOTES : @# 83 : 1 As Plato interprets the scepticism of Protagoras to mean that one state of mind can not be more true than another , but only better or worse .

Misconceptions and Antagonisms. @# Sect. 39 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special human interest , but with a theoretical discipline . We are confronted , therefore , with a new question : that of the relation within the body of human knowledge of two of its constituent members . Owing to the militant temper of the representatives of both science and philosophy , this has long since ceased to be an academic question , and has frequently been met in the spirit of rivalry and partisanship . But the true order of knowledge is only temporarily distorted by the brilliant success of a special type of investigation ; and the conquests of science are now so old a story that critical thought shows a disposition to judge of the issue with sobriety and logical highmindedness. @# In the seventeenth century a newly emancipated and too sanguine reason proposed to know the whole of nature at once in terms of mathematics and mechanics . Thus the system of the Englishman Hobbes was science swelled to world-proportions , simple , compact , conclusive , and all-comprehensive . Philosophy proposed to do the work of science , but in its own grand manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in repeated discomfiture at the hands of Seth Ward , Wallis , Boyle , and other scientific experts of the new Royal Society , certified conclusively to the failure of this enterprise , and the experimental specialist thereupon took exclusive possession of the field of natural law . But the idealist , on the other hand , reconstructed nature to meet the demands of philosophical knowledge and religious faith . There issued , together with little mutual understanding and less sympathy , on the one hand positivism , or exclusive experimentalism , and on the other hand a rabid and unsympathetic transcendentalism . Hume , who consigned to the flames all thought save " abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number , " and " experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence " ; Comte , who assigned metaphysics to an immature stage in the development of human intelligence ; and Tyndall , who reduced the religious consciousness to an emotional experience of mystery , are typical of the one attitude . The other is well exhibited in Schelling ' s reference to " the blind and thoughtless mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of philosophy by Bacon , and of physics by Boyle . " Dogmatic experimentalism and dogmatic idealism signify more or less consistently the abstract isolation of the scientific and philosophical motives. @# There is already a touch of quaintness in both of these attitudes . We of the present are in the habit of acknowledging the autonomy of science , and the unimpeachable validity of the results of experimental research in so far as they are sanctioned by the consensus of experts . But at the same time we recognize the definiteness of the task of science , and the validity of such reservations as may be made from a higher critical point of view . Science is to be transcended in so far as it is understood as a whole . Philosophy is critically empirical ; empirical , because it regards all bona fide descriptions of experience as knowledge ; critical , because attentive to the conditions of both general and special knowledge . And in terms of a critical empiricism so defined , it is one of the problems of philosophy to define and appraise the generating problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural laws in the whole system of knowledge. @# Sidenote : The Spheres of Philosophy and Science. @# Sect. 40 . If this be the true function of philosophy with reference to science , several current notions of the relations of the spheres of these disciplines may be disproved . In the first place , philosophy will not be all the sciences regarded as one science . Science tends to unify without any higher criticism . The various sciences already regard the one nature as their common object , and the one system of interdependent laws as their common achievement . The philosopher who tries to be all science at once fails ignominiously because he tries to replace the work of a specialist with the work of a dilettante ; and if philosophy be identical with that body of truth accumulated and organized by the cooperative activity of scientific men , then philosophy is a name and there is no occasion for the existence of the philosopher as such . Secondly , philosophy will not be the assembling of the sciences ; for such would be a merely clerical work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than as a book-keeper . Nor , thirdly , is philosophy an auxiliary discipline that may be called upon in emergencies for the solution of some baffling problem of science . A problem defined by science must be solved in the scientific manner . Science will accept no aid from the gods when engaged in her own campaign , but will fight it out according to her own principles of warfare . And as long as science moves in her own plane , she can acknowledge no permanent barriers . There is then no need of any superscientific research that shall replace , or piece together , or extend the work of science . But the savant is not on this account in possession of the entire field of knowledge . It is true that he is not infrequently moved to such a conviction when he takes us about to view his estates . Together we ascend up into heaven , or make our beds in sheol , or take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea  --  and look in vain for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by natural science . Persuade him , however , to define his estates , and he has circumscribed them . In his definition he must employ conceptions more fundamental than the working conceptions that he employs within his field of study . Indeed , in viewing his task as definite and specific he has undertaken the solution of the problem of philosophy . The logical self-consciousness has been awakened , and there is no honorable way of putting it to sleep again . This is precisely what takes place in any account of the generating problem of science . To define science is to define at least one realm that is other than science , the realm of active intellectual endeavor with its own proper categories . One can not reflect upon science and assign it an end , and a method proper to that end , without bringing into the field of knowledge a broader field of experience than the field proper to science , broader at any rate by the presence in it of the scientific activity itself. @# Here , then , is the field proper to philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determinate enterprise . The philosopher comes into being as one who is interested in observing what it is that the scientist is so intently doing . In taking this interest he has accepted as a field for investigation that which he would designate as the totality of interests or the inclusive experience . He can carry out his intention of defining the scientific attitude only by standing outside it , and determining it by means of nothing less than an exhaustive searching out of all attitudes . Philosophy is , to be sure , itself a definite activity and an attitude , but an attitude required by definition to be conscious of itself , and , if you please , conscious of its own consciousness , until its attitude shall have embraced in its object the very principle of attitudes . Philosophy defines itself and all other human tasks and interests . None have furnished a clearer justification of philosophy than those men of scientific predilections who have claimed the title of agnostics . A good instance is furnished by a contemporary physicist , who has chosen to call his reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a complete view of the world ; it simply claims that it is working toward such a complete view in the future . The highest philosophy of the scientific investigator is precisely this toleration of an incomplete conception of the world and the preference for it , rather than an apparently perfect , but inadequate conception. " 120 : 1 @# It is apparent that if one were to challenge such a statement , the issue raised would at once be philosophical and not scientific . The problem here stated and answered , requires for its solution the widest inclusiveness of view , and a peculiar interest in critical reflection and logical coordination. @# Sidenote : The Procedure of a Philosophy of Science. @# Sect. 41 . One may be prepared for a knowledge of the economic and social significance of the railway even if one does not know a throttle from a piston-rod , provided one has broad and well-balanced knowledge of the interplay of human social interests . One ' s proficiency here requires one to stand off from society , and to obtain a perspective that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the philosopher of science requires a similar quality of perspective . All knowledges , together with the knowing of them , must be his object yonder , standing apart in its wholeness and symmetry . Philosophy is the least dogmatic , the most empirical , of all disciplines , since it is the only investigation that can permit itself to be forgetful of nothing. @# But the most comprehensive view may be the most distorted and false . The true order of knowledge is the difficult task of logical analysis , requiring as its chief essential some determination of the scope of the working conceptions of the different independent branches of knowledge . In the case of natural science this would mean an examination of the method and results characteristic of this field , for the sake of defining the kind of truth which attaches to the laws which are being gradually formulated . But one must immediately reach either the one or the other of two very general conclusions . If the laws of natural science cover all possible knowledge of reality , then there is left to philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and natural science will then constitute the sum of knowledge . If , on the other hand , it be found that the aim of natural science is such as to exclude certain aspects of reality , then philosophy will not be restricted to logical criticism , but will have a cognitive field of its own . The great majority of philosophers have assumed the latter of these alternatives to be true , while most aggressive scientists have intended the former in their somewhat blind attacks upon " metaphysics . " Although the selection of either of these alternatives involves us in the defence of a specific answer to a philosophical question , the issue is inevitable in any introduction to philosophy because of its bearing upon the extent of the field of that study . Furthermore there can be no better exposition of the meaning of philosophy of science than an illustration of its exercise . The following , then , is to be regarded as on the one hand a tentative refutation of positivism , or the claim of natural science to be coextensive with knowable reality ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy with reference to natural science. @# Sidenote : The Origin of the Scientific Interest. @# Sect. 42 . Science issues through imperceptible stages from organic habits and instincts which signify the possession by living creatures of a power to meet the environment on its own terms . Every organism possesses such a working knowledge of nature , and among men the first science consists in those habitual adjustments common to men and infra-human organisms . Man is already practising science before he recognizes it . As skill it distinguishes itself early in his history from lore , or untested tradition . Skill is familiarity with general kinds of events , together with ability to identify an individual with reference to a kind , and so be prepared for the outcome . Thus man is inwardly prepared for the alternation of day and night , and the periods of the seasons . He practically anticipates the procession of natural events in the countless emergencies of his daily life . But science in the stricter sense begins when skill becomes free and social. @# Sidenote : Skill as Free. @# Sect. 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential terms of the action have been abstracted from the circumstances attending them in individual experiences , and are retained as ideal plans applicable to any practical occasion . The monkey who swings with a trapeze from his perch on the side of the cage , counts upon swinging back again without any further effort on his own part . His act and its successful issue signify his practical familiarity with the natural motions of bodies . We can conceive such a performance to be accompanied by an almost entire failure to grasp its essentials . It would then be necessary for nearly the whole situation to be repeated in order to induce in the monkey the same action and expectation . He would require a similar form , color , and distance . But he might , on the other hand , regard as practically identical all suspended and freely swinging bodies capable of affording him support , and quite independently of their shape , size , time , or place . In this latter case his skill would be applicable to the widest possible number of cases that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would lose no chance of a swing through looking for more than the bare necessities . When the physicist describes the pendulum in terms of a formula such as t = 2pisquareroot(l/g) he exhibits a similar discernment . He has found that the time occupied by an oscillation of any pendulum may be calculated exclusively in terms of its length and the acceleration due to gravity . The monkey ' s higher proficiency and the formula alike represent a knowledge that is free in the sense that it is contained in terms that require no single fixed context in immediacy . The knowledge is valid wherever these essential terms are present ; and calculations may be based upon these essential terms , while attendant circumstances vary ad infinitum . Such knowledge is said to be general or universal. @# There is another element of freedom , however , which so far has not been attributed to the monkey ' s knowledge , but which is evidently present in that of the physicist . The former has a practical ability to deal with a pendulum when he sees it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pendulum whether one be present or not . His knowledge is so retained as always to be available , even though it be not always applicable . His knowledge is not merely skill in treating a situation , but the possession of resources which he may employ at whatever time , and in whatever manner , may suit his interests . Knowing what he does about the pendulum , he may act from the idea of such a contrivance , and with the aid of it construct some more complex mechanism . His formulas are his instruments , which he may use on any occasion . Suppose that a situation with factors a , b , and c requires factor d in order to become M , as desired . Such a situation might easily be hopeless for an organism reacting directly to the stimulus abc , and yet be easily met by a free knowledge of d . One who knows that l , m , and n will produce d , may by these means provide the missing factor , complete the sum of required conditions , abcd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to obtain any required factor of the end , or of any near or remote means to the end . There is , in fact , no limit to the complexity of action made possible upon this basis ; for since it is available in idea , the whole range of such knowledge may be brought to bear upon any individual problem. @# Sidenote : Skill as Social. @# Sect. 44 . But knowledge of this free type becomes at the same time social or institutional . It consists no longer in a skilful adaptation of the individual organism , but in a system of terms common to all intelligence , and preserved in those books and other monuments which serve as the articulate memory of the race . A knowledge that is social must be composed of unequivocal conceptions and fixed symbols . The mathematical laws of the exact sciences represent the most successful attainment of this end so far as form is concerned . Furthermore , the amount of knowledge may now be increased from generation to generation through the service of those who make a vocation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proficiency , which any individual may bring to bear upon any emergency of his life. @# Sidenote : Science for Accommodation and Construction. @# Sect. 45 . Such proficiency as science affords is in every case the anticipation of experience . This has a twofold value for mankind , that of accommodation , and that of construction . Primitively , where mere survival is the function of the organism as a whole , the value of accommodation is relatively fundamental . The knowledge of what may be expected enables the organism to save itself by means of its own counter-arrangement of natural processes . Construction is here for the sake of accommodation . But with the growth of civilization construction becomes a positive interest , and man tends to save himself for definite ends . Accommodation comes to take place for the sake of construction . Science then supplies the individual with the ways and means wherewith to execute life purposes which themselves tend to assume an absolute value that can not be justified merely on the ground of science. @# Sidenote : Method and Fundamental Conceptions of Natural Science . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be animated by any special cognitive interest , this motive should appear in the development of its method and fundamental conceptions . If that interest has been truly defined , it should now enable us to understand the progressive and permanent in scientific investigation as directly related to it . For the aim of any discipline exercises a gradual selection from among possible methods , and gives to its laws their determinate and final form. @# The descriptive method is at the present day fully established . A leading moral of the history of science is the superior usefulness of an exact account of the workings of nature to an explanation in terms of some qualitative potency . Explanation has been postponed by enlightened science until after a more careful observation of actual processes shall have been made ; and at length it has been admitted that there is no need of any explanation but perfect description . Now the practical use of science defined above , requires no knowledge beyond the actual order of events . For such a purpose sufficient reason signifies only sufficient conditions . All other considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such has actually been the fate of the so-called metaphysical solution of special problems of nature . The case of Kepler is the classic instance . This great scientist supplemented his laws of planetary motion with the following speculation concerning the agencies at work : @# " We must suppose one of two things : either that the moving spirits , in proportion as they are more removed from the sun , are more feeble ; or that there is one moving spirit in the centre of all the orbits , namely , in the sun , which urges each body the more vehemently in proportion as it is nearer ; but in more distant spaces languishes in consequence of the remoteness and attenuation of its virtue. " 129 : 2 @# The following passage from Hegel affords an interesting analogy : @# " The moon is the waterless crystal which seeks to complete itself by means of our sea , to quench the thirst of its arid rigidity , and therefore produces ebb and flow. " 129 : 3 @# No scientist has ever sought to refute either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were advanced in obedience to a demand for the ultimate explanation of the phenomena in question , and were obtained by applying such general conceptions as were most satisfying to the reasons of their respective authors . But they contributed nothing whatsoever to a practical familiarity with the natural course of events , in this case the times and places of the planets and the tides . Hence they have not been used in the building of science . In our own day investigators have become conscious of their motive , and do not wait for historical selection to exclude powers and reasons from their province . They deliberately seek to formulate exact descriptions . To this end they employ symbols that shall serve to identify the terms of nature , and formulas that shall define their systematic relationship . These systems must be exact , or deductions can not be made from them . Hence they tend ultimately to assume a mathematical form of expression. @# Sidenote : Space , Time , and Prediction. @# Sect. 47 . But science tends to employ for these systems only such conceptions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are space and time . The first science to establish its method was the science of astronomy , where measurement and computation in terms of space and time were the most obvious means of description ; and the general application of the method of astronomy by Galileo and Newton , or the development of mechanics , is the most important factor in the establishment of modern science upon a permanent working basis . The persistence of the term cause , testifies to the fact that science is primarily concerned with the determination of events . Its definitions of objects are means of identification , while its laws are dynamical , i. e. , have reference to the conditions under which these objects arise . Thus the chemist may know less about the properties of water than the poet ; but he is pre-eminently skilled in its production from elements , and understands similarly the compounds into which it may enter . Now the general conditions of all anticipation , whereby it becomes exact and verifiable , are spacial and temporal . A predictable event must be assigned to what is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , or there then . An experimentally verifiable system must contain space-time variables , for which can be substituted the here and now of the experimenter ' s immediate experience . Hence science deals primarily with calculable places and moments . The mechanical theory of nature owes its success to a union of space and time through its conceptions of matter and motion. 132 : 4 And the projected theory of energetics must satisfy the same conditions. @# Sidenote : The Quantitative Method. @# Sect. 48 . But , furthermore , science has , as we have seen , an interest in freeing its descriptions from the peculiar angle and relativity of an individual ' s experience , for the sake of affording him knowledge of that with which he must meet . Science enlightens the will by acquainting it with that which takes place in spite of it , and for which it must hold itself in readiness . To this end the individual benefits himself in so far as he eliminates himself from the objects which he investigates . His knowledge is useful in so far as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of other wills recognized by him in his practical relations . But in attempting to describe objects in terms other than those of a specific experience , science is compelled to describe them in terms of one another . For this purpose the quantitative method is peculiarly serviceable . With its aid objects permit themselves to be described as multiples of one another , and as occupying positions in relation to one another . When all objects are described strictly in terms of one another , they are expressed in terms of arbitrary units , and located in terms of arbitrary spacial or temporal axes of reference . Thus there arises the universe of the scientific imagination , a vast complexity of material displacements and transformations , without color , music , pleasure , or any of all that rich variety of qualities that the least of human experiences contains . It does not completely rationalize or even completely describe such experiences , but formulates their succession . To this end they are reduced to terms that correspond to no specific experience , and for this very reason may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system for astronomy is not a bird ' s-eye view of elliptical orbits , with the planets and satellites in definite phases . Nor is it this group of objects from any such point of view , or from any number of such points of view ; but a formulation of their motions that will serve as the key to an infinite number of their appearances . Or , consider the picture of the ichthysauria romping in the mesozoic sea , that commonly accompanies a text-book of geology . Any such picture , and all such pictures , with their coloring and their temporal and spacial perspective , are imaginary . No such special and exclusive manifolds can be defined as having been then and there realized . But we have a geological knowledge of this period , that fulfils the formal demands of natural science , in so far as we can construct this and countless other specific experiences with reference to it. @# Sidenote : The General Development of Science. @# Sect. 49 . Science , then , is to be understood as springing from the practical necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or acquired reactions on the part of the organism . Such reactions imply a fixed coordination or system in the environment whereby a given circumstance determines other circumstances ; and science proper arises as the formulation of such systems . The requirement that they shall apply to the phenomena that confront the will , determines their spacial , temporal , and quantitative form . The progress of science is marked by the growth of these conceptions in the direction of comprehensiveness on the one hand , and of refinement and delicacy on the other . Man lives in an environment that is growing at the same time richer and more extended , but with a compensatory simplification in the ever closer systematization of scientific conceptions under the form of the order of nature. @# Sidenote : The Determination of the Limits of Natural Science. @# Sect. 50 . At the opening of this chapter it was maintained that it is a function of philosophy to criticise science through its generating problem , or its self-imposed task viewed as determining its province and selecting its categories . The above account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its generating problem , and afford the basis of our answer to the question of its limits . Enough has been said to make it clear that philosophy is not in the field of science , and is therefore not entitled to contest its result in detail or even to take sides within the province of its special problems . Furthermore , philosophy should not aim to restrain science by the imposition of external barriers . Whatever may be said of the sufficiency of its categories in any region of the world , that body of truth of which mathematics , mechanics , and physics are the foundations , must be regarded as a whole that tends to be all-comprehensive in its own terms . There remains for philosophy , then , the critical examination of these terms , and the appraisal as a whole of the truth that they may express. @# Sidenote : Natural Science is Abstract. @# Sect. 51 . The impossibility of embracing the whole of knowledge within natural science is due to the fact that the latter is abstract . This follows from the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The formulation of definitions and laws in exclusively mechanical terms is not due to the exhaustive or even pre-eminent reality of these properties , but to their peculiar serviceableness in a verifiable description of events . Natural science does not affirm that reality is essentially constituted of matter , or essentially characterized by motion ; but is interested in the mechanical aspect of reality , and describes it quite regardless of other evident aspects and without meaning to prejudice them . It is unfortunately true that the scientist has rarely been clear in his own mind on this point . It is only recently that he has partially freed himself from the habit of construing his terms as final and exhaustive. 137 : 5 This he was able to do even to his own satisfaction , only by allowing loose rein to the imagination . Consider the example of the atomic theory . In order to describe such occurrences as chemical combination , or changes in volume and density , the scientist has employed as a unit the least particle , physically indivisible and qualitatively homogeneous . Look for the atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in physical laws governing expansion and contraction , and in chemical formulas . There the real responsibility of science ends . But whether through the need of popular exposition , or the undisciplined imagination of the investigator himself , atoms have figured in the history of thought as round corpuscles of a grayish hue scurrying hither and thither , and armed with special appliances wherewith to lock in molecular embrace . Although this is nonsense , we need not on that account conclude that there are no atoms . There are atoms in precisely the sense intended by scientific law , in that the formulas computed with the aid of this concept are true of certain natural processes . The conception of ether furnishes a similar case . Science is not responsible for the notion of a quivering gelatinous substance pervading space , but only for certain laws that , e. g. , describe the velocity of light in terms of the vibration . It is true that there is such a thing as ether , not as gratuitously rounded out by the imagination , with various attributes of immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is employed in verified descriptions of radiation , magnetism , or electricity . Strictly speaking science asserts nothing about the existence of ether , but only about the behavior , e. g. , of light . If true descriptions of this and other phenomena are reached by employing units of wave propagation in an elastic medium , then ether is proved to exist in precisely the same sense that linear feet are proved to exist , if it be admitted that there are 90 , 000 , 000 x 5 , 280 of them between the earth and the sun . And to imagine in the one case a jelly with all the qualities of texture , color , and the like , that an individual object of sense would possess , is much the same as in the other to imagine the heavens filled with foot-rules and tape-measures . There is but one safe procedure in dealing with scientific concepts : to regard them as true so far as they describe , and no whit further . To supplement the strict meaning which has been verified and is contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will suffice to make entities of them , is mere ineptness and confusion of thought . And it is only such a supplementation that obscures their abstractness . For a mechanical description of things , true as it doubtless is , is even more indubitably incomplete. @# Sidenote : The Meaning of Abstractness in Truth. @# Sect. 52 . But though the abstractness involved in scientific description is open and deliberate , we must come to a more precise understanding of it , if we are to draw any conclusion as to what it involves . In his " Principles of Human Knowledge , " the English philosopher Bishop Berkeley raises the question as to the universal validity of mathematical demonstrations . If we prove from the image or figure of an isosceles right triangle that the sum of its angles is equal to two right angles , how can we know that this proposition holds of all triangles ? @# " To which I answer , that , though the idea I have in view whilst I make the demonstration be , for instance , that of an isosceles rectangular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may nevertheless be certain it extends to all other rectilinear triangles , of what sort or bigness soever . And that because neither the right angle , nor the equality , nor determinate length of the sides are at all concerned in the demonstration . It is true the diagram I have in view includes all these particulars ; but then there is not the least mention made of them in the proof of the proposition. " 140 : 6 @# Of the total conditions present in the concrete picture of a triangle , one may in one ' s calculations neglect as many as one sees fit , and work with the remainder . Then , if one has clearly distinguished the conditions used , one may confidently assert that whatever has been found true of them holds regardless of the neglected conditions . These may be missing or replaced by others , provided the selected or ( for any given investigation ) essential conditions are not affected . That which is true once is true always , provided time is not one of its conditions ; that which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not one of its conditions . But , given any concrete situation , the more numerous the conditions one ignores in one ' s calculations , the less adequate are one ' s calculations to that situation . The number of its inhabitants , and any mathematical operation made with that number , is true , but only very abstractly true of a nation . A similar though less radical abstractness appertains to natural science . Simple qualities of sound or color , and distinctions of beauty or moral worth , together with many other ingredients of actual experience attributed therein to the objects of nature , are ignored in the mechanical scheme . There is a substitution of certain mechanical arrangements in the case of the first group of properties , the simple qualities of sense , so that they may be assimilated to the general scheme of events , and their occurrence predicted . But their intrinsic qualitative character is not reckoned with , even in psychology , where the physiological method finally replaces them with brain states . Over and above these neglected properties of things there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preposterous to deny them and to describe them in mechanical terms . It is plain , then , that natural science calculates upon the basis of only a fraction of the conditions that present themselves in actual experience . Its conclusions , therefore , though true so far as they go , and they may be abstractly true of everything , are completely true of nothing. @# Sidenote : But Scientific Truth is Valid for Reality. @# Sect. 53 . Such , in brief , is the general charge of inadequacy which may be urged against natural science , not in the spirit of detraction , but for the sake of a more sound belief concerning reality . The philosopher falls into error no less radical than that of the dogmatic scientist , when he charges the scientist with untruth , and attaches to his concepts the predicate of unreality . The fact that the concepts of science are selected , and only inadequately true of reality , should not be taken to mean that they are sportive or arbitrary . They are not " devices " or abbreviations , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all thought involves . Nor are they merely " hypothetical , " though like all thought they are subject to correction. 142 : 7 The scientist does not merely assert that the equation for energy is true if nature ' s capacity for work be measurable , but that such is actually the case . The statistician does not arrive at results contingent upon the supposition that men are numerable , but declares his sums and averages to be categorically true . Similarly scientific laws are true ; only , to be sure , so far as they go , but with no condition save the condition that attaches to all knowledge , viz. , that it shall not need correction . The philosophy of science , therefore , is not the adversary of science , but supervenes upon science in the interests of the ideal of final truth . No philosophy of science is sound which does not primarily seek by an analysis of scientific concepts to understand science on its own grounds . Philosophy may understand science better than science understands itself , but only by holding fast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever account of reality it may be able to formulate. @# Sidenote : Relative Practical Value of Science and Philosophy. @# Sect. 54 . Though philosophy be the most ancient and most exalted of human disciplines , it is not infrequently charged with being the most unprofitable . Science has amassed a fortune of information , which has facilitated life and advanced civilization . Is not philosophy , on the other hand , all programme and idle questioning ? In the first place , no questioning is idle that is logically possible . It is true that philosophy shows her skill rather in the asking than in the answering of questions . But the formal pertinence of a question is of the greatest significance . No valid though unanswered question can have a purely negative value , and especially as respects the consistency or completeness of truth . But , in the second place , philosophy with all its limitations serves mankind as indispensably as science . If science supplies the individual with means of self-preservation , and the instruments of achievement , philosophy supplies the ideals , or the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fundamental life purpose is always philosophical . For every judgment respecting final worth is a judgment sub specie eternitatis . And the urgency of life requires the individual to pass such judgments . It is true that however persistently reflective he may be in the matter , his conclusion will be premature in consideration of the amount of evidence logically demanded for such a judgment . But he must be as wise as he can , or he will be as foolish as conventionality and blind impulse may impel him to be . Philosophy determines for society what every individual must practically determine upon for himself , the most reasonable plan of reality as a whole which the data and reflection of an epoch can afford . It is philosophy ' s service to mankind to compensate for the enthusiasm and concentration of the specialist , a service needed in every " present day . " Apart from the philosopher , public opinion is the victim of sensationalism , and individual opinion is further warped by accidental propinquity . It is the function of philosophy to interpret knowledge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosopher is the true prophet , appearing before men in behalf of that which is finally the truth . He is the spokesman of the most considerate and comprehensive reflection possible at any stage in the development of human thought . Owing to a radical misconception of function , the man of science has in these later days begun to regard himself as the wise man , and to teach the people . Popular materialism is the logical outcome of this determination of belief by natural science . It may be that this is due as much to the indifference of the philosopher as to the forwardness of the scientist , but in any case the result is worse than conservative loyalty to religious tradition . For religion is corrected surely though slowly by the whole order of advancing truth . Its very inflexibility makes it proof against an over-emphasis upon new truth . It has generally turned out in time that the obstinate man of religion was more nearly right than the adaptable intellectual man of fashion . But philosophy , as a critique of science for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightenment and gentleness . The quality , orderliness , and inclusiveness of knowledge , finally determine its value ; and the philosopher , premature as his synthesis may some day prove to be , is the wisest man of his own generation . From him the man of faith should obtain such discipline of judgment as shall enable him to be fearless of advancing knowledge , because acquainted with its scope , and so intellectually candid with all his visions and his inspirations. @# FOOTNOTES : @# 120 : 1 Ernst Mach : Science of Mechanics .

The stand-point and purpose of the philosopher define his task , but they do not necessarily prearrange the division of it . That the task is a complex one , embracing many subordinate problems which must be treated seriatim , is attested both by the breadth of its scope and the variety of the interests from which it may be approached . But this complexity is qualified by the peculiar importance which here attaches to unity . That which lends philosophical quality to any reflection is a steadfast adherence to the ideals of inclusiveness and consistency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with subordinate problems , these can not be completely isolated from one another , and solved successively . Perspective is his most indispensable requisite , and he has solved no problem finally until he has provided for the solution of all . His own peculiar conceptions are those which order experience , and reconcile such aspects of it as other interests have distinguished . Hence the compatibility of any idea with all other ideas is the prime test of its philosophical sufficiency . On these grounds it may confidently be asserted that the work of philosophy can not be assigned by the piece to different specialists , and then assembled . There are no special philosophical problems which can be finally solved upon their own merits . Indeed , such problems could never even be named , for in their discreteness they would cease to be philosophical. @# The case of metaphysics and epistemology affords an excellent illustration . The former of these is commonly defined as the theory of reality or of first principles , the latter as the theory of knowledge . But the most distinctive philosophical movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being are identical. 150 : 1 The prime reality is defined as a knowing mind , and the terms of reality are interpreted as terms of a cognitive process . Ideas and logical principles constitute the world . It is evident that in this Hegelian philosophy epistemology embraces metaphysics . In defining the relations of knowledge to its object , one has already defined one ' s fundamental philosophical conception , while logic , as the science of the universal necessities of thought , will embrace the first principles of reality . Now , were one to divide and arrange the problems of philosophy upon this basis , it is evident that one would not have deduced the arrangement from the general problem of philosophy , but from a single attempted solution of that problem . It might serve as an exposition of Hegel , but not as a general philosophical programme. @# Another case in point is provided by the present-day interest in what is called " pragmatism. " 151 : 2 This doctrine is historically connected with Kant ' s principle of the " primacy of the practical reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty is a profounder though less scientific insight than the knowledge of objects . The current doctrine maintains that thought with its fruits is an expression of interest , and that the will which evinces and realizes such an interest is more original and significant than that which the thinking defines . Such a view attaches a peculiar importance to the springs of conduct , and in its more systematic development152 : 3 has regarded ethics as the true propaedeutic and proof of philosophy . But to make ethics the key-stone of the arch , is to define a special philosophical system ; for it is the very problem of philosophy to dispose the parts of knowledge with a view to systematic construction . The relation of the provinces of metaphysics , epistemology , logic , and ethics can not , then , be defined without entering these provinces and answering the questions proper to them. @# Sidenote : The Dependence of the Order of Philosophical Problems upon the Initial Interest. @# Sect. 56 . Since the above terms exist , however , there can be no doubt but that important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . The inevitableness of it appears in the variety of the sources from which that aim may spring . The point of departure will always determine the emphasis and the application which the philosophy receives . If philosophy be needed to supplement more special interests , it will receive a particular character from whatever interest it so supplements . He who approaches it from a definite stand-point will find in it primarily an interpretation of that stand-point. @# Sidenote : Philosophy as the Interpretation of Life. @# Sect. 57 . There are two sources of the philosophical aim , which are perennial in their human significance . He , firstly , who begins with the demands of life and its ideals , looks to philosophy for a reconciliation of these with the orderly procedure of nature . His philosophy will receive its form from its illumination of life , and it will be an ethical or religious philosophy . Spinoza , the great seventeenth-century philosopher who justified mysticism after the manner of mathematics , 153 : 4 displays this temper in his philosophy : @# " After experience had taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain and futile ; seeing that none of the objects of my fears contained in themselves anything either good or bad , except in so far as the mind is affected by them , I finally resolved to inquire whether there might be some real good having power to communicate itself , which would affect the mind singly , to the exclusion of all else : whether , in fact , there might be anything of which the discovery and attainment would enable me to enjoy continuous , supreme , and unending happiness. " 153 : 5 @# In pursuance of this aim , though he deals with the problem of being in the rigorous logical fashion of his day , the final words of his great work are , " Of Human Freedom " : @# " Whereas the wise man , in so far as he is regarded as such , is scarcely at all disturbed in spirit , but , being conscious of himself , and of God , and of things , by a certain eternal necessity , never ceases to be , but always possesses true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pointed out as leading to this result seems exceedingly hard , it may nevertheless be discovered . Needs must it be hard , since it is so seldom found . How would it be possible if salvation were ready to our hand , and could without great labor be found , that it should be by almost all men neglected ? But all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare. " 154 : 6 @# Sidenote : Philosophy as the Extension of Science. @# Sect. 58 . On the other hand , one who looks to philosophy for the extension and correction of scientific knowledge will be primarily interested in the philosophical definition of ultimate conceptions , and in the method wherewith such a definition is obtained . Thus the philosophy of the scientist will tend to be logical and metaphysical . Such is the case with Descartes and Leibniz , who are nevertheless intimately related to Spinoza in the historical development of philosophy. @# " Several years have now elapsed , " says the former , " since I first became aware that I had accepted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that consequently what I afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful ; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted , and of commencing anew the work of building from the foundation , if I desired to establish a firm and abiding superstructure in the sciences. " 155 : 7 @# Leibniz ' s mind was more predominantly logical even than Descartes ' s . He sought in philosophy a supreme intellectual synthesis , a science of the universe. @# " Although , " he says retrospectively , " I am one of those who have worked much at mathematics , I have none the less meditated upon philosophy from my youth up ; for it always seemed to me that there was a possibility of establishing something solid in philosophy by clear demonstrations . . . . I perceived , after much meditation , that it is impossible to find the principles of a real unity in matter alone , or in that which is only passive , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad infinitum. " 155 : 8 @# Sidenote : The Historical Differentiation of the Philosophical Problem. @# Sect. 59 . Though these types are peculiarly representative , they are by no means exhaustive . There are as many possibilities of emphasis as there are incentives to philosophical reflection . It is not possible to exhaust the aspects of experience which may serve as bases from which such thought may issue , and to which , after its synthetic insight , it may return . But it is evident that such divisions of philosophy represent in their order , and in the sharpness with which they are sundered , the intellectual autobiography of the individual philosopher . There is but one method by which that which is peculiar either to the individual , or to the special position which he adopts , may be eliminated . Though it is impossible to tabulate the empty programme of philosophy , we may name certain special problems that have appeared in its history . Since this history comprehends the activities of many individuals , a general validity attaches to it . There has been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , so that it may fairly be claimed for them that they indicate inevitable phases in the development of human reflection upon experience . They represent a normal differentiation of interest which the individual mind , in the course of its own thinking , tends to follow . It is true that it can never be said with assurance that any age is utterly blind to any aspect of experience . This is obviously the case with the practical and theoretical interests which have just been distinguished . There is no age that does not have some practical consciousness of the world as a whole , nor any which does not seek more or less earnestly to universalize its science . But though it compel us to deal abstractly with historical epochs , there is abundant compensation in the possibility which this method affords of finding the divisions of philosophy in the manifestation of the living philosophical spirit. @# Sidenote : Metaphysics Seeks a Most Fundamental Conception. @# Sect. 60 . To Thales , one of the Seven Wise Men of Greece , is commonly awarded the honor of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction , it is on account of the question which he raised , and not on account of the answer which he gave to it . Aristotle informs us that Thales held " water " to be " the material cause of all things. " 157 : 9 This crude theory is evidently due to an interest in the totality of things , an interest which is therefore philosophical . But the interest of this first philosopher has a more definite character . It looks toward the definition in terms of some single conception , of the constitution of the world . As a child might conceivably think the moon to be made of green cheese , so philosophy in its childhood thinks here of all things as made of water . Water was a well-known substance , possessing well-known predicates . To define all nature in terms of it , was to maintain that in spite of superficial differences , all things have these predicates in common . They are the predicates which qualify for reality , and compose a community of nature from which all the individual objects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently dissatisfied with his fundamental conception , because of its lack of generality . They seized upon vaguer substances like air and fire , for the very definiteness of the nature of water forbids the identification of other substances with it . But what is so obviously true of water is scarcely less true of air and fire ; and it appeared at length that only a substance possessing the most general characters of body , such as shape , size , and mobility , could be thought as truly primeval and universal . In this wise a conception like our modern physical conception of matter came at length into vogue . Now the problem of which these were all tentative solutions is , in general , the problem of metaphysics ; although this term belongs to a later era , arising only from the accidental place of the discussion of first principles after physics in the system of Aristotle . The attempt to secure a most fundamental conception which attaches some definite meaning to the reality including and informing every particular thing , is metaphysics. @# Sidenote : Monism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that metaphysics is dogmatically committed to the reduction of all reality to a unity of nature . It is quite consistent with its purpose that the parts of reality should be found to compose a group , or an indefinite multitude of irreducibly different entities . But it is clear that even such an account of things deals with what is true of all reality , and even in acknowledging the variety of its constituents , attributes to them some kind of relationship . The degree to which such a relationship is regarded as intimate and essential , determines the degree to which any metaphysical system is monistic , 159 : 10 rather than pluralistic . But the significance of this difference will be better appreciated after a further differentiation of the metaphysical problem has been noted. @# Sidenote : Ontology and Cosmology Concern Being and Process. @# Sect. 62 . It has already been suggested that the test of Thales ' s conception lay in the possibility of deriving nature from it . A world principle must be fruitful . Now an abstract distinction has prevailed more or less persistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called ontology , and the study of the processes wherewith being is divided into things and events . This latter study has to do primarily with the details of experience enumerated and systematized by the natural sciences . To reconcile these , or the course of nature , with the fundamental definition of being , is the problem of cosmology . Cosmology is the construing of the prima facie reality in terms of the essential reality . It is the proof and the explanation of ontology . Since the most familiar part of the prima facie reality , the part almost exclusively noticed by the naive mind , is embraced within the field of the physical sciences , the term cosmology has come more definitely to signify the philosophy of nature . It embraces such an examination of space , time , matter , causality , etc. , as seeks to answer the most general questions about them , and provide for them in the world thought of as most profoundly real . Such a study receives its philosophical character from its affiliation with ontology , as the latter would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosmologies. @# Sect. 63 . But in addition to the consideration of the various parts of nature , cosmology has commonly dealt with a radical and far-reaching alternative that appeared at the very dawn of metaphysics . Differences may arise within a world constituted of a single substance or a small group of ultimate substances , by changes in the relative position and grouping of the parts . Hence the virtue of the conception of motion . The theory which explains all differences by motions of the parts of a qualitatively simple world , is called mechanism . Another source of change familiar to naive experience is will , or the action of living creatures . According to the mechanical theory , changes occur on account of the natural motions of the parts of matter ; according to the latter or teleological conception , changes are made by a formative agency directed to some end . Among the early Greek philosophers , Leucippus was an exponent of mechanism. @# " He says that the worlds arise when many bodies are collected together into the mighty void from the surrounding space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are of similar shape and like form become entangled , and from their entanglement the heavenly bodies arise. " 161 : 11 @# Anaxagoras , on the other hand , was famed for his doctrine of the Nous , or Intelligence , to whose direction he attributed the whole process of the world . The following is translated from extant fragments of his book , " +peri physeo : s+ " : @# " And Nous had power over the whole revolution , so that it began to revolve in the beginning . And it began to revolve first from a small beginning ; but the revolution now extends over a larger space , and will extend over a larger still . And all the things that are mingled together and separated off and distinguished are all known by the Nous . And Nous set in order all things that were to be and that were , and all things that are not now and that are , and this revolution in which now revolve the stars and the sun and the moon , and the air and the ether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Dualism. @# Sect. 64 . It is clear , furthermore , that the doctrine of Anaxagoras not only names a distinct kind of cause , but also ascribes to it an independence and intrinsic importance that do not belong to motion . Whereas motion is a property of matter , intelligence is an originative power working out purposes of its own choosing . Hence we have here to do with a new ontology . If we construe ultimate being in terms of mind , we have a definite substitute for the physical theories outlined above . Such a theory is scarcely to be attributed to any Greek philosopher of the early period ; it belongs to a more sophisticated stage in the development of thought , after the rise of the problem of epistemology . But Anaxagoras ' s sharp distinction between the material of the world on the one hand , and the author of its order and evolution on the other , is in itself worthy of notice . It contains the germ of a recurrent philosophical dualism , which differs from pluralism in that it finds two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , material , or potential on the one hand , and the mental , formal , or ideal on the other. @# Sidenote : The New Meaning of Monism and Pluralism. @# Sect. 65 . Finally , the alternative possibilities which these cosmological considerations introduce , bear directly upon the general question of the interdependence of the parts of the world , a question which has already appeared as pertinent in ontology . Monism and pluralism now obtain a new meaning . Where the world process is informed with some singleness of plan , as teleology proposes , the parts are reciprocally necessary , and inseparable from the unity . Where , on the other hand , the processes are random and reciprocally fortuitous , as Leucippus proposes , the world as a whole is an aggregate rather than a unity . In this way uniformity in kind of being may prevail in a world the relations of whose parts are due to chance , while diversity in kind of being may prevail in a world knit together by some thorough-going plan of organization . Thus monism and pluralism are conceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been said to demonstrate the interdependence of ontology and cosmology , of the theory of being and the theory of differentiation and process . Such problems can be only abstractly sundered , and the distinctive character of any metaphysical system will usually consist in some theory determining their relation . Philosophy returns to these metaphysical problems with its thought enriched and its method complicated , after becoming thoroughly alive to the problems of epistemology , logic , and ethics. @# Sidenote : Epistemology Seeks to Understand the Possibility of Knowledge. @# Sect. 66 . Epistemology is the theory of the possibility of knowledge , and issues from criticism and scepticism . If we revert again to the history of Greek philosophy , we find a first period of enterprising speculation giving place to a second period of hesitancy and doubt . This phase of thought occurs simultaneously with the brilliantly humanistic age of Pericles , and it is undoubtedly true that energy is withdrawn from speculation largely for the sake of expending it in the more lively and engaging pursuits of politics and art . But there are patent reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking of stock . For three centuries men have taken their philosophical powers for granted , and used them without questioning them . Repeated attacks upon the problem of reality have resulted in no consensus of opinion , but only in a disagreement among the wise men themselves . A great variety of mere theories has been substituted for the old unanimity of religious tradition and practical life . It is natural under these circumstances to infer that in philosophy man has overreached himself . He would more profitably busy himself with affairs that belong to his own sphere , and find a basis for life in his immediate relations with his fellows . The sophists , learned in tradition , and skilled in disputation , but for the most part entirely lacking in originality , are the new prophets . As teachers of rhetoric and morals , they represent the practical and secular spirit of their age ; while in their avoidance of speculation , and their critical justification of that course , they express its sceptical philosophy. @# Sidenote : Scepticism , Dogmatism , and Agnosticism. @# Sect. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to a definite doctrine maintained by those of their predecessors and contemporaries who were atomists , or followers of that same Leucippus whom we have quoted . This doctrine was the result of an attempt to construe perception in terms of the motion of atoms . Outer objects were said to give off fine particles which , through the mediation of the sense organs , impinged upon the soul-atom . But it was evident even to the early exponents of this theory that according to such an account , each perceiver is relegated to a world peculiar to his own stand-point . His perception informs him concerning his own states as affected by things , rather than concerning the things themselves . Upon this ground the great sophist Protagoras is said to have based his dictum : +Panto : n chre : mato : n metron anthro : pos+ ,  --  " Man is the measure of all things . " This is the classic statement of the doctrine of relativity . But we have now entered into the province of epistemology , and various alternatives confront us . Reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual , and you arrive at scepticism , or the denial of the possibility of valid knowledge . Plato expounds this consequence in the well-known discussion of Protagoras that occurs in the " Theaetetus. " @# " I am charmed with his doctrine , that what appears is to each one , but I wonder that he did not begin his book on Truth with a declaration that a pig or a dog-faced baboon , or some other yet stranger monster which has sensation , is the measure of all things ; then he might have shown a magnificent contempt for our opinion of him by informing us at the outset that while we were reverencing him like a God for his wisdom , he was no better than a tadpole , not to speak of his fellow-men  --  would not this have produced an overpowering effect ? For if truth is only sensation , and no man can discern another ' s feelings better than he , or has any superior right to determine whether his opinion is true or false , but each , as we have several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that he judges is true and right , why , my friend , should Protagoras be preferred to the place of wisdom and instruction , and deserve to be well paid , and we poor ignoramuses have to go to him , if each one is the measure of his own wisdom ? . . . The attempt to supervise or refute the notions or opinions of others would be a tedious and enormous piece of folly , if to each man his own are right ; and this must be the case if Protagoras ' s Truth is the real truth , and the philosopher is not merely amusing himself by giving oracles out of the shrine of his book. " 167 : 13 @# This is the full swing of the pendulum from dogmatism , or the uncritical conviction of truth . A modified form of scepticism has been developed in these later days under the influence of natural science , and is called agnosticism or positivism . It accepts the Protagorean doctrine only in the sense of attributing to human knowledge as a whole an incapacity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural science , where theories can be sensibly verified , lies the unknowable realm , more real , but forever inaccessible. @# Sidenote : The Source and Criterion of Knowledge According to Empiricism and Rationalism . Mysticism. @# Sect. 68 . It is important to note that both scepticism and agnosticism agree in regarding perception as the essential factor in knowledge . So far at any rate as our knowledge is concerned , the certification of being consists in perceivability . Knowledge is coextensive with actual and possible human experience . This account of the source and criterion of knowledge is called empiricism , in distinction from the counter-theory of rationalism. @# The rationalistic motive was a quickening influence in Greek philosophy long before it became deliberate and conspicuous in Socrates and Plato . Parmenides , founder of the Eleatic School , has left behind him a poem divided into two parts : " The Way of Truth " and " The Way of Opinion. " 168 : 14 In the first of these he expounds his esoteric philosophy , which is a definition of being established by dialectical reasoning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and changeless , because otherwise it can not be thought and defined without contradiction . The method which Parmenides here employs presupposes that knowledge consists in understanding rather than perception . Indeed , he regards the fact that the world of the senses is manifold and mutable as of little consequence to the wise man . The world of sense is the province of vulgar opinion , while that of reason is the absolute truth revealed only to the philosopher . The truth has no concern with appearance , but is answerable only to the test of rationality . That world is real which one is able by thinking to make intelligible . The world is what a world must be in order to be possible at all , and the philosopher can deduce it directly from the very conditions of thought which it must satisfy . He who would know reality may disregard what seems to be , provided he can by reflective analysis discover certain general necessities to which being must conform . This is rationalism in its extreme form. @# The rationalism of Socrates was more moderate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As is well known , Socrates composed no philosophical books , but sought to inculcate wisdom in his teaching and conversation . His method of inculcating wisdom was to evoke it in his interlocutor by making him considerate of the meaning of his speech . Through his own questions he sought to arouse the questioning spirit , which should weigh the import of words , and be satisfied with nothing short of a definite and consistent judgment . In the Platonic dialogues the Socratic method obtains a place in literature . In the " Theaetetus , " which is , perhaps , the greatest of all epistemological treatises , Socrates is represented as likening his vocation to that of the midwife. @# " Well , my art of midwifery is in most respects like theirs , but differs in that I attend men , and not women , and I look after their souls when they are in labor , and not after their bodies : and the triumph of my art is in thoroughly examining whether the thought which the mind of the young man brings forth is a false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the midwives , I am barren , and the reproach which is often made against me , that I ask questions of others and have not the wit to answer them myself , is very just ; the reason is that the god compels me to be a midwife , but does not allow me to bring forth . And therefore I am not myself at all wise , nor have I anything to show which is the invention or birth of my own soul , but those who converse with me profit . . . . It is quite clear that they never learned anything from me ; the many fine discoveries to which they cling are of their own making. " 171 : 15 @# The principle underlying this method is the insistence that a proposition , to be true of reality , must at least bespeak a mind that is true to itself , internally luminous , and free from contradiction . That which is to me nothing that I can express in form that will convey precise meaning and bear analysis , is so far nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have it , ready at hand , ours for the looking , but is the fruit of critical reflection . Only reason , overcoming the relativity of perception , and the chaos of popular opinion , can lay hold on the universal truth. @# A very interesting tendency to clothe the articulations of thought with the immediacy of perception is exhibited in mysticism , which attributes the highest cognitive power to an experience that transcends thought , an ineffable insight that is the occasional reward of thought and virtuous living . This theory would seem to owe its great vigor to the fact that it promises to unite the universality of the rational object with the vivid presence of the empirical object , though it sacrifices the definite content of both . The mystic , empiricist , and rationalist are in these several ways led to revise their metaphysics upon the basis of their epistemology , or to define reality in terms dictated by the means of knowing it. @# Sidenote : The Relation of Knowledge to its Object According to Realism , and the Representative Theory. @# Sect. 69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen another issue of even greater significance in its bearing upon metaphysics . The first issue , as we have seen , has reference to the criterion of knowledge , to the possibility of arriving at certainty about reality , and the choice of means to that end . A second question arises , concerning the relation between the knowledge and its object or that which is known . This problem does not at first appear as an epistemological difficulty , but is due to the emphasis which the moral and religious interests of men give to the conception of the self . My knowing is a part of me , a function of that soul whose welfare and eternal happiness I am seeking to secure . Indeed , my knowing is , so the wise men have always taught , the greatest of my prerogatives . Wisdom appertains to the philosopher , as folly to the fool . But though my knowledge be a part of me , and in me , the same can not , lightly at any rate , be said of what I know . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is my act or state , an event in my life , and the known , which is object , and belongs to the context of the outer world . The object of knowledge would then be quite independent of the circumstance that I know it . This theory has acquired the name of realism , 173 : 16 and is evidently as close to common sense as any epistemological doctrine can be said to be . If the knowledge consists in some sign or symbol which in my mind stands for the object , but is quite other than the object , realism is given the form known as the representative theory . This theory is due to a radical distinction between the inner world of consciousness and the outer world of things , whereby in knowledge the outer object requires a substitute that is qualified to belong to the inner world . Where , on the other hand , no specific and exclusive nature is attributed to the inner world , realism may flourish without the representative theory . In such a case the object would be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences or of remaining outside them all , and without on either account forfeiting its identity . This view was taken for granted by Plato , but is elaborately defended in our own day . During the intervening period epistemology has been largely occupied with difficulties inherent in the representative theory , and from that discussion there has emerged the theory of idealism , 175 : 17 the great rival theory to that of realism. @# Sidenote : The Relation of Knowledge to its Object According to Idealism. @# Sect. 70 . The representative theory contains at least one obvious difficulty . If the thinker be confined to his ideas , and if the reality be at the same time beyond these ideas , how can he ever verify their report ? Indeed , what can it mean that an idea should be true of that which belongs to a wholly different category ? How under such circumstances can that which is a part of the idea be attributed with any certainty to the object ? Once grant that you know only your ideas , and the object reduces to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward pointing or reference of the ideas , but which is not missed if neglected . The obvious though radical theory of idealism is almost inevitably the next step . Why assume that there is any object other than the state of mind , since all positive content belongs to that realm ? The eighteenth century English philosopher , Bishop Berkeley , was accused by his contemporaries of wilful eccentricity , and even madness , for his boldness in accepting this argument and drawing this conclusion : @# " The table I write on I say exists ; that is , I see and feel it : and if I were out of my study I should say it existed ; meaning thereby that if I was in my study I might perceive it , or that some other spirit actually does perceive it . There was an odor  --  that is , it was smelt ; there was a sound  --  that is , it was heard ; a color or figure , and it was perceived by sight or touch . This is all that I can understand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said of the absolute existence of unthinking things , without any relation to their being perceived , that is to me perfectly unintelligible . Their esse is percipi ; nor is it possible that they should have any existence out of the minds or thinking thing which perceives them. " 176 : 18 @# Sidenote : Phenomenalism , Spiritualism , and Panpsychism. @# Sect. 71 . In this paragraph Berkeley maintains that it is essential to things , or at any rate to their qualities , that they be perceived . This principle when expressed as an epistemological or metaphysical generalization , is called phenomenalism . But in another phase of his thought Berkeley emphasizes the perceiver , or spirit . The theory which maintains that the only real substances are these active selves , with their powers and their states , has been called somewhat vaguely by the name of spiritualism. 176 : 19 Philosophically it shows a strong tendency to develop into either panpsychism or transcendentalism . The former is radically empirical . Its classic representative is the German pessimist Schopenhauer , who defined reality in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly felt nature of the self . This immediate revelation of the true inwardness of being serves as the key to an " intuitive interpretation " of the gradations of nature , and will finally awaken a sense of the presence of the universal Will. @# Sidenote : Transcendentalism , or Absolute Idealism. @# Sect. 72 . Transcendentalism , or absolute idealism , on the other hand , emphasizes the rational activity , rather than the bare subjectivity , of the self . The term " transcendental " has become associated with this type of idealism through Kant , whose favorite form of argument , the " transcendental deduction , " was an analysis of experience with a view to discovering the categories , or formal principles of thought , implied in its meaning . From the Kantian method arose the conception of a standard or absolute mind for the standard experience . This mind is transcendental not in the sense of being alien , but in the sense of exceeding the human mind in the direction of what this means and strives to be . It is the ideal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all the chaos of finite experience compounded and redeemed . There is no being but the absolute , the one all-inclusive spiritual life , in whom all things are inherent , and whose perfection is the virtual implication of all purposive activities. @# " God ' s life . . . sees the one plan fulfilled through all the manifold lives , the single consciousness winning its purpose by virtue of all the ideas , of all the individual selves , and of all the lives . No finite view is wholly illusory . Every finite intent taken precisely in its wholeness is fulfilled in the Absolute . The least life is not neglected , the most fleeting act is a recognized part of the world ' s meaning . You are for the divine view all that you know yourself at this instant to be . But you are also infinitely more . The preciousness of your present purposes to yourself is only a hint of that preciousness which in the end links their meaning to the entire realm of Being. " 178 : 20 @# The fruitfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers is now evident . Problems are raised which are not merely urgent in themselves , but which present wholly new alternatives to the metaphysician . Rationalism and empiricism , realism and idealism , are doctrines which , though springing from the epistemological query concerning the possibility of knowledge , may determine an entire philosophical system . They bear upon every question of metaphysics , whether the fundamental conception of being , or the problems of the world ' s unity , origin , and significance for human life. @# FOOTNOTES : @# 150 : 1 The post-Kantian movement in Germany  --  especially in so far as influenced by Hegel .

There are three sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphysics assigns to the human critical faculties . Man passes judgment upon that which claims to be true , beautiful , or good , thus referring to ideals and standards that define these values . Attempts to make these ideals explicit , and to formulate principles which regulate their attainment , have resulted in the development of the three so-called normative sciences : logic , aesthetics , and ethics . These sciences are said to owe their origin to the Socratic method , and it is indeed certain that their problem is closely related to the general rationalistic attitude. 180 : 1 In Plato ' s dialogue , " Protagoras , " one may observe the manner of the inception of both ethics and logic . The question at issue between Socrates and the master sophist Protagoras , is concerning the possibility of teaching virtue . Protagoras conducts his side of the discussion with the customary rhetorical flourish , expounding in set speeches the tradition and usage in which such a possibility is accepted . Socrates , on the other hand , conceives the issue quite differently . One can neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is meant by it . Even the possession of such a meaning was scarcely recognized by Protagoras , who was led by Socrates ' s questions to attribute to the various virtues an external grouping analogous to that of the parts of the face . But Socrates shows that since justice , temperance , courage , and the like , are admittedly similar in that they are all virtues , they must have in common some essence , which is virtue in general . This he seeks to define in the terms , virtue is knowledge . The interest which Socrates here shows in the reduction of the ordinary moral judgments to a system centering in some single fundamental principle , is the ethical interest . But this is at the same time a particular application of the general rationalistic method of definition , and of the general rationalistic postulate that one knows nothing until one can form unitary and determinate conceptions . The recognition which Socrates thus gives to criteria of knowledge is an expression of the logical interest . In a certain sense , indeed , the whole labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For he sought to demonstrate that belief is not necessarily knowledge ; that belief may or may not be true . In order that it shall be true , and constitute knowledge , it must be well-grounded , and accompanied by an understanding of its object . Socrates thus set the problem of logic , the discovery , namely , of those characters by virtue of the possession of which belief is knowledge. @# Sidenote : The Affiliations of Logic. @# Sect. 74 . Logic deals with the ground of belief , and thus distinguishes itself from the psychological account of the elements of the believing state. 182 : 2 But it is not possible sharply to sunder psychology and logic . This is due to the fact that the general principles which make belief true , may be regarded quite independently of this fact . They then become the most general truth , belonging to the absolute , archetypal realm , or to the mind of God. 182 : 3 When the general principles of certainty are so regarded , logic can be distinguished from metaphysics only by adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of the special conditions ( mainly psychological ) under which they may be realized among men . In the history of human thought the name of logic belongs to the study of this attainment of truth , as the terms aesthetics and ethics belong to the studies of the attainment of beauty and goodness. 183 : 4 It is evident that logic will have a peculiar importance for the rationalist . For the empiricist , proposing to report upon things as they are given , will tend on the whole to maintain that knowledge has no properties save those which are given to it by its special subject-matter . One can not , in short , define any absolute relationship between the normative sciences and the other branches of philosophy. @# Sidenote : Logic Deals with the Most General Conditions of Truth in Belief. @# Sect. 75 . Logic is the formulation , as independently as possible of special subject-matter , of that which conditions truth in belief . Since logic is concerned with truth only in so far as it is predicated of belief , and since belief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined as the formulation of the most general principles of knowledge . The principles so formulated would be those virtually used to justify belief or to disprove the imputation of error. @# Sidenote : The Parts of Formal Logic . Definition , Self-evidence , Inference , and Observation. @# Sect. 76 . What is called formal logic is animated with the hope of extracting these formulations directly from an analysis of the procedure of thought . The most general logical principles which have appeared in the historical development of formal logic are definition , self-evidence , inference , and observation . Each of these has been given special study , and each has given rise to special issues. @# Definition has to do with the formation of concepts , or determinate and unequivocal meanings . The universality of such concepts , and their consequent relation to particular things , was , as we have seen , investigated at a very early date , and gave rise to the great realistic-nominalistic controversy. 184 : 5 A large part of the logical discussion in the Platonic dialogues is an outgrowth of the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sophists , and consisting in the adroit use of ambiguity. 184 : 6 It is natural that in its first conscious self-criticism thought should discover the need of definite terms . The perpetual importance of definition has been largely due to the great prestige in modern philosophy of the method of geometry , which was regarded by Descartes and Spinoza as the model for systems of necessary truth. @# Self-evidence is the principle according to which conviction of truth follows directly from an understanding of meaning . In the practice of his intellectual midwifery , Socrates presupposed that thought is capable of bringing forth its own certainties . And rationalism has at all times regarded truth as ultimately accredited by internal marks recognizable by reason . Such truth arrived at antecedent to acquaintance with instances is called a priori , as distinguished from a posteriori knowledge , or observation after the fact . There can be no principles of self-evidence , but logicians have always been more or less concerned with the enumeration of alleged self-evident principles , notably those of contradiction and identity . A philosophical interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axioms , but with a view rather to their fruitfulness than their intrinsic truth . Indeed , the interest in self-evident truth has always been subordinate to the interest in systematic truth , and the discovery of first principles most commonly serves to determine the relative priority of definite concepts , or the correct point of departure for a series of inferences. @# The greater part of the famous Aristotelian logic consists in a study of inference , or the derivation of new knowledge from old knowledge . Aristotle sought to set down and classify every method of advancing from premises . The most important form of inference which he defined was the syllogism , a scheme of reasoning to a conclusion by means of two premises having one term in common . From the premises " all men are mortal " and " Socrates is a man , " one may conclude that " Socrates is mortal . " This is an instance not only of the syllogism in general , but of its most important " mood , " the subsumption of a particular case under a general rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy there has been a notable decrease of interest in the different forms of inference ; though its fundamental importance as the very bone and sinew of reasoning or deductive thinking has never been challenged . Its loss of pre-eminence is in part due to the growth of empiricism , stimulated by the writings of Lord Bacon in the seventeenth century , and fostered by the subsequent development of experimental science. @# Observation is the fundamental logical principle of empiricism . For a radical empiricism , knowledge would consist of descriptive generalizations based upon the summation of instances . That branch of logic which deals with the advance from individual instances to general principles , is called inductive logic . It has resulted in the announcement of canons of accuracy and freedom from preconception , and in the methodological study of hypothesis , experiment , and verification . Rules for observation directed to the end of discovering causes , constitute the most famous part of the epoch-making logic of J. S. Mills. 187 : 7 @# Sidenote : Present Tendencies . Theory of the Judgment. @# Sect. 77 . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment have arisen in the course of an attempt to define the least complexity that must be present in order that thought shall come within the range of truth and error . It is evident that no one either knows or is in error until he takes some attitude which lays claim to knowledge . Denoting by the term judgment this minimum of complexity in knowledge , an important question arises as to the sense in which the judgment involves the subject , predicate , and copula that are commonly present in its propositional form. @# Sidenote : Priority of Concepts. @# Sect. 78 . But a more important logical development has been due to the recent analysis of definite accredited systems of knowledge . The study of the fundamental conceptions of mathematics and mechanics , together with an examination of the systematic structure of these sciences , furnishes the most notable cases . There are two senses in which such studies may be regarded as logical . In the first place , in so far as they bring to light the inner coherence of any body of truth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of formal perfection which it seeks , they differ from formal logic only in that they derive their criteria from cases , rather than from the direct analysis of the procedure of thought . And since formal logic must itself make experiments , this difference is not a radical one . The study of cases tends chiefly to enrich methodology , or the knowledge of the special criteria of special sciences . In the second place , such studies serve to define the relatively few simple truths which are common to the relatively many complex truths . A study of the foundations of arithmetic reveals more elementary conceptions , such as class and order , that must be employed in the very definition of number itself , and so are implied in every numerical calculation . It appears similarly that the axioms of geometry are special axioms which involve the acceptance of more general axioms or indefinables. 189 : 8 Logic in this sense , then , is the enumeration of conceptions and principles in the order of their indispensableness to knowledge . And while it must be observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily those most significant for the existent world , nevertheless the careful analysis which such an enumeration involves is scarcely less fruitful for metaphysics than for logic. @# Sidenote : Aesthetics Deals with the Most General Conditions of Beauty . Subjectivistic and Formalistic Tendencies. @# Sect. 79 . Aesthetics is the formulation , as independently as possible of special subject-matter , of that which conditions beauty . As logic commonly refers to a judgment of truth , so aesthetics at any rate refers to a judgment implied in appreciation . But while it is generally admitted that truth itself is by no means limited to the form of the judgment , the contrary is frequently maintained with reference to beauty . The aphorism , De gustibus non est disputandum , expresses a common opinion to the effect that beauty is not a property belonging to the object of which it is predicated , but a property generated by the appreciative consciousness . According to this opinion there can be no beauty except in the case of an object ' s presence in an individual experience . Investigators must of necessity refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they have in many cases occupied themselves entirely with the state of aesthetic enjoyment in the hope of discovering its constant factors . The opposing tendency defines certain formal characters which the beautiful object must possess . Evidently the latter school will attribute a more profound philosophical importance to the conception of beauty , since for them it is a principle that obtains in the world of being . This was the first notable contention , that of Plato . But even with the emphasis laid upon the subjective aspect of the aesthetic experience , great metaphysical importance may be attached to it , where , as in the case of the German Romanticists , reality is deliberately construed as a spiritual life which is to be appreciated rather than understood. @# As in the case of logic , a strong impulse has manifested itself in aesthetics to deal with groups of objects that lie within its province , rather than directly with its concepts and principles . The first special treatise on aesthetics , the " Poetics " of Aristotle , belongs to this type of inquiry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it aims at the formulation of general principles. @# Sidenote : Ethics Deals with the Most General Conditions of Moral Goodness. @# Sect. 80 . Ethics , the oldest and most popular of the normative sciences , is the formulation , as independently as possible of special subject-matter , of that which conditions goodness of conduct . Ethics is commonly concerned with goodness only in so far as it is predicated of conduct , or of character , which is a more or less permanent disposition to conduct . Since conduct , in so far as good , is said to constitute moral goodness , ethics may be defined as the formulation of the general principles of morality . The principles so formulated would be those virtually employed to justify conduct , or to disprove the imputation of immorality. @# Sidenote : Conceptions of the Good . Hedonism. @# Sect. 81 . The student of this science is confronted with a very considerable diversity of method and differentiation of problems . The earliest and most profound opposition of doctrine in ethics arose from the differences of interpretation of which the teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen , verbally expressed in the proposition , virtue is knowledge . Socrates was primarily concerned to show that there is no real living without an understanding of the significance of life . To live well is to know the end of life , the good of it all , and to govern action with reference to that end . Virtue is therefore the practical wisdom that enables one to live consistently with his real intention . But what is the real intention , the end or good of life ? In the " Protagoras , " where Plato represents Socrates as expounding his position , virtue is interpreted to mean prudence , or foresight of pleasurable and painful consequences . He who knows , possesses all virtue in that he is qualified to adapt himself to the real situation and to gain the end of pleasure . All men , indeed , seek pleasure , but only virtuous men seek it wisely and well. @# " And do you , Protagoras , like the rest of the world , call some pleasant things evil and some painful things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that things are good in as far as they are pleasant , if they have no consequences of another sort , and in as far as they are painful they are bad. " 192 : 9 @# According to this view painful things are good only when they lead eventually to pleasure , and pleasant things evil only when their painful consequences outweigh their pleasantness . Hence moral differences reduce to differences of skill in the universal quest for pleasure , and sensible gratification is the ultimate standard of moral value . This ancient doctrine , known as hedonism , expressing as it does a part of life that will not suffer itself for long to be denied , is one of the great perennial tendencies of ethical thought . In the course of many centuries it has passed through a number of phases , varying its conception of pleasure from the tranquillity of the wise man to the sensuous titillations of the sybarite , and from the individualism of the latter to the universalism of the humanitarian . But in every case it shows a respect for the natural man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service of such human wants as are the outgrowth of the animal instinct of self-preservation. @# Sidenote : Rationalism. @# Sect. 82 . But if a man ' s life be regarded as a truer representation of his ideals than is his spoken theory , there is little to identify Socrates with the hedonists . At the conclusion of the defence of his own life , which Plato puts into his mouth in the well-known " Apology , " he speaks thus : @# " When my sons are grown up , I would ask you , O my friends , to punish them ; and I would have you trouble them , as I have troubled you , if they seem to care about riches , or anything , more than about virtue ; or if they pretend to be something when they are really nothing ,  --  then reprove them , as I have reproved you , for not caring about that for which they ought to care , and thinking that they are something when they are really nothing. " 194 : 10 @# It is plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful consequences of his acts , provided they were worthy of the high calling of human nature . A man ' s virtue would now seem to possess an intrinsic nobility . If knowledge be virtue , then on this basis it must be because knowledge is itself excellent . Virtue as knowledge contributes to the good by constituting it . We meet here with the rationalistic strain in ethics . It praises conduct for the inherent worth which it may possess if it express that reason which the Stoics called " the ruling part . " The riches of wisdom consist for the hedonist in their purchase of pleasure . For the rationalist , on the other hand , wisdom is not coin , but itself the very substance of value. @# Sidenote : Eudaemonism and Pietism . Rigorism and Intuitionism. @# Sect. 83 . Rationalism has undergone modifications even more significant than those of hedonism , and involving at least one radically new group of conceptions . Among the Greeks rationalism and hedonism alike are eudaemonistic . They aim to portray the fulness of life that makes " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose synthetic mind weaves together these different strands , the Greek ideal finds its most complete expression as " the high-minded man , " with all his powers and trappings . But the great spiritual transformation which accompanied the decline of Greek culture and the rise of Christianity , brought with it a new moral sensibility , which finds in man no virtue of himself , but only through the grace of God. @# " And the virtues themselves , " says St. Augustine , " if they bear no relation to God , are in truth vices rather than virtues ; for although they are regarded by many as truly moral when they are desired as ends in themselves and not for the sake of something else , they are , nevertheless , inflated and arrogant , and therefore not to be viewed as virtues but as vices. " 195 : 11 @# The new ideal is that of renunciation , obedience , and resignation . Ethically this expresses itself in pietism . Virtue is good neither in itself nor on account of its consequences , but because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this ideal is characteristic of an age that despaired of attainment , whether of pleasure or knowledge . To all , even the persecuted , it is permitted to obey , and so gain entrance into the kingdom of the children of God . But as every special study tends to rely upon its own conceptions , pietism , involving as it does a relation to God , is replaced by rigorism and intuitionism . The former doctrine defines virtue in terms of the inner attitude which it expresses . It must be done in the spirit of dutifulness , because one ought , and through sheer respect for the law which one ' s moral nature affirms . Intuitionism has attempted to deal with the source of the moral law by defining conscience as a special faculty or sense , qualified to pass directly upon moral questions , and deserving of implicit obediences . It is characteristic of this whole tendency to look for the spring of virtuous living , not in a good which such living obtains , but in a law to which it owes obedience. @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sect. 84 . This third general ethical tendency has thus been of the greatest importance in emphasizing the consciousness of duty , and has brought both hedonism and rationalism to a recognition of its fundamental importance . Ethics must deal not only with the moral ideal , but also with the ground of its appeal to the individual , and his obligation to pursue it . In connection with this recognition of moral responsibility , the problem of human freedom has come to be regarded in the light of an inevitable point of contact between ethics and metaphysics . That which is absolutely binding upon the human will can be determined only in view of some theory of its ultimate nature . On this account the rationalistic and hedonistic motives are no longer abstractly sundered , as in the days of the Stoics and Epicureans , but tend to be absorbed in broader philosophical tendencies . Hedonism appears as the sequel to naturalism ; or , more rarely , as part of a theistic system whose morality is divine legislation enforced by an appeal to motives of pleasure and pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed in rationalistic or idealistic philosophies , where man ' s rational nature is construed as his bond of kinship with the universe. @# Ethics has exhibited from the beginning a tendency to universalize its conceptions and take the central place in metaphysics . Thus with Plato good conduct was but a special case of goodness , the good being the most general principle of reality. 198 : 12 In modern times Fichte and his school have founded an ethical metaphysics upon the conception of duty. 198 : 13 In these cases ethics can be distinguished from metaphysics only by adding to the study of the good or of duty , a study of the special physical , psychological , and social conditions under which goodness and dutifulness may obtain in human life . It is possible to attach the name of ethics , and we have seen the same to be true of logic , either to a realm of ideal truth or to that realm wherein the ideal is realized in humanity. @# Sidenote : The Virtues , Customs , and Institutions. @# Sect. 85 . A systematic study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral practice , shall be interpreted in the light of the central conception of good , or of conscience . Justice , temperance , wisdom , and courage were praised by the Greeks . Christianity added self-sacrifice , humility , purity , and benevolence . These and other virtues have been defined , justified , and co-ordinated with the aid of a standard of moral value or a canon of duty. @# There is in modern ethics a pronounced tendency , parallel to those already noted in logic and aesthetics , to study such phenomena belonging to its field as have become historically established . A very considerable investigation of custom , institutions , and other social forces has led to a contact of ethics with anthropology and sociology scarcely less significant than that with metaphysics. @# * * * * * @# Sidenote : The Problems of Religion .

In that part of his philosophy in which he deals with faith , the great German philosopher Kant mentions God , Freedom , and Immortality as the three pre-eminent religious interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social relationship between man and that massive drift of things which determines his destiny . Of the two terms of this relation , God signifies the latter , while freedom and immortality are prerogatives which religion bestows upon the former . Man , viewed from the stand-point of religion as an object of special interest to the universe , is said to have a soul ; and by virtue of this soul he is said to be free and immortal , when thought of as having a life in certain senses independent of its immediate natural environment . The attempt to make this faith theoretically intelligible has led to the philosophical disciplines known as theology and psychology. 199 : 14 @# Sidenote : Theology Deals with the Nature and Proof of God. @# Sect. 87 . Theology , as a branch of philosophy , deals with the proof and the nature of God . Since " God " is not primarily a theoretical conception , the proof of God is not properly a philosophical problem . Historically , this task has been assumed as a legacy from Christian apologetics ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European philosophy is concerned , the definition of ultimate being in such spiritual terms as make possible the relation with man postulated in Christianity . For this it has been regarded as sufficient to ascribe to the world an underlying unity capable of bearing the predicates of perfection , omnipotence , and omniscience . Each proof of God has defined him pre-eminently in terms of some one of these his attributes. @# Sidenote : The Ontological Proof of God. @# Sect. 88 . The ontological proof of God held the foremost place in philosophy ' s contribution to Christianity up to the eighteenth century . This proof infers the existence from the ideal of God , and so approaches the nature of God through the attribute of perfection . It owes the form in which it was accepted in the Middle Ages and Renaissance to St. Anselm , Archbishop of Canterbury at the close of the eleventh century . He argued from the idea of a most perfect being to its existence , on the ground that non-existence , or existence only in idea , would contradict its perfection . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of the idea of God . The argument was accepted in Scholastic Philosophy201 : 15 largely because of the virtual acceptance of this necessity . Mediaeval thought was under the dominance of the philosophical ideas of Plato and Aristotle , and through them rationalism had come to be the unquestioned starting-point for all thought . For Plato reality and rationality meant one and the same thing , so that the ultimate reality was the highest principle of rationality , which he conceived to be the idea of the good . In the case of Aristotle the ideal of rationality was conceived to determine the course of the cosmical evolution as its immanent final cause . But in itself it was beyond the world , or transcendent . For Plato perfection itself is reality , whereas for Aristotle perfection determines the hierarchical order of natural substances . The latter theory , more suitable to the uses of Christianity , because it distinguished between God and the world , was incorporated into the great school systems . But both theories contain the essence of the ontological proof of God . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at once the culmination of insight and the meaning of life . The ideal of God is therefore a necessary idea , because implied in all the effort of thought as the object capable of finally satisfying it . St. Anselm adds little to the force of this argument , and does much to obscure its real significance. @# In stating the ontological argument the term perfection has been expressly emphasized , because it may be taken to embrace both truth and goodness . Owing to a habit of thought , due in the main to Plato , it was long customary to regard degrees of truth and goodness as interchangeable , and as equivalent to degrees of reality . The ens realissimum was in its completeness the highest object both of the faculty of cognition and of the moral will . But even in the scholastic period these two different aspects of the ideal were clearly recognized , and led to sharply divergent tendencies . More recently they have been divided and embodied in separate arguments . The epistemological argument defines God in terms of that absolute truth which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of idealism this absolute truth has taken the form of a universal mind , or all-embracing standard experience , called more briefly the absolute . The ethical argument , on the other hand , conceives God as the perfect goodness implied in the moral struggle , or the power through which goodness is made to triumph in the universe to the justification of moral faith . While the former of these arguments identifies God with being , the latter defines God in terms of the intent or outcome of being . Thus , while the epistemological argument does not distinguish God and the world , the latter does so , assuming that independent reality can be attributed to the stages of a process and to the purpose that dominates it. @# Sidenote : The Cosmological Proof of God. @# Sect. 89 . The cosmological proof of God approaches him through the attribute of creative omnipotence . The common principle of causal explanation refers the origin of natural events to similar antecedent events . But there must be some first cause from which the whole series is derived , a cause which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of the world . Because God ' s function as creator was a part of the Christian teaching , and because explanation by causes is habitual with common sense , this argument has had great vogue . But in philosophy it has declined in importance , chiefly because it has been absorbed in arguments which deal with the kind of causality proper to a first cause or world-ground . The argument that follows is a case in point. @# Sidenote : The Teleological Proof of God. @# Sect. 90 . The teleological proof argues that the world can owe its origin only to an intelligent first cause . The evidence for this is furnished by the cunning contrivances and beneficent adaptations of nature . These could not have come about through chance or the working of mechanical forces , but only through the foresight of a rational will . This argument originally infers God from the character of nature and history ; and the extension of mechanical principles to organic and social phenomena , especially as stimulated by Darwin ' s principle of natural selection , has tended greatly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for nature and history there are substituted the intellectual and moral activities themselves , and the inference is made to the ideal which they imply , the teleological argument merges into the ontological . But the old-fashioned statement of it remains in the form of religious faith , and in this capacity it has had the approval even of Hume and Kant , the philosophers who have contributed most forcibly to its overthrow as a demonstration of God . They agree that the acknowledgment of God in nature and history is the sequel to a theistic belief , and an inevitable attitude on the part of the religious consciousness. @# Sidenote : God and the World . Theism and Pantheism. @# Sect. 91 . Another group of ideas belonging to philosophical theology consists of three generalizations respecting God ' s relation to the world , known as theism , pantheism , and deism . Although , theoretically , these are corollaries of the different arguments for God , two of them , theism and pantheism , owe their importance to their rivalry as religious tendencies . Theism emphasizes that attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some sense distinct from both the world and man , which are his works and yet stand in an external relationship to him . It expresses the spirit of ethical and monotheistic religion , and is therefore the natural belief of the Christian . Pantheism appears in primitive religion as an animistic or polytheistic sense of the presence of a divine principle diffused throughout nature . But it figures most notably in the history of religions , in the highly reflective Brahmanism of India . In sharp opposition to Christianity , this religion preaches the indivisible unity of the world and the illusoriness of the individual ' s sense of his own independent reality . In spite of the fact that such a doctrine is alien to the spirit of Christianity , it enters into Christian theology through the influence of philosophy . The theoretical idea of God tends , as we have seen , to the identification of him with the world as its most real principle . Or it bestows upon him a nature so logical and formal , and so far removed from the characters of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations . Such reflections concerning God find their religious expression in a mystical sense of unity , which has in many cases either entirely replaced or profoundly modified the theistic strain in Christianity . In current philosophy pantheism appears in the epistemological argument which identifies God with being ; while the chief bulwark of theism is the ethical argument , with its provision for a distinction between the actual world and ideal principle of evolution. @# Sidenote : Deism. @# Sect. 92 . While theism and pantheism appear to be permanent phases in the philosophy of religion , deism is the peculiar product of the eighteenth century . It is based upon a repudiation of supernaturalism and " enthusiasm , " on the one hand , and a literal acceptance of the cosmological and teleological proofs on the other . Religions , like all else , were required , in this epoch of clear thinking , to submit to the canons of experimental observation and practical common sense . These authorize only a natural religion , the acknowledgment in pious living of a God who , having contrived this natural world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of priests and prophets , but of natural law . The artificiality of its conception of God , and the calculating spirit of its piety , make deism a much less genuine expression of the religious experience than either the moral chivalry of theism or the intellectual and mystical exaltation of pantheism. @# Sidenote : Metaphysics and Theology. @# Sect. 93 . The systematic development of philosophy leads to the inclusion of conceptions of God within the problem of metaphysics , and the subordination of the proof of God to the determination of the fundamental principle of reality . There will always remain , however , an outstanding theological discipline , whose function it is to interpret worship , or the living religious attitude , in terms of the theoretical principles of philosophy. @# Sidenote : Psychology is the Theory of the Soul. @# Sect. 94 . Psychology is the theory of the soul . As we have already seen , the rise of scepticism directs attention from the object of thought to the thinker , and so emphasizes the self as a field for theoretical investigation . But the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The precept , +gno : thi seauton+ , has its deepest justification in the concern for the salvation of one ' s soul . In primitive and half-instinctive belief the self is recognized in practical relations . In its animistic phase this belief admitted of such relations with all living creatures , and extended the conception of life very generally to natural processes . Thus in the beginning the self was doubtless indistinguishable from the vital principle . In the first treatise on psychology , the " +peri Psyche : s+ " of Aristotle , this interpretation finds a place in theoretical philosophy . For Aristotle the soul is the entelechy of the body  --  that function or activity which makes a man of it . He recognized , furthermore , three stages in this activity : the nutritive , sensitive , and rational souls , or the vegetable , animal , and distinctively human natures , respectively . The rational soul , in its own proper activity , is man ' s highest prerogative , the soul to be saved . By virtue of it man rises above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal . But Plato , who , as we have seen , was ever ready to grant reality to the ideal apart from the circumstances of its particular embodiment , had already undertaken to demonstrate the immortality of the soul on the ground of its distinctive nature. 209 : 16 According to his way of thinking , the soul ' s essentially moral nature made it incapable of destruction through the operation of natural causes . It is evident , then , that there were already ideas in vogue capable of interpreting the Christian teaching concerning the existence of a soul , or of an inner essence of man capable of being made an object of divine interest. @# Sidenote : Spiritual Substance @# Sect. 95 . The immediate effect of Christianity was to introduce into philosophy as one of its cardinal doctrines the theory of a spiritual being , constituting the true self of the individual , and separable from the body . The difference recognized in Plato and Aristotle between the divine spark and the appetitive and perceptual parts of human nature was now emphasized . The former ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the lower soul ) was defined as a substance having the attributes of thought and will . The fundamental argument for its existence was the immediate appeal to self-consciousness ; and it was further defined as indestructible on the ground of its being utterly discontinuous and incommensurable with its material environment . This theory survives at the present day in the conception of pure activity , but on the whole the attributes of the soul have superseded its substance. @# Sidenote : Intellectualism and Voluntarism. @# Sect. 96 . Intellectualism and voluntarism are the two rival possibilities of emphasis when the soul is defined in terms of its known activities . Wherever the essence of personality is in question , as also occurs in the case of theology , thought and will present their respective claims to the place of first importance . Intellectualism would make will merely the concluding phase of thought , while voluntarism would reduce thought to one of the interests of a general appetency . It is evident that idealistic theories will be much concerned with this question of priority . It is also true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general and objective features of the mind , tends to subordinate the individual to the universal ; while voluntarism , emphasizing desire and action , is relatively individualistic , and so , since there are many individuals , also pluralistic. 211 : 17 @# Sidenote : Freedom of the Will . Necessitarianism , Determinism , and Indeterminism. @# Sect. 97 . The question of the freedom of the will furnishes a favorite controversial topic in philosophy . For the interest at stake is no less than the individual ' s responsibility before man and God for his good or bad works . It bears alike upon science , religion , and philosophy , and is at the same time a question of most fundamental practical importance . But this diffusion of the problem has led to so considerable a complication of it that it becomes necessary in outlining it to define two issues . In the first place , the concept of freedom is designed to express generally the distinction between man and the rest of nature . To make man in all respects the product and creature of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radically necessitarian doctrine . The question still remains , however , as to the causes which dominate man . He may be free from nature , and yet be ruled by God , or by distinctively spiritual causes , such as ideas or character . Where in general the will is regarded as submitting only to a spiritual causation proper to its own realm , the conception is best named determinism ; though in the tradition of philosophy it is held to be a doctrine of freedom , because contrasted with the necessitarianism above defined . There remains indeterminism , which attributes to the will a spontaneity that makes possible the direct presence to it of genuine alternatives . The issue may here coincide with that between intellectualism and voluntarism . If , e. g. , in God ' s act of creation , his ideals and standards are prior to his fiat , his conduct is determined ; whereas it is free in the radical or indeterministic sense if his ideals themselves are due to his sheer will . This theory involves at a certain point in action the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often identified with chance , in which case it loses its distinction from nature , and we have swung round the circle. @# Sidenote : Immortality . Survival and Eternalism. @# Sect. 98 . There is similar complexity in the problem concerning immortality . Were the extreme claims of naturalism to be established , there would be no ground whatsoever upon which to maintain the immortality of man , mere dust returning unto dust . The philosophical concept of immortality is due to the supposition that the quintessence of the individual ' s nature is divine. 213 : 18 But several possibilities are at this point open to us . The first would maintain the survival after death of a recognizable and discrete personality . Another would suppose a preservation after death , through being taken up into the life of God . Still another , the theory commonly maintained on the ground of rationalistic and idealistic metaphysics , would deny that immortality has to do with life after death , and affirm that it signifies the perpetual membership of the human individual in a realm of eternity through the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently leaves open the question of the immortality of that which is distinctive and personal in human nature. @# Sidenote : The Natural Science of Psychology . Its Problems and Method. @# Sect. 99 . So far we have followed the fortunes only of the " spirit " of man . What of that lower soul through which he is identified with the fortunes of his body ? When philosophy gradually ceased , in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , to be " the handmaid of religion , " there arose a renewed interest in that part of human nature lying between the strictly physiological functions , on the one hand , and thought and will on the other . Descartes and Spinoza analyzed what they called the " passions , " meaning such states of mind as are conditioned by a concern for the interests of the body . At a later period , certain English philosophers , following Locke , traced the dependence of ideas upon the senses . Their method was that of introspection , or the direct examination by the individual of his own ideas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple factors . The lineal descendants of these same English philosophers defined more carefully the process of association , whereby the complexity and sequence of ideas are brought about , and made certain conjectures as to its dependence upon properties and transactions in the physical brain . These are the three main philosophical sources of what has now grown to be the separate natural science of psychology . It will be noted that there are two characteristics which all of these studies have in common . They deal with the experience of the individual as composing his own private history , and tend to attribute the specific course which this private history takes to bodily conditions . It is only recently that these investigations have acquired sufficient unity and exclusiveness of aim to warrant their being regarded as a special science . But such is now so far the case that the psychologist of this type pursues his way quite independently of philosophy . It is true his research has advanced considerably beyond his understanding of its province . But it is generally recognized that he must examine those very factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , furthermore , that he must seek to provide for them in nature . He treats the inner life in what Locke called " the plain historical method , " that is to say , instead of interpreting and defining its ideas , he analyzes and reports upon its content . He would not seek to justify a moral judgment , as would ethics , or to criticise the cogency of thought , as would logic ; but only to describe the actual state as he found it . In order to make his data commensurable with the phenomena of nature , he discovers or defines bodily conditions for the subjective content which he analyzes . His fundamental principle of method is the postulate of psycho-physical parallelism , according to which he assumes a state of brain or nervous system for every state of mind . But in adopting a province and a method the psychologist foregoes finality of truth after the manner of all natural science . He deals admittedly with an aspect of experience , and his conclusions are no more adequate to the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An admirable reference to this abstract division of experience occurs in Kuelpe ' s " Introduction to Philosophy " : @# " For the developed consciousness , as for the naive , every experience is an unitary whole ; and it is only the habit of abstract reflection upon experience that makes the objective and subjective worlds seem to fall apart as originally different forms of existence . Just as a plane curve can be represented in analytical geometry as the function of two variables , the abscissae and the ordinates , without prejudice to the unitary course of the curve itself , so the world of human experience may be reduced to a subjective and an objective factor , without prejudice to its real coherence. " 215 : 19 @# Sidenote : Psychology and Philosophy. @# Sect. 100 . The problems of psychology , like those of theology , tend to disappear as independent philosophical topics . The ultimate nature of the self will continue to interest philosophers  --  more deeply , perhaps , than any aspect of experience  --  but their conception of it will be a corollary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of the old philosophical psychology , the introspective and experimental analysis of special states of mind , is already the province of a natural science which is becoming more and more free from the stand-point and method of philosophy. @# Sidenote : Transition from Classification by Problems to Classification by Doctrines . Naturalism . Subjectivism . Absolute Idealism . Absolute Realism. @# Sect. 101 . Reminding ourselves anew that philosophical problems can not be treated in isolation from one another , we shall hereinafter seek to become acquainted with general stand-points that give systematic unity to the issues which have been enumerated . Such stand-points are not clearly defined by those who occupy them , and they afford no clear-cut classification of all historical philosophical philosophies . But system-making in philosophy is commonly due to the moving in an individual mind of some most significant idea ; and certain of these ideas have reappeared so frequently as to define more or less clearly marked tendencies , or continuous strands , out of which the history of thought is forever weaving itself . Such is clearly the case with naturalism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy is a summation of the natural sciences , whose entire thought is based upon an acceptance of the methods and the fundamental conceptions of these disciplines . This tendency stands in the history of thought for the conviction that the visible and tangible world which interacts with the body is veritable reality . This philosophy is realistic and empirical to an extent entirely determined by its belief concerning being . But while naturalism is only secondarily epistemological , subjectivism and absolute idealism have their very source in the self-examination and the self-criticism of thought . Subjectivism signifies the conviction that the knower can not escape himself . If reality is to be kept within the range of possible knowledge , it must be defined in terms of the processes or states of selves . Absolute idealism arises from a union of this epistemological motive with a recognition of what are regarded as the logical necessities to which reality must submit . Reality must be both knowledge and rational knowledge ; the object , in short , of an absolute mind , which shall be at once all-containing and systematic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an idealistic epistemology , but with the common-sense principle that being is discovered and not constituted by thought . Such an absolute realism is , like naturalism , primarily metaphysical rather than epistemological ; but , unlike naturalism , it seeks to define reality as a logical or ethical necessity. @# Under these several divisions , then , we shall meet once more with the special problems of philosophy , but this time they will be ranged in an order that is determined by some central doctrine .

The meaning conveyed by any philosophical term consists largely of the distinctions which it suggests . Its peculiar quality , like the physiognomy of the battle-scarred veteran , is a composite of the controversies which it has survived . There is , therefore , an almost unavoidable confusion attendant upon the denomination of any early phase of philosophy as materialism . But in the historical beginnings of thought , as also in the common-sense of all ages , there is at any rate present a very essential strand of this theory . The naive habit of mind which , in the sixth century before Christ , prompted successive Greek thinkers to define reality in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect one with that exhibited in Dr. Samuel Johnson ' s smiting the ground with his stick in curt refutation of Bishop Berkeley ' s idea-philosophy . There is a theoretical instinct , not accidental or perverse , but springing from the very life-preserving equipment of the organism , which attributes reality to tangible space-filling things encountered by the body . For obvious reasons of self-interest the organism is first of all endowed with a sense of contact , and the more delicate senses enter into its practical economy as means of anticipating or avoiding contact . From such practical expectations concerning the proximity of that which may press upon , injure , or displace the body , arise the first crude judgments of reality . And these are at the same time the nucleus of naive philosophy and the germinal phase of materialism. @# Sidenote : Corporeal Being. @# Sect. 103 . The first philosophical movement among the Greeks was a series of attempts to reduce the tangible world to unity , and of these the conception offered by Anaximander is of marked interest in its bearing upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined his first principle , instead of having chosen it from among the different elements already distinguished by common-sense . He thought the unity of nature to consist in its periodic evolution from and return into one infinite sum of material ( +to apeiron+ ) , which , much in the manner of the " nebula " of modern science , is conceived as both indeterminate in its actual state and infinitely rich in its potentiality . The conception of matter , the most familiar commonplace of science , begins to be recognizable . It has here reached the point of signifying a common substance for all tangible things , a substance that in its own general and omnipresent nature is without the special marks that distinguish these tangible things from one another . And in so far the philosophy of Anaximander is materialistic. @# Sidenote : Corporeal Processes . Hylozoism and Mechanism. @# Sect. 104 . But the earliest thinkers are said to be hylozoists , rather than strict materialists , because of their failure to make certain distinctions in connection with the processes of matter . The term hylozoism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ( +hyle : + ) , that of an animating power to which its formations and transformations are due . Hylozoism itself was not a deliberate synthesis of these two conceptions , but a primitive practical tendency to universalize the conception , of life . Such " animism " instinctively associates with an object ' s bulk and hardness a capacity for locomotion and general initiative . And the material principles defined by the philosophers retain this vague and comprehensive attribute as a matter of course , until it is distinguished and separated through attempts to understand it. @# That aspect of natural process which was most impressive to Greek minds of the reflective type was the alternation of " generation and decay . " In full accord with his more ancient master , Epicurus , the Latin poet Lucretius writes : @# " Thus neither can death-dealing motions keep the mastery always , nor entomb existence forevermore ; nor , on the other hand , can the birth and increase giving motions of things preserve them always after they are born . Thus the war of first beginnings waged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , now there , the life-bringing elements of things get the mastery and are o ' ermastered in turn : with the funeral wail blends the cry which babies raise when they enter the borders of light ; and no night ever followed day , nor morning night , that heard not , mingling with the sickly infant ' s cries , wailings of the attendants on death and black funeral. " 226 : 2 @# In a similar vein , the earliest conceptions of natural evolution attributed it to the coworking of two principles , that of Love or union and that of Hate or dissolution . The process is here distinguished from the material of nature , but is still described in the language of practical life . A distinction between two aspects of vital phenomena is the next step . These may be regarded in respect either of the motion and change which attend them , or the rationality which informs them . Life is both effective and significant . Although neither of these ideas ever wholly ceases to be animistic , they may nevertheless be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive animistic world to the lower end of its scale , the other construes it in terms of a purposive utility commensurable with that of human action . Now it is with mechanism , the former of these diverging ways , that the development of materialism is identified . For this philosophy a thing need have no value to justify its existence , nor any acting intelligence to which it may owe its origin . Its bulk and position are sufficient for its being , and the operation of forces capable of integrating , dividing , or moving it is sufficient for its derivation and history . In short , there is no rhyme or reason at the heart of things , but only actual matter distributed by sheer force . With this elimination of the element of purposiveness from the hylozoistic world , the content and process of nature are fitted to one another . Matter is that which is moved by force , and force is the determining principle of the motions of matter . Materialism is now definitely equipped with its fundamental conceptions. @# Sidenote : Materialism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialism as a philosophical theory differ from those employed in the physical sciences only in what is demanded of them . The scientist reports upon physical phenomena without accepting any further responsibility , while those who like Lucretius maintain a physical metaphysics , must , like him , prove that " the minute bodies of matter from everlasting continually uphold the sum of things . " But , though they employ them in their own way , materialists and all other exponents of naturalism derive their central conceptions from the physical sciences , and so reflect the historical development through which these sciences have passed . To certain historical phases of physical science , in so far as these bear directly upon the meaning of naturalism , we now turn. @# Sidenote : The Development of the Conceptions of Physical Science . Space and Matter. @# Sect. 106 . From the earliest times down to the present day the groundwork of materialism has most commonly been cast in the form of an atomic theory . Democritus , the first system-builder of this school , adopted the conception of indivisible particles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and varying among themselves only in form , order , and position . To provide for the motion that distributes them he conceived them as separated from one another by empty space . From this it follows that the void is as real as matter , or , as Democritus himself is reputed to have said , " thing is not more real than no-thing. " @# But atomism has not been by any means universally regarded as the most satisfactory conception of the relation between space and matter . Not only does it require two kinds of being , with the different attributes of extension and hardness , respectively , 229 : 3 but it would also seem to be experimentally inadequate in the case of the more subtle physical processes , such as light . The former of these is a speculative consideration , and as such had no little weight with the French philosopher Descartes , whose divisions and definitions so profoundly affected the course of thought in these matters after the sixteenth century . Holding also " that a vacuum or space in which there is absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indivisible space-filling particle is self-contradictory , he was led to identify space and matter ; that is , to make matter as indispensable to space as space to matter . There is , then , but one kind of corporeal being , whose attribute is extension , and whose modes are motion and rest . The most famous application of the mechanical conceptions which he bases upon this first principle , is his theory of the planets , which are conceived to be embedded in a transparent medium , and to move with it , vortex fashion , about the sun. 230 : 4 @# But the conception of the space-filling continuity of material substance owes its prominence at the present time to the experimental hypothesis of ether . This substance , originally conceived to occupy the intermolecular spaces and to serve as a medium for the propagation of undulations , is now regarded by many physicists as replacing matter . " It is the great hope of science at the present day , " says a contemporary exponent of naturalism , " that hard and heavy matter will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a theory would reduce bodies to the relative displacements of parts of a continuous substance , which would be first of all defined as spacial , and would possess such further properties as special scientific hypotheses might require. @# Two broadly contrasting theories thus appear : that which defines matter as a continuous substance coextensive with space ; and that which defines it as a discrete substance divided by empty space . But both theories are seriously affected by the peculiarly significant development of the conception of force. @# Sidenote : Motion and its Cause . Development and Extension of the Conception of Force. @# Sect. 107 . In the Cartesian system the cause of motion was pressure within a plenum . But in the seventeenth century this notion encountered the system of Newton , a system which seemed to involve action at a distance . In the year 1728 Voltaire wrote from London : @# " When a Frenchman arrives in London , he finds a very great change , in philosophy as well as in most other things . In Paris he left the world all full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe is seen filled up with ethereal vortices , while here the same space is occupied with the play of the invisible forces of gravitation . In Paris the earth is painted for us longish like an egg , and in London it is oblate like a melon . At Paris the pressure of the moon causes the ebb and flow of tides ; in England , on the other hand , the sea gravitates toward the moon , so that at the same time when the Parisians demand high water of the moon , the gentlemen of London require an ebb. " 232 : 6 @# But these differences are not matters of taste , nor even rival hypotheses upon an equal footing . The Newtonian system of mechanics , the consummation of a development initiated by Galileo , differed from the vortex theory of Descartes as exact science differs from speculation and unverified conjecture . And this difference of method carried with it eventually certain profound differences of content , distinguishing the Newtonian theory even from that of Democritus , with which it had so much in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposiveness in the older hylozoism by referring the motions of bodies as far as possible to the impact of other bodies , he nevertheless attributed these motions ultimately to weight , signifying thereby a certain downward disposition . Now it is true that in his general belief Newton himself is not free from hylozoism . He thought of the motions of the planets themselves as initiated and quickened by a power emanating ultimately from God . They are " impressed by an intelligent Agent , " and @# " can be the effect of nothing else than the wisdom and skill of a powerful ever-living Agent who , being in all places , is more able by his will to move the bodies within his boundless uniform sensorium , and thereby to form and reform the parts of the universe , than we are by our will to move the parts of our own bodies. " 233 : 7 @# But by the side of these statements must be set his famous disclaimer , " hypotheses non fingo . " In his capacity of natural philosopher he did not seek to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did in action at a distance , he saw no possibility of explanation short of a reference of them to God ; but such " hypotheses " he thought to be no proper concern of science . As a consequence , the mathematical formulation of motions came , through him , to be regarded as the entire content of mechanics . The notion of an efficient cause of motion is still suggested by the term force , but even this term within the system of mechanics refers always to a definite amount of motion , or measurement of relative motion . And the same is true of attraction , action , reaction , and the like . The further explanation of motion , the definition of a virtue or potency that produces it , first a neglected problem , then an irrelevant problem , is finally , for a naturalistic philosophy in which this progression is completed , an insoluble problem . For the sequel to this purely descriptive procedure on the part of science is the disavowal of " metaphysics " by those who will have no philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the positivistic and agnostic phase of naturalism . But a further treatment of this development must be reserved until the issue of epistemology shall have been definitely raised. @# A different emphasis within the general mechanical scheme , attaching especial importance to the conceptions of force and energy , has led to a rival tendency in science and a contrasting type of naturalism . The mechanical hypotheses hitherto described are all of a simple and readily depicted type . They suggest an imagery quite in accord with common-sense and with observation of the motions of great masses like the planets . Material particles are conceived to move within a containing space ; the motions of corpuscles , atoms , or the minute parts of ether , differing only in degree from those of visible bodies . The whole physical universe may be represented in the imagination as an aggregate of bodies participating in motions of extraordinary complexity , but of one type . But now let the emphasis be placed upon the determining causes rather than upon the moving bodies themselves . In other words , let the bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result is a radical alteration of the mechanical scheme and the transcendence of common-sense imagery . This was one direction of outgrowth from the work of Newton . His force of gravitation prevailed between bodies separated by spaces of great magnitude . Certain of the followers of Newton , notably Cotes , accepting the formulas of the master but neglecting his allusions to the agency of God , accepted the principle of action at a distance . Force , in short , was conceived to pervade space of itself . But if force be granted this substantial and self-dependent character , what further need is there of matter as a separate form of entity ? For does not the presence of matter consist essentially in resistance , itself a case of force ? Such reflections as these led Boscovich and others to the radical departure of defining material particles as centres of force. @# Sidenote : The Development and Extension of the Conception of Energy. @# Sect. 108 . But a more fruitful hypothesis of the same general order is due to the attention directed to the conception of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of reciprocal transformations without loss , of motion , heat , electricity , and other processes . The principle of the conservation of energy affirms the quantitative constancy of that which is so transformed , measured , for example , in terms of capacity to move units of mass against gravity . The exponents of what is called " energetics " have in many cases come to regard that the quantity of which is so conserved , as a substantial reality whose forms and distributions compose nature . A contemporary scientist , whose synthetic and dogmatic habit of mind has made him eminent in the ranks of popular philosophy , writes as follows : @# " Mechanical and chemical energy , sound and heat , light and electricity , are mutually convertible ; they seem to be but different modes of one and the same fundamental force or energy . Thence follows the important thesis of the unity of all natural forces , or , as it may also be expressed , the ' monism of energy. ' " 236 : 8 @# The conception of energy seems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have seen that the matter-motion theory was satisfied to ignore , or regard as insoluble , problems concerning the ultimate causes of things . Furthermore , as we shall presently see to better advantage , the more strictly materialistic type of naturalism must regard thought as an anomaly , and has no little difficulty with life . But the conception of energy is more adaptable , and hence better qualified to serve as a common denominator for various aspects of experience . The very readiness with which we can picture the corpuscular scheme is a source of embarrassment to the seeker after unity . That which is so distinct is bristling with incompatibilities . The most aggressive materialist hesitates to describe thought as a motion of bodies in space . Energy , on the other hand , exacts little if anything beyond the character of measurable power . Thought is at any rate in some sense a power , and to some degree measurable . Recent discoveries of the dependence of capacity for mental exertion upon physical vitality and measurements of chemical energy received into the system as food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lent plausibility to the hypothesis of a universal energy of which physical and " psychical " processes are alike manifestations . And the conception of energy seems capable not only of unifying nature , but also of satisfying the metaphysical demand for an efficient and moving cause . This term , like " force " and " power , " is endowed with such a significance by common sense . Indeed , naturalism would seem here to have swung round toward its hylozoistic starting-point . The exponent of energetics , like the naive animistic thinker , attributes to nature a power like that which he feels welling up within himself . When he acts upon the environment , like meets like . Energetics , it is true , may obtain a definite meaning for its central conception from the measurable behavior of external bodies , and a meaning that may be quite free from vitalism or teleology . But in his extension of the conception the author of a philosophical energetics abandons this strict meaning , and blends his thought even with a phase of subjectivism , known as panpsychism. 238 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature as homogeneous with an immediately felt activity or appetency , as energetics finds the inner life to be homogeneous with the forces of nature . Both owe their philosophical appeal to their apparent success in unifying the world upon a direct empirical basis , and to their provision for the practical sense of reality. @# Such , in brief , are the main alternatives available for a naturalistic theory of being , in consequence of the historical development of the fundamental conceptions of natural science. @# Sidenote : The Claims of Naturalism. @# Sect. 109 . We turn now to an examination of the manner in which naturalism , equipped with working principles , seeks to meet the special requirements of philosophy . The conception of the unity of nature is directly in the line of a purely scientific development , but naturalism takes the bold and radical step of regarding nature so unified as coextensive with the real , or at any rate knowable , universe . It will be remembered that among the early Greeks Anaxagoras had referred the creative and formative processes of nature to a non-natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The adventitious character of this principle , the external and almost purely nominal part which it played in the actual cosmology of Anaxagoras , betrayed it into the hands of the atomists , with their more consistently naturalistic creed . Better , these maintain , the somewhat dogmatic extension of conceptions proved to be successful in the description of nature , than a vague dualism which can serve only to distract the scientific attention and people the world with obscurities . There is a remarkable passage in Lucretius in which atomism is thus written large and inspired with cosmical eloquence : @# " For verily not by design did the first-beginnings of things station themselves each in its right place guided by keen intelligence , nor did they bargain sooth to say what motions each should assume , but because many in number and shifting about in many ways throughout the universe , they are driven and tormented by blows during infinite time past , after trying motions and unions of every kind at length they fall into arrangements such as those out of which our sum of things has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many great years , when once it has been thrown into the appropriate motions , and causes the streams to replenish the greedy sea with copious river waters , and the earth , fostered by the heat of the sun , to renew its produce , and the race of living things to come up and flourish , and the gliding fires of ether to live : all which these several things could in no wise bring to pass , unless a store of matter could rise up from infinite space , out of which store they are wont to make up in due season whatever has been lost. " 240 : 10 @# The prophecy of La Place , the great French mathematician , voices the similar faith of the eighteenth century in a mechanical understanding of the universe : @# " The human mind , in the perfection it has been able to give to astronomy , affords a feeble outline of such an intelligence . Its discoveries in mechanics and in geometry , joined to that of universal gravitation , have brought it within reach of comprehending in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system of the world. " 241 : 11 @# As for God , the creative and presiding intelligence , La Place had " no need of any such hypothesis. " @# Sidenote : The Task of Naturalism. @# Sect. 110 . But these are the boasts of Homeric heroes before going into battle . The moment such a general position is assumed there arise sundry difficulties in the application of naturalistic principles to special interests and groups of facts . It is one thing to project a mechanical scheme in the large , but quite another to make explicit provision within it for the origin of nature , for life , for the human self with its ideals , and for society with its institutions . The naturalistic method of meeting these problems involves a reduction all along the line in the direction of such categories as are derived from the infra-organic world . That which is not like the planetary system must be construed as mechanical by indirection and subtlety. @# Sidenote : The Origin of the Cosmos. @# Sect. 111 . The origin of the present known natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by science . The general form of solution which naturalism offers is anticipated in the most ancient theories of nature . These already suppose that the observed mechanical processes of the circular or periodic type , like the revolutions and rotations of the stars , are incidents in a historical mechanical process of a larger scale . Prior to the present fixed motions of the celestial bodies , the whole mass of cosmic matter participated in irregular motions analogous to present terrestrial redistributions . Such motions may be understood to have resulted in the integration of separate bodies , to which they at the same time imparted a rotary motion . It is such a hypothesis that Lucretius paints in his bold , impressionistic colors. @# But the development of mechanics paved the way for a definite scientific theory , the so-called " nebular hypothesis , " announced by La Place in 1796 , and by the philosopher Kant at a still earlier date . Largely through the Newtonian principle of the parallelogram of forces , the present masses , orbits , and velocities were analyzed into a more primitive process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . And with the aid of the principle of the conservation of energy this theory appears to make possible the derivation of heat , light , and other apparently non-mechanical processes from the same original energy of motion. @# But a persistently philosophical mind at once raises the question of the origin of this primeval nebula itself , with a definite organization and a vast potential energy that must , after all , be regarded as a part of nature rather than its source . Several courses are here open to naturalism . It may maintain that the question of ultimate origin is unanswerable ; it may regard such a process of concentration as extending back through an infinitely long past ; 243 : 12 or , and this is the favorite alternative for more constructive minds , the historical cosmical process may be included within a still higher type of periodic process , which is regarded as eternal . This last course has been followed in the well-known synthetic naturalism of Herbert Spencer . " Evolution , " he says , " is the progressive integration of matter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs down , and may be conceived as giving place to a counter-process of devolution which scatters the parts of matter and gathers another store of potential motion . The two processes in alternation will then constitute a cosmical system without beginning or end. @# In such wise a sweeping survey of the physical universe may be thought in the terms of natural science . The uniformitarian method in geology , resolving the history of the crust of the earth into known processes , such as erosion and igneous fusion ; 244 : 13 and spectral analysis , with its discoveries concerning the chemical constituents of distant bodies through the study of their light , have powerfully reenforced this effort of thought , and apparently completed an outline sketch of the universe in terms of infra-organic processes. @# Sidenote : Life . Natural Selection. @# Sect. 112 . But the cosmos must be made internally homogeneous in these same terms . There awaits solution , in the first place , the serious problem of the genesis and maintenance of life within a nature that is originally and ultimately inorganic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical cosmos had made little real progress prior to the nineteenth century . Mechanical theories had , indeed , been projected in the earliest age of philosophy , and proposed anew in the seventeenth century. 245 : 14 Nevertheless , the structural and functional teleology of the organism remained as apparently irrefutable testimony to the inworking of some principle other than that of mechanical necessity . Indeed , the only fruitful method applicable to organic phenomena was that which explained them in terms of purposive adaptation . And it was its provision for a mechanical interpretation of this very principle that gave to the Darwinian law of natural selection , promulgated in 1859 in the " Origin of Species , " so profound a significance for naturalism . It threatened to reduce the last stronghold of teleology , and completely to dispense with the intelligent Author of nature. @# Darwin ' s hypothesis sought to explain the origin of animal species by survival under competitive conditions of existence through the possession of a structure suited to the environment . Only the most elementary organism need be presupposed , together with slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be conceived to arise mechanically . There will then result in surviving organisms a gradual accumulation of such variations as promote survival under the special conditions of the environment . Such a principle had been suggested as early as the time of Empedocles , but it remained for Darwin to establish it with an unanswerable array of observation and experimentation . If any organism whatsoever endowed with the power of generation be allowed to have somehow come to be , naturalism now promises to account for the whole subsequent history of organic phenomena and the origin of any known species. @# Sidenote : Mechanical Physiology. @# Sect. 113 . But what of life itself ? The question of the derivation of organic from inorganic matter has proved insoluble by direct means , and the case of naturalism must here rest upon such facts as the chemical homogeneity of these two kinds of matter , and the conformity of physiological processes to more general physical laws . Organic matter differs from inorganic only through the presence of proteid , a peculiar product of known elements , which can not be artificially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into these elements without any discoverable residuum . Respiration may be studied as a case of aerodynamics , the circulation of the blood as a case of hydrodynamics , and the heat given off in the course of work done by the body as a case of thermodynamics . And although vitalistic theories still retain a place in physiology , as do teleological theories in biology , on the whole the naturalistic programme of a reduction of organic processes to the type of the inorganic tends to prevail. @# Sidenote : Mind . The Reduction to Sensation. @# Sect. 114 . The history of naturalism shows that , as in the case of life , so also in the case of mind , its hypotheses were projected by the Greeks , but precisely formulated and verified only in the modern period of science . In the philosophy of Democritus the soul was itself an atom , finer , rounder , and smoother than the ordinary , but thoroughly a part of the mechanism of nature . The processes of the soul are construed as interactions between the soul and surrounding objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of effluxes which impinge upon the soul-atom . These images are not true reports of the outer world , but must be revised by thought before its real atomic structure emerges . For this higher critical exercise of thought Democritus devised no special atomic genesis . The result may be expressed either as the invalidity of such operations of mind as he could provide for in his universe , or the irreducibility to his chosen first principles of the very thought which defined them . Later naturalism has generally sacrificed epistemology to cosmology , and reduced thought to sensation . Similarly , will has been regarded as a highly developed case of instinct . Knowledge and will , construed as sensation and instinct , may thus be interpreted in the naturalistic manner within the field of biology. @# Sidenote : Automatism. @# Sect. 115 . But the actual content of sensation , and the actual feelings which attend upon the promptings of instinct , still stubbornly testify to the presence in the universe of something belonging to a wholly different category from matter and motion . The attitude of naturalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there has gradually come to predominate a method of denying to the inner life all efficacy and real significance in the cosmos , while admitting its presence on the scene . It is a strange fact of history that Descartes , the French philosopher who prided himself on having rid the soul of all dependence on nature , should have greatly contributed to this method . But it is perhaps not so strange when we consider that every dualism is , after all , symmetrical , and that consequently whatever rids the soul of nature at the same time rids nature of the soul . It was Descartes who first conceived the body and soul to be utterly distinct substances . The corollary to this doctrine was his automatism , applied in his own system to animals other than man , but which those less concerned with religious tradition and less firmly convinced of the soul ' s originating activity were not slow to apply universally . This theory conceived the vital processes to take place quite regardless of any inner consciousness , or even without its attendance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century were especially attracted . With them the active soul of Descartes , the distinct spiritual entity , disappeared . This latter author had himself admitted a department of the self , which he called the " passions , " in which the course and content of mind is determined by bodily conditions . Extending this conception to the whole province of mind , they employed it to demonstrate the thorough-going subordination of mind to body . La Mettrie , a physician and the author of a book entitled " L ' Homme Machine , " was first interested in this thesis by a fever delirium , and afterward adduced anatomical and pathological data in support of it . The angle from which he views human life is well illustrated in the following : @# " What would have sufficed in the case of Julius Caesar , of Seneca , of Petronius , to turn their fearlessness into timidity or braggartry ? An obstruction in the spleen , the liver , or the vena portae . For the imagination is intimately connected with these viscera , and from them arise all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' A mere nothing , a little fibre , some trifling thing that the most subtle anatomy can not discover , would have made two idiots out of Erasmus and Fontenelle. ' " 250 : 15 @# Sidenote : Radical Materialism . Mind as an Epiphenomenon. @# Sect. 116 . The extreme claim that the soul is a physical organ of the body , identical with the brain , marked the culmination of this militant materialism , so good an instance of that over-simplification and whole-hearted conviction characteristic of the doctrinaire propagandism of France . Locke , the Englishman , had admitted that possibly the substance which thinks is corporeal . In the letters of Voltaire this thought has already found a more positive expression : @# " I am body , and I think ; more I do not know . Shall I then attribute to an unknown cause what I can so easily attribute to the only fruitful cause I am acquainted with ? In fact , where is the man who , without an absurd godlessness , dare assert that it is impossible for the Creator to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 @# Finally , Holbach , the great systematizer of this movement , takes the affair out of the hands of the Creator and definitively announces that " a sensitive soul is nothing but a human brain so constituted that it easily receives the motions communicated to it. " 251 : 17 @# This theory has been considerably tempered since the age of Holbach . Naturalism has latterly been less interested in identifying the soul with the body , and more interested in demonstrating its dependence upon specific bodily conditions , after the manner of La Mettrie . The so-called higher faculties , such as thought and will , have been related to central or cortical processes of the nervous system , processes of connection and complication which within the brain itself supplement the impulses and sensations congenitally and externally stimulated . The term " epiphenomenon " has been adopted to express the distinctness but entire dependence of the mind . Man is " a conscious automaton . " The real course of nature passes through his nervous system , while consciousness attends upon its functions like a shadow , present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Positivism and Agnosticism. @# Sect. 117 . Holbach ' s " Systeme de la Nature , " published in 1770 , marks the culmination of the unequivocally materialistic form of naturalism . Its epistemological difficulties , always more or less in evidence , have since that day sufficed to discredit materialism , and to foster the growth of a critical and apologetic form of naturalism known as positivism or agnosticism . The modesty of this doctrine does not , it is true , strike very deep . For , although it disclaims knowledge of ultimate reality , it also forbids anyone else to have any . Knowledge , it affirms , can be of but one type , that which comprises the verifiable laws governing nature . All questions concerning first causes are futile , a stimulus only to excursions of fancy popularly mistaken for knowledge . The superior certainty and stability which attaches to natural science is to be permanently secured by the savant ' s steadfast refusal to be led away after the false gods of metaphysics. @# But though this is sufficient ground for an agnostic policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sprung from a closer analysis of knowledge , though it fails to make a very brave showing for thoroughness and consistency . The crucial point has already been brought within our view . The general principles of naturalism require that knowledge shall be reduced to sensations , or impressions of the environment upon the organism . But the environment and the sensations do not correspond . The environment is matter and motion , force and energy ; the sensations are of motions , to be sure , but much more conspicuously of colors , sounds , odors , pleasures , and pains . Critically , this may be expressed by saying that since the larger part of sense-perception is so unmistakably subjective , and since all knowledge alike must be derived from this source , knowledge as a whole must be regarded as dealing only with appearances . There are at least three agnostic methods progressing from this point . All agree that the inner or essential reality is unfathomable . But , in the first place , those most close to the tradition of materialism maintain that the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compose a purely quantitative and corporeal world . The inner essence of things may at any rate be approached by a monism of matter or of energy . This theory is epistemological only to the extent of moderating its claims in the hope of lessening its responsibility . Another agnosticism places all sense qualities on a par , but would regard physics and psychology as complementary reports upon the two distinct series of phenomena in which the underlying reality expresses itself . This theory is epistemological to the extent of granting knowledge , viewed as perception , as good a standing in the universe as that which is accorded to its object . But such a dualism tends almost irresistibly to relapse into materialistic monism , because of the fundamental place of physical conceptions in the system of the sciences . Finally , in another and a more radical phase of agnosticism , we find an attempt to make full provision for the legitimate problems of epistemology . The only datum , the only existent accessible to knowledge , is said to be the sensation , or state of consciousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , do we know of this terrible ' matter ' except as a name for the unknown and hypothetical cause of states of our own consciousness ? And what do we know of that ' spirit ' over whose threatened extinction by matter a great lamentation is arising , . . . except that it is also a name for an unknown and hypothetical cause , or condition , of states of consciousness ? " 255 : 19 @# The physical world is now to be regarded as a construction which does not assimilate to itself the content of sensations , but enables one to anticipate them . The sensation signifies a contact to which science can provide a key for practical guidance. @# Sidenote : Experimentalism. @# Sect. 118 . This last phase of naturalism is an attempt to state a pure and consistent experimentalism , a workable theory of the routine of sensations . But it commonly falls into the error of the vicious circle . The hypothetical cause of sensations is said to be matter . From this point of view the sensation is a complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes themselves , on the other hand , are said to be analyzable into sensations . Now two such methods of analysis can not be equally ultimate . If all of reality is finally reducible to sensations , then the term sensation must be used in a new sense to connote a self-subsistent being , and can no longer refer merely to a function of certain physiological processes . The issue of this would be some form of idealism or of the experience-philosophy that is now coming so rapidly to the front. 256 : 20 But while it is true that idealism has sometimes been intended , and that a radically new philosophy of experience has sometimes been closely approached , those , nevertheless , who have developed experimentalism from the naturalistic stand-point have in reality achieved only a thinly disguised materialism . For the very ground of their agnosticism is materialistic. 256 : 21 Knowledge of reality itself is said to be unattainable , because knowledge , in order to come within the order of nature , must be regarded as reducible to sensation ; and because sensation itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physiological process , a special phenomenon , in no way qualified to be knowledge that is true of reality. @# Sidenote : Naturalistic Epistemology not Systematic. @# Sect. 119 . Perhaps , after all , it would be as fair to the spirit of naturalism to relieve it of responsibility for an epistemology . It has never thoroughly reckoned with this problem . It has deliberately selected from among the elements of experience , and been so highly constructive in its method as to forfeit its claim to pure empiricism ; and , on the other hand , has , in this same selection of categories and in its insistence upon the test of experiment , fallen short of a thorough-going rationalism . While , on the one hand , it defines and constructs , it does so , on the other hand , within the field of perception and with constant reference to the test of perception . The explanation and justification of this procedure is to be found in the aim of natural science rather than in that of philosophy . It is this special interest , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of its categories . Naturalism as an account of reality is acceptable only so far as its success in satisfying specific demands obtains for it a certain logical immunity . These demands are unquestionably valid and fundamental , but they are not coextensive with the demand for truth . They coincide rather with the immediate practical need of a formulation of the spacial and temporal changes that confront the will . Hence naturalism is acceptable to common-sense as an account of what the every-day attitude to the environment treats as its object . Naturalism is common-sense about the " outer world , " revised and brought up to date with the aid of the results of science . Its deepest spring is the organic instinct for the reality of the tangible , the vital recognition of the significance of that which is on the plane of interaction with the body. @# * * * * * @# Sidenote : General Ethical Stand-point. @# Sect. 120 .

It is recognized as the prophecy of the brute majority of life , of those considerations of expediency and pleasure that are the warrant for its secular moods rather than for its sustaining ideals .

For the naturalistic method of reduction must find the key to human action among those practical conditions that are common to man and his inferiors in the scale of being . In short , human life , like all life , must be construed as the adjustment of the organism to its natural environment for the sake of preservation and economic advancement. @# Sidenote : Cynicism and Cyrenaicism. @# Sect. 121 . Early in Greek philosophy this general idea of life was picturesquely interpreted in two contrasting ways , those of the Cynic and the Cyrenaic . Both of these wise men postulated the spiritual indifference of the universe at large , and looked only to the contact of life with its immediate environment . But while the one hoped only to hedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sensibilities . The figure of the Cynic is the more familiar . Diogenes of the tub practised self-mortification until his dermal and spiritual callousness were alike impervious . From behind his protective sheath he could without affectation despise both nature and society . He could reckon himself more blessed than Alexander , because , with demand reduced to the minimum , he could be sure of a surplus of supply . Having renounced all goods save the bare necessities of life , he could neglect both promises and threats and be played upon by no one . He was securely intrenched within himself , an unfurnished habitation , but the citadel of a king . The Cyrenaic , on the other hand , did not seek to make impervious the surface of contact with nature and society , but sought to heighten its sensibility , that it might become a medium of pleasurable feeling . For the inspiration with which it may be pursued this ideal has nowhere been more eloquently set forth than in the pages of Walter Pater , who styles himself " the new Cyrenaic.

In the course of modern philosophy the ethics of naturalism has undergone a transformation and development that equip it much more formidably for its competition with rival theories . If the Cynic and Cyrenaic philosophies of life seem too egoistic and narrow in outlook , this inadequacy has been largely overcome through the modern conception of the relation of the individual to society . Man is regarded as so dependent upon social relations that it is both natural and rational for him to govern his actions with a concern for the community . There was a time when this relation of dependence was viewed as external , a barter of goods between the individual and society , sanctioned by an implied contract . Thomas Hobbes , whose unblushing materialism and egoism stimulated by opposition the whole development of English ethics , conceived morality to consist in rules of action which condition the stability of the state , and so secure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential to his welfare. @# " And therefore so long a man is in the condition of mere nature , which is a condition of war , as private appetite is the measure of good and evil : and consequently all men agree on this , that peace is good , and therefore also the ways or means of peace , which , as I have showed before , are ' justice , ' ' gratitude , ' ' modesty , ' ' equity , ' ' mercy , ' and the rest of the laws of Nature , are good ; that is to say , ' moral virtues ' ; and their contrary ' vices , ' evil.

This latest word of naturalistic ethics has not won acceptance as the last word in ethics , and this in spite of its indubitable truth within its scope .

Indeed , naturalism shows here , as in the realm of epistemology , a persistent failure to appreciate the central problem . Its acceptance as a philosophy , we are again reminded , can be accounted for only on the score of its genuinely rudimentary character . As a rudimentary phase of thought it is both indispensable and inadequate . It is the philosophy of instinct , which should in normal development precede a philosophy of reason , in which it is eventually assimilated and supplemented. @# Sidenote : Naturalism as Antagonistic to Religion. @# Sect. 124 .

When , in the year 1710 , Bishop Berkeley maintained the thesis of empirical idealism , having rediscovered it and announced it with a justifiable sense of originality , he provoked a kind of critical judgment that was keenly annoying if not entirely surprising to him . In refuting the conception of material substance and demonstrating the dependence of being upon mind , he at once sought , as he did repeatedly in later years , to establish the world of practical belief , and so to reconcile metaphysics and common-sense . Yet he found himself hailed as a fool and a sceptic . In answer to an inquiry concerning the reception of his book in London , his friend Sir John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name the subject matter of your book of Principles to some ingenious friends of mine and they immediately treated it with ridicule , at the same time refusing to read it , which I have not yet got one to do . A physician of my acquaintance undertook to discover your person , and argued you must needs be mad , and that you ought to take remedies . A bishop pitied you , that a desire of starting something new should put you upon such an undertaking . Another told me that you are not gone so far as another gentleman in town , who asserts not only that there is no such thing as Matter , but that we ourselves have no being at all. " 268 : 2 @# There can be no doubt but that the idea of the dependence of real things upon their appearance to the individual is a paradox to common-sense . It is a paradox because it seems to reverse the theoretical instinct itself , and to define the real in those very terms which disciplined thought learns to neglect . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is recognized as that which is likely to distort truth rather than that which conditions it . When the wise man , the devotee of truth , first makes his appearance , his authority is acknowledged because he has renounced himself . As witness of the universal being he purges himself of whatever is peculiar to his own individuality , or even to his human nature . In the aloofness of his meditation he escapes the cloud of opinion and prejudice that obscures the vision of the common man . In short , the element of belief dependent upon the thinker himself is the dross which must be refined away in order to obtain the pure truth . When , then , in the critical epoch of the Greek sophists , Protagoras declares that there is no belief that is not of this character , his philosophy is promptly recognized as scepticism . Protagoras argues that sense qualities are clearly dependent upon the actual operations of the senses , and that all knowledge reduces ultimately to these terms. @# " The senses are variously named hearing , seeing , smelling ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pain , desire , fear , and many more which are named , as well as innumerable others which have no name ; with each of them there is born an object of sense ,  --  all sorts of colors born with all sorts of sight and sounds in like manner with hearing , and other objects with the other senses. " 269 : 3 @# If the objects are " born with " the senses , it follows that they are born with and appertain to the individual perceiver. @# " Either show , if you can , that our sensations are not relative and individual , or , if you admit that they are individual , prove that this does not involve the consequence that the appearance becomes , or , if you like to say , is to the individual only. " 270 : 4 @# The same motif is thus rendered by Walter Pater in the Conclusion of his " Renaissance " : @# " At first sight experience seems to bury us under a flood of external objects , pressing upon us with a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand forms of action . But when reflexion begins to act upon those objects they are dissipated under its influence ; the cohesive force seems suspended like a trick of magic ; each object is loosed into a group of impressions  --  color , odor , texture  --  in the mind of the observer . . . . Experience , already reduced to a swarm of impressions , is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced on its way to us , or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be without . Every one of these impressions is the impression of the individual in his isolation , each mind keeping as a solitary prisoner its own dream of a world. " @# The Protagorean generalization is due to the reflection that all experience is some individual experience , that no subject of discourse escapes the imputation of belonging to some individual ' s private history . The individual must start with his own experiences and ideas , and he can never get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own vision , or even think outside his own mind . The scepticism of this theory is explicit , and the formulas of Protagoras  --  the famous " Man is the measure of all things , " and the more exact formula , " The truth is what appears to each man at each time " 271 : 5  --  have been the articles of scepticism throughout the history of thought. @# Sidenote : Phenomenalism and Spiritualism. @# Sect. 127 . There is , therefore , nothing really surprising in the reception accorded the " new philosophy " of Bishop Berkeley . A sceptical relativism is the earliest phase of subjectivism , and its avoidance at once becomes the most urgent problem of any philosophy which proposes to proceed forth from this principle . And this problem Berkeley meets with great adroitness and a wise recognition of difficulties . But his sanguine temperament and speculative interest impel him to what he regards as the extension of his first principle , the reintroduction of the conception of substance under the form of spirit , and of the objective order of nature under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are two motives at work in him , side by side : the epistemological motive , restricting reality to perceptions and thoughts , and the metaphysical-religious motive , leading him eventually to the definition of reality in terms of perceiving and thinking spirits . And from the time of Berkeley these two principles , phenomenalism and spiritualism , have remained as distinct and alternating phases of subjectivism . The former is its critical and dialectical conception , the latter its constructive and practical conception. @# Sidenote : Phenomenalism as Maintained by Berkeley . The Problem Inherited from Descartes and Locke. @# Sect. 128 . As phenomenalism has its classic statement and proof in the writings of Berkeley , we shall do well to return to these . The fact that this philosopher wished to be regarded as the prophet of common-sense has already been mentioned . This purpose reveals itself explicitly in the series of " Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous . " The form in which Berkeley here advances his thesis is further determined by the manner in which the lines were drawn in his day of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consisting of God , physical nature , and the soul . In the early years of the seventeenth century Descartes had sharply distinguished between the two substances  --  mind , with its attribute of thought ; and body , with its attribute of extension  --  and divided the finite world between them . God was regarded as the infinite and sustaining cause of both . Stated in the terms of epistemology , the object of clear thinking is the physical cosmos , the subject of clear thinking the immortal soul . The realm of perception , wherein the mind is subjected to the body , embarrasses the Cartesian system , and has no clear title to any place in it . And without attaching cognitive importance to this realm , the system is utterly dogmatic in its epistemology. 273 : 6 For what one substance thinks , must be assumed to be somehow true of another quite independent substance without any medium of communication . Now between Descartes and Berkeley appeared the sober and questioning " Essay Concerning Human Understanding , " by John Locke . This is an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traditional metaphysics and revolutionary epistemology . The universe still consists of God , the immortal thinking soul , and a corporeal nature , the object of its thought . But , except for certain proofs of God and self , knowledge is entirely reduced to the perceptual type , to sensations , or ideas directly imparted to the mind by the objects themselves . To escape dogmatism it is maintained that the real is what is observed to be present . But Locke thinks the qualities so discovered belong in part to the perceiver and in part to the substance outside the mind . Color is a case of the former , a " secondary quality " ; and extension a case of the latter , a " primary quality . " And evidently the above empirical test of knowledge is not equally well met in these two cases . When I see a red object I know that red exists , for it is observed to be present , and I make no claim for it beyond the present . But when I note that the red object is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to exist in the object after I have closed my eyes or turned to something else . Here my claim exceeds my observation , and the empirical principle adopted at the outset would seem to be violated . Berkeley develops his philosophy from this criticism . His refutation of material substance is intended as a full acceptance of the implications of the new empirical epistemology . Knowledge is to be all of the perceptual type , where what is known is directly presented ; and , in conformity with this principle , being is to be restricted to the content of the living pulses of experience. @# Sidenote : The Refutation of Material Substance. @# Sect. 129 . Berkeley , then , beginning with the threefold world of Descartes and of common-sense , proposes to apply Locke ' s theory of knowledge to the discomfiture of corporeal nature . It was a radical doctrine , because it meant for him and for his contemporaries the denial of all finite objects outside the mind . But at the same time it meant a restoration of the homogeneity of experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so had its basis of appeal to common-sense . The encounter between Hylas , the advocate of the traditional philosophy , and Philonous , who represents the author himself , begins with an exchange of the charge of innovation. @# Hyl . I am glad to find there was nothing in the accounts I heard of you. @# Phil . Pray , what were those ? @# Hyl . You were represented , in last night ' s conversation , as one who maintained the most extravagant opinion that ever entered into the mind of man , to wit , that there is no such thing as material substance in the world. @# Phil . That there is no such thing as what philosophers call material substance , I am seriously persuaded : but if I were made to see anything absurd or sceptical in this , I should then have the same reason to renounce this that I imagine I have now to reject the contrary opinion. @# Hyl . What ! can anything be more fantastical , more repugnant to Common-Sense , or a more manifest piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as matter ? @# Phil . Softly , good Hylas . What if it should prove that you , who hold there is , are , by virtue of that opinion , a greater sceptic , and maintain more paradoxes and repugnances to Common-Sense , than I who believe no such thing ? 276 : 7 @# Philonous now proceeds with his case . Beginning by obtaining from Hylas the admission that pleasure and pain are essentially relative and subjective , he argues that sensations such as heat , since they are inseparable from these feelings , must be similarly regarded . And he is about to annex other qualities in turn to this core of subjectivity , when Hylas enters a general demurrer : @# " Hold , Philonous , I now see what it was deluded me all this time . You asked me whether heat and cold , sweetness and bitterness , were not particular sorts of pleasure and pain ; to which I answered simply that they were . Whereas I should have thus distinguished :  --  those qualities as perceived by us , are pleasures or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must not therefore conclude absolutely , that there is no heat in the fire , or sweetness in the sugar , but only that heat or sweetness , as perceived by us , are not in the fire or sugar. " 276 : 8 @# Sidenote : The Application of the Epistemological Principle. @# Sect. 130 . Here the argument touches upon profound issues . Philonous now assumes the extreme empirical contention that knowledge applies only to its own psychological moment , that its object in no way extends beyond that individual situation which we call the state of knowing . The full import of such an epistemology Berkeley never recognized , but he is clearly employing it here , and the overthrow of Hylas is inevitable so long as he does not challenge it or turn it against his opponent . This , however , as a protagonist of Berkeley ' s own making , he fails to do , and he plays into Philonous ' s hands by admitting that what is known only in perception must for that reason consist in perception . He frankly owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that " colors , sounds , tastes , in a word , all those termed secondary qualities , have certainly no existence without the mind. " 277 : 9 @# Hylas has now arrived at the distinction between primary and secondary qualities . " Extension , Figure , Solidity , Gravity , Motion , and Rest " are the attributes of an external substance which is the cause of sensations . But the same epistemological principle readily reduces these also to dependence on mind , for , like the secondary qualities , their content is given only in perception . Hylas is then driven to defend a general material substratum , which is the cause of ideas , but to which none of the definite content of these ideas can be attributed . In short , he has put all the content of knowledge on the one side , and admitted its inseparability from the perceiving spirit , and left the being of things standing empty and forlorn on the other . This amounts , as Philonous reminds him , to the denial of the reality of the known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forced to deny the reality of sensible things ; since you made it to consist in an absolute existence exterior to the mind . That is to say , you are a downright sceptic . So I have gained my point , which was to show your principles led to Scepticism. " 278 : 10 @# Sidenote : The Refutation of a Conceived Corporeal World. @# Sect. 131 . Having advanced the direct empiricist argument for phenomenalism , Berkeley now gives the rationalistic motive an opportunity to express itself in the queries of Hylas as to whether there be not an " absolute extension , " somehow abstracted by thought from the relativities of perception . Is there not at least a conceivable world independent of perception ? @# The answers of Philonous throw much light upon the Berkeleyan position . He admits that thought is capable of separating the primary from the secondary qualities in certain operations , but at the same time denies that this is forming an idea of them as separate. @# " I acknowledge , Hylas , it is not difficult to form general propositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , in this sense , to consider or treat of them abstractedly . But , how doth it follow that , because I can pronounce the word motion by itself , I can form the idea of it in my mind exclusive of body ? or , because theorems may be made of extension and figures , without any mention of great or small , or any other sensible mode or quality , that therefore it is possible such an abstract idea of extension , without any particular size or figure , or sensible quality , should be distinctly formed , and apprehended by the mind ? Mathematicians treat of quantity , without regarding what other sensible qualities it is attended with , as being altogether indifferent to their demonstrations . But , when laying aside the words , they contemplate the bare ideas , I believe you will find , they are not the pure abstracted ideas of extension. " 279 : 11 @# Berkeley denies that we have ideas of pure extension or motion , because , although we do actually deal with these and find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they appear as the content . He applies this psychological test because of his adherence to the general empirical postulate that knowledge is limited to the individual content of its own individual states . " It is a universally received maxim , " he says , " that everything which exists is particular . " Now the truth of mathematical reckoning is not particular , but is valid wherever the conditions to which it refers are fulfilled . Mathematical reckoning , if it is to be particular , must be regarded as a particular act or state of some thinker . Its truth must then be construed as relative to the interests of the thinker , as a symbolism which has an instrumental rather than a purely cognitive value . This conclusion can not be disputed short of a radical stand against the general epistemological principle to which Berkeley is so far true , the principle that the reality which is known in any state of thinking or perceiving is the state itself. @# Sidenote : The Transition to Spiritualism. @# Sect. 132 . This concludes the purely phenomenalistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate apprehension of sensible objects in a state of mind centring about the pleasure and pain of an individual , to be the norm of knowledge . He has further maintained that knowledge can not escape the particularity of its own states . The result is that the universe is composed of private perceptions and ideas . Strictly on the basis of what has preceded , Hylas is justified in regarding this conclusion as no less sceptical than that to which his own position had been reduced ; for while he had been compelled to admit that the real is unknowable , Philonous has apparently defined the knowable as relative to the individual . But the supplementary metaphysics which had hitherto been kept in the background is now revealed . It is maintained that though perceptions know no external world , they do nevertheless reveal a spiritual substance of which they are the states . Although it has hitherto been argued that the esse of things is in their percipi , this is now replaced by the more fundamental principle that the esse of things is in their percipere or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in perceivers. @# Sidenote : Further Attempts to Maintain Phenomenalism. @# Sect. 133 . Now it is at once evident that the epistemological theory which has been Berkeley ' s dialectical weapon in the foregoing argument is no longer available . And those who have cared more for this theory than for metaphysical speculation have attempted to stop at this point , and so to construe phenomenalism as to make it self-sufficient on its own grounds . Such attempts are so instructive as to make it worth our while to review them before proceeding with the development of the spiritualistic motive in subjectivism. @# The world is to be regarded as made up of sense-perceptions , ideas , or phenomena . What is to be accepted as the fundamental category which gives to all of these terms their subjectivistic significance ? So far there seems to be nothing in view save the principle of relativity . The type to which these were reduced was that of the peculiar or unsharable experience best represented by an individual ' s pleasure and pain . But relativity will not work as a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private mind , and can not provide for the validity of knowledge enough even to maintain itself . Some other course , then , must be followed . Perception may be given a psycho-physical definition , which employs physical terms as fundamental ; 282 : 12 but this flagrantly contradicts the phenomenalistic first principle . Or , reality may be regarded as so stamped with its marks as to insure the proprietorship of thought . But this definition of certain objective entities of mind , of beings attributed to intelligence because of their intrinsic intelligibility , is inconsistent with empiricism , if indeed it does not lead eventually to a realism of the Platonic type. 283 : 13 Finally , and most commonly , the terms of phenomenalism have been retained after their original meaning has been suffered to lapse . The " impressions " of Hume , e. g. , are the remnant of the Berkeleyan world with the spirit stricken out . There is no longer any point in calling them impressions , for they now mean only elements or qualities . As a consequence this outgrowth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience. 283 : 14 Any one , then , of these three may be the last state of one who undertakes to remain exclusively faithful to the phenomenalistic aspect of Berkeleyanism , embodied in the principle esse est percipi. @# Sidenote : Berkeley ' s Spiritualism . Immediate Knowledge of the Perceiver. @# Sect. 134 . Let us now follow the fortunes of the other phase of subjectivism  --  that which develops the conception of the perceiver rather than the perceived . When Berkeley holds that @# " all the choir of heaven and furniture of the Earth , in a word , all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world , have not any subsistence without a Mind , " @# his thought has transcended the epistemology with which he overthrew the conception of material substance , in two directions . For neither mind of the finite type nor mind of the divine type is perceived . But the first of these may yet be regarded as a direct empirical datum , even though sharply distinguished from an object of perception . In the third dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# " I own I have properly no idea , either of God or any other spirit ; for these being active , can not be represented by things perfectly inert , as our ideas are . I do nevertheless know that I , who am a spirit or thinking substance , exist as certainly as I know my ideas exist . Farther , I know what I mean by the terms I and myself ; and I know this immediately or intuitively , though I do not perceive it as I perceive a triangle , a color , or a sound. " 284 : 15 @# The knowledge here provided for may be regarded as empirical because the reality in question is an individual present in the moment of the knowledge . Particular acts of perception are said directly to reveal not only perceptual objects , but perceiving subjects . And the conception of spiritual substance , once accredited , may then be extended to account for social relations and to fill in the nature of God . The latter extension , in so far as it attributes such further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epistemology , and threatens to pass over into rationalism . But the knowledge of one ' s fellow-men may , it is claimed , be regarded as immediate , like the knowledge of one ' s self . Perceptual and volitional activity has a sense for itself and also a sense for other like activity . The self is both self-conscious and socially conscious in an immediate experience of the same type. @# Sidenote : Schopenhauer ' s Spiritualism , or Voluntarism . Immediate Knowledge of the Will. @# Sect. 135 . But this general spiritualistic conception is developed with less singleness of purpose in Berkeley than among the voluntarists and panpsychists who spring from Schopenhauer , the orientalist , pessimist , and mystic among the German Kantians of the early nineteenth century . His great book , " Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung , " opens with the phenomenalistic contention that " the world is my idea . " It soon appears , however , that the " my " is more profoundly significant than the " idea . " Nature is my creation , due to the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as space , time , and causality . But nature , just because it is my creation , is less than me : is but a manifestation of the true being for which I must look within myself . But this inner self can not be made an object of thought , for that would be only to create another term of nature . The will itself , from which such creation springs , is " that which is most immediate " in one ' s consciousness , and " makes itself known in a direct manner in its particular acts . " The term will is used by Schopenhauer as a general term covering the whole dynamics of life , instinct and desire , as well as volition . It is that sense of life-preserving and life-enhancing appetency which is the conscious accompaniment of struggle . With its aid the inwardness of the whole world may now be apprehended. @# " Whoever has now gained from all these expositions a knowledge in abstracto , and therefore clear and certain , of what everyone knows directly in concreto , i. e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real inner nature of his phenomenal being , . . . and that his will is that which is most immediate in his consciousness , . . . will find that of itself it affords him the key to the knowledge of the inmost being of the whole of nature ; for he now transfers it to all those phenomena which are not given to him , like his own phenomenal existence , both in direct and indirect knowledge , but only in the latter , thus merely one-sidedly as idea alone. " 287 : 16 @# The heart of reality is thus known by an " intuitive interpretation , " which begins at home in the individual ' s own heart. @# Sidenote : Panpsychism. @# Sect. 136 . The panpsychist follows the same course of reflection . There is an outwardness and an inwardness of nature , corresponding to the knower ' s body on the one hand , and his feeling or will on the other . With this principle in hand one may pass down the whole scale of being and discover no breach of continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth by a contemporary writer , who quotes the following from the botanist , C. v. Naegeli : @# " Sensation is clearly connected with the reflex actions of higher animals . We are obliged to concede it to the other animals also , and we have no grounds for denying it to plants and inorganic bodies . The sensation arouses in us a condition of comfort and discomfort . In general , the feeling of pleasure arises when the natural impulses are satisfied , the feeling of pain when they are not satisfied . Since all material processes are composed of movements of molecules and elementary atoms , pleasure and pain must have their seat in these particles . . . . Thus the same mental thread runs through all material phenomena . The human mind is nothing but the highest development on our earth of the mental processes which universally animate and move nature. " 288 : 17 @# According to panpsychism , then , physical nature is the manifestation of an appetency or bare consciousness generalized from the thinker ' s awareness of his most intimate self . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of that which appears as physical nature. @# Sidenote : The Inherent Difficulty in Spiritualism . No Provision for Objective Knowledge. @# Sect. 137 . We must now turn to the efforts which this doctrine has made to maintain itself against the sceptical trend of its own epistemology . For precisely as in the case of phenomenalism its dialectical principle threatens to be self-destructive . Immediate presence is still the test of knowledge . But does not immediate presence connote relativity and inadequacy , at best ; an initial phase of knowledge that must be supplemented and corrected before objective reality and valid truth are apprehended ? Does not the individuality of the individual thinker connote the very maximum of error ? Indeed , spiritualism would seem to have exceeded even Protagoreanism itself , and to have passed from scepticism to deliberate nihilism . The object of knowledge is no longer even , as with the phenomenalist , the thinker ' s thought , but only his thinking . And if the thinker ' s thought is relative to him , then the thinker ' s act of thinking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negating relation . How is a real , a self-subsistent world to be composed of such ? Impelled by a half-conscious realization of the hopelessness of this situation , the exponent of spiritualism has sought to universalize his conception ; to define an absolute or ultimate spirit other than the individual thinker , though known in and through him . But it is clear that this development of spiritualism , like all of the speculative procedure of subjectivism , threatens to exceed the scope of the original principle of knowledge . There is a strong presumption against the possibility of introducing a knowledge of God by the way of the particular presentations of an individual consciousness. @# Sidenote : Schopenhauer ' s Attempt to Universalize Subjectivism . Mysticism. @# Sect. 138 . Schopenhauer must be credited with a genuine effort to accept the metaphysical consequences of his epistemology . His epistemology , as we have seen , defined knowledge as centripetal . The object of real knowledge is identical with the subject of knowledge . If I am to know the universal will , therefore , I must in knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innermost heart of the individual into which he may retreat , even from his private will , is  --  the universal . But there is another way of arriving at the same knowledge . In contemplation I may become absorbed in principles and laws , rather than be diverted by the particular spacial and temporal objects , until ( and this is peculiarly true of the aesthetic experience ) my interest no longer distinguishes itself , but coincides with truth . In other words , abstract thinking and pure willing are not opposite extremes , but adjacent points on the deeper or transcendent circle of experience . One may reach this part of the circle by moving in either of two directions that at the start are directly opposite : by turning in upon the subject or by utterly giving one ' s self up to the object . Reality obtains no definition by this means . Philosophy , for Schopenhauer , is rather a programme for realizing the state in which I will the universal and know the universal will . The final theory of knowledge , then , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , direct and vivid , like perception , and at the same time universal , like thought . But the empiricism with which Schopenhauer began , the appeal to a familiar experience of self as will , has meanwhile been forgotten . The idea as object of my perception , and the will as its subject were in the beginning regarded as common and verifiable items of experience . But who , save the occasional philosopher , knows a universal will ? Nor have attempts to avoid mysticism , while retaining Schopenhauer ' s first principle , been successful . Certain voluntarists and panpsychists have attempted to do without the universal will , and define the world solely in terms of the many individual wills . But , as Schopenhauer himself pointed out , individual wills can not be distinguished except in terms of something other than will , such as space and time . The same is true if for will there be substituted inner feeling or consciousness . Within this category individuals can be distinguished only as points of view , which to be comparable at all must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of relations like that of the physical world or that of an ethical community . The conception of pure will or pure feeling inevitably attaches to itself that of an undivided unity , if for no other reason because there is no ground for distinction . And such a unity , a will or consciousness that is no particular act or idea , can be known only in the unique experience which mysticism provides. @# Sidenote : Objective Spiritualism. @# Sect. 139 . The way of Schopenhauer is the way of one who adheres to the belief that what the thinker knows must always be a part of himself , his state or his activity . From this point of view the important element of being , its very essence or substance , is not any definable nature but an immediate relation to the knower . The consequence is that the universe in the last analysis can only be defined as a supreme state or activity into which the individual ' s consciousness may develop . Spiritualism has , however , other interests , interests which may be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of being which it defines as spiritual , and in terms of which it proposes to define the universe . Such procedure is radically different from the epistemological criticism which led Berkeley to maintain that the esse of objects is in their percipi , or Schopenhauer to maintain that " the world is my idea , " or that led both of these philosophers to find a deeper reality in immediately intuited self-activity . For now it is proposed to understand spirit , discover its properties , and to acknowledge it only where these properties appear . I may now know spirit as an object ; which in its properties , to be sure , is quite different from matter , but which like matter is capable of subsisting quite independently of my knowledge . This is a metaphysical spiritualism quite distinct from epistemological spiritualism , and by no means easily made consistent therewith . Indeed , it exhibits an almost irrepressible tendency to overstep the bounds both of empiricism and subjectivism , an historical connection with which alone justifies its introduction in the present chapter. @# Sidenote : Berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order. @# Sect. 140 . To return again to the instructive example of Bishop Berkeley , we find him proving God from the evidence of him in experience , or the need of him to support the claims of experience. @# " But , whatever power I may have over my own thoughts , I find the ideas actually perceived by Sense have not a like dependence on my will . When in broad daylight I open my eyes , it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no , or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view : and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses ; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will . There is therefore some other Will or Spirit that produces them. @# The ideas of Sense are more strong , lively , and distinct than those of the Imagination ; they have likewise a steadiness , order , and coherence , and are not excited at random , as those which are the effects of human wills often are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection whereof sufficiently testifies the wisdom and benevolence of its Author . Now the set rules , or established methods , wherein the Mind we depend on excites in us the ideas of Sense , are called the laws of nature. " 294 : 18 @# Of the attributes of experience here in question , independence or " steadiness " is not regarded as prima facie evidence of spirit , but rather as an aspect of experience for which some cause is necessary . But it is assumed that the power to " produce , " with which such a cause must be endowed , is the peculiar prerogative of spirit , and that this cause gives further evidence of its spiritual nature , of its eminently spiritual nature , in the orderliness and the goodness of its effects. @# " The force that produces , the intellect that orders , the goodness that perfects all things is the Supreme Being. " 294 : 19 @# That spirit is possessed of causal efficacy , Berkeley has in an earlier passage proved by a direct appeal to the individual ' s sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mind at pleasure , and vary and shift the scene as oft as I think fit . It is no more than willing , and straightway this or that idea arises in my fancy ; and by the same power it is obliterated and makes way for another . This making and unmaking of ideas doth very properly denominate the mind active . Thus much is certain and grounded on experience : but when we talk of unthinking agents , or of exciting ideas exclusive of volition , we only amuse ourselves with words. " 295 : 20 @# Although Berkeley is here in general agreement with a very considerable variety of philosophical views , it will be readily observed that this doctrine tends to lapse into mysticism whenever it is retained in its purity . Berkeley himself admitted that there was no " idea " of such power . And philosophers will as a rule either obtain an idea corresponding to a term or amend the term  --  always excepting the mystical appeal to an inarticulate and indefinable experience . Hence pure power revealed in an ineffable immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some definite meaning may be attached . The energy of physics , defined by measurable quantitative equivalence , is a case in point . The idealistic trend is in another direction , power coming to signify ethical or logical connection . Similarly , in the later philosophy of Berkeley himself , God is known by the nature of his activity rather than by the fact of his activity ; and we are said " to account for a thing , when we show that it is so best . " God ' s power , in short , becomes indistinguishable from his universality attended with the attributes of goodness and orderliness . But this means that the analogy of the human spirit , conscious of its own activity , is no longer the basis of the argument . By the divine will is now meant ethical principles , rather than the " here am I willing " of the empirical consciousness . Similarly the divine mind is defined in terms of logical principles , such as coherence and order , rather than in terms of the " here am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been said to make it plain that this is no longer the stand-point of empirio-idealism . Indeed , in his last philosophical writing , the " Siris , " Berkeley is so far removed from the principles of knowledge which made him at once the disciple and the critic of Locke , as to pronounce himself the devotee of Platonism and the prophet of transcendentalism . The former strain appears in his conclusion that " the principles of science are neither objects of sense nor imagination ; and that intellect and reason are alone the sure guides to truth. " 297 : 21 His transcendentalism appears in his belief that such principles , participating in the vital unity of the Individual Purpose , constitute the meaning and so the substantial essence of the universe. @# Sidenote : The General Tendency of Subjectivism to Transcend Itself. @# Sect. 141 . Such then are the various paths which lead from subjectivism to other types of philosophy , demonstrating the peculiar aptitude of the former for departing from its first principle . Beginning with the relativity of all knowable reality to the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other of the terms of this relation , as particular state of knowledge or as individual subject of knowledge . But these terms develop an intrinsic nature of their own , and become respectively empirical datum , and logical or ethical principle . In either case the subjectivistic principle of knowledge has been abandoned . Those whose speculative interest in a definable objective world has been less strong than their attachment to this principle , have either accepted the imputation of scepticism , or had recourse to the radical epistemological doctrine of mysticism. @# Sidenote : Ethical Theories . Relativism. @# Sect. 142 . Since the essence of subjectivism is epistemological rather than metaphysical , its practical and religious implications are various . The ethical theories which are corollary to the tendencies expounded above , range from extreme egoism to a mystical universalism . The close connection between the former and relativism is evident , and the form of egoism most consistent with epistemological relativism is to be found among those same Sophists who first maintained this latter doctrine . If we may believe Plato , the Sophists sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the " Theaetetus , " Socrates is represented as speaking thus on behalf of Protagoras : @# " And I am far from saying that wisdom and the wise man have no existence ; but I say that the wise man is he who makes the evils which are and appear to a man , into goods which are and appear to him . . . . I say that they ( the wise men ) are the physicians of the human body , and the husbandmen of plants  --  for the husbandmen also take away the evil and disordered sensations of plants , and infuse into them good and healthy sensations as well as true ones ; and the wise and good rhetoricians make the good instead of the evil seem just to states ; for whatever appears to be just and fair to a state , while sanctioned by a state , is just and fair to it ; but the teacher of wisdom causes the good to take the place of the evil , both in appearance and in reality. " 299 : 22 @# As truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so good is indistinguishable from a particular seeming good . The supreme moral value according to this plan of life is the agreeable feeling tone of that dream world to which the individual is forever consigned . The possible perfection of an experience which is " reduced to a swarm of impressions , " and " ringed round " for each one of us by a " thick wall of personality " has been brilliantly depicted in the passage already quoted from Walter Pater , in whom the naturalistic and subjectivistic motives unite. 299 : 23 If all my experience is strictly my own , then my good must likewise be my own . And if all of my experience is valid only in its instants of immediacy , then my best good must likewise consist in some " exquisite passion , " or stirring of the senses. @# Sidenote : Pessimism and Self-denial. @# Sect. 143 . But for Schopenhauer the internal world opens out into the boundless and unfathomable sea of the universal will . If I retire from the world upon my own private feelings , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am asserting myself against the world . I should seek a sense of unison with a world whose deeper heart-beats I may learn to feel and adopt as the rhythm of my own . The folly of willing for one ' s private self is the ground of Schopenhauer ' s pessimism. @# " All willing arises from want , therefore from deficiency , and therefore from suffering . The satisfaction of a wish ends it ; yet for one wish that is satisfied there remain at least ten which are denied . Further , the desire lasts long , the demands are infinite ; the satisfaction is short and scantily measured out . But even the final satisfaction is itself only apparent ; every satisfied wish at once makes room for a new one , both are illusions ; the one is known to be so , the other not yet . No attained object of desire can give lasting satisfaction , but merely a fleeting gratification ; it is like the alms thrown to the beggar , that keeps him alive to-day that his misery may be prolonged till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus constantly stretched on the revolving wheel of Ixion , pours water into the sieve of the Danaids , is the ever-longing Tantalus. " 300 : 24 @# The escape from this torture and self-deception is possible through the same mystical experience , the same blending with the universe that conditions knowledge. @# Sidenote : The Ethics of Welfare. @# Sect. 144 . But though pleasant dreaming be the most consistent practical sequel to a subjectivistic epistemology , its individualism presents another basis for life with quite different possibilities of emphasis . It may develop into an aggressive egoism of the type represented by the sophist Thrasymachus , in his proclamation that " might is right , justice the interest of the stronger. " 301 : 25 But more commonly it is tempered by a conception of social interest , and serves as the champion of action against contemplation . The gospel of action is always individualistic . It requires of the individual a sense of his independence , and of the real virtue of his initiative . Hence those voluntarists who emphasize the many individual wills and decline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a universal , may be said to afford a direct justification of it . It is true that this practical realism threatens the tenability of an epistemological idealism , but the two have been united , and because of their common emphasis upon the individual such procedure is not entirely inconsequential . Friedrich Paulsen , whose panpsychism has already been cited , is an excellent case in point . The only good , he maintains , is " welfare , " the fulfilment of those natural desires which both distinguish the individual and signify his continuity with all grades of being. @# " The goal at which the will aims does not consist in a maximum of pleasurable feelings , but in the normal exercise of the vital functions for which the species is predisposed . In the case of man the mode of life is on the whole determined by the nature of the historical unity from which the individual evolves as a member . Here the objective content of life , after which the will strives , also enters into consciousness with the progressive evolution of presentation ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 302 : 26 @# Here , contrary to the teaching of Schopenhauer , the good consists in individual attainment , the extension and fulfilment of the distinct interests that arise from the common fund of nature . To be and to do to the uttermost , to realize the maximum from nature ' s investment in one ' s special capacities and powers  --  this is indeed the first principle of a morality of action. @# Sidenote : The Ethical Community. @# Sect. 145 . But a type of ethics still further removed from the initial relativism has been adopted and more or less successfully assimilated by subjectivistic philosophies . Accepting Berkeley ' s spirits , with their indefinite capacities , and likewise the stability of the ideal principles that underlie a God-administered world , and morality becomes the obedience which the individual renders to the law . The individual , free to act in his own right , cooperates with the purposes of the general spiritual community , whose laws are worthy of obedience though not coercive .

As for religion , at least two distinct practical appreciations of the universe have been historically associated with this chapter in philosophy . The one of these is the mysticism of Schopenhauer , the religious sequel to a universalistic voluntarism . Schopenhauer ' s ethics , his very philosophy , is religion . For the good and the true are alike attainable only through identification with the Absolute Will . This consummation of life , transcending practical and theoretical differences , engulfing and effacing all qualities and all values , is like the Nirvana of the Orient  --  a positive ideal only for one who has appraised the apparent world at its real value. @# " Rather do we freely acknowledge that what remains after the entire abolition of will is for all those who are still full of will certainly nothing ; but , conversely , to those in whom the will has turned and has denied itself , this our world , which is so real , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 304 : 27 @# Sidenote : The Religion of Individual Cooperation with God. @# Sect. 147 . From the union of the two motives of voluntarism and individualism springs another and a more familiar type of religion , that of cooperative spiritual endeavor . In the religion of Schopenhauer the soul must utterly lose itself for the sake of peace ; here the soul must persist in its own being and activity for the sake of the progressive goodness of the world . For Schopenhauer God is the universal solution , in which all motions cease and all differences disappear ; here God is the General of moral forces . The deeper and more significant universe is @# " a society of rational agents , acting under the eye of Providence , concurring in one design to promote the common benefit of the whole , and conforming their actions to the established laws and order of the Divine parental wisdom : wherein each particular agent shall not consider himself apart , but as the member of a great City , whose author and founder is God : in which the civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties of religion : and where everyone ' s true interest is combined with his duty.

To cooperate with his creation by the best and rightest response seems all he wants of us .

He thought beyond immediate practical problems , devoting himself to a profounder reflection , that could not but induce in him a sense of superior intellectual worth . The familiar was not binding upon him , for his thought was emancipated from routine and superficiality . Furthermore his intellectual courage and resolution did not permit him to indulge in triviality , doubt , or paradox . He sought his own with a faith that could not be denied . Even Heraclitus the Dark , who was also called " the Weeping Philosopher , " because he found at the very heart of nature that transiency which the philosophical mind seeks to escape , felt himself to be exalted as well as isolated by that insight . But this sentiment of personal aloofness led at once to a division of experience . He who knows truly belongs to another and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , there is a philosophical way of life , and a philosophical object . Since the philosopher and the common man do not see alike , the terms of their experience are incommensurable . In Parmenides the Eleatic this motive is most strikingly exhibited . There is a Way of Truth which diverges from the Way of Opinion . The philosopher walks the former way alone . And there is an object of truth , accessible only to one who takes this way of truth . Parmenides finds this object to be the content of pure affirmation. @# " One path only is left for us to speak of , namely , that It is . In it are very many tokens that what is , is uncreated and indestructible , alone , complete , immovable , and without end . Nor was it ever , nor will it be ; for now it is , all at once , a continuous one. " 308 : 2 @# The philosophy of Parmenides , commonly called the Eleatic Philosophy , is notable for this emergence of the pure concept of absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims to discover that which is , and so turns away from that which is not or that which ceases to be . The negative and transient aspects of experience only hinder him in his search for the eternal . It was the great Eleatic insight to realize that the outcome of thought is thus predetermined ; that the answer to philosophy is contained in the question of philosophy . The philosopher , in that he resolutely avoids all partiality , relativity , and superficiality , must affirm a complete , universal , and ultimate being as the very object of that perfect knowledge which he means to possess . This object is known in the history of these philosophies as the infinite or absolute. 309 : 3 @# Sidenote : The Eleatic Conception of Being. @# S//
