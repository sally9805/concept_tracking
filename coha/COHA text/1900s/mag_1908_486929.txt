To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION . SIR : Teachers of Latin in all Darts of the country are asking , through their various associations , for changes in the college entrance requirements . The contentions are two First , that the lack of uniformity in the work demanded by the col leges imposes an unnecessary burden on the schools , by compelling division of classes and increased labor of teachers , involving waste of energy and a resulting inefficiency in teaching Second , the large amount of prescribed literature leaves the schools little opportunity to develop courses of study suited to individual needs . For these two reasons the universities and colleges of America are petitioned , first , to establish uniform requirements for the college entrance examinations in Latin , expressed in identical terms ; second , to prescribe as a basis of the set examinations much smaller portions of the literature than are now prescribed by some institutions-testing the power to read the lan-guage by simple examination at sight , and thus leaving to the schools the choice of the major part of the reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that teachers of Latin are asking , first , for such uniformity and definiteness in requirements as teachers of English , after a long struggle , have actually secured ; and , second , such freedom in the choice of texts as many teachers of English are still endeavoring to secure . The contention that the lack of uniformity in Latin requirements is an unnecessary burden to the schools is sustained by an examination of our leading colleges . Of some twenty-five institutions , for example , no three have identical requirements , although some of them accept alternatives . Seven of these institutions test the required proficiency in grammar by examinations based on the second , third , and fourth speeches of Cicero against Catiline ; five , by examinations on both Cmsar and Cicero as wholes ; and two by a " thorough examination " on the first two books of the 2Eneid . Five of the colleges that make formal distinctions between the elementary and the advanced requirement include Cmsar and Cicero , but no poetry in the elementary requirement , while fifteen others include both Cicero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small matters : to the schools they spell confusion . In reply to the remonstrances of the preparatory schools , some of the colleges have specified alternatives which they are ready to accept in place of certain prescribed works But these alternative 's offer such manifold variations that they are not widely helpful . In an attempt to remedy the difficulties the Classical Association of New England adopted general resolutions . Acting upon these , the Classical Association of the Middle States and Maryland proposed the adoption of the following specific plan of entrance examinations ; ( 1 . ) The requirements for admission to college in Latin shall be : ( a ) a thorough knowledge of the forms and inflections of Latin ; ( b ) a thorough knowledge of the chief principles of Latin syntax , ( c ) a thorough knowledge of a vocabulary of 2,000 Latin words and their English equivalents , ( d ) the ability to scan the Latin hexameter ( 2 . ) The primary intent of entrance requirements in Latin shall be to test the candidate 's knowledge of Latin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that end the entrance examinations in Latin shall be divided into four parts . ( a ) Prose composition ( Latin writing in prose ) . This examination shall be in two parts : the first part shall consist of detached sentences requiring knowledge of Latin forms and exemplifying the principles of Latin syntax ; the second of a short passage of easy narrative , destined to test the ability of the candidate to ss rite Latin consecutively ; ( b ) a short passage of moderate difficulty from some Latin prose author , to be translated and explained at sight , ( c ) a short passage of moderate difficulty from some Latin poet , to be translated and explained at sight , ( d ) a special examination on a particular prescribed portion of Latin literature , of limited extent ( 1,500 lines , more or less , prose or verse ) , e g , " De Bello Galileo , " vif , azEneid iv or vi , This plan , or some modification of it , seems now likely to be accepted What has been done toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference to Latin , should now be undertaken with reference to other subjects , notably mathematics . A table exhibiting the algebra , requirements of seventeen universities and colleges- including Columbia , Cornell , and Princeton , as well as the leading colleges for men in New England-shows at a glance a wide diversity . Of the fifteen items presented in this table even greater variety No two are alike And the history of college entrance requirements gives abundant evidence for the assumption that most of the wide divergencies serve no worthy and generally recognized purpose , that they are whims-tolerated by college faculties from a pernicious sense of " departmental courtesy " The committee of twelve of the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools is now at work on the problem , and hopes soon to offer recommendations similar to those already adopted with reference to Latin That is to say , it hopes to secure an agreement , at least among New England colleges Not only are the schools much hampered by the present diversity of requirements The work of the College Entrance Examination Board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the large number of separate examinations-nowrendered necessary , the board is unable to devise a time-schedule confined to a reasonable number of days The requirements in Latin , for instance , make it necessary for some candidates to take no less than six or seven separate examinations requiring nearly ten hours of writing . The adoption of uniform requirements , or even the elimination of the apparently useless variations , would be a great aid to this important board . WILLIAM T FOSTER Brunswick , Me , November 27 FACTS AND FIGURES FROM SHAKES-PEARE . THE EDITOR OF THE NATION . SIR : While looking into Sidney Lee 's " Shakespeare and the Modern Stage " ( London , 1906 ) , my eye fell upon the following sentence ( p 116 ) : " Hamlet " is the longest of Shakespeare 's plays ; it reaches a total of over 3,900 lines . It is thus some 900 lines longer than " Antony and Cleopatra , " which or all Shakespeare 's plays most nearly ap-proaches its length In his " Life of Shakespeare " ( London , 1898 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Except " Antony and Cleopatra , " which exceeds it by 60 lines , the piece " Hamlet " is the longest of Shakespeare 's plays ; while the total length of Hamlet 's speeches far exceeds that of . . any other of his characters . On page 239 of the " Life " ' he says that " Macbeth " is " the shortest of all Shakespeare 's plays " , and on p 254 that " The Tempest " is the shortest except " Macbeth " and " The Two Gentlemen of Verona " All these statements are incorrect Personally I care ' very little for these statistics , but , in the course of the last forty years or so , I have found that many teachers , students , and critical readers of Shakespeare are interested in them ; and if the figures are printed at all they should be given accurately " Hamlet " is the longest play ( 3,930 lines ) , but " Antony and Cleopatra " ( 1,063 lines ) is not the next longest , ten , others coming between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , " Troilus and Cressida " ( 3,496 ) , " Henry IV. , " ' Part 2 ( 3,446 ) , " Coriolanus " ( 3,410 ) , " Henry V " ( 3,380 ) , " Cymbeline " ( 3,341 ) , " Lear " ( 3,336 ) , ' Othello " ( 3,317 ) , " Henry IV , " Part 1 , ( 3,177 ) , " Henry VI. , " Part 2 ( 3,161 ) , and " The Winter 's Tale " ( 3,074 ) On the other hand , " Macbeth " ( 2,109 lines ) is not the shortest by two plays : " The Comedy of Errors " ( 1,778 ) and " The Tempest " ( 2,065 ) " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " ( 2.180 ) comes next , while " The Two Gentlemen " ( 2,294 ) , which Mr Lee reckons as the third shortest , is the fifth The numbers , by the way , are those of the Globe edition , now taken as the standard for line-numbers by all the recent editors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lexicon , " Abbott 's " Grammar , " etc . ) . Mr Lee is correct in saying that Hamlet speaks more lines ( 1,569 ) than any other of Shakespeare 's characters ( that is , in a single play ) , and next come Richard III ( 1,161 ) , Iago ( 1,117 ) , and Henry V. ( 1,063 ) . Then follow Othello ( 888 ) , Coriolanus ( 886 ) , the Duke in " Measure for Measure " ( 880 ) , Timon ( 863 ) , and Antony in " Antony and Cleopatra " ( 829 ) These are all the characters , male or female , above 800 lines . Between 800 and 700 there are five male characters , between 700 and 600 , four males , betWeen 600 and 500 , seven males ; and between 500 and 400 , eleven males-including such important personages as Ulysses ( 488 ) , Benedick ( 474 ) , Henry VIII . ( 457 ) , Wolsey ( 436 ) , and King John ( 435 ) . Among those below the 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( 379 ) , Shylock ( 364 ) , Orlando ( 322 ) , and Malvolio ( 306 ) Hamlet 's 1,569 lines are exceeded by three characters who appear in more than one play : Henry V. , who , in addition to the 1,063 lines in the play named for him , has 616 in " Henry IV. , " Part 1 , and 308 in " Henry IV. , " Part 2 , or 1,987 in all , Falstaff , with 719 in " Henry IV , " Part 1 , 688 in " Henry IV. , " Part 2 , and 488 in the " Merry Wives , " or 1,895 m all ; and Richard III , who , besides the 1,161 lines already mentioned , has 24 in " Henry VI. , " Part 2 , and 390 in " Henry - VI , " Part 3 , or 1,575 in all . Antony , besides the 829 lines in " Antony and Cleopatra , " has 327 in " Julius Caesar , " or 1,156 in all Bolingbroke has 414 in " Richard II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part 1 , and 294 in " Henry IV. , " Part 2 , or 1,049 in all . These are the only characters of this group who exceed a thousand lines ; and only two others , I think , have more than 500 lines : Richard , Duke of York , with 737 lines in the three " Henry VI " plays ; and Warwick , with 568 lines in the second and third of that series . What female character in the plays has the most lines ? I have found that nine persons out of ten guess ' that it is Portia-probably because of the part she plays in the trial scene-but Rosalind heads the list with 749 lines , followed by Cleopatra with 670 , and Imogen with 596 , while Portia has only 589 Then come Juliet ( 541 ) , Helena in " All 's Well " ( 479 ) , Isabella in " Measure for Measure " ( 426 ) , Desdemona ( 389 ) , Queen Katharine in " Henry VIII . " ( 374 ) , Mrs Page ( 361 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winter 's Tale " ( 331 ) , Julia in the " Two Gentlemen of Verona " ( 323 ) . Olivia m " Twelfth Night " ( 321 ) , Margaret of Anjou in " Henry VI , " Part 2 ( 317 ) , Volumnia ( 315 ) , Cressida ( 312 ) , Beatrice ( 309 ) ? the Countess in " All 's Well " ( 306 ) , and Celia in " As You Like It " ( 304 ) I think these are all that exceed 300 lines in a single play Among the nine women that I have noted between 200 and 300 , the most important are Constance ( 263 ) , Lady Macbeth ( 261 ) , Kate the Shrew ( 220 ) , and Hermione ( 211 ) - all of whom I fancy that many even among critical students and readers will be surprised to find so far down in the list , as they will also be to learn that among those below 200 are Ophelia ( 175 ) , Miranda ( 142 ) , Perdita ( 128 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julius CHsar " ( only 92 ) . Of the few women who appear in more than one play ( all in the English historical plays ) the most remarkable is Margaret of Anjou , the only character of either sex who appears in four plays , and the only woman who in the aggregate- exceeds Rosalind 's 749 lines . Margaret has 33 , 317 , and 279 lines in- the three parts of " Henry VI. , " and 218 in " Richard III. , " or 847 in all . Lady Grey ( proxima , sed loupe xntervallo ) has 73 lines in " Henry VI. , " Part 3 , and 274 in " Richard III. , " or 347 in all . The part that the women have in a play , compared with the men , varies greatly . In " Timon Of Athens " the three women have only fifteen lines in all . In " Henry IV. , " Part 1 , out of 3,180 lines they have only 115 On the other hand , in " As You Like It " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All 's Well " ( 2,966 ) , 1.013 ; in " Romeo and Juliet " ( 3,053 ) , 919 , in the " Merry Wives " ( 3,019 ) , 900 , in " Antony and Cleopatra " ( 3,063 ) , 845 ; and in " Twelfth Night " ( 2,692 ) , 843 lines . It should be understood that in all these statistics half-lines or Darts of lines at the beginning or end of speeches are count . ed as whole ones , though in the Globe edition they may often be properly numbered as parts of lines in the preceding or following speech . If all the lines of all the characters in a play are thus counted separately , the total will always be greater than the actual number of lines in the play counted continuously , as in the comparative lengths of plays given above The history of the blunder in regard to the length of " Antony and Cleopatra " is curious , and , it may be of interest as illustrating the persistent vitality of misprints , though by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now only thirty-four years old , but it may attain to a much greater longevity . It had its birth in a paper on " Metrical Tests , " by F G. Fleay , read before the New Shakespeare Society of London in 1874 . In the accompanying tables the number of lines in " Antony and Cleopatra " was given as 3,961 ; but the appended numbers of prose lines , blank verse , and rhymed lines add up to exactly 3,064 . Mr. Fleay , in copying his figures for the table , apparently mistook the zero for a nine ( his handwriting was very bad ) , and neither he nor his fellows in the New Shakespeare Society detected the error , though the paper was thoroughly discussed at that and the following meeting . He reprinted the table in his " Shakespeare Manual " ( 1876 ) , a book which was severely criticised for its many misstatements , misquotations , and other faults ( but not this one ) , by Dr. Ingleby , in the London Academy ( August 19 , 1876 ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metrical tables , much extended and carefully corrected , in Part ii . of his own " Shakespeare : The Man and the Book . " Up to 1881 , so far as I know , the error as to the length of " Antony and Cleopatra " had not been detected in Europe , though it had been often quoted by Shakespeare scholars on both sides of the Atlantic , I happened to see it in 1880 , while preparing my first edition of the play , published early the next year , but I think I did not refer to it in print It reappeared in a book by one of our most eminent critics less than a year ago . No reviewer has pounced upon it there , I think , and it may survive for many a year yet . W. J. ROLFE Cambridge , Mass. , November 15 AN UNNOTED ELIZABETHAN SOURCE To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Emil Koeppel , the latest authority on the subject , says ( " Quellen-Studien zu den Dramen Ben Jonsons , " etc , p. 83 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Humorous Lieutenant " : Fletcher found the basis of the comic action in a closely corresponding anecdote of a soldier of Antigonus , which is unquestionably very old , but has hitherto been known only in a somewhat later English version , in a collection of anecdotes compiled by Thomas Forde , published in 1660 , entitled " A Theatre of Wits Ancient and Modern , represented in a Collection of Apothegmes Pleasant and Profitable . " The anecdote does not , indeed , occur in the various accounts of the life of Demetrius , on which the play is founded ; but in Plutarch 's Pelopitias ( North 's translation ) , Chapter 1 , we read : The report goeth , that king Antigonus gave paye to a souldier among other , that was very hardie and venturous , but he had a naughtie , sickly bodye . . .

Wellesley Hills , Mass , December 1 ZACHARY TAYLOR 'S LETTERS .. TG THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I have just seen the Nation of October 8 , containing a notice of the " Letters of Zachary Taylor from the Battlefields of the Mexican War " ? a privately printed volume prepared from the original manuscripts in the collection of William K. Bixby of St. Louis . The notice concludes with the following words : William H. Samson has prepared the letters for printing and the very erratic spelling leads one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unjust reflection on me , for in the introduction signed by me the statement is made that the letters " are printed precisely as he Taylor wrote them  --  without the omission of a single word , without a change in spelling or punctuation " In the introduction I took special pains to point out the disadvantages under which General Taylor wrote , and urged the reader to be " lenient in criticism of the language in which the old soldier clothed his thoughts " In view of these statements , why should your reviewer , who never saw the original manuscripts , " suspect " that anybody was " at fault " ? By the way , your readers may be interested in knowing that common American books of reference differ as to the date of Zachary Taylor 's birth , and that the correct date , ascertained from the family records , is given in the introduction to this volume . He was born at Hare Forest , Orange County , Va. , November 24 , 1784 . The sketch of Taylor in Appleton 's " Cyclopmdia of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first wife was Taylor 's t second daughter . That sketch gives the date as September 24 , but this is by no means ' the only blunder ; of others , the most astounding is his statement that he had married the eldest daughter , instead of the ' second . Your readers may also be interested in knowing that the famous " Miss Betty , " who presided over the White House when Gen. Taylor was President , is still living . Mary Elizabeth Taylor , the fifth of Gen. Taylor 's daughters , and the third to survive the perils of childhood , was born near Louisville , Ky , April 20 , 1824 ? not 1826 , as Davis said in his biography of her father  --  and on December 5 , 1848 , soon after her father 's election to the Presidency , was married to Major William Wallace Smith Bliss , a gallant soldier of brilliant mental attainments who had been Taylor 's chief of staff and was destined to become his private secretary . Bliss died at East Pascagoula , Miss. , August 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow married Philip Pendleton Dandridge of Winchester , Va. , whom she survives . WILLIAM H. SAMSON . Rochester , N. Y , November 23 We are sorry if we have done Mr Samson an injustice Our reviewer based his opinion ( 1 ) on eighteen long letters of Taylor , of the same period , in the Library of Congress , in which the spelling does not show more than ordinary lapses ; and ( 2 ) on a comparison of Mr Samson 's own pages It may perhaps be regarded as permissible for a man to drop a final letter when writing hastily , and to indulge in some consistent misspelling ? that is , misspelling the same word whenever written Taylor did occasionally drop a final letter , as " cas " for " case " ( D 162 ) and " forse " for " foresee " on the same page But where a man , as a rule , spells correctly , and Taylor was a fair speller , one may question the accuracy of printing " youg " ( p 168 ) where " young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if at all So " contageon " and " contagion " are given in the same letter ( pp , 131 , 132 ) and " ter-able " on page 147 , when there are sufficient strokes of the pen to allow of terrible Such instances led the reviewer to suggest possible errors in copying the letters ? ED NATION . AN OPINION OF THE FILIPINOS . Tc , THE EDITOR ON THE NATION SIR : It seems to me that the inclosed extract from a letter written by a college graduate who is engaged in work in the Philippine Islands would interest many of your readers . I send it to you , therefore , in case you should think fit to publish it E M. H Moscow , Idaho , November 10 There at home now I suppose you are in the thick of the Presidential campaign . The Americans over here are hoping that the Philippine question will be discussed actively during this fall campaign . While there is little practical difference between the Republican and Democratic positions on the question , a discussion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only got the people interested I have become convinced , since I came over , that the Philippine question is one of the most important and about the most ignored of all our public problems . Naturally it is the all-engrossing topic with the Americans in the islands . And after one has listened diligently for a few months to the opinions of all sorts of men , and made a few observations himself , he is prone to deny the finality or wisdom of our present Philippine policy I think McKinley sat down one day , after lunch , and lit a cigar , and evolved the Philippine policy before he got up again . However he formulated it , it has been followed with admirable consistency ever since It is the laudable scheme of fitting these people for self-government and then presenting them with independence . To govern themselves is people must have some vital conception of public honesty and observance of law In this municipality the president , vice-president , and justice of the peace were caught the other day deliberately breaking the internal revenue laws regarding buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school house , and one of his subordinate Filipino teachers steals it as soon as the American is gone Public officials graft without shame at every opportunity A Chino-Filipino district judge imposes a merely nominal fine on Chinos convicted of violating the opium law ? Etc , ad lantum . To govern themselves a people must also be - endowed with at least a small measure of industry A public road is being built in the province north of this one The government engineers are offering Al wages for men , all sorts of natives are lying around their houses doing nothing , except petting their fighting cocks and eating their meals So the road must be built by labor brought clear from Manila . The explanation of this state of affairs is this ? When a native harvests a good corn or rice crop and has , therefore , an assured food supply for a little while , he immediately quits work When a carpenter working on a house has drawn three or four days ' pay , he forthwith decides that it is no longer needful to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet if a famine comes or a flood sweeps the crop away , the improvident creatures throng the houses of the better Filipino fainilies and the Americans , begging for enough to feed them ? Considering these things it seems unlikely that the Filipinos will be ready for independence in any twenty years , or forty years or fifty years . Suppose they could reach the goal in fifty years The United States would have poured into these islands untold billions in money and brains and lives , then it would be gone , every sou of it , in the twinkling of an eye . Some Americans over here declare that we should drop the Philippines like a hot biscuit , and do it now They say so because they believe the Filipinos will never reach the place where they can conduct a decent popular ' government . They point to the fact that this cry for independence is nourished and kept alive by the princtpales , the aristocratic families , constituting about 10 per cent . of the population . This upper tenth sees in independence unlimited power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only Malays . And did you ever hear of a Malay republic ? Or did you ever hear of any Malaysian government not despotic , Incidentally , did you ever hear of any respectable popular government anywhere in the tropics ?
