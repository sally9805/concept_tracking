txt Alderman Davies Commended . Caused perhaps by the general and mixed conditions of this election , sufficient attention has not been called to the candidacy of Alderman John R. Davies , Republican candidate for Justice of the Municipal Court , Seventh District , which lies north of 110th Street and west of Fifth Avenue . Although only 28 years of age , Alderman Davies during his four years as Alderman , and especially during his present term as Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Board of Aldermen and as member of the Sinking Fund Commission , has so conducted himself as to have the respect of all city officials and the entire citizenship of every party because of his many and common sense reforms in the finance work of those bodies ; always fair and courteous in the conduct of their affairs , he has the regard and esteem of all citizens of his district . He is a lawyer of a high type . In addition to his professional degree in Master of Laws he has had an active law and court experience since 1894 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All who have had close contact with him , both officially and professionally , believe the work of the Municipal Court would be greatly advanced by the addition of Mr. Davies to its bench .
