txt Miss . Elizabeth Stewart of Pittsburg , who was , with Lieut. : Sutton on the night he met his death in Annapolis , talked frankly with a NEW YOBS TIMES reporter to-day at her boarding house " in- Staney Brae , Sue said without apparent reservation or without excessive questioning that she could throw no light upon the death of the lieutenant of Marines . She did add , however , that Sutton , wnom she knew but slightly , did not show in his conversation with her on the night of his death that " he thought of suicide , and from her knowledge of him she could not conceive why he should want to kill . himself . Miss Stewart has settled down for sev-. eral weeks ' stay to recover from a Serious attack of " nerves . " " I can offer no explanation whatever for the death of Lieut . Sutton , " Miss Stewart said . " I did not knew him intimately and can not contradict too forcibly the unpleasant statements of the ' newspapers that we were sweethearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant of any of the causes leading up , to Mr. Sutton 's act , and came ' over to Canada only to - get a good rest . But I am not going back to undergo pry-1 ing investigations if I can help it . " Preserving this attitude of knowing " only what the others have told me , " she - quickly showed her vexation at the ; reports in the newspapers of her intimacy with Sutton . " I do n't know why they discuss me as they do , " she said . " I 'm sure it does no one any good and is unpleasant for me . I have no connection with the case , and did n't came to this place ter escape anything that 1 should have met cpenly . " I hesitate to say that I believe Lieut. - Sutton was murdered because , I am in no position to judge . Prom my knowledge of him , however , I can not conceive why he should have taken his life . deleted paragraph You know , two years is a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' old then , and not apt to remember what happened from one day to - another : . But I can tell you that in the conversation and events of that evening there was nothing to lead me or my brother to think that Lieut . Sutton contemplated suicide . It seems impossible as I think . - about it now , , but as I said I am not going to make a definite statement or opinion , for it would be absurd when snow so little about It . 1 " The news of Lieut . Sutton 's death reached me next morning and being in a weak nervous state I fainted . ' I'nere is nothing wonderful or significant about that . Any girl is apt to have a fainting spell at such shocking news . But I deny that I know any more about Sutton 's death than any girl in Annapolis that night . The next morning fattier came down to see me and he was as much grieved as 1 , " To Miss Stewart was shown a newspaper story from Washington reviewing the events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adams as the one suspected by Capt . Charles Badger , Superintenent of the Academy , of fighting with Sutton previous to the latter 's suicide . " Yes , that is what I have read , too , " was all she would say . " I know only the gossip of the affair , and the newspaper reports . " " Rid you believe Sutton unpopular with his comrades in the Marine Corps ? " Miss Stewart was asked . " Quite the contrary , " she replied . " He seemed well liked . His first object was study , but that did n't keep him from mix-ing in the social life . i was told of a few occasions when he broke loose on a jamboree , but was assured it was not frequent " " Was there ever a question of jealousy between Adams and any of the other officers and Sutton ? " " About , me ? " Miss Stewart asked laughingly . " Jealous over me ? That is even more absurd thin anything I have yet heard . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieut . Sutton and either Adams , Osterman , Utley , or Roelker ? " I know of nothing whatever . " " Do you know any reason why Lieut . Roelker should be dismissed from tha service without any explanation ? ' " " These questions have nothing to do with me , " said the young woman . " I know absolutely nothing about it . Just as well ask any of the hundred and one people in Annapolis that day . " " And you can offer no explanation either why Sutton should kill himself or be ' murdered by any of his eempariions ? " was asked . " None at all , " she said . Miss Stewart is not too III to go out boating every day , and has done considerable walking about the country since she arrived . At the village of Staney Brae , where " she is staying , there are comparatively few people summering. and with no telephone or telegraph connection her seclusion is about as complete as she could desire .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
