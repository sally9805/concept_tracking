Enter DRUSILLA , R. E. STERLING Ray ! asleep ? RACHEL ( starting up ) Oh . Drusie , I 'm so glad that you a wakened me ! I was having an awful dream . ( listens , bells heard in distance ) Bells ! then it was not all a dream . STERLING No , not if you were dreaming of fire . There is a fire in the village , and feeling sure that you would not retire , I came down to keep you company . RACHEL I 'm so glad you did ! I must have been asleep a long time , for I did not know when aunt Sophy retired . Has Elmer gone to the fire . STERLING Yes , and so have Mr. Ellsworth and Barney . RACHEL ( looking out of window ) Oh ! what shall we do ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow STERLING ( putting her arm around RAY ) Why , you little goose , you are trembling like a leaf in the wind ! Why is it that you fear fire , even at a safe distance ? p. 3 RACHEL From my early associations , I suppose . Eugene was a fireman . STERLING Eugene ! RACHEL Yes . Eugene saved me from the fire in Chicago , you know , and hearing him relate the horrors of that time , has bred such a fear of fire in my heart , that I am nearly frantic when I know one is raging . STERLING I do not understand you . How came you in the Chicago fire ? RACHEL Why ! do you not know that I am a fire waif ? STERLING I did not . Are you not Mr. Ellsworth 's neice ? RACHEL No , Eugene , who rescued me from the fire was the only son of uncle Nate 's sister . She died when Eugene was a small boy , and uncle Nate and aunt Sophy cared for him . When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he , having other inclinations , rebelled , hot words followed and Eugene left the house , which he has never since entered . At the time of the Chicago fire , he was in that ill fated city , and he saved me from a burning hotel . It is supposed that my parents perished in the flames . STERLING That was a sad time , one that left many families desolate . My parents perished in that dreadful conflagration . Fearing that our residence would be destroyed , we left it and sought refuge in a hotel that seemed to be out of the line of fire , but suddenly it was enveloped in flames , and in the panic that followed , I was separated from my parents and little sister . My grandfather saved me , but could find nothing of the others . p. 4 RACHEL Oh , Drusie , how said ! ( loud ringing of bells ) Another alarm , ( looking out of window ) I fear the village is all burning up . ( walking wildly about ) Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! RACHEL Drusie , do not call me Rachel . I can not feel that it is my name . STERLING It is a sweet name to me , for it was my mothers . RACHEL Your mother 's ! I also think it was my mother 's name . ( taking a locket from her bosom ) This locket was clasped in my hand when Gene took me from the arms of the dead woman , who I think was my mother . It is all I have of home and friends . The name " Rachel " is engraved on the inside of the case , on the outside R. E. in monogram. ( opens locket and passes it to DRUSILLA ) See ! STERLING ( looking at locket ) Great heavens !

E. , with a glass of wine . p. 5 RACHEL Here Drusie , drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STERLING ( dashing the glass to the floor and springing up ) Never again put to my lips liquor of any kind . It is a deadly poison . RACHEL Pardon me , Drusie , but you looked so ill , I thought a little wine would revive you . STERLING And it did  --  revived scenes that I would gladly forget . Forgive me , dear . I have broken your glass and hurt your feelings . RACHEL ( picking up broken glass ) Never mind my feelings , but wo n't you get a piece of aunt Sophy 's mind for breaking her glass ! STERLING Do you think the pictures in that locket are those of your parents ? RACHEL I feel confident of it . STERLING I think you are right . ( puts her arm around RAY ) Dear little Raella ! RACHEL What ? What did you call me ? Say it again , Drusie , it seemed like a flash of light upon the darkness of my memory  --  Drusie , do you know those pictures ? You came from Chicago  --  Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 6 STERLING Hush ! Who said that I came from Chicago ? Have I not told you that my native place was in England ? RACHEL Yes , but to-night you have told me of your home in Chicago , Oh ! Drusie , you came to us , a stranger , in need of care and friend-ship . We gladly gave you both . Not once have we tried to pry into your past history , though you have been with us a year , but now I beg you to tell me what you know of me . STERLING Shall I tell it to you if the telling will cost me my life ? RACHEL Drusie ! STERLING Can you not trust me yet a little longer ? I did recognize those pictures and firmly believe them to be of your parents , but to tell you all I know , would cause me more misery than I can bear . Some day I will tell you , but I can not now . Oh , Ray , I can not . RACHEL Drusie , tell me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , they are among the honored dead . RACHEL One more question , please ? Did you ever know E. P. Burleigh ? I ask , because Eugene P. Burleigh was the name of our Gene , and in getting some papers for Tabby to put on the shelves , yesterday , I found an article about E. P. Burleigh , of Chicago . I thought you might know about it , or know the man . I hope it was n't our Gene , for this man was murdered . p. 7 STERLING Oh ! RACHEL There you go again ! I never before had an idea that you were hysterical . STERLING Get the paper , Ray , I want to see it . RACHEL Yes , you want to faint again , do n't you ! STERLING Get it , I shall not faint .

It is feared that she carried her threat into execution . Though what has become of her , can not be conjectured . " ( RAY lays down paper ) Horrible , is it not ? p. 8 STERLING Dreadful , dreadful !

Have you heard the news ? RACHEL Is it true ? Is it really Eugene ? ELMER I suppose there is no doubt about it , I dragged him out of the Seaport House and uncle Nate searched him to find a clue to his identity . In his pockets were letters addressed to Eugene Burleigh , and the same name was marked on his pocket-book . RACHEL Oh , Elmer , I am so glad !  --  but you do not look a bit glad . What is it ?

Now this man is coming , and I feel that he will come between us . RACHEL Elmer , you have been a dear brother to me and I dislike to hurt your feelings , but when you talk like that you make me angry . Gene has been more than a brother to me , he was father and mother to me for four years . I owe him my life , yes , hat it not been for him , I should never have known you . For he left money with Tabby to care for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take me to aunt Sophy , so when he failed to come home , Tabby brought me here . Poor boy ! no doubt but that the marks of dissipation , which you thought you saw , were the effects of suffering and want . ELMER He is not needy . We found plenty of money , besides a bottle of whiskey in his pocket . RACHEL Elmer , you are unjust . Every traveler carries liquor . Please do not talk to me any more , you are jealous , and I dislike jealous people . ( exit R. E. ELMER It has began ! The trouble that I felt would come with that man . ( exit R. E.
