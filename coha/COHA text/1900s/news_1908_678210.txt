txt Extraordinary interest was aroused here some months ago when Sir Oliver Lodge stated publicly that he believed messages had been received from dead members of the Society for Psychical Research by living beings . The messages in question were said to have emanated from the late Frederic W. H. Myers , author of " Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death , " . a writer and thinker of the highest distinction ; Edmund Gurney , and Dr. Richard Hodgson , who ' were among the founders of the society . This performance was compared by Sir Oliver with the first faint tappings heard by a party working at one end of a tunnel from those moving toward them from the other side . Fuller particulars of these " messages from the dead " are now accessi-ble , having been published in The Journal of the Society for Psychical Research . The messages in question were transmitted through a medium whose true name is withhel4 but who is called " " Mrs. Holland . " Sitting with her mind blank , we are ( told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wrote what purported to be commun4ations from beyond the grave . The messages were blurred and broken , but a large number of them are printed , and many deal with the difficulty of opening communication between the dead and living . Thus a message which is said to have proceeded from Gurney ran : " The nearest simile I can find to express the difficulties of sending this message is that I appear to be standing behind a sheet of frosted glass which blurs the sight and deadens sounds , dictating feebly to a reluctant and somewhat obtuse secretary . Feeling the terrible impotence which burdens me , I am powerless to tell what means so much . I can not get into communication with those who would understand and believe me . You need much training before you can ever begin to help me as I need to be helped , and I do not know how that training is to be arranged for . It is like intrusting a message on which something of infinite importance depends to a sleeping person . " Human or living personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development  --  a plane which does not receive clear*impressions from the higher plane of those who have quitted the prison of flesh . The messages claim to give some account of the existence after death . Following upon death immediately was an " obsepration of consciousness " which led to many failures in attempts at communication with the living . The first message ascribed to Myers was in verse , though certainly not of the distinction which marks his published poems : " Friend , while on earth with knowledge slight , I had the living power to write ; " Death tutored now in things of might , I yearn to you and can not write . " Myers is afterward said to have told how at death he passed into complete unconsciousness . " The period of oblivion was unusually long with me . There was no link between my utter consciousness of things of earth  --  the last thing I felt was the touch that closed my eves ? and the passage to the plane I now occupy . The transit was absolutely unknown to me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were , when I communicate in this way . At least I am conscious of strain and effort , but I can not note the stages of the way . " Several messages were prefaced by signs which at first appeared absolutely meaningless , and which had to be taken in conjunction before an interpretation could be found . Thus three messages began , one with 17 , the next with 1 , the third with 01 ; which was finally read as 17 , 1 , 01 , or Jan. 17 , 1901 , the date of Myers 's death . In view of these alleged messages W. T. Stead states in The Review of Reviews that he asked a lady who " often received messages from beyond by means of automatic writing if she would try to secure a message from Myers . " A long communication was received to the effect that the dead man had made many discoveries , annulling some conclusions at which he had arrived in life when writing of human personality , and that it was his intention to make these discoveries known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Alice Johnson , by whom the account of the communications has been prepared for the Psychical Research Society , is inclined to regard . with skepticism the theory that they come from the dead .
