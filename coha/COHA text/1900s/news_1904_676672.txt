txt Acting upon information received from various sources to the effect that certain policemen of the Tenderloin Station have been employing " shake-down " methods in the arrest of women and " graft " methods in the handling of raids on " crap " games , District Attorney Jerome for the last two weeks has had an agent gathering evidence . The name of this agent is unknown to the police of the Nineteenth Precinct , but he is a man who is said to be thoroughly familiar with the conditions of the Tenderloin and to have every facility for obtaining the desired evidence . At the same time it is clearly understood that the suspicion of " grafting " which has fallen upon the heads of six men whose names are in the District Attorney 's possession does not touch Capt . Cottrell and the remainder of his force . As a matter of fact . the Captain has started a private investigation of his own . It was about three weeks ago that District Attorney Jerome received the information which caused him and Assistant District Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases of alleged " grafting " which the agent has discovered is in connection with a recent gambling house raid . It is said that two of the raiders had a heated argument on the sidewalk as to who should " grab the bank rota . " It appeared that the one who planned to attend to that important work . had " grabbed " it at a previous raid , so his comrade thought two chances in succession would be manifestly unfair . The matter was finally settled in favor of the second man , who later seized a bank 1 ' 01 of S3S5 , Only a very small portion of which , it is alleged , was turned over to the Sergeant at the station . The District Attorney 's agent has information also that at the same raid the policeman who got the bankroll saw a man in the house with his hands in his pockets . The policeman ordered him to take them out , which at first the man refused to do . Later , however , he took out his hands , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was not turned over to the Sergeant . In this case District Attorney Jerome is said to have several affidavits , one of which is sworn to by the person who was robbed , and who also says that he was kicked out of the place by the police . A Week previous to that raid the police visited a gambling house in West Twentysixth Street , and there seized - $410 , only a small part of which sum was turned over to the desk for entry , it is alleged . - Another charge of " graft " which Is being rigidly investigated by the District Attorney 's agent is the " shake down " methods employed by two policemen in arresting women . District Attorney Jerome has had several complainants in his office during the last few days , all of whom make the same charges . They declare that the two particular policemen make a practice of arresting . women on false charges of grand larceny without being able to produce a complainant , with the motive of ultimately practicing extortion on the women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Capt . Cottrell started his own investigation , Three women have told cireumstantial stories of persecution for the purpose of blackmail . Some of Inspector Walsh 's men have also come under the eye of District Attorney Jerome 's agent . It has been discovered that a number of them make their headquarters at a saloon on Seventh Avenue owned by a person who is occasionally referred to as " The Man Higher Up , " and who is said to have control of numerous illegal resorts . The saloon is known as a regular-clearing house for such places , and the District Attorney 's agent is fully supplied with evidence that at least one man receives $250 a week from five of them . CAR ALMOST IN THE SUBWAY . Stopped Within Few Inches of Excavation , but Caused Serious Block . Surface cars on the Broadway , Ninth Avenue , and Seventh Avenue lines were blocked for nearly an hour early last evening , just at the hour when down town workers were going home , on account of northbound car 2,122 leaving the tracks at Broadway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived there was a line of cars filled with impatient and angry passengers for ten blocks either side of the spot . The place where the car left the rails is airectly over the still unfilled subway excavation , and in its plunge from the track it escaped diving into the hole by only a few Inches . The passengers did not realize this phase of the accident at the time , however , and were not alarmed on that account . The lack of ballast in the track here is thought to have caused the rails to spread . When the line was released and a car go-ing south reached the transfer point at Slaty-fourth Street and Broadway , it was etormed by more than a hundred people who had been waiting an hour . At Fiftyninth Street and Columbus Avenue there was another crowd of as many more insistent upon entering . The motorman kept on as if he did not intend to stop , whereupon the men in the crowd pushed past the women and children and jumped for the running board . There were curses and threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riot by halting the car and allowing the mob to squeeze aboard .
