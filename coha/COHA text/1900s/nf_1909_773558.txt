txt // upon the King 's powers . The clergy now claimed the right to be tried in the Church courts alone , and denied the jurisdiction of the King 's courts . As the Church courts could not inflict the death penalty , a clerk , or priest , who had committed a capital offence could not be punished like other men . Henry II . set himself to regain the power thus lost and to secure a uniform administration of his laws . Thomas Becket , who had been a most efficient minister of the King in the adoption and execution of measures tending to restore order and to restrain the violence of the barons , was made Archbishop of Canterbury . As Archbishop , he took an extreme position in favour of maintaining the independent powers of the Church . At a meeting of the Council , in 1163 , the King proposed that a certain tax should be made a part of the royal revenue . The Archbishop ventured an objection , and Henry , surprised and enraged , swore a great oath that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becket replied as firmly that , so far as the estates of the Church were concerned , the thing should not be done . The records of the period do not make clear the outcome of this quarrel , but it is inferred that the barons supported Becket , and that the King was compelled to recede from his position . ' If this were a characteristic meeting of the Great Council , all that has been previously said about its weakness would be disproved ; for if the spirit manifested in 1163 had been its usual temper , it must have been , as an institution , an important check upon the power of the King . This case , however , is given as the first recorded instance of open resistance to the King in a meeting of the Council ; and , in spite of that action , Henry continued to use the Council for building up his own power . The barons , who in this one instance sided with Becket in a matter of corn- // Ilion interest , disliked him as much as they feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at which certain barons , in accordance with his request , presented a body of ancient rules to regulate the relations of the Church to the other parts of the government . ' I'liese rules are known as the Constitutions of Clarendon . Bucket strenuously opposed the enactments ; yet such was t he power of the united forces of King and barons in the Council , that the reluctant Archbishop was finally induced to affix his seal to the laws . The measure to which he especially objected , was that requiring appeals from ecclesiastical courts to be made to the King 's Court , and to go no farther except by the King 's consent . This , in Becket 's mind , placed the bishops at the mercy of the King . le preferred to have appeals made from the bishop 's court to the see of Rome . The stubborn prelate having repudiated the Constitutions of Clarendon , the King caused him to be summoned to another Council , where charges were brought against him , and he , feeling that his life was in danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed that the King 's triumph over ( lie Archbishop was complete . A few years later , however , Henry H. was involved in serious difficulty because of his efforts to have his oldest son Henry crowned and accepted as the future king . To assist him in this matter he sought a reconciliation with Becket . The Archbishop returned to England , but he came not as a friend , as the K ing had hoped . He excommunicated the Archbishop of York and all the other bishops who had sided with the King in the matter of crowning his son , and was preparing fully to vindicate the power of the Church against all the recent innovations . It was at this time that Henry enry uttered the angry words which caused his too faithful friends to hasten to Canterbury for the murder of Becket . A great revulsion of feeling against the Mon152 GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION CHAP . au arch resulted from that deed , and he was constrained to make friends with the Pope . In doing this , he renounced the Constitutions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , notwithstanding the renunciation , the laws in restraint of the Church were for the most part still enforced . The manner of the death of Becket furnished the occasion for the manifestation of a force which in later years became a dominant element in the Constitution . It was the force of public opinion . The people , who from the time of the Conquest had been more inclined to look to the clergy than to any other class for sympathy , commonly believed the King to be the real author of the murder , and Becket was at once regarded as a martyr and a saint . The King , while he took care not to lose any of the advantages conferred by his laws restraining the Church , was yet led to show great deference to the pious sentiments of the people in honour of their martyred hero . During the first one hundred years after the Conquest , there was no time when the great lords were not ready to enter upon deeds of violence and rebellion unless restrained by the strong hand of the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Becket was his efficient minister and supporter , the barons were kept in order by the power of the King supported by the Church , the lesser lords , and the people . When , therefore , the Sovereign became involved in a quarrel with the primate , the great barons were eager to destroy the man who had done so much to put restraints upon themselves . When the King had become unpopular on account of the violent death of Becket , and when his power was seriously threatened by an attack of his son Henry supported by the King of France , a portion of the barons raised in England the standard of rebellion . This barons ' war is of more than ordinary constiturun // tional interest . In the first place , it is the last of the wars against the King led by French barons . There were st i l l earls and barons in England who owned possessions in France , and in this revolt , which involved only the Freach faction of the English nobility , they were the leaders . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the leader of the King 's cause in England was at his wits ' end , and knew not what to do , the royal cause was saved by a spontaneous rising of the people in the north of England led by their local leaders.l Finally , the King was so strong in his position after his double triumph over the French king and his own rebellious lords that he did not deem it necessary to punish the rebels in any other way than by still farther stripping them of power , and by strengthening the administrative policy whereby that power was permanently restrained . A view of the government of England at the close of the reign of the first Plantagenet king gives us almost notating to suggest the present English Constitution which slid not also exist at the close of the reign of the first Norman king . In other words , the characteristic feattams of the Constitution of to-day were still absent from the government of England . For example , political pares in the modern sense of the term did not exist . In eir place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been manifestations of public opinions strong enough to influence the policy of the government , notably in the case of the martyrdom of Becket , but public opinion had then no organ of expression.The appearance of earls and barons with sympathies distinctly English , pitted against earls and barons whose sympathies were still French , has suggested the possibil , that class faction might lead to party divisions . But the fact that needs emphasis at this point is the complete // non-existence of political parties . Let it be specially remembered , also , that there did not exist any national representative institution according to the modern use of the words . The Great Council may , indeed , be called in some sense a national institution . But the modern representative idea is based upon the conscious right of the people to be represented , and representation in this sense can not exist before public opinion becomes influential . Undoubtedly there were dignitaries in both Church and State who felt that a slight had been put upon them if they were not summoned in the ordinary way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , was viewed as a violation of privilege , ratherthan as a violation of a fundamental principle of the Constitution . The Great Council simply furnished a practical way for doing a thing which had to be done . The King was obliged to come into working relations with the organs of the government , and the Great Council was an agency for effecting this . I t is easy to find in the body of administrative and judicial officers created by Henry I. , and more fully organized by Henry II. , a suggestion of a modern Ministry . The justieiar who acted as regent during the time when the h jug was absent upon the Continent , and who presided both at the council table of the Exchequer and at the meetings of the same high officers when they sat as a supreme court , may suggest a modern prime minister ; but there is in reality little resemblance between the two . As the judicial functions of the Council were the first to be specialized , the justiciar became in time the Chief Justice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctively administrative offices grew up finally around the treasury . Much progress had therefore been made by the time of the death of Henry H. , in 1187 , in respect to the development of permanent judicial and administrative institutions , and those // institutions became themselves important factors in the further development of the modern Constitution . Some positive resemblance to the later Constitution may be found in the fact that the dominant forces of the government were divided and balanced one against another . No one of the four great political powers was permitted to be crushed out . Each was needed as a protection against the encroachments of the others . Thus , while there was little in the actual government of HenryI I. which answers directly to the modern Constitution , there were certain features of his policy which had much to do with its development . A brief review of these may be helpful . The narrative of the resistance to the King on the part of Thomas Becket , supported by the barons , in a matter of taxation , is of interest simply as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later times had much to do with constitutional development . Henry instituted a sort of tax which had a more immediate effect upon the dominant powers of the government . It was called the ' village , or shield money . This was a payment to the . king of a sum of money in lieu of the personal service which the lords were bound to render the King in time of war . ' Henry often waged war upon the Continent to defend his feudal possessions , and his English vassals did not like to go abroad for such a purpose . They reed , therefore , to pay money instead ; and the King could use the money to employ mercenaries for his continental enterprises . This policy , begun by Henry II. , was continued by other sovereigns , and tended to make them less dependent upon the feudal lords . Again , Henry made provision for more thoroughly Inning and drilling the fyrd , or national army , under others appointed by the King . We have seen that this // army had been of great value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many times the prompt action of the English army under their local leaders had been the determining factor in securing a royal triumph over turbulent barons . Henry recognized this force , and made it still more effective . Further , the sending of justices from his Curia Regis to hold courts in the counties1 did much to consolidate the entire government , and cause the local governments to contribute to the support of the Crown . At one time the King summarily removed all the sheriffs , and required them to place their accounts in the hands of his Council , requiring the members of the Council to administer for a time the offices of the sheriffs in all the counties . When he suspected that the members of the Council might be open to charges of irregularity , he required them to surrender their accounts to a special commission of barons appointed for the purpose . There is no doubt that this thorough-going administrative system did much to convince the barons that it was useless to contend against the King unless they could first win the support of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry II . to insure the continuity of those customs which resulted in the establishment of the jury system.2 It is probable that something of the representative idea was always associated with the ancient customs from which the jury is derived . When the jury accused a person of a crime , there was probably associated with the act the notion that through and by means of it the community itself was speaking . When a dispute was settled by the witness of chosen men , the decision presumably carried with it the notion that // t he witnesses voiced the sentiment of the disturbed community . When an inquest of twelve made a valuation of property which should serve as the basis for the assessment and the payment of taxes , there was associated with 1 he act the notion that the community was bound by it.Henry 's judicial and fiscal policy involved an extended use of these juries as spokesmen of the communities . Immediately after the death of Henry II . his administrative policy was subjected to a severe test . Richard I. and John were both thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of tyranny to stir up enough opposition really to threaten the hold of the Crown upon the administrative agencies which their predecessor had established . Certain enactments which bear the date of 1194 , five years after Henry 's death , belong in fact to his policy , since they were adopted by statesmen trained in his school , and were strictly in line with the work already done . By these the justices from the Curia Regis were required to take an oath of the peace from all the people who attended the local courts , and to appoint conservators of the peace whose duty it wits t o keep the peace in the King 's name . At the same time , the relations of the juries to the county court were more clearly defined . The constitutional importance of these measures may be seen in their tendency to harmonize the King 's courts and the local courts , and thus to strengthen the power of the Crown . In course of time use conservators of the peace , under the name of Justices of the Peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had previously belonged to the locall and more popular courts , thus giving still more emphasis to the jury system as the sole representative institution which brought the people into direct contact with important governmental business . CHAPTER XIII MAGNA CHARTA THE next great landmark in the development of the English government , after the completion of the administrative system of Henry H. was the signing of Magna Charta . It is not an easy matter to read Magna Charta or any other ancient law with true historical circumspection . It is well known that Mr. Freeman was wont to criticise the historical work of lawyers . But historians who can not be convicted of any of the lawyer 's bias are not themselves agreed in the adjustment of ancient laws to their historical relations . There is a strong probability that lawyers and historians alike , as well as laymen of every class , are very commonly the victims of erroneous theories in their interpretations of ancient laws . No attempt is here made to give to Magna Charta its true historical setting . The task undertaken is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Charter changed the relative positions of the dominant classes in England . ' Weighty evidence may be adduced to prove that laws usually contain much that is controversial in its nature . Even in the most settled governments of modern times , many laws indicate a striving rather than an attainment . If the United States should be blotted out of existence , and if a thousand years from now the volumes containing the state and federal constitutions should be 158 // recovered as a sole relic , it would appear that the southern states were conspicuous in their opposition to duelling , because in their constitutions are found most numerous restrictions upon that crime . It would also appear that t he eleven southern states which formed the Confederacy were conspicuous opponents of the doctrine of the right of secession , because in the constitutions of those states alone is found explicit denial of the right of a state to secede from the Union . If these things can be justly said of the settled governments of to-day , it is not unreasonable to suppose that the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that expressed a hope rather than an attainment ; much that was intended to deceive and outwit the ignorant and the helpless ; much that at the time was in appearance a treaty of peace when it was in reality intended as a basis for war . Magna Carta has certainly the appearance of a treaty of peace ; but upon closer study evidence appears that it was at the time intended as a basis of war . t should be borne in mind that the Charter was signed after ten years of earnest strife during which time John hall incurred the enmity and the distrust of all classes in his kingdom . After the defeat of the barons in the time of Henry II . they had come to realize that a contest against the King was hopeless so long as he had the loyal support of the trained English soldiers ; and there is much reason to believe that they had learned to appreciate the necessity of winning for themselves the favour of the people . Early in John 's reign he had been driven from France by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This had the effect still further to impress upon the barons the importance of making peace With the ruling powers in England . If any were disposed to contend for their French possessions , they could do so only at the cost of imperilling their possessions in 160 GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION cHAr. xi ? England . John was as bad a king as could well be . He had , moreover , the faculty of impressing all classes with the belief that he was a thoroughly dangerous man . The contest which resulted in the Charter began with the Church . The Archbishop of Canterbury died in 1205 , and the younger monks of the cathedral secretly elected a successor , whom they sent abroad to receive the badge of office from the Pope . When this became known , the elder monks , in alarm , reported the matter to the King , and he ordered them to elect in his presence an archbishop who was at once invested with the temporalities of the office , while a statement of what had been done was sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied their customary share in the selection of the primate , appealed to the Pope to vindicate their right . There thus appeared before the Pope three parties : first , the younger monks with their nominee ; second , the elder monks who had at the command of the King selected his nominee ; third , the bishops of the province , who claimed the right of nomination . The Pope , having a plan of his own , decided that the elder monks had the right to nominate , but that their first action was irregular . He therefore ordered the monks who were present vi Rome then and there to name Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury . Stephen was thus chosen , and was at once consecrated by the Pope to the office . John was in a rage at what was clone , and wreaked his vengeance upon the monks . The Pope placed the land under an interdict , and John took vengeance - upon the bishops who published the Pope 's decree , driving them out of the land and seizing their estates . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old enemies the bishops being stripped of their possessions , but John did not limit his attacks to any class . Upon one pretext and another he seized the estates CHAP . XIli MAGNA CllARTA tai of the barons as well . The Pope , following the course of events in England , in due time excommunicated John . I n 1211 he threatened to depose him , and appointed Philip of France as the executor of the edict . John , finding that he could ' rely upon no class in England , hastened to make his peace with the Pope . Stephen Langton was acknowledged as Archbishop , and John yielded to all the papal demands , even to surrendering his crown and receiving it hack as the Pope 's vassal . His intention was to use the power of the Pope in enabling him to triumph over his enemies in England and France . In England those enemies were all classes of the English people . Stephen Langton and the clergy made common cause with the barons , the lesser nobility , and all those who had influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parishes , to restrain the action of the King . In 1213 a meeting of the Council was held at St. Albans attended by representatives from the townships on the royal estates . These . were called to act as a jury to assess certain damages which the King had agreed to pay to the bishops . At this meeting were formulated measures of reform to be demanded of the King . In the same year , at a meeting of barons and clergy held in St. Paul 's Church , in London , Stephen Langton presented a copy of the charter of Henry I. , which was accepted as the basis of the demands to be made upon the King . A year now intervened , during which time the Ring was engaged in an nsne.cessful war against the King of France . In June , 1215 , the King 's situation had become desperate . He was threatened with an invasion by the King of France . The barons , backed by an army of determined Englishmen , had openly defied him . Archbishop Langton had threatened to excommunicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to the nobles . The city of London had received the army of the barons . Nothing M // was left for John but to surrender or be conquered . A meeting was arranged for the King with his army , and the barons with their army , on the plains of Runnymede , to agree upon the terms of the surrender . The terms agreed upon are preserved in Magna Charta . By the signing of the Charter , John escaped personal violence for the time . His enemies could not have foreseen that he would die soon after that act . There is no reason to believe , or rather there are the best of reasons for not believing , that the barons expected this treaty to relieve them from the duty of fighting against the King . They all knew that the signing of the Charter would not make John trustworthy . The naming of twenty-five of their members , of whom the mayor of London was one , to make war upon the King and compel him to observe the Charter , was by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation . The Charter would but make the grounds of warfare a little more definite . If a constitution has for its chief object the prevention of encroachments and the harmonizing of governmental institutions , Magna Charta answers to that description , at least in part . It was certainly intended to harmonize for the time being the greater and the lesser nobility , the clergy , and the influential classes among the English people . For a hundred and fifty years these classes had been jealous of each other . Kings good and bad had been able to play one class against another , and thus to shield themselves and to increase their power a , t the expense of others . The Charter was evidently designed to secure greater harmony between the three classes , the clergy , the nobility , and the people , who were traditionally jealous and hostile , and it could do this only by conveying the idea that encroachments upon their privileges were to be prevented . But was the Charter intended to harmonize the Crown with the other agencies of government ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what would seem to be a strained interpretation of the word " harmony " that the Charter can be said to harmonize the Crown and the nation . Making war upon the King does not , to the view of a modern citizen , seem to be a legitimate and constitutional method of harmonizing governmental agencies . It will help us to understand the facts of the period if we see clearly that to the mind of the subject in the time of John this appeared altogether different . Making war upon the King was then looked upon as the customary , the regular , the orderly , and according to the Charter it became , the legal way of restraining the King . In that sense the Charter did provide in express terms for harmonizing the Crown and the nation by the only method known at the time . That is , it named those who should lead the nation in a war upon the King in case he violated the terms of the agreement . Yet it is more conformable to modern usage to say that , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to limit his power and to prevent him from making encroachments . Stephen Langton is by common consent the hero of this period . Magna Charta was two years or more in prepaon , and there were doubtless frequent consultations with representatives of the various classes affected . It is bahle that every sentence in the charter touches some sore spot in the working of the government , and was ( Rm+d to conciliate an influential class . There is no evidence that any one who had anything to do with the formulation of the document was a victim of any general ) ry of the rights of man , or any general theory as to how a government ought to be organized and admitted . From beginning to end the Charter is a catalogue promises that specific injurious practices should cease , and older and better ways should be followed . The great Charter expressly confirmed all the privi164 GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION CHAP . Xlic leges granted in a charter which the Church had previously received . The King 's feudal tenants had suffered divers abuses and hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lords were to cease . The Great Council , as the older administrative agency for apportioning taxes and collecting them , had been displaced in the time of Richard and John by new administrative agents . Hence we have the statement that taxes were hereafter to be voted in full Council . The lesser baronage and the freemen had much reason to fear that if the government came into the hands of lords and bishops they would be deprived of the judicial and administrative favours which they had enjoyed under the system of Henry H. Much of the Charter is fitted to remove this fear . The King 's courts and the various uses of the juries were to be continued . The city of London and other towns and cities were to continue in possession of their accustomed privileges . The hand of the King had been heavy in the execution of forest regulations , and these laws are modified . Viewed in one way , the document is eminently practical . Each sentence had in view the immediate practical object of securing the cooperation of some particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the King . For such a purpose the document must be brief and void of detail . The classes who must needs work together had habitually been at enmity . If they were now to work in harmony , troublesome details must be left out of account . Like the platforms of a modern political party , Magna Charta of necessity ignored many important subjects , and fastened attention only upon objects of common antipathy and desire . It is this brevity , this absence of detail , this indefiniteness in some of the terms used , and especially the indefiniteness of some of the classes to which the terms refer , that has made it // easy to read out of or to read into Magna Charta all the ideal principles of government which have been discovered in the succeeding centuries.r The Charter appears in Its terms to be made for freemen . Yet it is probable that half of the English people of that day were not freemen.2 It is also probable that no man living at the time understood the word " freeman " as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of persons who could of be classified either as free or not free . Freedom has own by solving doubts in favour of freedom . The amplification of rights has coincided with an amplified interpretation of the charter . It requires a peculiar construction to get out of the Charter the advanced principles of taxation by the representatives of those who pay the taxes . Yet this has been one . Henry II . constantly used the Great Council to form and publish his policies and to adopt the means of Irrying them into effect . Richard and John had frequentIy used other agencies . The Charter is understood to state that the method of Henry II . should be followed . In after centuries the Council became a truly representative body , and the interpretation of the Charter has naturally enough followed the changing facts . The Charter makes frequent use of the word " liberty , " which meant in these early days merely the privilege of a certain class , or of certain classes ; while , as used in modern times , the word expressly denies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common rights all men . Mr. Gardiner quotes a passage in which this contrast of meanings is emphasized . A town was // anxious to preserve its ancient liberty to put culprits into the stocks . Along with the broadening of the term " freeman " so as to make it include all the people , has come the imperceptible elimination of the idea of privilege from the word " liberty . " In this way Magna Charta being in its origin a charter of privileges , has become the Great Charter of Liberty . It is impossible to determine all that the makers of Magna Carta intended to accomplish . The document was especially noteworthy in that it set forth in order so complete a catalogue of the ills of government and the grievances of the governed . As the people of the present day cherish an exaggerated notion of the immediate effects of novelties in legislation , it is not unreasonable to suppose that some of the makers of the Charter may have actually entertained the absurd notion that the adoption of it would result in harmonizing the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought that when the King had been sufficiently coerced by the barons appointed for the purpose , he would become transformed in character , and thus all the agencies of government would be harmonized . Of course , any such result was out of the question . The conflicting interests were not changed . The Church still had occasion to be jealous of the barons . The interests of the lesser nobility were often at variance still with those of the higher nobility . The privileges of towns and cities could be maintained only by constant conflict . The masses of the people , although they were the creators of the wealth upon which the warring classes subsisted , and furnished the brute force which was a determining factor in the strife of the warring classes , were not yet regarded as dangerous . It was difficult to make the ignorant populace change their customs at all ; but if they did change , the conditions were such that the change was almost // invariably in the direction of their own interests . They would work best and fight hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained the support of the masses prospered in their contests until such a time as the musses themselves got a mind of their own and came to in , recognized as dangerous to the ruling classes . It does not follow that , because the immediate purpose of t he makers of the Charter was impossible of accomplishment , the effect of the act was therefore not great , immediate , and permanent . It is because men have ever been found who were willing resolutely to set themselves to to accomplishment of that which , for the time being , was impossible , that progress in human liberty has been made possible . It was fortunate that John died before e had time to break the league with his subjects . It was fortunate that Stephen Langton lived for more than half a political generation after the death of John , and that he aececded in making peace with the Pope , so that the undivided forces of the Church could , under the Archbishop 's wise direction , be used in the effort to harmonize the orlcing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate that during the whole of Langton 's life after the death of John , England had a boy for a king , and that he government was in the hands of a regency . For the first time since the Conquest the people enjoyed an orderl y , customary administration of the laws at the hands of others than the King . Thequestion may be asked , If the Charter could suefully regulate the working of the government for fifty years , why was it impossible as a permanent scheme government ? The answer is , Simply because , in the aural course of events , so many fortunate circumstances tint often coincide . So soon as the people were pertted again to feel the hand of a king , they experienced a less orderly and a more tyrannical and irregular govern168 GROWTH OF THF . FNGLISII CONSTITUTION CHAP .

And yet , looking back down the long vista of history , it may even be seen that this too was among the favouring circumstances which have together accelerated the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first sovereign to make his hand felt by his subjects after the establishment of the famous compact between the classes , was a tyrant with foreign notions and sympathies , estranged from his own people . CHAPTER XIV HE POWER OF THE CROWN REGAINED BY MEANS OF PARLIAMENT Henry III . declared himself of age in 1227 . During the five years following , the King and the upelders of the Great Charter were at strife . In 1232 Henry put himself into the hands of foreigners , and for enty-six years a tyranny was maintained . At the end of this time the opposition to the Monarch had become - in so consolidated as to be able successfully to with him for a few years . But he again prevailed over N enemies , and closed his reign in triumph in 1272 . During the years of tyranny the King was supported by Pole . After the death of Stephen Langton a compact , conspiracy , against the English tax-payers was formed the part of the King and the Pope . The laity were Unsuccessfully to resist some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the support of the 1110 or of the barons , were powerless against the Roman tiff . After a few years , in 1237 , a special legate was 1st from Rome to extort money from the English people . clergy allowed their old jealousy to deter them from giving effective support to the barons . It was not until clergy had been made to suffer many things at , the His of King and Pope , that they were again induced to e common cause with the barons in opposition to their sovereign . 169 170 GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION CHAP . xry The great difficulty in the way of those who would restrain the King was to compel him to observe the laws . The various charters , and especially the Great Charter , were understood to require good government , yet the King appointed both those who administered the laws and those who decided cases arising under the laws . The provision of the Charter appointing twenty-five barons to make war upon the King in case he refused to observe the Charter , was omitted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III . The popes , ever opposed to the Charter , were ready to relieve the King from the oath requiring its observance . It was found to be comparatively easy to persuade the King to promise to obey the charters , but it was exceedingly difficult to get him to keep the promise . After many years of tyranny the barons and the clergy in the Great Council were led to demand that they should be allowed to control the appointment of the King 's ministers . This demand was at the time revolutionary , and , as a matter of course , the King would not yield to it . Finally , in 1258 , all efforts to restrain the King and the Pope having failed , the barons and the clergy having become one in sentiment through the sympathy created by a common suffering , the Great Council , which had now come to be called Parliament , 1 met at Oxford . The barons came with an army to coerce the King . When the barons met John under similar conditions , they exhausted their demands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something more than charters was now needed . The Parliament at Oxford made a rude attempt to create such agencies for administering the government as would effectually restrain the King . A few months before , Henry had been // induced to consent to the appointment of a committee of twenty-four , twelve of his own party and twelve of the party of the barons , to adopt measures for restoring order . This committee of twenty-four made a report to the Parliament at Oxford , winch , having been adopted , beCame known as the Provisions of Oxford . These required that a body of fifteen councillors should be appointed to advise the King in matters of government , and forbade itn to act except upon their advice . The committee of twenty-four was continued , and the offices of State were required to be filled in accordance with their advice . To take the place of the ordinary Parliament , a body of twelve was to be chosen by the barons with whom the Council of fifteen was to consult three times each year . f this form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government by barons instead of a government by the King . It would have been an oligarchy instead of a monarchy . But the new government did not prove permanent . A few years of strife and civil war ensiled during which the King and his son were for a time prisoners in the hands of the nobles . Then the royal party triumphed , and the King was again firmly establiished in the government . The political contentions of the reign of Henry III . are ilic , nit for many reasons . In the first place , the clergy gr ; ulually becoming less influential as leaders of the people . .

But the most important fact of all was the attempt of the party of the nobles to enter into competition with the // ing to secure a hold upon the counties and towns . The . re presence of representatives from counties and towns an assembly such as that of the time of Henry III . is a thing of little consequence . But the fact of the existence it king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of counties and towns by means of a summons to parliament , is a matter of much consequence . Evidences such a contest appear in the war between the oligarchy d the King . Having made prisoners of King Henry d his son Edward at the battle of Lewes , in 1264 , the rolls set up a provisional government with Earl Simon Montfort , their leader , at its head . In the following r Earl Simon summoned a Parliament of his own supterm to which he invited representatives from counties d towns . Note in this connection a significant fact . The young prince who was then a prisoner had five years ore threatened to join the community in compelling barons to fulfil their obligations .. A few years later , ward , having become King of England , fulfilled that ' at , and as a part of the process of fulfilment he too rallied upon towns and counties to send representatives meet with him in Council . It is this Parliament of ward I. thirty years after that of Earl Simon , which ks the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly . The reign of Edward I. is of unusual interest in the study of the Constitution , whether we view the subject of the standpoint of the forms of government , or from standpoint of the balancing of the dominant forces the government . Besides giving to Parliament its representative form , Edward did much to give perma- // nence of form to the high courts of the realm . It was Edward who succeeded in winning back to the Crown the confidence of the English people , thus , in a sense , undoing the work of John and Henry III . Yet the existence of the Great Charter , and especially the fact that clergy , barons , lesser nobility , and townsfolk had for a generation or two laboured together to secure the ends outlined in the Charter , could not be undone . During part of the time the people looked to the clergy as the chief patrons of their local privileges ; part of the time they looked to the barons as their most trustworthy supporters . Larger and larger classes were becoming conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edward could win the loyal support of the people only by convincing them that he was a more effective supporter of the principles of the Charter , than were the barons ; that their local privileges were safer in his hands than they would be in the hands of the clergy or the aristocracy . It will be remembered that from the time of Henry I. the sending of judges from the King 's Council to hold courts in the counties tended to strengthen the hold of the King upon the people through their local institutions . Henry H. developed and used this power with marked effect . It should be noticed , too , that one of the important provisions of Magna Charta is that these courts should be held in each county four times each year . During the long regency after the death of John the people enjoyed these among other charter privileges at the hands of the clergy and the barons . It was part of Edward 's policy to turn the judicial system to the advantage of the Crown . In the hands of Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that system was scarcely distinguishable from the other administrative agencies of the King : the same officers managed all the King 's affairs . The beginnings of separation were // noticed in the time of Henry II. , and before Edward cane to . the throne the courts and the common law which had been established through their agency had become a distinct factor in the government . The courts held by the King 's justices in the counties had encroached upon the feudal courts , upon the Church courts , and upon the local courts of the hundred , while there was No a tendency to modify the county court . The first fleet of the centralized judicial system was greatly to trengthen the power of the Sovereign . But it will be en that the tendency of fixed laws administered accord to rigid rules is , in itself , to limit all arbitrary power . ' The courts and the law became a bulwark of the people , ? r , at least , of certain classes of the people , against despotic government . Yet the same courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever a source of royal strength as against powerful subjects . Edward I. fully ppreciated the value of the judicial system which he had inherited . Three separate common law courts had been radually developed out of the Curia Regis of Henry L , d to them Edward gave a still more distinct organization.I He took care , also , that justices should be ' , pointed who would protect the people against the lawessness of the barons . Were any of his justices suspected of corruption , he punished them as did Henry H. hundred years before . Thus in Edward 's hands the courts of law were made effective for the restoration of power to the Crown . With the separation of the courts from the King 's council cane the separation of the judicial from the financial liminess of the realm . When , as in the times of Henry I. id Henry II. , the sovereign used the same body of men determine and publish his policy , to settle questions of law and of government , and to arrange with the county // courts for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the King and the local governments was close and intimate . No distinction was made between the power of the Monarch as represented by the sheriff , and the same power as represented by the royal courts . With the separation of the courts , however , from the financial administration came a lessening of the effective hold of the King upon the local governments . Royal communication with the county governments was through the sheriffs , but with the encroachments of the King 's courts upon the county courts the sheriff 's office had become less important . The sheriffs , being subject to the orders of courts as well as of the King , were less efficient agents of communication with county courts . Confusion of authority in the sheriff 's office tended to promote corruption as well as weakness there . From the signing of Magna Charta , the place of the Council , or Parliament , in respect to matters of revenue , became more important . When Henry III . and his barons began to vie with each other in calling upon county courts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to strengthen their military and financial support in counties and towns . Edward saw , as his father did not , that the King needed to have the loyal support of the people . Much has been made of the fact that the Parliament of Earl Simon supplied King Edward with a model , but Edward seemed , nevertheless , to have proceeded in his own way to find a method of cooperation with his local governments . At one time he called together provincial councils in different parts of his kingdom which were composed of four knights from each of certain shires , and two representatives from each town and city of the locality , besides various clergymen . The barons were not present at these meetings . At another time knights and burghers were called to meet with the // nobles , while the clergy were not summoned . In one ease the representatives from boroughs and cities were summoned through the sheriffs ; in another the summons was issued through the mayors . Knights were sometimes called to meet with bishops and barons when the burghers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also summoned to separate councils . " But in 1295 , for the first time , all these various ingredients were added together in their completed form to make what has been known to after ages as the Model Parliament . To this assembly came archbishops and bishops , three heads of religious orders , sixty-seven abbots , seven earls , forty-one barons , two knights from each of thirty-seven shires , and representatives from each of one hundred and ten cities and boroughs throughout the kingdom , ? a body of rather more than four hundred persons . " l The formation of Parliament was an incident in ' the efforts of the King to regain power over the nobility through the support of the people . Direct dealing with the people tended to remove abuses in the sheriff 's office , and this not only helped the King to gain the confidence of his people , but for the time being undoubtedly increased his effective hold upon their resources . Our modern notions lead us to think that , as a matter of course , a Parliament limits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to happen after Edward established the Parliament on a representative basis before Parliament tended to limit in any appreciable degree the royal power . It is almost impossible to read of such an institution as he English Parliament in the time of Edward without reading into the history ideas and notions which had never occurred to the people of that day . To-day Parliament is sovereign , in legislation , in finance , in admin- // istration . And because there has been at all times a national assembly under the name of Parliament , Great Council , or Witenagemot , it is natural to associate with that body the vast powers possessed by the Parliament of to-day . It will help us to understand the origin of the modern Constitution , if we look upon the early assemblies not as law-making bodies chiefly , but rather as administrative agencies of the government . Henry I. could get along without giving much attention to the Great Council , because he found in a smaller body of men ' an effective administrative agency . ' Henry II. , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative agencies , yet also made large use of the Great Council.2 Calling bishops and barons to meet in Council , he was able to compel them to give formal assent to his predetermined policy . In his hands the Council was clearly an agent for increasing the royal power . When the barons first tried their hand at governing , in the time of the conflict with Henry III. , they set up a frame of government which left out the Parliament altogether , substituting for it a body of twelve of their own number . Edward I.3 used the Great Council in the early part of his reign to perfect the judicial machinery of his government . To build up his administrative policy , and to forestall the clergy and the barons in gaining control of the local governments , he adopted the policy of direct communication with counties , towns , and cities through their own representatives . When he called these representatives to meet with his Great Council in 1295 , it was chiefly with the intention of strengthening his administration . The Great Council and early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the modern sense agencies for determining policies . The year after the meeting of the noted Model Parliament of 1295 , Edward , being still sore pressed for money , gathered companies of merchants , and persuaded them to grant increased export duties . He also collected companies of the clergy , and persuaded then to grant large stuns . When Edward again met his Parliament , the Archbishop of Canterbury presented a Bull of the Pope forbidding t lie clergy to pay taxes to a layman ; and on the strength of this , the clergy refused a grant to the King . " Edward , instead of arguing with the Archbishop , directed the justice of the King 's Bench to announce that , as the clergy would lay no taxes , they would be no longer protected by the King . The clergy now found themselves in evil case . Any one who pleased could rob them or beat them , and no redress was to be had . They soon therefore evaded their obligation to obey the Bull , and paid their taxes under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on which Edward again opened his courts to them . " Mr. Gardiner , l from whom the above is quoted , remarks that in the days of Henry I. or Henry II . the King could not have treated the clergy in that way . The masses of the people now looked to the King rather than to the Church for protection . Edward I. gained the ill-will of many of his barons because he was constantly stripping them of power . His encounter with the Archbishop and the clergy naturally set the hierarchy against him . His exactions from the merchants likewise set the towns against him . The next year , 1297 , when he ordered the Earl of Norfolk to lead an army into Gascony , he was met by a flat refusal ? All classes in his Parliament turned at this juncture against the King , and he was compelled to confirm Magna Charta // and other charters , and certain important clauses on the subject of taxation were added to the Great Charter . It henceforth became much easier to claim that any general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax not voted by Parliament was illegal . This incident shows that whenever , by a fortunate coincidence , the nobles , the clergy , and the influential classes among the people were united against the Xing , they could overpower him . Edward was an eminently wise and powerful king , yet he was forced to add provisions to previous charters which tended to limit his control over taxation . But the true value of the new words of the charter which Edward gave was in the fact that in coming generations they made it easier for the people , through an amplified Parliament , to gain control over taxation . For the time being , the giving of such a charter made it a little more likely that a king would ordinarily call upon the full Parliament rather than upon a smaller body of men for the administration of his finances . It should , however , be distinctly borne in mind that , whether the Xing used the smaller body or the larger , it was the Xing who controlled and directed affairs . If at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not because of the existence of the institution known as the Parliament , but because of forces outside of Parliament . It would be absurd to say that it was the Parliament that forced Edward to sign the charter . It was rather the enraged barons , the clergy , and the merchants , with the hold which these had on the lower determining forces of the nation . The idea can not be too often enforced that if at this time in English history the Parliament had been recognized as having centred in itself the high powers of a modern Parliament , it would have ceased to exist . It was because Parliament was looked upon by all classes as simply one agency for doing a thing which had to be // done in some way , that it was permitted to do that most important of all things , viz. to continue to be . The fact of continuity made it easier in after generations to make of Parliament an agency for governing by public opinion . It was as true in the time of Edward I. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers which really limited the Crown were the Church , the nobles , and the local governments in counties , towns , and cities . Every one of these powers , which were in a sense independent of the Crown , might , as we have seen , be made , under certain circumstances , to minister to the power of the Crown . The real strength of the Crown lay in so balancing these powers one against the other as to make them each in t urn support the government of the King . The Church had manifestly lost power at the time of Edward I. Probably a larger and larger proportion of the people in local governments had become conscious of power . The Crown and the barons held their own with , probably , l i t tle change in relative strength . It is a matter of no small consequence that at the death of Edward I. there had been a hundred years of striving for unattained privileges . Magna Charta is a catalogue of such . Each class , we may believe , was still contending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity for the play of sentiments that were neither narrow nor selfish . It is much more than an empty form that the kings were many times induced , or forced , to ratify the charters by solemn oath . A century of striving to realize an ideal may be worth more to a nation than any amount of obedience to a clearly determined law . CHAPTER XV PARLIAMENT AS AN AGENCY OF FACTION EDV ARD II . was a weak monarch , and was disposed to place his affairs in the hands of favourites , who were not acceptable to the ruling classes . The barons wished to regain the power which they had lost at the hands of Edward I. At first they had the support of the nation , and were able to compel Edward II . to place the government in the hands of twenty-one of their number , called Lords Ordainers , who were to exercise practically all power . The Ordainers , for the time being , entirely displaced the Parliament . This is an indication of the sort of Constitution which England would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could temporarily gain the support of the dominant forces of the nation , because the King 's government in the hands of odious foreign advisers was excessively had . But in a few years the government of the barons was seen to be bad also . Then certain of the King 's favourites were shrewd enough to devise a way by which he might overthrow the nobles . This plan was to call a full Parliament , and by means of it to destroy the power of the oligarchy . The new Parliament enacted laws providing that matters of government should thereafter be established in a Parliament composed of the clergy , the barons , and the commons . This point in the history of Parliament is important as 182 corer . xv PARLIAMENT AS AN AGENCY OF FACTION 188 marking the first distinct declaration that the Commons should have a share in law-making . The appeal to the ruling classes by means of a Parliament enabled the King and his favourites to prevail over the Ordainers ; but having so prevailed , they were unable to maintain their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned against the King . He was forced to abdicate his throne , and his son Edward was crowned in his stead . Parliament was used as an agency for deposing one king and crowning another . This may suggest the great Revolution of 1688 , but in reality the two things were quite dissimilar . The act of 1688 was a great revolution , because it carried with it a certain theory of the rights of Parliament . There is no evidence that any theory if the rights of Parliament had taken shape in any mind in 1327 . Getting rid of a despised king , and an obnoxious husband , was in itself a disagreeable business . ' lie Parliament was the most available agent for such a sk . Five years earlier , Parliament was one of the means Bich this same king had used for getting hold of those forces of the nation which enabled him to destroy his chief enemies among the barons . While these things could all take place without the existence of any distinct Ivory concerning the rights and powers of Parliament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves fitted develop a theory . The greater part of Edward III . ' s reign was occupied in war with France . This war served to bring the consciousness of increased power to large classes of the people . The shrewdness of William I. had led him to preserve the fyrd , or old English militia , and provide for its maintenance . We have seen that until the time of Magna Charta any English king , however bad , could maintain himself against his barons by calling to his aid the English militia . Henry II . thought it worth while // to reorganize and strengthen those local forces , and they became a powerful aid to clergy and the barons in their contest with King John ; and all the kings , nobles , and clergy had always more or less influence over the local governments of which the militia formed a part , and according as one or another of these ruling classes gained control of this popular force that class prevailed over its enemies . As an incident to the building up of kingly power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the possibilities wrapped up in the organization were not fully appreciated till bands of those trained and armed peasants had destroyed feudal armies of many times their own number at Crecy and at Poitiers . Parliaments were habitually used during the reign of Edward III . as agencies for voting supplies . ' It was during this reign that the two Houses were organized into their permanent forms.2 The House of Lords was composed of the higher clergy and the earls and barons of the Great Council . The knights from the shires and the burgesses and citizens from towns and cities were formed into one House called the House of Commons . The lower clergy gradually ceased to attend the meetings of the assembly.3 From the time of the Model Parliament of 1295 to the formation of the two Houses about 1341 , much confusion continued to exist in the organization of Parliament . There were times when four diverse classes voted supplies or transacted other business separately . These were the old Council of bishops and barons , the knights , the burgesses , and the lower clergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections ; sometimes to have sat together while still acting separately . Gradually , out of the confusion , arose , during the early years xv PARLIAMENT AS AN AGENCY OF FACTION 1S5 of the reign of Edward I1I. , the two separate and distinct louses of Parliament which continue to the present day . Thenceforth the representatives of the lesser nobility , culled knights of the shire , sat with representatives from towns and cities . The House of Commons , as thus composed , represented the wealthy and influential classes . In the counties those who were only a little less wealthy and powerful than the barons were usually chosen to Parlament . In the towns and cities only the more wealthy it izens had an important share in local government , and he more wealthy of these would usually be sent to Paliament . The bringing together of so many important persons in one House and giving to them a share in the government would naturally tend to develop the conviction that Parliament was itself an institution which had rights , privileges , and powers . The House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers should take part in the trying of peers , but the House of Commons , from the nature of its origin , held the first place in respect to the voting of supplies . The defining of the functions of the two Houses tended to promote the consciousness of special powers in each . A comparison of their powers would reveal the fact that the House of Commons , so long as it really represented the local governments of the counties and the chief towns and cities of the realm , carried with it the controlling physical force of the nation . Parliament , thus organized , became a natural agency resisting the King . It took the place in large part the armed barons of former times . When a leader on ; ; the barons saw the necessity of resisting the King the h ing 's favourites , instead of raising an army by an +ul to his friends , he sought to gain his ends by means the Parliament . During the later years of the reign of Edward III . // England was in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other times to civil war . Notwithstanding the great victories over French armies the results of the war were disastrous to England . Taxes were oppressive , and the money raised was squandered in offensive ways . The King , never a great man , was losing his mental powers and had become the victim of a designing mistress . Causes other than the immediate conduct of the government also served to create an atmosphere of discontent . In 1349 commenced the visitations of the Black Death , which is believed to have destroyed half the population . Social and industrial changes were in progress . Free labour had largely taken the place of bond service , and in consequence of the death of so many labourers there was a natural tendency for wages to increase . But the wealthy classes , being the law-makers , strove to protect themselves by severe and repressive laws against the labourers . Large unrepresented classes who were injured by the conduct of the government became conscious of their injuries . A revival of religion added to the social uneasiness . Many preachers and teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sins of their rulers , while the belief spread that the Church was both rich and corrupt as well as oppressive . ) By far the most noted of those teachers was John Wiclif , whose preaching with that of his followers furnishes one of the strongest illustrations of the tendency of the teaching function of the Church to weaken its governing function . The clergy filled a prominent place in the King 's Council and among the high officers of State . The laity were always jealous of their power and influence , and a large party among the nobility wished to degrade the clergy and seize the property of the Church . John of ( gaunt , en . r. xv PARLIAMENT AS AN AGENCY OF FACTION 187 ) like of Lancaster , made himself the leader of a part of lie anti-clerical faction . But the Duke of Lancaster was himself feared and dreaded by many of that faction . here was uncertainty about the succession to the throne . The aged King was declining . His son Edward , the Black Prince , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke of Lancaster aspired to the throne . In this emergency , the Black Prince headed the party of opposition to the corrupt court , now dominated by the hike of Lancaster , and a Parliament was assembled , in 137G , which has received the name of The Good Parliament . It was noted for the vigorous action of the house of Commons , which refused a grant of supplies until the accounts of the government should have been laid before diem . With the Black Prince to support the Commons , he Duke of Lancaster was thrust out of the King 's Council ; the treasurer was impeached before the House of ords , convicted , and imprisoned , ? the first instance in history of such an act , ? and the King 's mistress was moved from the court . n the midst of these reforms the Black Prince died , and hewing that event the Duke of Lancaster returned to Weer . Under his direction another Parliament was called , hick undid much of the work of the Good Parliament . his incident shows Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent power . Still , it was a much more civilized agency than were the armed troops which it displaced . And it is because Parliament was for ninny centuries an effective tool in the hands of first e and then another of the opposing factions of the realm that t has been comparatively easy in modern times to Mize in Parliament itself , effective power . During the reign of Richard II . ( 1377 ? 1399 ) the varielements in the Constitution were quite thoroughly rested . The King was only twelve years old at his coro188 GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION CHAP . XV nation . There was a baronial faction with the Duke of Lancaster at its head , and there was a clerical party . These were only a short time before at the point of civil war . The masses of the people were overburdened and discontented . The sense of injury on the part of the masses was greatly increased by the preaching of Wiclif and the Lollards . The French and Scots were ravaging the borders , and with the advent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overrun by hostile armies . The dangers from discontented peasants and from foreign enemies were so great that for the first few years of the reign the bishops and the barons composed their differences and united to make up a Council to preserve order and prevent disaster . It was during these few years that there occurred various revolts among the peasantry . The most important of these was the one in the county of Kent , led by Wat Tyler . Armed peasants overran the country , and gained possession of the city of London , and were induced to return to their homes only upon the promise of the young King that their grievances should be redressed . They complained of the unequal taxation of the government and of the tyranny of the landlords . But the word of the liing was not observed , nor was the lot of the peasants improved . Nevertheless , the demonstration of power on the part of the populace was such that the wealthy and ruling classes were led to tremble for their position . If , under an ignorant leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slay the Archbishop of Canterbury , what might they not do if led by a competent military chief ? From this time forth the fear of the masses had a sensible restraining influence upon the quarrels of the privileged wealthy classes . The first few years of Richard 's reign after he was old enough to take personal control of the government were aline . sv PARLIAMENT AS AN AGENCY OF FACTION 189 characterized by violence and faction . The King , with certain of his favourites , undertook to preserve order by the exercise of royal prerogative , and the Duke of Gloucester , one of the King 's uncles , headed a faction against them . Gloucester 's party controlled the Parliament of 1386 ; the King 's ministers were impeached , and a commission of eleven was appointed to administer the government for one year . In the hope of overpowering this commission , the King secured a decision from his judges declaring its appointment illegal , and was proceeding to summon a Parliament which should punish the commisloners , when five of them , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Richard was again compelled to yield . A Parliament subservient to the Lords Appellant impeached and executed two of his ministers and drove others from the country . The Sovereign now seemed to be reduced to more complete subjection than ever ; yet within a few years the successful oligarchy became itself unpopular , and Richard placed himself once more at the head of the government . It will be remembered that when Henry III . was put under restraint , a party of the barons assumed control , t heir failure led to the trial of a representative Parliment . Again , when Edward II . was in similar fashion restrained by the Lords Ordainers , he was , after a few s , enabled to overthrow the oligarchy by an appeal to Parliament and by enacting a law which gave the corns a share in legislation . So now when Richard II . percived the waning popularity of the Lords Appelant lie threw himself into the hands of the now fully developed Parliament , and for several years ruled in accord ' ' ith its wishes . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices so t IIw assembly might not be deterred from making // complaints against them , and he restored the ministers to office only when he was assured that their conduct was agreeable to his Parliament . It will be observed that facts of this sort are of immense value to the modern statesman in the construction of the modern theory of the power of Parliament . After a few years of parliamentary rule Richard became alarmed at the rumours of plots against his life , and so violent was his conduct that he is believed by many to have been insane . He compassed the death of Gloucester and others of his enemies . He called a packed Parliament , and secured the passing of a law which placed the power of that body in the hands of eighteen of his friends , thus making the royal government absolute . One highhanded act followed another , until , upon the death of the Duke of Lancaster , the estates of the dukedom were confiscated . Upon that the young Henry of Lancaster , who had been banished by order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army to vindicate his right as heir to the title and the estates of the duchy . The King was overpowered , and a Parliament was called under the direction of the triumphant party of the barons , with Henry , Duke of Lancaster , at their head . This Parliament deposed Richard II . and crowned Henry of Lancaster in his stead . The Parliament which deposed Edward II . made his son Edward king in his place , but when Richard II . was deposed , the direct lineal descendant was passed over . If the law of descent had been observed , the Crown would have gone to the house of Mortimer , which was descended from the second son of Edward III . ; but Parliament gave it to Lancaster , descendant of the fourth son . Thus the house of Lancaster was enthroned by means of superior military and political power . Three hundred years later this fact made it seem less irregular for a family to be cuAr. xv PAI ?

According to the view of Pym and Eliot , Parliament represented the intelligence , the judgment , and the conscience of the nation ; in the time of Richard II . it was a mere tool in the hands of a faction , or often a conspiracy of the privileged classes against the nation rather than a representative institution of the . nation .

Coincident with the formation of the House of Commons as the recognized organ of communication between the King and the counties , towns , and cities , these local governments were themselves becoming more exclusive and more aristocratic . The county court ceased to be attended by a large body of the influential people of the county , and its affairs were transacted by the justices of the peace appointed by // the King and by a select number of the knights and the burgesses . The towns and cities had become more wealthy , and their governments were falling into the hands of a more exclusive class . The long war with France led to a change in the military organization of the country , or coincided with it . There came into being a detached fighting class . This was supported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part by the great nobles who maintained among their retainers large bodies of armed men wearing their lord 's liveries . These made up the train of the great man and by means of them he often became a source of terror to both king and people . Laws against liveries , that is , against these bands of liveried warriors , began to appear with the reign of Richard H. and continued in force for many generations . During the three centuries which had passed since the Conquest , free labour had been gradually displacing serfdom . The liberated peasants were often , indeed , a less effective political factor than were the former serfs . So long as the serf belonged to a lord he had a sort of representation in local governments . The free peasant was wholly without representation . He was ill treated , and gradually he became aware of his injuries .

By the time of the deposition of Richard II . in 1399 , certain fixed institutions had come into existence which may themselves be counted as factors in the balancing of the high powers of State . More than two hundred years had passed since the organization of the judicial system of Henry II . The common law courts were now wellestablished and venerable institutions . In their origin these courts were agencies for strengthening the arm of the King , yet in course of time they had come in many ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its very nature against arbitrary power , and je knowledge of the law is a source of protection to the people . It should , however , be borne in mind that the mitts were still often used as a means of tyranny.l The igler nobility were accustomed , by means of their armed retainers , to overawe courts , assassinate jurors , and secure unjust decisions ; 2 and the power which the great lords xcreised over the courts was a large element in building p and maintaining the liveried troops who followed them . and could appear in the court on behalf of his retainer , nd could get from the judicial body what the feudal inferior could not get for himself.3 Thus , in one way and nether , the courts themselves had a modifying effect upon the balancing of the powers of State . 0 // Besides the three common law courts , a fourth court , called the Court of Chancery , 1 had in the time of Richard II . grown out of the King 's Council.2 Centuries had been required for the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they became distinct from the King 's Council , they assumed the position of lower courts from which there was an appeal to the King in Council . The Chancellor , who was at first the King 's secretary , came afterwards to exercise high judicial functions , and so around the office of Chancellor grew up the Court of Chancery . Thus out of the one King 's Court of the time of Henry I. had come four distinct judicial bodies , while there was still in the King 's Council a measure of judicial power , a remnant of which is to this day exercised by the Privy Council . After the development of the two separate Houses of Parliament in the early years of the reign of Edward III . a conflict of authority speedily grew up between them and the King 's Council , ? which had by that time come to be called the Privy Council . The King and his Council altered acts of Parliament , and the two Houses objected . The King issued orders from his Council which were given the force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parliament , and , in short , there was no clear line of demarcation between the respective spheres of the two institutions . Thus , out of the one ill-defined assembly of the Norman period had been developed four separate courts , a Privy Council , and two Houses of Parliament . Yet the real moving forces of the nation were not to be found in any of these institutions . They still dwelt in the King , in the dukes and other high nobility , in the Church , in the lower nobility , in the wealthy classes of towns and cities , and in // be lower classes of freemen , who were becoming ever more conscious of rights and of injuries . The existence of the national institutions did , no doubt , modify in some measure the perpetual strife ; but , so far as the ruling classes were concerned , it was still a government of force rather an of law , and courts and parliaments were for the most rt mere tools in the hands of warring factions . CHAPTER XVI THE NOBILITY WEAKENED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented a faction . One great baronial faction had triumphed over another great baronial faction , and there was a tendency to a counter-revolution on the part of the displaced faction . The marked success of the first two Lancastrians in a measure overcame this tendency . There followed during the minority of Henry VI . a political generation of acquiescence in the rule of the house of Lancaster . Then , partly by reason of the personal qualities of the King , partly through adverse circumstances , the factional strife broke out in the middle of the century into the Wars of the Roses . The roots of that frightful and bloody contest run far back into the early ages of English history , and have been to some extent already traced in preceding chapters . I t may be well , however , again to glance swiftly over some of the historic facts and conditions whose tendencies culminated in the great fratricidal strife of the Middle Ages . From the days of the creation by Henry I. of a new English nobility as a counterpoise to the unmanageable Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . At first the line of separation was mainly a national one , and the quarrels represented the inevitable jealousy of the English dwelling on their an-196 // - Hirai lands towards the greedy and usurping French nobles , and of the French whose arms had established and supported the Sovereign in his conquered realm towards despised and inferior race which had cunningly secured ' yid favour . As time went on , the ostensible and even the real grounds of opposition were continually shifting . ell faction was forced to bid for the favour of the lower tiers , often with little reference to any question of Live or foreign influence ; and in some periods power swung from one to the other party , as one or the other hied more of popular support . The great lords on the Scottish borders had been permitted and encouraged by earlier kings to retain a large measure of independent wer , and they naturally became leaders of the opposing forces .

At one time of the aristocratic factions championed the popular e , at another it was the opposing nobles who claimed support the people 's interests . A hundred years before house of Lancaster was enthroned the Duke of Lanter headed the people 's opposition to the foreign farites of Edward H. But when Richard II . was to be honored , and Henry of Lancaster crowned , the Lancasns became the leaders of the higher nobility , while a tendency ensued for their enemies to seek to curry favour h the more popular party . ' he clergy , likewise , sometimes cast their influence to the royal side , sometimes with one or other of the aristotic factions . During the Lancastrian period the weight their choice was much less than in preceding ages . Upon the Continent the Church was itself rent with diviH , and two Popes contested for supremacy . The Church in England had become rich and in a measure cor198 GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION cnnr. xvt rupt . Kings and nobles had more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus threatened , the clergy were eager to ally themselves with any party which seemed likely to protect them in the possession of their property . Hence their warm support of the Lancastrian kings , who also gratified them by persecuting the Lollards . But more than by fear of losing property the real strength of the Church had been sapped by the moral unsoundness which was becoming clearly apparent to the growing spiritual earnestness and insight of the people , stimulated by criticisms of the religious teachers in the fourteenth century . In this continual strife of factions may be seen a suggestion of the methods followed by modern political parties . But the red rose and the white were not symbols of political parties in any accepted modern sense . Parties of to-day are held together by common beliefs and common opinions . Lanca , trians or Yorkists were bound together by common fears and common hatreds . The knights , citizens , and burgesses who were represented in the House of Commons had come to be a limited and privileged class . Changes which had been made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , over whom they had largely lost influence . The governing classes might now be justly said to constitute a conspiracy against the people . Effective power was in the hands of the King and the great lords . I f these had been united among themselves , it is probable that the forms of parliamentary institutions would not have been preserved . Henry IV . was induced to favour the House of Commons , not because the Commons in themselves stood for a great and effective power , but because he was beset on all sides with great lords who threatened his destruction . Under such circumstances the Commons did represent a // power which was not to be despised . Henry named his ministers in Parliament , and one-third of , them were members of the House of Commons . It was understood hat ministers thus named were acceptable to Parliament . Sheriffs under the direction of the King or of some lord ad been accustomed to name the members to represent -e county in Parliament or to interfere with the free choice of the county court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove this abuse .

Yet the effort was not successful , and the interference continued throughout the century . In 1431 a law was passed limiting the franchise in the choosing of knights of the shire to free-holders worth forty shillings a year . Mr. Freeman suggests that when we take into consideration the value of money as compared with present values , in the place of forty shillings we should read forty pounds . It is probable that this law did not essentially change the practice in respect to electing members .

The government , being in the hands of the few , each party among the warring factions feared the people ; yet the Yorkists were distinctly the more popular . The insurrection under Jack Cade in 1450 is believed to have been undertaken partly in the interest of the Duke of York . Still , throughout that cruel and bloodthirsty period little heed was paid to the needs or the aspirations of the common people . Lords with their retainers fought against other lords with their retainers . The victorious party often slew the conquered without mercy . There were many vicissitudes . Lancastrians vanquished Yorkists , and were in turn many times vanquished by Yorkists . Not content with the slaughters of the battle-field , the victors for the time being were wont to call packed Parliaments to continue the work of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the existing higher nobilCHAT ' . // ity was destroyed , and much of the land which they had held was transferred to the surviving noble families or to the Crown.1 That force which had been from the days of William the Conqueror to this fatal era the chief counterpoise to the power of the Crown was , so far as such a unction is concerned , utterly swept away . After these wars there was never a time when a faction of the nobilty relying upon their own retainers could meet a king n equal terms . For generations after it was impossible to discover in the English government any clearly defined and deffective counterpoise to the regal power . If any such real counterpoise remained , it is to be Mind in the local customs , habits , and temper of the represented masses of the people . The upper nobility as now weak ; the Church was rich but timid ; the ever nobility were without effective leaders or organization .

If the masses of the people could , as they did , improve their condition in the midst of destructive civil war , much more could they prove it if , while retaining all their acquired privileges , they could at the same time enjoy the comforts of peace . The people naturally approved a strong and orderly govuuent . The nobility and the clergy were also disposed favour a strong hand lest an enraged nation should strip . ni of their privileges . 202 GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION char. xvt At the close of the Wars of the Roses and the beginning of the reign of the Tudors , the forms of the Constitution had been determined . In the first place , the House of Commons had become the recognized agent for voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were constantly used as agents of government . Edward IV . got a Parliament to vote him supplies for life , and was thus enabled to get along without Parliaments during much of his reign . The grants made by Parliament he supplemented by " benevolences " which he exacted from the rich . A Parliament in the reign of Richard III . made the exaction of benevolences illegal . The point to be especially noticed here is that the facts are such as to render it easy to prove that at this time Parliament was a recognized taxing agent , and that in matters of taxation the House of Commons held the first place . During the weak rule of Henry VI . Parliament adopted the practice of introducing regular bills and passing them through the two Houses before presenting them to the King for his signature . Before that time legislation took the form of a proposition from the King to be approved by Parliament , or of a humble petition from the Parliament to be approved by the King . Edward IV . made a complimentary speech at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rule according to the law . This , it will be observed , is a good precedent . It was also a good precedent when , almost a hundred years earlier , Richard II . in a fit of parliamentary fervour required his ministers to lay down their offices upon the assembling of Parliament , so that Parliament might feel free to accuse any one of them of malfeasance in office.2 All such acts are important because of the support which they give to modern parliamentary theories and practices . // Parliament had been made the tool of all sorts of high-handed judicial and executive acts . It began the impeachment of ministers in the time of Edward III . ; it was brought into conflict with the judges in the time of Richard II. ; and the events were such as to give weight to the modern contention that Parliament is above the judiciary in authority . An impeachment makes the Commons the accusers and the House of Lords the judges .

Time and again ' arliament had been made the agent for controlling or choosing the King 's ministers . Especially had Parliament c1aimed control over the expenditure of money . ! I CHAPTER XVII EARLY TRAINING FOR DEMOCRACY Looking simply at the forms of parliamentary action , nearly all may be seen in acts before Henry Tudor became king in 1485 . Green tells us that nothing was added to the Constitution after the New Monarchy ( which he dates from Edward IV. ) until the century of the Puritans and the Stuarts.I This is true if we are looking simply for forms of action , and for material out of which to create the modern theory of the powers of Parliament . The Parliament of the fifteenth century had everything which we associate with a modern Parliament , except power , influence , independent authority , and such a connection with the nation at large as to make it a really representative , national institution : all of these it lacked . Its hold upon the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norman and early Plantagenet kings . These kings came into intimate relations with their people through members of their Council , through sheriffs whom they appointed , through the system of courts which the ' set up , and through the fyrd , or local militia . When the later Plantagenets called representatives from the local governments to attend the meetings of the King 's Council , the act resulted in the breaking of the nation into two parts , leaving the greater part of the people on one side and the ruling , privileged classes on the other . The 204 // admission of knights and burgesses to the Council tended to destroy rather than to promote popular representation . But if there had been a loss in respect to the relation of the masses to the King 's Council and to Parliament , there , ad been a distinct gain in respect to their relations to in courts . When the Wars of the Roses broke out , the people had for centuries enjoyed the benefits of the common law courts , and all through the civil conflict the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , many instances of cruelty and injustice per.trated by juries and courts when overruled by powerful asses ; yet , so far as the masses of the people were conrued , in their ordinary dealings they received a fair . gee of justice at the hands of those institutions . The common people had become law-abiding . It was mainly e rulers only who were lawless , and , while the lawless elements in the nation were destroying each other by civil r , the ordinary industries flourished and the people ospered . England had ceased to be a nation of farmers . Edward . was called the Merchant Prince . He owned ships and gaged in commerce . More than a hundred years earlier ward III . had encouraged the importation of weavers In Flanders . The manufacture of woollens in endless riety had grown up . Towns and cities were enlarged and prosperous .. Country folk had made their way into the cities , and some of them had risen to positions of dirship in trade organizations . Certain laws placed m the statute books during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them was igued to prevent labourers from leaving the farms . &Nuances; were passed in the towns to prevent the scanof villeins rising to the position of master . From 206 GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION chAr. xvn this time forward the towns held a more important place in those political contentions which resulted in the development of the English Constitution . With the greater security which came to England with the Tudors , there grew up among the wealthy townsfolk the habit of deserting the cities and establishing country residences . At the close of the Tudor century townsfolk and middle class countryfolk were ready to unite in opposition to the monarch . It has been already remarked that the working of the present Constitution is dependent upon the state of mind of the people , and one element in that attitude and temper which is of the utmost importance is the essential conservatism which prevails to-day among all classes . It is not easy to account for the peculiar temper of a nation ; but in a study of the characteristics of the English people at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken of the fact that for many centuries an orderly government had been maintained by means of the common law courts , and of this other fact that the dwellers in towns and cities were the subjects of a great variety of political and social experiences . The Norman kings set the example which other monarchs followed of granting charters to towns and cities . Under royal patronage the freemen in the towns were protected from the brutality of feudal despotism , and gained much practice in various forms of self-government . They were organized into trade and craft guilds . No man stood alone . All were bound together in cooperative enterprises . Difficulties between the town corporations and the guilds , and between the guilds in their relations to each other , were continually arising and demanding adjustment . Within the guilds were masters and apprentices between whom were many disputes requiring settlement . From the middle of the fourteenth century there existed a distinct // class of journeymen , or wage receivers ) . These formed themselves into labour organizations , and for generations there was conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The religious element also contributed to the friction between classes and orders . Religious fraternities and other societies abounded among the laity , and the religious motive was a leading feature in all the industrial organizations . Many of the later guilds grew out of the religious brotherhoods , so that a single society came to provide for the secular interests of a trade , while at the same time it maintained a priest to pray for the souls of the members , supported a chapel with lights perpetually burning before the altar , performed a religious play at stated seasons , and managed charitable funds for the benefit of their members and dependents . Especially as the religious motive prominent in the labour organizaions . Masters complained that the workmen were seeking to raise their wages under the guise of piety . The religious brotherhood which spread from the towns to the country contributed to the development of a lower middle . lass in the villages . While liveries were playing such a conspicuous part in the later phases of the feudal system , there sprang up in he cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a limited membership from societies already existing , but not cut off from the company , or craft , of which the ivory constituted the aristocracy . Now it may be wide of the mark to say that the centuries of experience in the common law courts , and in the many organizations which embraced a large proportion of he people , accounts for that peculiar quality of character which enables the modern English to maintain their delicately poised Cabinet system , ? especially as the corn- 208 GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION CHAT . xvu munal and guild institutions were common to England , France , and Germany , ? yet we can readily believe that those experiences have had much influence in the formation of national characteristics . By means of them large numbers of people gained practice in political affairs , learned self-control , and acquired the habit of effectual cooperation . As the government of counties and hundreds became more exclusive , that is , came to be controlled by fewer persons , so there was likewise a similar movement in all organizations of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations of equals ; in later times the authority within them came to be wielded by the few . The journeyman societies were all either destroyed or brought into subjection to the craft , or company , in connection with which ( and , in a sense , in opposition to which ) they had arisen ) . In the religious societies and in the municipal corporations , also , authority became more and more centralized in a few hands . Probably language is used entirely amiss when any of these early organizations are spoken of as being democratic at any period . It is a more accurate form of speech to say of the early governments of the counties , hundreds , and towns , and of the early guilds , that they would be democratic if , with corresponding forms of organization , they existed at the present day . But in the olden time the ideas out of which modern democracy grows were wholly wanting in the minds of the people . There was probably no more real democracy , as now defined , in the rude primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same things , and were related to each other as equals , than in the later ages when greater diversity appears , and the relations were those of higher and lower // ranks . The change simply indicated greater wealth and a further division of labour . It was then held to be the business of some men to govern , and there was a tendency i all the voluntary societies , as well as in cities and counties , for the exercise of authority to become hereditary . Political strife went on in all the ranks of life , not because f the existence of a spirit of democracy , but rather because f the continual conflict of class interests . Nothing can be more helpful in promoting a correct understanding of the existing democratic Constitution of England than a clear apprehension of the fact that the ideas w expressed by the word " democracy " are altogether new in the world 's history . Merely that the word is old no indication that its meaning is old . To the mind of o Greeks who gave us the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking characteristic of the Athean democracy that nine-tenths of the people were ignored the ruling classes . The slaves of the Greeks were ten of their own race ? their own flesh and blood ; yet e moral code of the Greeks treated the slave as other an a human being . A classical Greek with a Salvation Army conscience is an utterly unthinkable being . American annals record a memorable sentence which , th accompanying events , well illustrates this contrast view in different ages . In 1857 the Chief Justice of e Supreme Court of the United States in rendering an important judicial decision gave utterance to these words : The negro has no rights which the white man is bound respect . " To the mind of the classically trained lawyer the statement was true in fact and correct in law . ie. speaker attributed the sentiment to the statesmen of e previous century , and ? with individual exceptions ? their views were , no doubt , fairly represented . But the rlls of the Chief Justice fell upon the ears of men of different spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION cu Ac. svit civilization and the growth of humane and Christian feeling into an attitude of revolt toward the coarse brutaid and pagan heartlessness which the words embodied . 1 less than twenty years from that day the Negroes of the United States were not only in possession of all the rights of manhood and citizenship , but they were also in control of the legislatures of many of the Southern states and were making laws which white men are still bound to obey . Democracy was a term of reproach to the statesmen who framed the early American constitutions . The new ideas which the word now represents were then finding utterance ; and , while no objection was brought against the ancient , classical meanings , the modern notions of democracy were heard only to be rejected and condemned . Only in the rare , exceptional mind did this new thought become a conviction earlier than the present century . Now , that view of democracy represented by Thomas Jefferson has been for a century gradually filtering into the American mind . The momentous revolution ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to the American without observation . To the Englishman the case is wholly different . The introduction of the new idea of democracy has been accompanied by certain specific acts . Now , if there were nothing to be accounted for in the present English Constitution except the democratic theory and those governmental institutions which are in harmony with it , the easy way to accomplish that would be to go with the multitude and call everything democratic in the past history of England which admits of such a construction . But it is necessary also to account for the Crown , the House of Lords , and a formal constitution which appears to contradict in many ways the democratic constitution . To explain this apparent contradiction it is necessary to use // discrimination in respect to the meaning of words , ? to avoid as far as possible the confusion arising from employing the same words with a variety of meanings . When we apply the term " democracy " to the ancient English counties , hundreds , towns , guilds , and religious societies , we mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern Constitution . All careful historians will admit that the earlier democracy , so-called , was without a clearly defined theory of the right of all to participate in the government . But it is this clearly defined theory which is the essential element in the new democracy . The distinction is so important that , at the risk of being tedious , I venture to introduce one more illustraton . Among the mountains of Switzerland are found little pure democracies which seem to link the government of the ancient primeval tribe to the Swiss constitution of 1848 . There is , however , no satisfactory evidence hat democracy in the modern sense of the word existed anywhere in Switzerland much earlier than 1848 . At any previous time , wherever the men who composed the little cal democracies were led to take part in a government inside of their ancient prescriptive rule , they have acted a ways quite undemocratic . They have shown no predilection in favour of democratic forms ; they have conned the privilege of governing to the hands of the conveniently few . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who compelled the close oligarchies which imposed the governments of the thirteen ruling cantons cease to play the tyrant over the eight subject cantons . lid after the Napoleonic wars it was the monarchies of Europe which compelled the thirteen oligarchies to admit to the Confederation on equal terms the remaining nine cantons . So in Switzerland , as elsewhere , modern democracy is distinctly modern .
