txt No Private Entertainment . That the Hudson-Fulton Celebration thus far has been a great success can not be well denied . In all its details , so far as the public functions are concerned there is nothing to criticise , but there is one eery important feature that seems to have been totally nezlected , and that is the absence of the entertainment of our foreign visitors by any of our private citizens . I have seen no mention of any such in any of the journals of the dhy , and if what I hear is well founded , the foreigners themselves have commented , of course in a sub rosa manner among themselves , on the absence of any hospitality of an individual character . This Is In strong contrast to the manner in which our representatives have been entertained abroad , particularly on the occasion of the recent voyage of our fleet of battleships around the world . This oversight on the part of our leading citizens Is likely to seriously damage the good name we have hitherto borne for our hospitality . KNICKERBOCKER. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
