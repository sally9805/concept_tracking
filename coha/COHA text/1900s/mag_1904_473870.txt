THE University of Athens : what meaning does the phrase bear to the reader ? I can easily believe that to one it is simply a historic symbol . It represents that small group of philosophers , poets , and historians who in and near the age of Pericles were the teachers of the Athenian youth , and who have become , not by their conscious purpose , but by the dignity of their character and the weight of their message , the teachers of the youth of every progressive nation . To one who thus interprets the phrase it stands for Raphael 's " The School of Athens . " But to another the phrase may represent not a historic symbol , but a modern force or condition . It is simply an agency which is concerned with a few general academic functions . Like the term " the University of the State of New York , " which has no local habitation , which confers directly no degrees , which prepares no academic budget , and which has no faculty , yet which supervises the educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Athens " may easily be understood to refer to the headship of the whole educational system of Greece . But the University of Athens is neither a historic symbol nor a chief administrative force . It is a university , as local and of as definite functions as Columbia in New York or as Harvard in Cambridge . It has buildings , placed in the midst of the modern city of one hundred and fifty thousand people , more beautiful than those of any American college , with possibly two or three exceptions . It has a body of some twelve hundred students in its four departments of Arts and Sciences , Law , Medicine , and Theology . It enrolls a faculty of one hundred members . It has a library of two hundred and fifty thousand volumes , housed in a noble marble building which may be compared , even if its location be less impressive , with the library building at Columbia . It has also laboratories of the sciences , placed in buildings which show the advantages and disadvantages of the construction of twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local , modern institution of the higher learning and teaching . Yet I hasten to say that the present University of Athens more adequately embodies the Greek life and influence of twenty-four hundred years ago than any other institution . If the influence of ancient Greece is borne into the modern world through literature , sculpture , and architecture , the life of ancient Greece is continued in the personality and services of the teachers of her chief university . The University of Athens , like the worthy university of every metropolis , stands for the ripest culture and the highest attainment of its best people . Its buildings bear the same relation to its teachers and students which the plane-trees of Plato 's Academy bore to his associates . Its professors are simply teachers , constituted by authority and in orderliness , as were Socrates and Plato . It is , therefore , in the marble halls of the University of Athens that one feels himself quite as near to the greatest of the greatest nations of antiquity as among the broken columns of the Parthenon . Justinian closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine hundred years the Academy of Plato ceased . The modern university was founded in 1837 . After a lapse of thirteen centuries Plato 's Academy was reopened . The University of Athens is one of the results of the War of Liberation . Ifthat war arose , in part at least , from a more enlightened spirit , an effect of the war was still further to liberalize and to quicken this spirit . The . Greek mind sought to give itself those advantages and opportunities which three and a half centuries of Turkish rule and misrule and a longer period of Byzantine control had denied . Its establishment sprung out of those same human and humanistic impulses which , under conditions broad and rich , or narrow and bare , have contributed to the foundation of hundreds of universities in the Old World and the New . Its foundation , too , was a part of a general movement for education . The schools of Greece which we call primary , secondary , academic , took on a more formal system . During these almost threesome years and ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements and parts of the educational system . Founded in that fourth decade of the last century which is made illustrious in the history of the higher education in the United States by the foundation of great institutions , the University of Athens soon numbered three hundred students ? a number large for a kingdom small and poor . Its progress throughout the century has been steady . It has grown and strengthened with the growth and strengthening of Greece . It is , therefore , not too much to say that the University of Athens is the most important institution of a nation which has made richest contributions to education and to literature . Such a recognition of its place and functions is common among the Greeks . A democratic nation of a good degree of civilization is most friendly to its institutions of the higher education . The Greeks are essentially democrats . Of their university they are nobly and humbly proud . Of it , in their wide dispersion , they think as the Jews during their exiles thought of their holy city ; and to it they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the seven millions scattered in Turkey , Epirus , Thessaly , and wherever favoring or ill fortune has carried them . The University of Athens is called a national university . The name is wisely chosen : it is national , ? but it is not governmental . The German universities are national , and they are sometimes also more governmental than national . Not such is the University of Athens : it belongs to the people . The government , through the Minister of Education , performs certain formal functions , in the making of appointments , but the supportis derived from the people more than from the exchequer . The buildings were built by the offerings of the nation . The buildings , too , which have association more or less intimate with the university , represent the beneficence of individuals . The library building is the gift of the Villianos brothers ; the neighboring school for girls , the Arsakion , was founded and endowed by Mr. Arsais ; the Academy of Science was built by Baron Sine of Vienna , as was the Observatory ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the magnificent Stadium is the result of a gift of one million dollars made by a lover of Athens . The American habit of beneficence to institutions of education is also Greek . For the higher education is peculiarly dear to the heart of the modern Greek . Regard for it is stronger and niece widely spread among all classes than obtains among any other European people . Many a Greek home of small resources , and even of poverty , gladly sacrifices precious interests that a son may be educated . This son , too , coming to the university , is not unlike the American youth who earns his way through college . In most Continental universities self-support , in part or wholly , is far less usual than in American colleges . But in Greece the American custom seems to prevail . Any work which a student can do in a city like Athens is done by scores of these men . Serving as janitors , as waiters , selling newspapers , doing chores of all sorts , represent this work . The tales , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an education , in the city of Socrates are akin to the stories which every American college president gladly and sadly hears . It is hard to get a full college life without a dormitory . Propinquity promotes fellowship . Doing away with the halls of residence at Oxford or Yale or Princeton would be doing away with what not a few regard as the most important conditions of these ancient foundations . But Athens , in common with Continental universities , has no dormitories . Yet , despite this most serious lack , a mighty spirit of loyalty to each other and to their university prevails among the students . They have , on what they regard as most serious occasions , stood together againstthe government . There is not , too , quite the same feeling of distinction prevailing among the professional students and what we should call the undergraduates in the European as in the American colleges . Medical student , law student , theological student , as well as philosophical student , stand together against the philistine world . In one of the courts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lost their lives iu an endeavor to oppose what they and their fellows regarded as governmental usurpation . Yet be it said that these men are usually more quiet and orderly than the " town " in most countries finds the " gown . " One of the most picturesque forms of student life is seen in the gymnasiums . The modern gymnasium of Athens is quite as unlike the ancient as the gymnasium of an American college is unlike what the German means by a gymnasium . The modern gymnasium of Athenian students ? more a private club than a university institution ? is both like and unlike the American . The Athenian institution is a combination of a gymnasium building and an athletic field . It is a gymnasium out-of-doors , fitted up with all kinds of apparatus , and containing opportunities and facilities for track athletics of all sorts . Each field , also , has a building , usually small , containing bath and dressing rooms . Few things make more vivid and impressive the ancient life than seeing these young fellows , vigorous and happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump , or swinging on the bars . The fascination of the old and the new Olympic games is upon these men as it can not be on our American college man , although the American college man bore of more prizes at the last great contest than the Greek . That magnificent modern and ancient stadium , too , is near in distance and feeling . Be it said , however , that the general physical build of the Greek man is not so athletic as is the constitution of the better-trained American student . The very rigors of the American climate , which prevent our having a gymnasium without a roof and without a floor , may aid in developing a stronger set of men than the semitropical skies of Greece permit . The most important of the four schools which constitute the University of Athens is the School of Law . Such an importance I like to interpret as rather a development of the Greek mind than as having special relation to politics or to governmental service as a career . For the Greek mind is pre-eminently interpretive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once be said that service for and through the government represents an inviting opportunity for not a few men in the democracy of Greece , as in the democracy of most nations . The Greek mind , too , is giving a good account of itself in the science of medicine . Those conditions which one finds in the best medical schools of the United States and Germany one finds in the laboratories at Athens . The clinics , too , and hospital advantages are good for a city of a hundred and fifty thousand people and for a neighboring country thinly settled . But it is only fair to say that the tendency to enter the legal or medical profession is altogether too strong . I do not presume that Greece , any more than America , has too many first-rate doctors or lawyers ; but that the number of lawyers and doctors is far in excess of the demands of the community is evident in each country . Greece needs more engineers , more intelligent farmers , more capable administrators in industry , commerce , finance . Farming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remunerative . Railroads in Greece are few and short . Even if the country be small , a proper system should be inaugurated . The steamships which come into her ports are usually British , Austrian , Italian , or French . She should establish her own lines . The country would vastly profit by an effective system of irrigation . However capable the Greek may be , the land of Greece is yet to receive its agricultural and industrial development . For this purpose the technical development in education , in which Germany and the United States are leading , should be at once inaugurated . The beginnings already made , as intimated in the Polytechnic School situated near the university and near the National Museum , should be immediately and greatly extended . A nation can live too much in its past , even if that past contains a history which bears such names as Greek history bears , ? even if that past is associated with a geography which includes Salamis and Marathon . A university in its service for the people of its own nation is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarly needs , it is also to render a service to all men of that sort which by its history or location or constitution it is specially fitted to render . There is one form of service which the university of Athens is peculiarly fitted to give to man ; it is represented in arclmology . The records of the past of Greece she is the one force in all the world best situated to read and to interpret . That this duty she has not done , and is not doing , in significant ways is evident . But for not taking up this task she is not to be altogether blamed . The Greek Archaeological Society is rendering the service which on many grounds be-. longs to the university , and in personal relations the association of this society with the university is intimate . Other nations and universities , too , have in part at least relieved Greece and her chief institution from bearing archaeological burdens . Under different names and with diverse origins at least four nations are investigating Greek history . The French school , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of classical studies represent forces which have done much and are to do more to interpret the life of ancient Greece to their respective peoples and to the world . Each of these schools has a building of its own ? two of them , the French and the German , being near the university ; each of them is a centre and source of scholastic and archaeological interest , and each of them enrolls from time to time great scholars on its teaching staff . They in a sense represent an offering of the scholastic world to Greece and to its university . Such an offering , given and accepted in graciousness , represents a high type of co-operative beneficence . For the field of research and of excavation is large , the expense is great , and the risk of securing no result is nothing less than immense . And the results , when secured , belong not to Greece alone , but to that whole world which is a debtor to Greece . The official head of the university is Professor N. Kazazis . I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater regard and respect than are contained in the words spoken regarding him . He is among the first citizens of the city and of the nation . If Greece were to become a republic ? a result not impossible in the shifting political conditions and in the made character of the present throne , ? Kazazis would be called upon to be a candidate for the Presidency . The public respect paid to the president of the university is itself evidence of the degree to which the ideals and atmosphere of culture and the higher education have come to pervade Greek society . A sense of proportion and of justice , self-restraint , dignity , delicacy , idealism , ? these are qualities for which the Greek character in its higher relations has stood for twenty-five centuries . Under conditions , racial and personal , most trying and difficult , these qualities have persisted . Their development is to-day most fittingly promoted by the university of the city of Pallas Athena.                    @
