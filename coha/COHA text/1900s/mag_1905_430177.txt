 | It was in the winter of 1878 ? 79 that I first saw Emerson . A Harvard schoolmate had proposed a jaunt on foot to Concord . The British line of retreat was followed and the historic road is less well remembered by one of the pair of pedestrians than the conversation of C ? , his companion , a down-easter from Maine . Might a bumpkin from the South have anticipated the miles would be lightened by disputations on Shelley 's poetry and the metaphysical doctrines of Hegel ? T. H. Green was then an arbiter with many in Cambridge and if C ? had preserved his perfect poise when talking to Emerson that day , the Concord Sage would have been more deeply impressed by our visit than he was , for C ? could have given him a rhapsody of which Coleridge as a youth need not have been ashamed . My companion had a mind distinguished for searching , ranging curiosity and it was to this characteristic , it may be added , that our sight of Emerson was one . Arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manse were " done . " A momentary fear was felt returning to the village that the hailstorm of C ' s questions addressed to a caretaker would batter down utterly an ancient roadside structure that showed bullet-marks of the famous battle . Passing through the village , C ? was instant to call upon Emerson . A strong demurrer was of no avail . A downright refusal to accompany him availed as little . He went in . I waited near the Wayside and reflected in a pale way of Bronson Alcott and in a less pale , but still moonlit , fashion of Hawthorne and his footfall in the grove on the hillside mounting directly behind the venerable old home . While I stood there C returned , reporting Emerson as away , but as certain to return from Boston at six o'clock . He was firm for remaining to see him and while debate was proceeding , a stately woman came towards us , going as I at once surmised on a visit to neighbors at the Wayside . She approached us however and addressing us began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emerson , I said a word deprecatingly about intrusion . This was promptly put aside . " Mr. Emerson is always glad to see Harvard students . " The ground became firm at once and thanking her for her thoughtful courtesy , C ? and I made off for Walden Pond . We looked upon that somewhat drear body of water , inspected the ruins of Thoreau 's hut and returned to the village only to have a native at the inn where we stopped shatter romantic thoughts of the hermit of the woods . This native told us as something within his own knowledge that some member of Thoreau 's family used regularly at intervals to carry him a basket of supplies . After listening for some time to this and other natives talk , catching at such provincialisms as reminded one of the Biglow Papers , in which I had recently immersed myself , C ? and I walked on to the Emerson home . Our ring was promptly answered by Miss Emerson and we were shown into what I took to be the parlor . I saw nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Melos and as I had fallen under the spell with which that lady continues to rules the world , I am not ashamed to confess that I noted the existence of not one object besides in the room where we sat . Mr. Emerson came down in a few minutes and conducted us into his library . Here the eye fell at once upon an impressive array of tall black volumes , the lowest in rank on his shelves . With no warrant but fancy I have ever since chosen to associate them with Hindoo philosophy . He began by asking us where we were from and what were our classes in the college . We told him of our respective studies and if there was any ambition in our statements this was dashed . He persisted throughout the conversation in holding us to be freshmen . C ? with a bachelor 's degree , was studying divinity and our host had an arch speech about his having begun his career as a minister of a denomination , the name of which he frankly confessed he could not recall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful " yes " and " all ! my young friends when you grow old you must not suffer your memory to play you tricks like this . " On learning I was from the South , he said he had a classmate from the South . He recalled that this classmate succeeded Calhoun in the Senate , but could not recollect his name . My own prompting , " Barnwell , " brought its own cheerful " yes . "  | Barnwell had been highly regarded by his companions at Cambridge ; of none was a future more confidently predicted . Emerson had lost touch with him , however , until after the war , when he learned Barnwell was in a straitened way financially . This moved a number of Barnwell 's friends to bestir themselves in his behalf . No initiative was named , but I was persuaded it was Emerson 's own . I made bold to inquire whether Barnwell figured in a conversation between two congressmen set out in the essay on " Immortality , " where the statesmen are presented as foiled seekers of proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own writings , I was reassured by his benignant " no . " Our visit was a brief one . I was lingeringly oppressed with the idea that we were without a true call to be there . As we were leaving he pointed to a well-known lithograph portrait of Lowell , that hung unframed on his door and asked if we knew him . I had to say it was my one keen regret that Lowell had left Cambridge before I reached the university . He added a handsome word about Lowell , the man , and told us how happy Lowell had been to receive his appointment to the Spanish Mission . Following us to the door , he manifested the gravest concern that I had no overcoat with me and from his repeated expressions of fear that I should certainly be ill , I am quite sure that if I had not stoutly put the suggestion away , I could , for once in my life , have worn a philosopher 's coat . I saw Mr. Emerson twice afterwards . Once on the occasion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard , and again on the occasion of the Bayard Taylor memorial exercises in Tremont Temple , Boston . The friend and helper of those who would live in the spirit , remains stamped in my recollections , ever thoughtful , kindly , with a sort of radiance about him .
