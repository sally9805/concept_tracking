txt Mrs. Gladstone , widow of William E. Gladstone , the English statesman , died at 5:40 P. M. to-day . Mrs. Gladstone , who had been unconscious for about seventy-two hours , died without recovering consciousness . The news was immediately conveyed to the Queen , the Prince of Wales , the Dean of Westminster , the Dean of Lincoln , Sir William Vernon-Harcourt , Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman , Arthur J. Balfour , and others . In the course of the evening Master William Gladstone , heir to Hawarden , arrived from Eton , shortly followed by two sisters from London . The bells of Ha-warden Church rang muffled peals . By courtesy of the Dean of Westminster , and in accordance with arrangements made in 189S , the funeral will be held in the  --  Abbey . The interment will take place probably on June 19 , being of as private a character as possible . Mrs. Catherine Gladstone was looked upon as one of the most potent factors in the success of her husband , William Ewart Gladstone , who died in 1898 . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubly so in his later years , and aroused the interest and affectionate admiration of both continents . Mr. Gladstone , in a speech to his neighbors in 1S89 , in acknowledging his wife 's devotion , said : " Whatever of success I have attained in my career has been chiefly due to the devoted comforter , counselor , and companion by my side . " Her fortune and her family , also , were of decided service to the statesman , who was not a great man at the time of his marriage , and who at that time was considered hardly the social equal of his wife . Mrs. Gladstone was born Jan. 6 , 1812 , and was the eldest daughter of a Welsh Baronet , Sir Stephen Glynne of Hawarden . The title became extinct on the death of her brother , the estates being thus left to Mrs. Gladstone , with remainder to her eldest son . It was in this way that Mr. Gladstone came to occupy the now famous Hawarden Castle . A. sister of Mrs. Gladstone married Lord Lyttleton . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke of Devonshire , and the Duke of Buckingham . She was married to Mr. Gladstone in 1839. on the same day that her youngest sister was married to Lord LyttletOn . She accompanied him upon nearly , if not all , - of his political tours , and was usually present when he delivered his speeches in Parliament . Numerous stories are told of the way she encouraged and assisted her husband in his public life . It has been said that she would take great pains to keep anything disagreeable out of his way , and would even destroy a copy of The Times on its delivery if it contained an article which she thought would displease him . It used to be said that when Mr. Gladstone left his seat in the House of Commons to don his coat his wife would follow him into the cloakroom from the ladies ' gallery and would there prepare for him a drink of sherry and egg , and would then adjust his muffler and see that he was helped on with his great coat . Although accustomed to life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple in her tastes , even to the point of plainness . Her neglect or forgetfulness of conventionalities was proverbial , with the result that she was never popular in London society , though she was always loved by the masses in England . Early in the seventies , when Mr. Gladstone was at the head of the Government , Mrs. Gladstone often gave great offense by failing to in- ; vite people of consequence to her parties , ' causing the London wits to say that she put her invitations under the sofa instead of giving them to the servants to deliver . The story is told that in 1819 , when the Speaker of the House of Commons was Mr. Brand , Mrs. Gladstone constantly neglected to invite him to her receptions , though his family was on intimate terms with the Gladstones . It was afterward explained to Mr. Brand that the omission could not have been intentional . At the very next reception , however , the same thing happened . The Brands gOt no cards , but acting on the verbal suggestion they went . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a paper stuck into the mirror opposite the door . On it was written in a large hand : " Mein : To invite those Brands . " While these peculiarities in Mrs. Glad . stone were noticed they came to the talked about and laughed at , so that their effect was never lasting . Once , in 1876 , when Mr. Gladstone was. , speaking at Blackheath to a crowd that kept interrupting his speech with hoots and hisses , the clouds , which until then had obscured the sky , suddenly rolled - away and the sun commenced to beat down on the head of the speaker . Suddenly Mrs. ? Gladstone stood up , and opening a very domestic-looking umbrella , held it over him to protect him from the sun . The spectacle of the old couple stanSing together appealed to the crowd , which cheered lustily , and from that moment they were with the ' speaker . Mrs. Gladstone was known also for her philanthropy and charity . With Mr. Gladstone , she started in 1803 the Newport Market Refuge at Soho , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached . During the cholera epi- ; demic in 1866 , when the East of London was severely attacked , Mrs. Gladstone made regular visits to the London hospitals and provided shelter for many of the victims of the disease . Her Free Convalescent Home , known as Woodsford Hall , which was established in 18138 , in Essex , resulted from this service . During the cotton famine in Lancashire in 1862 Mrs .. : Gladstone turned a house which stood in ' ; the courtyard of her home into a training home for nurses , and afterward made of it an orphanage for boys , which has been ; maintained for over twenty-five years . About 1880 a home for training young girls for service was opened at Notting Hill , London , of which Mrs. Gladstone was made President . Mrs. Gladstone also had a hand in inaugurating many other chart . table institutions . Mrs. Gladstone had three sons and three daughters . Her eldest son , William Henry , who died in 1891 , held the office of Lord of ehe Treasury from 1879 to 1880 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now rector of Hawarden , and the Hon. Herbert John Gladstone , her third son , was . Lord of the Treasury , ( 1881-5. ) afterward Financial Secretary of the War Office , and later Under Secretary of the Home Office . He has been a Member of Parliament from Leeds since 1880 . Of Mrs , Gladstone 's daughters , Miss Helen G. Gladstone , who was born in 1849 , was edudated at home and at Newnham College , Cambridge , of which she was afterward made Vice Principal .
