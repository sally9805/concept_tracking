Foit two reasons Italy has obtained an unenviable reputation in re gard to crime . Not only has a very careful study of crime among the Italians been made by criminologists , but it so happens that crime in that country has been frequently accompanied by extraordinary circum stances . It has thus come to pass that many persons have formed the impression that our beautiful country is privileged ground for the pro duction of criminals . For example , after the assassination of King Hum bert , the newspapers and letters which I received from the United States contained , directly or indirectly , the most severe as well as the most un just estimates of the character of the Italian people . A young lady of Indiana , who has been in Italy , and who is incapable of descending to mere vulgar prejudices , wrote thus to a friend of mine : " The assassination of King Humbert has called forth many bitter and scathing remarks upon the Italian in general . It has been said that almost all anarchists are of that nationality ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they become angry , would as soon kill a person as look at him ; that they are all alike in that respect ; etc. , etc . You have no idea of what things have been said . " All this is , indeed , most lamentable , and reminds one of the lady who once asked if all Italians were " fruit-store men " ! Taken all in all , it is true that the knife and the revolver have gained for the Italians an unenviable notoriety . The history of the temporary emigration of Italians to Switzerland , France , and Germany , and of their permanent emigration to the other side of the Atlantic , particularly to the United States , is rife with disagreeable facts ; and , unfortunately , newspaper writers , with their customary exaggerations , have managed to render such facts glaringly revolting . Now , in these days , when so many Italians have become American citizens , and are participating in the po litical events of that country , I think it may not be uninteresting to the readers of TILE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account concerning homicide among Italians . A search after the truth is always useful . Moreover , the prejudice against Italians does not exist in the United States aloiw . Even in Italy unfavorable criticism concerning the char- acter of the Italian has been supported by certain statistics , poorly collected , however , and still more poorly interpreted . I refer to the statistics reported by Lombroso 's school of criminology . Indeed , the most eminent man of this school has accredited the Italians with ferity as their principal characteristic ! Every Italian who holds himself aloof from the prejudices of ordinary patriotism will recognize that the moral conditions of our country are not of the best , and that in the general statistics of homicide Italy holds a disgraceful supremacy . More murders are committed in Italy than in Spain or Hungary ; and in the latter two countries the number of homicides has been supposed to be the largest in Europe . Having said this much , with a sincerity which none can doubt , it remains for us to examine into the details concerning the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of 12.58 per 100 , - 000 inhabitants in Italy have been accused of homicide . A more detailed study brings to light these facts : ( 1 ) The provinces of Italy which give the highest averages for homicide are Girgenti , 52.65 ; Sassari , 36.53 ; Trapani , 33.25 ; Palermo , 32.25 ; and Naples , 31.76. ( 2 ) Those which yield the lowest averages are Mantua , 1.87 ; Bergamo , 2.12 ; Padua , 2.15 ; Sondrio , 2.47 ; and Cremona , 2.65 . These figures go to prove that there exists in Italy a large zone ? almost all northern Italy ? which , as regards homicide , very nearly approaches the most civilized countries of Europe . Difficult as is the study of crime in the United States , it may be said that there exists in that country also an enormous difference in the criminal statistics of different regions . For example , in the statistics for 1898 we find a maximum of 20 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in New York . In San Francisco the number was 13.33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington has the small percentage of 0.73 . Italy and the United States are pre-eminent in regard to the differences in social conditions found in the different sections of the same country . And here I must call attention to another point . The various political crimes of the Italians have given the enemies of democracy the pretext of attributing the high criminal average to the propaganda through which the popular factions ? republicans , radicals , and socialists ? are seeking to spur the Italian people on to a more highly civilized life . Now , statistics show that the crime of homicide is greatest in the south of Italy ? in Sardinia and Sicily ? that is to say , in those parts where the fewest republicans and socialists are to be found ; where , in fact , they do not exist as a political party . If we look upon homicide from the  | standpoint of political propagandism , we are forced to admit that in Italy , as in Germany , such propaganda exerts a moderating influence over crime . In the north of Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homicide is at a minimum , radicals , republicans , and socialists abound , and are organized into strong political factions . But let us leave for the moment this argument concerning political revolutionary propaganda . I have said that northern Italy is in a state of moral superiority , as compared to southern Italy , from the standpoint of statistics of homicide . But he is mistaken who believes that this superiority has always existed . At a period not very long past , i.e. , at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth , Lombardy , Piedmont , and Venice ? which to-day are objects of universal envy and admiration ? were morally in a very inferior condition . The Piedmontese , Lombards , and Venetians of that time strongly resembled the Sardinians and Sicilians of the present day . This proves that crime is not a question of race , as some pseudo-scientists , who love to cling to the old formuhe and thus profoundly impress the ignorant , would have us believe . And if the history of the past disposes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of race , so does the history of the present encourage us to hope for the gradual moral regeneration of all the regions of southern Italy , now so stained with the crime of murder . This hope is not merely founded on ardent desire , but is based on actual statistics . To prove this , we need simply to compare the statistics of 1879 ? 83 with those of 1895 ? 97 ; for this comparison shows very clearly that homicide is diminishing appreciably throughout all Italy , and that the average has dropped from 17.88 per 100,000 inhabitants , to 12.58 . The diminution has been considerable in some provinces of central Italy . In Ancona it has fallen from 19.83 to 8.86 ; in Pesaro , from 18.02 to 7.29 ; in Leghorn , from 21.38 to 5.53 . This diminution is also generally noticeable in the provinces of the south . One province alone in all Italy is a melancholy exception to the rule ? Naples . Here homicide statistics show an increase from 26.71 to 31.76 . And yet this is not to be wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Noteworthy also is the fact that the diminution of homicide in Italy has been neither accidental nor irregular . It has , indeed , been both regular and continuous . From 5,418 homicides in 1880 , the number fell to 3,868 in 1896 . And this reduction of some 30 per cent in the general average of the country was brought about without any direct influence of education , with which the Italian Government does not greatly  | concern itself . It has been determined by other social factors , which have indirectly spread their advantageous influences ? roads , the telegraph , newspapers , commerce , facility of access to the most refined and cultivated centres , and , above all , emigration . Emigration has been of assistance in a number of ways : ( 1 ) Because emigration is generally undertaken by men , and , for the most part , youths , who yield the largest proportion of homicides. ( 2 ) Those who depart help to improve the condition of those who remain , either by means of an increase in earnings on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emigrants send home from abroad . In fact , the amount sent home to Italy by emigrants reaches a total of about 300 , - 000,000 lire per annum. ( 3 ) Education has been of assistance ; for , when emigrants return from cultured surroundings , such as Switzerland , France , and the United States afford , they exert a helpful influence on their relatives and friends at home . And now let us ask : If in less than twenty years , without any organized effort to decrease the number of homicides , we have obtained such satisfactory results , what wonders might not come to pass if the State and the ruling classes should endeavor , directly and persistently , to combat this crime ? If they should do this , Italy would be no longer pointed out to the world as the nation of crime . The study of the causes which bring about crime is one of very great interest , and is now being prosecuted with the utmost diligence in Italy , where the criminal phenomenon is most intensely manifest . Our form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education encourages it ; and , above all , the want of culture encourages it . Where education is lacking , there is wanting also the development of the soul , without which no check is placed upon the human passions . On the other hand , in places where education has advanced , it has had the effect of moderating the criminal tendency . Where we find the combination of oppression and ignorance , as has been the case for a long time in southern Italy , there the manifestations of crime are greatest . In the south of Italy , in Latium , Romagna , and Sicily , criminal associations sometimes assumed a political aspect . I shall not dwell here on the reports bearing upon the relation of the various systems of government to crimes of violence ; I shall turn , instead , to those reports referring to homicide and education . The reader must bear in mind , meanwhile , that instruction and education are intimately connected with political and economic conditions . Hence , while speaking of homicide and lack of education , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation and breadth of education . ' Flu ) intimate relation between homicide and the want of education may be found in every case , and Italy serves admirably for such demonst ration . Considering the invaluable statistics of Dr. Bosco ? one of the most noteworthy among the students of the conditions in the United States ? we find that , with the exception of certain small oscillations in smile of the provinces of Italy , the maximum of homicide coincides with that of the want of education . In Sardinia and in Sicily ? in the period 1879-83 ? the greatest number of homicides coincided with this lack of education . On the other hand , the smallest number of homicides is to lie found in Lombardy and Piedmont and in some parts of Emilia , where the lack of education is least in evidence . International comparisons confirm this report . Dr. Bosco , in his excellent study of homicide in the United States , has demonstrated that the same condition is true of the other side of the Atlantic as well . He has found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits of the people , rendering them nwro mild in disposition . Further data on the relation between education and homicide are furnished by another important publication , one belonging to the General Bureau of Statistics of IG , me , published iii 1890 , regarding the vocation of those guilty of homicide . While those who followed " roving " trades gave the enormous total of 4,738 convicted out of 100,000 individuals , we find that artisans , clerks , teachers , capitalists , and householders yielded not more than 288 convicted out of 100,000 . In the face of this , who can deny the influence of social conditions upon the genesis of crime ? The highest contingent of homicides comes from laborers and miners , who , as is well known , live a life of peril , poverty , and ignorance . The high total which marks the homicides in Girgenti and Caltanissetta may he traced to the poor , brutalized miners of Sicily , where mining life is most prevalent , and where education among the miners is nil . In my opinion , Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parallelism of homicide and ignorance . But examples are not wanting in other countries . In England the spread of education has greatly diminished the number of homicides . And yet , in two wellknown works , Mr. Merridon argued that it was unnecessary to educate criminals , that education was only an incentive to crime . In Switzerland education has almost eliminated homicide . What has occurred in the Ticino canton is eloquent proof of this . Sixty years ago , in that can- ton , as in Italy , homicides were frequent , and ignorance abounded . Today , we find that district ? which by the map is Italian , as it is by race , language , and religion ? morally and intellectually on a level with the rest of Switzerland and the other cultured countries of Europe . The few homicides which do occur ill the Ticino canton are , sad to relate , to a great extent committed by the Italian immigrants , who perpetrate there the crimes resulting from their poverty and ignorance . Having thus briefly discussed the conditions , let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them . These lessons , as regards Italy , are very clear : ( 1 ) IIumicide iii Italy is not a question of race ; ( 2 ) the manifestation of homicide is shown by statistics to vary with the social conditions ; and ( 3 ) first among the social factors of homicide is lack of education . Now , it can be very well maintained that education in itself is directly influential in diminishing capital crimes , for the reason that it checks impulsiveness and develops the moral qualities . The Italian Government falls disgracefully short in its duty as regards public education . The law of 1877 , which obliges all children to attend school as far as the third elementary class , is an ironical one , as no provision was made by the State to ensure that it would be carried into effect . Poverty prevents the people from sending their children to school . Indeed , poverty obliges these children to work . Again , the annual expenditure for public education by the Italian Government is ridiculously small . In this respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following figures will indicate : The United States expends about 1,000,000,000 lire annually for educational purposes . And to Italy 's greater disgrace , we must remember that Switzerland , with one-tenth of Italy 's population , expends two-thirds more for education . In Italy , the government is merely the instrument of the wealthy ruling classes , and the constitution is a living falsehood . With a population of 30,000,000 there are not many more than 1,000,000 electors . In the eves of the Italian governing classes , whom the American tour- ists call " the best society in Italy , " the populace exists merely as a mechanism for work . For the ruling classes of Italy all the marvellous examples of educational institutions , which the English and Americans have spread over the world , have no value . And , as long as the majority of the Italian people deplore their own delinquencies , it is clear that the re.sjHonsil ) ility for the very unfavorable conditions under which the masses in Italy are forced to live rests upon the shoulders of the ruling classes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
