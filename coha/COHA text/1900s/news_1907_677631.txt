txt Mayor McClellan has been asked by the Brooklyn League to order an investigation of reports of faulty construction in the tunnel from the Battery to Brooklyn under the East River . At a special meeting on Saturday the league , which Is one of Brooklyn 's leading civic organizations , addressed a letter to the Mayor requesting him to appoint a disinterested engineer to make a thorough inspection of the twin tubes and to determine if there is anything In the persistent rumors about the tunnel . This letter was mailed on Saturday , and will be received by the Mayor this morning . John B. Creighton , Secretary of the league , said last night that the attention of the organization had been directed to the report of faulty construction in the tunnel several weeks ago , and that several Meetings had been held for the discussion Of the subject " The league seriously considered the matter and decided to send the letter to Mayor McClellan asking him to appoint an expert engineer , who is not connected with the construction of the tunnel ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation . " said Mr. Creighton . " It is the wish of the league to settle once for all the disconcerting ru- ' mors that the tunnel is not all it should be . " Elwin S. Piper , President of the Allied Boards of Trade of Brooklyn , said last ' , night that his organization stood ready - to co-operate with the Brooklyn League . He said that many stories regarding faulty construction in the tubes had come to his ears , and that an investigation should certainly be made if only to settle the fears of the public . William Barclay Parsons , who drew the Plans for the tunnel , while he was Chiet Engineer of the Rapid Transit Commission , denied strongly yesterday that the tubes were unsafe owing to the quicksand foundation under part of the construction . Mr. Parsons went through the tunnel last week , and says he thoroughly convinced himself that the two tubes are absolutely safe and that the public need have no fear of being swallowed up by a cave-in due to faulty construction . He said also that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Autumn . " I wish , first of all , to say that there is no cause for alarm on the part of the public , " said Mr. Parsons . " All these rumors about the East River tunnel between New York and Brooklyn being unsafe are poppy-cock . When it is completed it will be all that can be desired in tunnel construction and the public need have no fear to the contrary . " I was down there in the excavation last week and thoroughly inspected the work . So I know what I am talking about It has been printed broadly that the quicksand under the tubeL is a menace . We have it from the lips ) of George S. Rice . Chief Engineer of the Rapid Transit Commission , that the quicksand is not a menace to the safety of the-tunnel . He considered it unnecessary to place piling through this quicksand to form . a solid base for the tubes . But the construction company has made assurance doubly sure- by volunteering to place piling there . " About 120 of these piles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock bottom and not only part of the way , as it has been charged . It has been said , also that the piles do not reach to the rock , owing to a wish to have elasticitY . I wish to contradict this assertion . They are being sunk to the rock . The piles are of concrete and are as solid as rock . There are only two stretches , short ones , of quicksand . The other formation is rock and gravel and makes a good bed for the tubes . It is true that the tubes have settled somewhat . This settling occurred months ago , as the work progressed . These tunnels always settle . That is no cause for alarm . It is a feature of that class of work which is always expected . " This settling has occurred all along the route bt the East River tunnel , hardly more in one place than in another . It is due to the fine sand which forms part of the earth formation throtigh which the tubes are being built " " It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cast-iron plates which form part of the inner lining of the tubes are cracked and that the engineers are relying upon rust to fill up the cracks , " said the interviewer . " Yes , it is true that there are cracks in the tunnel , " replied Mr. Parsons . " In fact , the tunnel is all cracks in one sense . The iron segments are in sections . Wherever they are joined there Is a crack . That is true in all tunnels . The crack 's are being filled with iron filings , and the sal ammonia is used to conduce rust . Concrete is also being used , This is between the joints of the plates , in order to keep the water out . This method makes an air-tight and water-tight shell . " So far as plates which have cracks or imperfections in them being placed in the tunnel , I do not believe a word of it This filling of the cracks between plates by iron . filings and sal ammonia is a. regular practice of tunnel builders . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . " " When will the Mayor be asked to inspect the tunnel ? " Mr. Parsons was asked . " I can not answer that " : he replied . " That is a matter for the Rapid Transit Commission-to decide . But I can say that , judging from what I saw on my trip through the tunnel last week , it will probably be ready for the public in the early Autumn .
