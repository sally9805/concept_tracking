Copyright , 1908 by Paul Elder and Company Introduction Science may conquer the stars , but it does nothing by jumps . As a Scientist , as well as a philosopher , I am accustomed to reaching the Transcendental by winding paths . It is characteristic of me that I should have consented to preface this remarkable Sonnet Cycle only after supreme deliberation , and that I should at last have determined to speak in behalf of the Car Conductor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am fascinated by the phenomenon of Genius flourishing from bud to flower , from flower to seed . 2 . As a Psychologist I am anxious to establish once and for all , both by plano-inductive and precoordinate systems of logic , the Status of Slang . What position does Slang occupy in the thought of the world ? Let us turn to Zoology for an answer . No traces of Slang may be found among mollusks , crustaceans or the lower invertebrates . Slang is not common to vertebrate fishes or to whales , seals , reptiles or anthropoid apes - in a word , slang-speaking is nowhere prevalent among lower animals . It may , then , be definitely and clearly asserted that Slang is the natural , logical expression of the Human Race . If Man , then , is the highest of created mammals , is not his natural speech ( Slang ) the highest of created languages ? It is generally conceded that Literature is the most exalted expression of Language . Would not the Literature , then , which employs the highest of created languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? By such logical , irrefutable , inductive steps have I proven not only the Status of Slang , but the literary importance of these Sonnets which it is at once my scientific duty and my esthetic pleasure to introduce . The twenty-six exquisite Sonnets which form this Cycle were written , probably , during the years 1906 and 1907 . Their author was William Henry Smith , a car conductor , who penned his passion , from time to time , on the back of transfer-slips which he treasured carefully in his hat1 . We have it from no less an authority than Professor Sznuysko that the Car Conductor usually performed these literary feats in public , writing between fares on the rear platform of a Sixth Avenue car . Smith 's devotion to his Musa Sanctissima was often so hypnotic , I am told , that he neglected to let passengers on and off - nay , it is even held by some critics that he occasionally forgot to collect a fare . But be it said to his undying honor that his Employers never suffered from such carelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand double fares from the old , the feeble and the mentally deficient . Even as the illimitable ichor of star-dust , the mysterious Demiurge of the Universe , keeps the suns and planets to their orbitary revolutions , so must environment mark the Fas and Nefas of Genius . Plato 's Idea of the Archetypal Man was due , perhaps , as much to the serene weather conditions of Academe as to the marvelous mentality of Plato . What had Job eaten for breakfast that he should have given utterance to his magnificent Lamentation ? Was he the discoverer of Human Sorrow or the pioneer of Human Dyspepsia ? It is not altogether radical on my part , then , for me to assert that many of the stylistic peculiarities found in these Sonnets are attributable to the locale of their inspiration the rear platform of a Sixth Avenue car . One can plainly hear the jar and jounce of the elliptical wheels , the cry , " Step lively ! " the six o'clock stampede , the lament of the strap-hanging multitude in such lines as these : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet Pansy cometh nix to ride with me . I rubber vainly at the throng to see Her golden locks - gee ! such a discontent ! Perhaps she 's beat it with some soapy gent - " Where are lines like these to be found in the Italian of Petrarch ? Where has Tasso uttered an impassioned confession to resemble this : " But when I ogle Pansy in the throng My heart turns over twice and rings a gong " ? Of the human or personal record of William Henry Smith very little has been discovered . Looking over the books of the Metropolitan Street Railway I unearthed the following entry : " Nov. 1 , 1907 : " " W. H. Smith , conductor , discharged . " " Remarks : - Car No. 21144 , William Smith , conductor , ran into large brewery truck at So . E. cor . Sixth Ave . It is reported that Smith , to the neglect of his duty , was reading poetry from a book called ' Sonnets of de Heredia ' at the time of the accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethelbert Pangwyn , an actor starring in ' The Girl and the Idiot , ' a musical comedy , was killed . " " Smith was held for manslaughter , but Judge O ' Rafferty , who had seen ' The Girl and the Idiot , ' discharged the defendant , averring that the killing of Pangwyn did not constitute a crime . " What , then , has become of this minstrel who sang the Minnelieder of the Car-barns ? Like Homer , like Omar , like Sappho , like Shakespeare , he is a Voice singing out of the mists . He was but a Name to his employers ; and his friends , if he has friends , remember him not . These Sonnets , written neatly on twenty-six violet transfer-slips , were discovered , together with a rejection blank from a leading magazine , in the Dead Letter office . According to the current folk-lore in Harlem and the Bronx , Smith is now living in California employed as a brakeman on the Southern Pacific Railroad . Some aver that Pansy fell heiress to a sausage establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain that Pansy , Gill the Grip and Maxy the Firebug never existed in real life - were merely the mind-children of a Symbolist and a dreamer of dreams . To the latter theory I incline at a scholarly angle . This Cycle may be taken , perhaps , not so much as a living record of human experience as a lofty parable sounding the key-note of all human life . Gill the Grip is the Iago , the Mefistofele , the symbolism of a malevolent destiny . Maxy the Firebug may be the Poet 's interpretation of the Social Unrest , of Doubt , of progressive irresponsibility . Would it be going too far , then , to say that Pansy stands to us as the symbol of Pan-girlism - as an almost Anacreontic yearning for the type ? Or may not these Sonnets be taken , in a way , as a modern Vita Nuova wherein a Sixth Avenue Alighieri calls to his Beatrice and mourns within when , " Pansy-girl refuses to occur ? " So much for the Poet and his Purpose . Should any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines , let him consider that I , Wolfgang Copernicus Addleburger , have seen fit to introduce them to immortality . 1 Since the salary-books of the Metropolitan Street Railways show , during the year 1906 , 182 conductors named Smith in their employ , 38 of whom were named William Smith and 12 William Henry Smith , it is easy for the reader to conceive my task in establishing the identity of our Poet . W. C. A. The Love Sonnets of a Car Conductor Prologue Did some one ask if I am on the job ? I sure am to the pay-roll with my lay , A hot tabasco-poultice which will stay Close to the ribs and answer throb-to-throb . Here have I chewed my Music from the cob And followed Passion from the get-away Past the big Grand Stand where the Pousse-Caf ? Christens my Muse as Jennie-on-the-Daub . Hark ye , all marks who break the Pure Fool Law , How I , the Windy Wonder of the Age , Have fought the Tender Passion to a draw And got my mug upon the Sporting Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me with a Dislocated Nerve . I Am I in bad ? upon the tick of nine Today the Pansy got aboard my ship And sprung the Trans-Suburban for a trip . Say , she 's the shapely ticket pretty fine ! Next to her pattern Anna Held looks shine And Lilly Russell does n't know the grip . But oh ! she 's got a deep ingrowing tip That she must shy at honks like yours and mine . I says to her , " Fare , please ! " out loud like that , But she pipes , " Fade , Bill , fade ! you pinched my fare . " That get-back tripped your Oswald to the mat , And yet I yelled , " Cough up here , Golden Hair ! " Eh , what ? I got the zing from Pansy 's orb Which says , " Dry out now , Shorty , - please absorb ! " II A True McGlook once handed this to me : When little Bright Eyes cuts the cake for you Count twenty ere you eat the honey-goo Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunk what 's bats on spending free Ca n't four-flush when he 's paying rent for two . The pin to flash on Cupid is ' Skidoo ! ' The call for Sweet Sixteen is 23 . " But say ! Life looks goshawful on the stretch Without a Ray of Sunshine in my flat , With no one there to call me " Handsome wretch , " And dust the fuzz and mildew off my hat . If she was waiting at the church tonight You 'd find me there with wedding-bells all right ! III Pansy got on at Sixteenth Street last night , And some one flipped a handspring in my heart . She snickered once , " Oh look , here 's Mr. Smart ! " Was I there Henry Miller ? guess you 're right ! I did the homerun monologue as bright As any scrub that ever learned the art . I plum forgot the signals , " Stop " and " Start ! " And almost wrecked the car once - guess I might ! I took one Mike six blocks beyond the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham And yodelled through his apopleptic face , " I think you 're dips ! " I says , " I know I am - " When Pansy starts to send a wireless wave She simply just ca n't make her eyes behave ! IV On every car there 's always one fat coot What goes to sleep and dreams he 's paid his fare . And when you squeak he gets the Roosevelt glare , And hoots , " I wo n't be dickied with - I 'll shoot ! " Then all the passengers get in and root . Loud cheers of , " Put him off ! " and " Make him square ! " Till Mr. Holdfast with an injured air Pungles his nick and ends the bum dispute . It 's ever thus on this here rolling ball - You 've got to pop your coin to ride so far . The yap that kicks and rings a deadhead call Must either spend or else get off the car . On Life 's Street Railway wealth may cut the cheese , But Death rings up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 'll be some fancy steps at Car-Barn Hall , " Gilly the Gripman pipes me off today , " This wo n't be any gabberfest - for say ! Nix but the candy goes to this here ball . You 've got to flash your union card , that 's all , To circulate the maze with Tessie May , And all the Newport push out Harlem way Will slip on wax till sunrise , - do you call ? " I told him that I pulled the gong for that ! If Pansy would be there ' t was was Me for It . I 'd burnish up my buttons , mop my hat , Polish my pumps and blow in for a hit . " All to the Fritz , " says Gill , " if you get jolly Around the curves - you 're apt to slip your trolley ! " VI The lemon-wagon rumbled by today And dropped me off a sour one - are you on ? I went and gave the boss a cooney con About the Car-Barn Kick - what did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gay , Jingle the jocund fares , nor think upon The larks of Harry Lehr or Bath House John , For they are It and you are still on pay . " So I have been sky-prancing all night long A-dragging car-conductors and their queens Clad in their laughing-robes to join the throng That makes the Car-Barn function all the beans . And say ! I had a brainstorm just last trip When I took Pansy 's fare from Gill the Grip . VII At Midnight when I got a gasp for lunch I mushed it for the Car-Barns just to lamp And see the Creamy Charlies do the vamp And swing their Fancy Floras in the crunch . I piped my Pansy in among the bunch And asked her would she mix it with the Champ , Would n't she like to join me in a stamp ? She saw me first and stopped me with a punch . I saw her hook a loop with Gill the Grip , With Pinky Smith and Handsome Hank she heeled ; With all the dossy bunks she took a skip Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightsome toe she sprung - As Caesar said to Cassius , " Ouch ! I 'm stung ! " VIII Forsooth that was a passing lusty clout That chopped me off with Pansy - do n't you fret ! There 's quite a blaze inside my garret yet , And all the Dipper Corps ca n't put it out . Gilly the Grip 's a pretty ricky tout - Under the old rag-rug for him , you bet , When I put on my Navajo and get One license to unloose my soul and shout . Perhaps he thinks I 'm old Molasses Freight Sidetracked at Pokey Pond and filled with prunes Waiting for Congress to appropriate The nuggets draped around me in festoons . Wait till I ticket Pansy , then I guess Slow Freight will switch to Honeymoon Express ! IX Today I gave a serenade to Gill ; I says , " To put it pleasant you 're a screech , Your smile would shoo the seagulls off the beach , Your face would give Vesuvius a chill . You 're just what Mr. Shakespeare calls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Now , if you want to answer with a speech , Open your trap at once , or else lie still . " But when I handed Gill the Grip this cluster He simply clamped his language-mill down tight , Strangled his guff and acted rather fluster Although I 'm sure I spoke to him polite . I guess that Mr. Gilly ai n't the kind That understands when people talk refined . X Three days with sad skidoo have came and went , Yet Pansy cometh nix to ride with me . I rubber vainly at the throng to see Her golden locks - gee ! such a discontent ! Perhaps she 's beat it with some soapy gent - Perhaps she 's promised Gill the Grip to be His No. 1 till Death tolls " 23 ! " While I am Outsky in the supplement . Now and anon some Lizzie flags the train And I , poor dots , cry , " Rapture , it is her ! " Yet guess again - my hope is all in vain And Pansy girl refuses to occur . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jabbers in a padded cell . XI My Trolley hikes to Harlem p.d.q. , And picks up pikers all along the beat . At six o'clock the aisles are full of feet , The straps with fingers , and the entire zoo Boils on the platform with a mad huroo Reckless as Bronx mosquitoes after meat . The widow stands , the fat man gets the seat And Satan smiles like Foxy M. Depew . And as we hikes along I thinks , thinks I , " The human race is like the ocean foam , Roaring and discontented , peevish , fly - " Say , why in blazes do n't they stay to home ? This travel-sickness is a danger which Keeps hoboes poor and corporations rich . XII Today I piped my future Ma-in-law . She got aboard my Pullman and she scared Three babies into fits the way she glared . Rattle my baggage if I ever saw A cracker-box to equal Mother 's jaw , A hardwood-finish face all nailed and squared . She ossified the gripman when she stared - And me ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pansy 's Ma , ' t was up to me To hand her something pit-a-pat and swell , And so I says , " Hello , Queen Cherokee ! What ho ! for Pansy ? hope she 's feeling well . " And Ma responds , a trifle tart but game , " She minds her bizness - hope you feel the same . " XIII I do n't think Mother chalked me out to win , To be the steady of her darling child . She thinks I am a kick-up , something wild , And no sweet girl should wear my college pin . She thinks I 'm some too piffly with my chin And my soft prattle simply gets her riled . I 've lost my keys with her , to put it mild , I do n't belong , because I am not In . Say how , with such an iceberg on the track , Can I conduct my car to married bliss ? I hoped that I could whistle Pansy back , And lo ! I got a frostbite off of this ! I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - But stab me if I 'll syrup to her Ma ! XIV E'en as I stood with cobwebs in my tower A candy vision came and flagged the boat - Give forty rah-rah-rahs ! O joy , O gloat ! ' T was Pansy like a fairy in a bower Warbling , " Hi , stop the car ! " With all my power I yanked the bell . My brain was all afloat , My heart cut pin-wheels , stole a base at throat , Sang " Tammany " - and knighthood was in flower . I helped her on . My shoes were full of feet . I says , " How 's Ma ? " She answers , " Going some . " I doffed my lid and ventured to repeat The breeze had put the weather on the bum . Then she replied , not seeming sore or vexed , " It may not be so punk on Sunday next . " XV The Sinful Rich go whizzing by all day In wealthy wagons , looking pert and swell ; They get the ride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microbes wend their way . Maxy the Firebug says that Mammon 's sway Is stringing Virtue to a fare-ye-well , But wait , he says , till Labor with a yell Soaks Mam a crack forninst the vertebray . The Rich , says Max , are simply dips and yeggs That lift the headlight beads from yaps like us ; They pinch your pie , sew up our ham and eggs And leave us minus all that they are plus . The world , says Max , belongs to me and Bill And Mrs. Casey - whoa ! let 's roll a pill ! XVI At Mrs. Casey 's hunger-killing shop Whither I his thrice daily for my stew , I dream I 'm Mr. Waldorf as I chew My prunes or lay my Boston-baked on top . Growley and sinkers , slum and mutton sop , India-rubber jelly known as " glue , " A soup-bone goulash with a spud or two , Clatter below until I signal " Stop ! " There may be chefs in France or Albany Can knock a poem from a wedge of pie ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For rapid-filling ballast , murmurs I. Kings may prefer some tasty wads of hash , But they do n't feed at fifteen cents per crash ! XVII Pansy and me for Coney Sunday noon To see a perfect lady bump the bumps ; We rubbered at the lions with the chumps And took the Wellman special to the moon . She asks me , " Dance ? " I answers , " Just as soon , " And so we clutched and whirled into the gumps , But every time I went to stir my stumps They stuck like gum-drops to a macaroon . " I could die dancing , Danny ! " murmurs she . ( I gambolled on her corns , she hollered , " Do n't ! " ) " I could die dancing also " ( this from me ) , " " But if you 'll pass me up , I guess I wo n't . " Just then some lemon-sport observed my glide And warbled , " Slide , you frozen chicken , slide ! " XVIII I next sprung Pansy for a four-bit feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? We shot the bill-of-fare from soup to pie And lemonade ( that cost an extra seed ) . " You 're the cute plunge , " says Pans ' , and I agreed That at a spenderfest I was n't shy , - That when it came to rolling nickels by , Willie the Cowboy was a perfect bleed . She said that Thomas Lawson on a lark Would faint away to see the way I blew ; She said I 'd be the whizz in Central Park , And Ready Cash to me seemed very few . I asked her , Did she need a Valentine ? And she responded , " You 're the pink for mine ! " XIX We took the iron-clad wave-tub home at ten , And as we sat conversing on the deck A certain Hester-street spaghetti-neck Pipes through the darkness , " Who 's yer ladyfren ' ? " There might have been a hoe-down there and then ( That war-ship never came so near a wreck ) ; The dog-eye boy got just as pale as heck And made a duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamped me by a flip . " Nixie the kindergarten ! " murmurs she . " Gents , " I replied out loud , " Get off the ship And walk , or else nail down that repartee . This yard of lace I 'm holding , so to speak , Is pinned on tight - or will be in a week . " XX A-lopping on a car-barn bench I spied Gilly the Grip , quite recent this g. m. , Just like a lily on a broken stem Or like a Salt Lake buck without a bride . " Chirk , Gilly , chirk ! " I says in tones of pride , " Perhaps this unhinged heart is just pro tem . The world is full of pompadours for them That keep their search-lights peeled from side to side . " But Gill remarked , " Eh , what ? Say , I 'm so slow I could n't catch the hour-hand on a clock . I 'm simply stationary as they grow ; . A lamp-post race could beat me round the block . You need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a quarry-cart like me ! " XXI Next week the wedding-bells wo n't do a thing , For I 'll be there , I guess , to fill the set , And Pansy 's Ma , she wo n't be late , you bet , To see the Reverend Mr. pull the string . Me for a spike-tailed scabbard and a ring , A shell-back shirt , forsooth a peacherette . I 'll be the daintiest bridegroom ever yet ; Nothing to do but take the count , then - bing ! Love in a cottage run on union pay - Can Teddy Roosevelt do a sum like that ? Two can eat cheap as one , perhaps , but say , You 've got to beat a quarter pretty flat To cork three squares , make Little Two Shoes snug And keep the Wolf from chewing up the rug . XXII Methinks I 'm tagged to join the Worry Club , To chase the fleeting rhino through the gloom , To bag the boodle , trap the wild mazume And scratch for corn when Pansy hollers " Grub ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chub When on the First , with dull and deadly boom , The Rent comes round and walks into the room , Remarking , " Peel or else file out , you scrub ! " But when your arms are full of girl and fluff You hide your nerve behind a yard of grin ; You 'd spit into a wild cat 's face or bluff A flock of dragons with a safety pin . Life 's a slow skate , but Love 's the dopey gum That puts a brewery horse in racing trim . Epilogue Kind reader , when you ' phone do n't ask for me Enquiring how a Flossie should be won - There is n't any Rule Book , are you on ? And Queenie ca n't be coaxed by recipee . Some girls like hard-luck music , minor key , Some like the Gas-car Gussie act , hot ton , Others are simply fierce for Jolly John Who loves to make a noise like repartee . None but the Nerve , say I , deserves the Fair , And stony hearts ca n't stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are he 'll be Invited In . Up against Love the Candy Kid is nix ; The Porous Plaster wins because it sticks ***
