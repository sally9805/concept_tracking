 | THE writer 's first near view of the volcano after the eruption of this year was on the afternoon of April 24 , when he took his way toward Dr Matteuci 's observatory . The electric train was pushing slowly with its cogged wheels upward toward the observatory station : beyond that point the road was destroyed . The fields outside of Naples showed one or two inches of dust , brown , gray , and gray-green , but most of the vegetable gardens had been cleared of it . A little farther the pines and palms were heavily loaded with sand . as in a snowstorm . It was three inches deep on the walls . It had drifted in places to a depth of two or three feet . On nearing the observatory the lava fields of 1872 and 1898 were found buried under or 6 inches of sand and dust , which formed a heavy mantle , but not sufficient to wholly disguise the slaggy contortions beneath . The whole cone of Vesuvius became cleared of clouds in the course of the afternoon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whitish-gran color which occasionally slipped downward as on the steeper  | slopes of a dune . Pure white steam boiled tip slowly from the crater . In one instance it burst out radially over the edge of the crater , showing a ring on the border , a dome of cumulus above and within , and a second still higher outer ring made of an older rain-cloud which had been punctured and pushed up bodily . The effect was like a hat on the mountain 's crown . At night the cone was clear and entirely without luminosity . Professor Matteuci was found on his return from an ascent , in which he had been accompanied by Dr Sjogren , of Stockholm , and Mr Perret , a graduate of the Brooklyn Polytechnic . They had been in the clouds , and their faces were most picturesquely plastered with blown dust , but they had been unable to see anything , so dense was the fog of steam and sand . The next morning , with a strong west wind , we started up . Besides the writer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain and a guide . The Alpineers were Dr Tempest Anderson and Messrs Yeld and Brigg , all of Yorkshire . The steam was settling down in clouds on the summit from time to time . in alternation with clear spells . The route followed the extension of the tramway to the place where the lower Funicular station had been , and then the western profile of the cone was followed straight up . The rails along the foot of the cave had been twisted and torn by landslides . Most of the old track and the lower station were buried , but not under lava . No new lava was anywhere  | visible on this side of the mountain . Everything was covered with pebbles , sand , and dust . Vesuvius was never more completely a " cinder cone ' ' in outward appearance than it is at the present time . The slope of the main cone averages about 29 ? , and the ejecta seem to have slipped down this slope to form thick taluses at the bottom . Here and there large angular pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter . Climbing the cone was not especially difficult , though it was very steep in places . By making a somewhat zigzag track and keeping on the radial elevations rather than in the shallow troughs , hard pan could be found to walk upon . Some of this was scoured old hard lava , otherwise it was closely wedged or plastered fragments , whereas the gullies were filled with deep sand . It was necessary to be very cautious to avoid starting rocks down on those below . The steepness increased up to a point near the edge of the crater , and then it became slightly less . The edge of the crater itself is the upper rim as seen below ; there are no intervening ridges . Therefore the abruptness of the fall-off , when we finally came to it . was startling in the extreme . The wind had steadily increased and was pelting our necks with stinging sand grains which surged in whirling clouds all about us . It was impossible to face this bombardment except during lulls in the gale ; hence photography was accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only occasionally did the dim sunlight sift through the mixture of sand . steam , and cloud . In those lucent intervals , however , we could make out an inward slope of 35  | or more degrees , covered with hot sand and broken rock fragments , terminated about 120 feet ( vertically ) below by jutting ledges which appeared to be precipitous . Beyond was steam and sulphurous heat and obscurity . The ledges fumed in places . No noise could be heard above the howling of the wind . The curvature of the crater edge was irregular with embayments , and it showed much irregularity in height . We could not sec the opposite side of the cauldron , but from the curvature it was estimated that the crater could not be less than from one-fourth to one-half mile in diameter ? unusually large for Vesuvius . The summit was 4,000 feet above the sea by Aneroid , or some 350 feet lower than before the eruption , according to the data furnished us by the officers of the observatory . The east-west diameter is much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 150 feet and no one knows how much more . There is a great notch or caving-in on the northeast rim of the crater , where . thousands of tons of gravel and sand were hurled clear over the crest of Monte Somma and fell on Ottajano and San Giuseppe with most disastrous results . On the south side of the cave , toward Boscotrecase , a radial rift opened , letting lava escape from different elevations progressively lower until finally the great outflow came from a mouth or " bocca " only 2,000 feet above tidewater , half way down the mountain , and quite below the cone proper . The history of the eruption , as gleaned from the accounts of men of science who were on the spot , is briefly as follows : In 1904 there was a lava flow which stopped in September of that year . In May , 1905 , lava flowed from a split in the northwest side of the cone and continued in active motion throughout the year . It ceased flowing at the time when the present eruption opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On April 4. 1906 , a splendid black " cauliflower " cloud rose from the crater . On April 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 lava mouths opened along the southern rift above mentioned , first 500 , feet below the summit , then 1,300 feet lower , and finally boo feet lower still , all in the same radial line . The lowest mouth was more than half way down the mountain , and from this orifice came the destructive streams . It should be borne in mind that these flows are not floods of lava which cover the whole slope of the mountain , but relatively narrow snakelike trickles , none the less deadly when they push their way through a closely built town . The molten rock crusted over and cracked , making a tumble of porous boulders at its front . At 8 p. m. , April 7 , a column of dustladen steam shot up four miles from the crater vertically . The cloud snapped with incessant lightnings . New lava mouths opened and the flows moved forward , crushing and burning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare some portions of the town . Meantime torrents of ashes fell on Ottajano on the opposite side of the volcano , and many roofs collapsed and lives were lost . At the observatory Dr Matteuci and his colleagues were obliged to retreat , as the observatory was rocking violently and heavy stones were falling . They went only half way down the mountain , however , and returned to their posts next day . The observatory was uninjured , although stones had fallen weighing as much as five pounds . The stones and sand of the eruption are mostly composed of ancient lavas broken up by the steam blast . On April 8 the electrical dust cloud still hung over the volcano , but thereafter through a fortnight the explosions diminished in violence until only quiet steam rose . On the 18th bad gases were blown downward on the observatory by a strong southeast wind , and some persons nearly lost their lives by asphyxiation . The gases were probably both carbon dioxide and sulphuretted hydrogen . Boscotrecase was ruined wholly by lava ; Ottaiano by falling gravel . Boscotrecase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in some cases  | houses were literally cut in two . The stream of lava had forked about a spur of the mountain , leaving the higher land with its vineyards untouched . The lower land with its town was invaded . There is so little timber in the Italian masonry construction that the uninvaded part of the town was not burned at all . At Ottajano the roofs fell in under the weight of sand and gravel . The roofs were largely flat or slightly sloping tiled affairs . The ash and lapilli reached a depth of three feet on level surfaces . The roofs carried the walls with them in many cases , but there was no significant earthquake . There was no fire , destructive lightning . nor strong wind . The persons who perished were all found in the houses , where the sole cause of death was entombment in the ruins . In both these towns suitable rebuilding might avert a similar catastrophe in the future . Arches and domes are the architectural forms best fitted to shed the and-fall . Rebuilding on higher land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a town as Boscotrecase from another attack of lava . The Japanese have made systematic experiments to test the resistance of different forms of masonry to earthquake shocks . Similar experiments might well be made on volcano-proof construction , if human beings continue to insist on living within the five-mile limit of an active crater.
