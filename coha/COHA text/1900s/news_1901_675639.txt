txt The events in connection with the sale of the old New York Custom House to the National City Bank , which heretofore has been the subject of much comment , occupied the centre of the stage during the debate on the Sundry Civil Appropriation bill in the House to-day . Much excitements attended the debate . Mr. , an Arkansas Democrat , raised the issue with a motion to strike out the appropriation of e371,047 for rent of the Custom House , and with this motion as a basis , Mr. Jones of Virginia launched a fierce attack upon the manner and circumstances of the sale , and the vast profits which he claimed the bank made out of the transaction . Secretary Gage was sharply criticised , and several references were made to the letter written by Mr. Hepburn to Secretary Gage apropos of the political claims of the bank . Mr. Cannon and Mr. Hopkins of Illinois both defended the Custom House transaction , and the latter turned the tables on the Democrats by springing upon them a series of letters written by prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Treasury under the Cleveland Administration asking the deposit of Government funds in banks with Democratic proclivities . His centre shot was a letter written by Representative Richardson of Tennessee , now the Democratic leader of the House , in behalf of . a bank at Murfreesborough , Tenn . Mr. indignantly charged that the letters were private letters , and had been furnished to divert attention from the sale of the New York Custom House . He and Mr. Hopkins had hot words , and for a moment it looked almost as if there would be a personal encounter . In the , end Mr. MeRae 's amendment was lost on a strict party vote , and another amendment offered by Mr. Richardson to provide that the rent should not be paid until the title to the old Custom House passed from the Government to the bank failed on a tie vote . MeRAE OPENS THE ATTACK . When the debate opened Mr. ( Dem. , Ark. ) moved to strike out the appropriation of $371.047 for the rent of the did New York Custom House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National City Bank , saying that $50,000 was withheld so that ' the titlewould not pass , to ' the ' bank , : eand it thereby escaped : taX.a.tion . Bird B:Coler , Controller of the City of New York , he said , had protested TO the e.eretary of the Treasury , claiming that the city and . State were being defrauded out of $50,000 in taxes a year . . Mr. Richardson ( Dem. , Tenn. ) declared that the Secretary of the Treasury had contracted to retain the title to the property in the United States . Mr. Cannon ( Rep. , Ill. ) here called attention to the fact that the Custom House site was sold under the authority of an act of Congress , which permitted the payment of the purchase money in installments . Mr. Jones ( Dem. , Va. ) retorted by saying that , in his opinion , the bank would not pay the $50,000 withheld for ten years , arid proceeded to speak , when Mr. Richardson interrupted him long enough to read the letter of the President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property remained in the United States the bank - would not be liable for taxes or water rent , and Secretary Gage 's reply agreeing to this understanding . Do n't you know , " interjected Mr. Hill , ( Rep. , Conn. , ) " that with regard to the taxes under the - laws. of New . York it does n't make a particle of difference whether the title is in the bank or the Government ? " Several New York Democratic members jumped to their feet to deny this statement . Proceeding . Mr. Jones read a mtssrege from the Treasury Department in answer to- an inquiry made yesterday by Mr. MeRae to the effect that $50,000 remained unpaid under the terms of the act which authorized the sale ; that it dre 4 interest at the rate of 4 per cent. , payable at the pleasure of the purchaser , not , however . later than the date of the completion of the new Custom House . Mr. Jones said the new custom house would not be completed for ten years . During those years , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old custom house , would save $50.000 taxes , would have the use of $3.210.000. which , at 4 per cent. , would be equal to $128,000 . He figured that the bank would obtain $307.000 in ten years . almost enough to pay for the site , besides having the use of millions of United States funds deposited with the bank . In conclusion Mr. Jones declared " ' the transaction is a fraud upon the Government , and if the Secretary of the Treasury allows it to continue he will be particeps criminis to the fraud . " CANNON FOR THE DEFENSE . Mr. Cannon . replying , explained in great detail the entire scope of the transaction . He declared that the whole subject was an exceedingly plain business proposition when it was divested of the partisanship and declamation which might have its place on the stump in the stress of a political campaign , but was hardly appropriate in the discus. sion.of the law . " I , for one , " said Mr. Cannon . " propose to treat this institution as I would treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be he rich or poor . " 4 Why should the Government ; which has ' , V15,000,000 on deposit with the National City Bank , pay interest to that bank ? " asked Mr. Richardson . " The gentleman is playing to the galleries , " replied Mr. Cannon . The Government is not paying interest as a matter of favor It is paying the rent it agreed to under the law . The gentleman seeks to muddy the waters by speakin- of the large Government deposits in the bank . The United States deposits its funds wherever a bank qualifies as a depository by depositing in the Treasury bonds dollar for ! doll lar . It becomes part of the Treasury for that purpose . " " Why did Congress authorize the sale of this property when it was apparent that offices would be needed until the new cue , tom house was completed ? " asked Mr. Jones . " That is not involved in this discussion . " responded Mr. Cannon . " Congress proposed to build a new custom house at a big price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old site at an upset price of $3,000,000 . The money is due , and I. for ' one , am in favor of the United States keeping its contracts . " HOPKINS 'S SURPRISE . Mr. Hopkins ( Rep. , Ill. , ) declared that every act of the Secretary of the Treasury was not only in exact accordance with law , but also was based on sound business principles . Neither had the bank escaped any of its taxation by . reason of the contract , for , while the building was not taxed , the money paid for it was taxed . At this point Mr. Hopkins threw a bombshell into the discussion by producing copies of letters which , he said , had been written by prominent Democratic leaders under a Democratic Administration , asking that certain banks be made Government depositories because of the political associations of their managers . Mr. Hopkins said the Hepburn letter to Secretary Gage was not the only one of that kind . He held in his hand copies of several letters from Senator Jones of Arkansas , ex-Congressman Breckinridge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . One of these asked that the German National Bank of Little Rook , Ark. , be made a Government depository , adding : " It is exclusively Democratic in its management . ' " But does it say they contributed to a campaign fund ? asked Mr. Richardson . " If the gentleman will wait I will give him some more of these letters , " answered Mr. Hopkins . Another letter read , referring to the hank authorities seeking Governmental deposits . said : " They are all reliable Democrats , " and was signed by Senator Berry of Arkansas . To this was affixed : " I concur , J. K. Jones . " " That is the head of the Democratic Party , " declared Mr. Hopkins , while many Democratic members were on their feet seeking recognition . ' But does the letter speak of contributions to a campaign fund ? " persisted . Mr. Richardson . " I have read the letter . " responded Mr. Hopkins , turning to another letter in the bunch before him . He read a letter signed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , objecting to a Government depository because " the owners of that bank are open and notorious Republicans , " and adding " from a political standpoint I am opposed to them . " RICHARDSON GETS A REPLY . The Illinois member then proceeded to read other letters from Illinois and Pennsylvania Democrats . " Do any of these letters say ' in consideration of contributions ' they are entitled to the deposits , &c.?"; asked Mr. Richardson . " Be patient , " observed Mr. Hopkins . " I have one here . " He then read a letter to Senator Brice from a Toledo ( Ohio ) Democrat , commending a banker who had been a " liberal contributor . " This phrase evoked much laughter on the Republican side . " Did any of these gentlemen buy property of the Government ? " cried Mr. Richardson . To this question Mr. Hopkins replied by producing a letter written by Mr. Richardson himself , under the Cleveland Administration , indorsing " for good and sufficient reasons " an application for the transfer of the Government deposit from the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenn . This brought a. round ? of applause from the Republicali side Mr. Richardson jumped - to his ' feet . ' l " That bank is one hundred . and fifty miles ' ' from my.districtef he cried : " it never contributed to ray campaign . " Republican jeers . As a parting shot Mr : HopkinS declared that he had read the letters to show that Mr. Hepburn , who was Controller of the Currency under the Harrison Administration , in writing the letter to Secretary Gage , had all these Democratic precedents before him . Mr. arose , showing much anger . With extended arm he declared that the letters read by Mr. Hopkins were private letters , and had been furnished him as he ( ) charged and believed for the purpose of breaking the force of the charge made against Secretary Gage , that he was paying political debts due the National City Bank Mr. charged that the furnishing of those letters was without precedent . and he indignantly demanded to know where they had come from , and when Mr. Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hopkins said he had learned of their existence during the last Democratic Administration . When the subject came before the House - last year he had procured them , but had had no opportunity of going through them until to-day . " But how did you learn of their existence ? " demanded Mr. . " Through officials at the Secretary 's office . " replied Mr. Hopkins . " Who were they ? " insisted Mr. , repeating his question several times . I am not on the witness stand , " retorted Mr. Hopkins . " Any member of the House or Senate has the right to any public document . These are not anonymous letters . I produced them to show up the hypocrisy and cant on that side of the House . " This statement only increased Mr. 's ire , and he insisted that Mr. Hopkins should state whether Secretary Gage had furnished the letters . Mr. Hopkins did not reply . " If the gentleman does not reply I will assume . " he - cried , " that both he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , then added ? " of violating the rules . " This conclusion of the sentence aroused a roar of jeers and laughter on the Republican side . After much confusion a vote finally was taken upon Mr. 's - motion to strike out the appropriation for the rent of . the old custom house , and it was defeated , S9 to OS . Mr. Jones then offered are amendment to provide that of the appropriation of $371 , - 047 for rent , the Secretary of the Treasury should withhold $50.000 still due the Government on the purchase price of the property . Against this amendment - Mr . Cannon raised . a point of order , and was sustained . Mr. Richardson then offered an amendment providing that none of the rent should be paid until the title passed from the Government to the bank . To this Mr. Cannon also made a point of order , but it was overruled . The vote on the amendment was a tie-92 to 92  --  and it therefore failed .
