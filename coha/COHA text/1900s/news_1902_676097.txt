txt Johnstown has again been visited by an appalling disaster , only less frightful than the awful calamity of May 31 , 1889 , in cost of life . A mine explosion took place in the Cambria Steel Company rolling mill mine , under Westmont Hill , at 12:20 o'clock to-day . How many are dead it may take several days to fully determine . The total may reach 125 or more men . At 10 o'clock to-night after damp prevents rescue parties from making rapid headway , and the ' probabilities are that the entombed miners will not be reached before morning . At midnight President Powell Stackhouse was seen at the mouth of the mine , and gave out the following statement : The disaster is an awful one , and came on us entirely unexpected . The mine had been inspected only three days ago , and was pronounced in satisfactory condition . In the thirty years that the mine has been in operation no serious accident has occurred . The cause is yet indefinite , but I believe it was caused by gas escaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being worked because it contained gas , into the sixth heading . " The number of casualties is now placed at 125 . No list of the names of the dead miners can be given , for the majority of them were foreigners and were known only by check and not by name . The only way their names will ever be known , if the bodies are not recovered in time for identification , will be by their families sending their names to us . " It was nearly an hour after the explosion before any general knowledge of what happened got abroad . Men who escaped . from , the mine told the terrible news , and soon it spread like wildfire all over the city . In scores of homes there were the most pathetic scenes . Mothers , wives , daughters , sons , and relatives were frantic with grief . Hundreds rushed to the point , and with sobbing hearts awaited news that did not come from the ill-fated mine . There are two openings to the mine in which the explosion occurred . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania Railroad , just below Johnstown depot , the other at Mill Creek , ' four miles away . At the Westmont opening the Cambria Iron Company police , with several assistants , stand guard , permitting no one to enter the mine from which noxious gases are coming . It was nearly 4 s'clock when all hope of senuing rescue parties from the Westmont opening was abandoned . Two men who had escaped from the mine  --  Richard Bennett and John Myers  --  went back two miles to see what assistance could be rendered , but the frightful damp drove them back , and they fell prostrate when they finally , after a desperate effort , reached the outside . Two doctors gave the men assistance , and after working with them half an hour restored them . Their story of the situation In the mine made it clear that the rescue work could not proceed from the Westmont opening , and then hasty preparations were made to make an attempt at the Mill Creek entrance . Soon after the news of the explosion reached the Cambria officials Mining Engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Prosser , made an attempt to enter the mine . They were followed by Mine Superintendent George T. Robinson , but the deadly gases stopped their progress and they were ' compelled to return to the surface .. RESCUE PARTY PERISHES . Mine Foreman Harry Rodgers , his assistant , William Blanch , and Fire Bosses Johns Whitney , John Retallick , and John Thomas made an attempt to rescue the entombed men . They were overcome by the gases , and it is feared they perished in their heroic effort . Griffith Powell and Thomas Foster , two other fire bosses , carried Mr. Whitney 200 yards in the hope of saving his life , when they were compelled to drop their burden and save themselves . Mr. Whitney was unconscious while being carried by his friends . The fifteen-year-old son of Harry Rodgers , when he heard that his father had been overcome with after-damp , started to help rescue him if possible . He had no sooner entered the drift than the deadly gas almost overcame the lad , and he had to be carried back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and men had to force his jaws apart with a stick to prevent lockjaw . Young Rodgers , who is employed in the mine , was among those who escaped through the Mill Creek shaft . Two miners who came out of the mine at the Mill Creek opening estimate about 300 of the 600 men at work in the Cambria drift got out at that opening . They think the other 300 still there and probably dead . William Stibich spent several hours at the Mill Creek opening . He said that he believed as many as 450 men were still in the mine . In his opinion , based on all he could learn , not more than 150 men had come out . Several miners who have reached the surface were working near the scene of the explosion . They say that they saw the bodies of at least fifty men . The men who came out were foreigners and were in such an excited condition that it was impossible to get a connected story from them . Many of the miners escaped at Mill Creek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point . About a score of American miners who were at work in the affected district noticed the presence of the fire damp in their apartment soon after the explosion occurred and started at once for the main entrance . They were almost overcome by the deadly gas , but finally escaped . The mining officials of the Cambria Company stated the explosion was one of fire damp . One of the men who got out safely said it is not known how the explosion occurred , and that it will probably never be known , as he believed none of the men at work in the Klondike district can be saved . He also said that only a few days ago the officials issued an order to the employes in the mine not to play with the gas , and that the very next day a young Hungarian was seen pushing his naked lamp along the roof of the mine in search of it . The catastrophe occurred in the section of the mine known among the miners as " Klondike . " The name of the section on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Main Heading . " It is about a mile and a half from the main entrance of the Rolling Mill Mine . The few survivors who have escaped from the depths of the mine describe conditions there as frightful . Outside of the " Klondike " the mines are safe and uninjured . Within the fatal limits of the mine the havoc wrought by the explosion is such as beggars description . Solid walls of masonry three feet through were torn down as though barriers of paper . The roofs of the mine were demolished and not a door remains standing . In the face of these difficulties even the most heroic efforts toward rescue may well seem hopeless . Miners who left the mine by way of the Mill Creek entrance brought horrible : stories of crawling over the dead bodies of their comrades . Two young men who were at work in the " Klondike ' when the explosion occurred escaped by way of the airshaft heading up through the Kornville Hill from the mine . A fan house , now out of use , stands at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- young men , sick and dizzy I.rom the nauseous after damp or black damp , reached safety . They told how they had walked across dead bodies  --  how many they did not know  --  to pure air and light . The Cambria Steel officials were notified at once of the explosion . It caused consternation in the offices among those wht , heard the awful news . Tom Poster , an assistant foreman in the Klondike Mine , was among the first to emerge from the Mill Creek shaft . Shortly after Powell Griffith , a fire boss , came up . Foster was in his office when the explosion occurred . - His first thought was for the safety of the men under his charge . With the help of Foreman Roberts , an ' effor was made to replace a few of the shattered doors . All the while the fire damp was closing around them . They did not falter for an instant but straight into the midst of danger they went . The thought " save the men " was paramount . Through galleries into headings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts fell , but Foster staggered on , whither he hardly knew . In the midst of the danger he met Powell Griffith , a fire boss . He had faced what seemed certain death in an effort to save his men . Forward they went , dragging a comrade into a possible place of safety here , giving a word of warning there , until human endurance could stand the strain no longer . Exhausted they staggered into a heading where the fire damp had not entered . There they rested for a moment and then plunged forward  --  where they did not care  --  until finally they wandered into a water level and through it reached a place of safety . STORIES OF SURVIVORS . Said Tom Foster : " How I escaped I do not know . It seems like a terrible nightmare . Hundreds of times I gave up hope , but from sheer instinct I stumbled forward until finally I reached a place of safety . " John Whitney , who was beyond the dip where the explosion ' Cook place , said : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several dozen were overcome by the damp or gas , and I had all I could do to escape . It was terrible . After the explosion we went back to rescue the less fortunate and nearly lost our own lives . We got one man and saved his life . I did not see my father , who was struggling to get out . I do n't think many outside of the drivers escaped . " William Malcolm was in the upper part of the mine when the explosion came . " The first I knew of the trouble was when men came running from what is known as the dip or lower sectwa . They came running without hats , coats , and some without clothes . and in a terrible state of excitement . As near as I can remember not more than the ten came that way and they escaped , leaving more than 200 in the dip . ' Richard Bennett and John Meyers were in the mine where the explosion took place , but managed to escape . About . 2 o'clock they concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a report as to the situation . They went two miles inside , and on the way saw the dead body of Eddie Yamanski at the first side track , about a mile from the explosion point . " The damp was fearful , " said Mr. Bennett . " We had to turn back . We could go no further . " John Hewlett of 313 Market Street ; at the time of the accident was at Second Right , Room 16 , two miles back in the mines . The explosion , he said , occurred about 400 yards from where he was working . " There were six of us together , " he said , " and as soon as we heard the explosion we pulled up stakes and got out as quick as possible . " Richard Bennett was one of the men with me . After Bennett got out he went back again . After the explosion we could not see our hands before us until we reached the main heading . It appeared to be a smoky , sticky substance , whether gas or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . " John Martin of 117 Penn Avenue , George Wallace of 118 Quarles Street , Patrick Muldoon of Penn Avenue , and Joseph Cohegchaski of Chestnut Street , came out of the Mill Creek opening some time after the explosion . ' We were all working at what is called Goody 's , three miles back , " said Martin . " We were beyond the point of the explosion about " half a mile . At least 150 men were back behind us . Thomas Wallace and his four ' buddies ' were all that we saw who escaped from the point near the explosion . We did not hear the explosion , but felt the shock and left at once . " At 11:20 the first four victims were brought to the surface from the Klondike section . They were William Robertson , who was unconscious when found ; John Retallic , alive and in pretty good condition , and two unknown Slays , both alive , but unconscious . Dr. John B. Lowman of this city , who came up with the men , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting postures . The armory of Company H , Fifth Regiment , National Guard of Pennsylvania , will be turned into a charnel house . After a conference to-night it was announced that the dead miners would be brought to the armory to-morrow . Planks have been laid on chairs in the armory and the removal of bodies will begin at an early hour in the morning . The ambulances of all the undertakers in the city are at Mill Creek in readiness to begin the . transfer of bodies . Tne Cambria Steel Rolling Mill Mine has been open for fifty years , and is producing 3,000 tons a day . It is the property of the Cambria Steel Company , general offices in the Arcade Building , Philadelphia . The great Johnstown flood , which began on May 31 , 1889 , was numbered among the great disasters of the last century . The manner in which the towns of the Conemaugh Valley , in Western Pennsylvania , were overwhelmed by an irresistible tOrrent of water makes the calamity stand foremost of its kind in horror and destructiveness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more than $1o.000.000. this was the most trivial element of loss . What made the flood so exceptional was the fact that it destroyed half as many lives as were lost in the battle of Gettysburg , one of the bloodiest of the civil war , and transformed a rich and productive valley for more than twenty miles into a vast charnel house . Johnstown is situated on the*Pennsylvania Railroad . thirty-nine miles west-southwest of Altoona and seventy-eight miles east-by-south of Pittsburg . Before the flood it was a city of 28,000 inhabitants . As the seat of the Cambria Iron Works , one of the largest in the United States , it was the most important member of the chain of boroughs annihilated , and as such gave the name by which the disaster was known . The Conemaugh Valley was long famous for its scenery . Lying on the lower western slope of the Allegheny Mountains , the valley , inclosed between lofty hills , resembles in a general way an open curve hook running from South Fork ( where the inundation first made itself felt ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northwest to New Florence , where the more terrible effects of the flood ended , though the devastation did not cease at this point . The most dramatic incident of the Johnstown calamity was provided by Engineer Park , who had been working on a sluiceway and who comprehended the extent of the approaching disaster , mounted a fleet horse and rode through the valley , warning all to fly to the hills . So faithfully did he perform his duty that he himself was caught in the rushing waters and drowned .
