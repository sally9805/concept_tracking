txt The special commission appointed to revise the tax laws of the State will make its report to the Legislature to-day . Accompanying the general statement of the commission there will be a supplemental report , containing the recommendationi of a minority of the : nembers upon several subjects , including a habitation tax , to be levied upon every householder paying more than $600 a year In rent ; a new form of stock tax , a more rigid personal property tax than that which is in opera ? tion , and a tax upon incomes . The last session of the : special commis. sion was held yesterday afternoon at ' the Murray Hill Hotel There was a general unanimity upon most of the proposed measures , but a wide diversity of opiniell upon the subject of recommending an Int come tax . The members of the cosinnisq sion failed utterly to reach an agreement upon this measure . Many of those Whitt had advocated such a tax decided to with . draw entirely from the discussion , and . to sign no report containing such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller , President of the commis. sion , who told a TIb1118 reportsr last night that he had signed no report having as he subject a tax upon incomes . ? ' The tax upon habitations to be ream. mended in the supplemental report is a feature of taxation that occasioned Con. siderable discussion in the committee , on the ground that it was a measure based upon the old window or hearth tint , the theory of which was that any Man owning a house with more than a certain number of windows or hearths waS'possessed of sufficient substance to warrant the imposition upon him of a certain tax . It was also argued that it would tend to increase the already high rentals . The rate is progressive , based upon the rental value of the house . It is proposed that the occupant of every dwelling or apartment of a rental value of more than $600 a year and up to and including $2,000 , is to be taxed at the rate of 3 per cent . Above $2,000 the rate is to increase proportionately with the estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hOuse or apartment there will be no direct payment . But the owner of the property will be directly liable and will be left to'recover the tax from the rentee . William A. Sutherland , counsel to the commission , said that such a tax was not in operation in the United States at the present time , although it was poisible that there would soon be one imposed in Massachusetts . He said that such a bill had been recommended to the Legislature of New York in 1871 , but had never been passed . In Ontario and Quebec , Canada . he said , a habitation tax was in operation . Another bill favored by several Members of the commission Is one providing for a more rigid tax upon personal property than that which is in force at present . If the Legislature adopts the recommendations of this group , , taxpayers will be reqiiired to make a detailed statement of their personal prepeety ' tinder oath , including each taxable possession ...

T. ? tte commission was unanimous in recommending a progressive inheritance tax ; such a tax to be graded upon the basis of the amount bequeathed , and the degree of reletionship between the testator and the beheficlaries . The supplemental report contains a recommendation that a different method of . taxation be applied to the transfer of stock . The report contains a discussion of the question of the tax upon corporations , and many recommendations areimade . An Increase in thc taxation of savings banks is advocated , and other corporations are subject to the argument that too little revenue is derived front them . The report is not , however , calculated to increase , in a ritclic-3.1 degree , the rate of taxation paid by corporations . Some of the members were in favor of levying ? 1 g-req tertax upon all corpora- tions , while others contended ; hat there should be extreme care in returning a report that would recommend an equable rate of taxation .

There has been great pressure brought to bear upon certain members of the commission , it is said , to the end that no majority recommendation for an income tax be made . ' . o confirmation of this rumor could be obtained from any of the Commissioners . It was said that the proposition was discussed upon its merits , and great diversity of opinion was developed . Some of the members were in favor of a tax that would apply upon the incorne , derived exclusively from investments . Others wished a progressive tax levied upon all incomes . Still others argued that such a tax would not conform with the general policy of the Government , and would not preserve equable taxation . Several of the members of the commission , however , held out for a recommendation for an income tax . and will probably make one , Independent of the others .
