On the height their footing changed to bare pink ledges with grass-grown intervals of thin earth . A spiked wall of dark firs and a little grove of white birches disappointed him by cutting off all view of Black Harbor on the seaward side . Pow-ell 's cove , too , had vanished : the hollow field , the spring , the house itself , had , in a few steps from the edge of the ascent , dropped from sight so utterly that the island seemed one great table-land some ten miles long , continuous , though curving at the middle to a narrow ridge . From their way along the verge , they could look back , straight down upon the shining channel , the low mainland , and the smoke-blurred elms , masts , and crisscross streets of the petty town . Alone and aloft , they walked slowly , their shadows already spindling before them over the ledge and the yellow grass . Sometimes they crossed a bare scar of rattling pebbles , that in the shelving places rolled from under their feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fell silently over the cliff , down to the black seaweed at the foot of that dizzy height . " I come here often , " said Helen , after the long silence of outdoor companions . " This little faint path is all my own making . Oh , it was your boat I saw crossing yesterday afternoon ! ? Two of you ? ? But you could n't have seen me , for I was lying down close to the edge , and just saw you disappear round the southern end . " " It must be melancholy to come up on this height all alone , " said Archer . " Oh , no , " she returned . " That 's the strangest part of it . I never feel alone anywhere on the island , partly because I used to make believe so much . And then I'vealways had a queer feeling that there was some one moving along parallel to me , not far off , and not very near ? a kind of invisible person that you might almost see out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and among white birches more than anywhere . My father says it 's very interesting , and shows how paganism begins . I do n't know . But it seems real . Sometimes ? like drinking from the witch 's spring , you know ? I 've looked up quickly to catch a sight of it ? the presence . But it never appears . It makes you feel quite safe ? and yet somehow ? cautious . See how I talk about my notions ! It 's your fault . You 've been silent . Tell me more about what you 've seen and done . " " No , please , " said Archer . " I 've told you most of it . It 's been a pretty dull life , sailing round ; and yours is so much better . " Walking behind her again , he could see the neat springing of her ankles , the free play of white-clad shoulders , the bronze gleams in her hair , blown away from him . But he was thinking of this childhood into which she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The white birches I spoke of , " she continued , gayly voluble , facing about and pointing , " see , there they arc , behind , against the firs . You should see them in winter , too . Once , after a storm , they were all weighed down with ice till I was afraid they would break . But it was very beautiful ? bending along together under the evergreens behind ? and made me think of princesses in a fairy story , all stealing by the foot of a dark wall , you know , to escape . " They clattered across a frail foot-bridge , spanning a narrow black gorge , in which the sea splashed somewhere down in the 463 464 Blue darkness . Then , between the empty sunlit air of the verge to the right and the wall of firs to the left , the breadth of yellow grass led them upward to the skyline and the southern end of the island . Often Archer had to climb ahead and pull her up the arduous hillside . As they gained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose trunks , bleached by salt winds , had been blown about till the roots writhed above ground and the distorted branches grew away from the sea . From among the trunks gleamed the eastern sky . This was the same tempestuous grove that Archer had seen from the boat ; and perhaps it was some remembrance of the lurking ambiguity of movement among these trunks that made him ask : " Have n't the fellows in Black Harbor ever troubled your father or you They seem a rough set " ? " No indeed , " replied Helen , wonderingly . " They ' re just poor fishermen , I think . They only came and lived there ; my father said nothing . But he has forbidden me to go up on the hill above the harbor , so I 've never even seen them . Oh , that ' s not true . Once last spring an awful man met me up here ? a young man , but dreadful , with a kind of flat face and nose ? and began to speak to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't hear what he said . And then another man , very tall , in a blue jersey , with very bright eyes , and blue veins in his forehead , overtook him and spoke to him , and they both went away . I did n't come up here for weeks after , not even on the Sunday mornings . But I did n't see them again . There ! if I 've not told you the only secret I have from my father ! " Archer rejoiced in this guileless compliment . At the same time he seemed to recognize two acquaintances in the narrative , and was greatly disturbed . But just then the ocean lay before them . They had come to the very end of the island . One peep over the edge , where blue harebells quivered in the wind , made him look well to his footing on the parched grass . He drew back beside Helen , and Peter the two stood looking down the great sheer drop of shattered brown rock , ? broken pillars of basalt , stained with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whitened with bird-droppings . From the foot of the cliffs and the little crescents of shingle beach below , the tide was ebbing away almost without a sound , it was so calm under the lee of the head . Helen tossed over a pebble , and a score of white gulls started up from among the rocks , to go wheeling from headland to headland , with peevish cries as of lonely wickedness . Amazingly high in the sunlight the big birds soared , with heads bent down ; amazingly far beneath moved the sea , ? endless , inward-toiling lines , rising away to the weary , straight , infinite circumscription of the horizon . " It is beautiful , " said he at last , " mid unspeakably sad . One is very little ? and yet glad to feel so . " " That was well added , " said the girl thoughtfully . There was nothing further to be said . Out here at the meeting of earth , air , and water , the wind seemed more cold , the sunlight pale , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mysterious look of age that sometimes comes to one who has long watched the sea . Their comradeship grew closer , ? little human allies tacitly united in the face of vast and melancholy nature . A slow-forming thought suddenly overwhelmed him : here was a girl who , in her eyes , her speech , her acts , showed that her life could include and master sorrow . And he had walked with her hardly two hours , and he could not bear to leave her . " The hardest part , " said the girl , sadly , as if speaking to herself in the void of ocean air , " is not to know what my father really believes and really does n't . He answered me once that God was the Ether of Euripides . Now what can a young girl make of that ? " Suddenly her wide brown eyes turned to him . " Oh ! " she exclaimed , " I was thinking ? what have I said ' ? ? But you 'll forget it ? and you ' re not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faltered , his voice thick and coming with an effort . " No , I 'm not a stranger ? I wo n't tell ? and even if I did , no one aboard ship would care ? or know who ? My three days ' leave are up . I 'll be gone to-morrow , anyway . " She cried out in pure dismay . " Oh , you must n't ! " Then , flushed and confused , ? " I forgot , of course . You 're such a wanderer ? and have your duties , too " ? She smiled uncertainly . " Why , I must have been making believe once more ? it becomes a habit , probably ? even to playing I had a big brother again . It was very nice to have one ? just for an afternoon ? but silly ? and for a grown-up ! ? I beg your pardon " ? " Helen ! " he cried , forgetting everything , and stepping in front of her , as if to intercept her look and her thoughts from going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , he never knew ; for in the wild manoeuvre he nearly slipped from his feet . " Come back from the edge ! " she cried , and seized him by the jacket . " You must n't ! " The movement swung them together , she still grasped the rough cloth by instinct , and for one fiery moment their faces were perilously close , their spirits passed in flame between the shining eyes . " Oh , " she cried again , letting go and shrinking back astounded , staring at him with a pale face of terror . " Oh , what have we done ? We do n't know each other , not even know each other ! " She covered her face . " Something passed between us , it ca n't be unsaid or undone . What must you ? please , please go away ! I shall pay for this alone , ? oh , the long retribution ! " She cried bitterly , bowed down and trembling . Archer drew near , neither allowed nor forbidden , and tried to console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fragments of some priceless thing . " Helen , " he said . " Do n't cry so . Do n't . " He awkwardly patted her head , but she only nodded once as if to acknowledge the consolation . The slantVOL. 96 ? NO. 4 ing sunlight fell kindly round these two . troubled children , aloft on the lonely headland . " I mean it for good , always , " he begged hurriedly . " The time is no matter ? long or short ? if it had n't been then it would have been never . Do n't you see , Helen ? Just believe . I ca n't prove it to you . Why , " he cried in despair , " if I had n't meant it for always , I 'd no more have done it than I 'd have tried to kiss good old Barbara the cook ! " The girl still hid her face , but laughter mingled funnily with her sobs . " You can prove it , " she declared suddenly . And seizing him by the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead him away from the precipice , toward the grove of windswept cedars and pines . " You can say it to me before my brother , " she said , eagerly tugging him along . Wondering , he followed . They found themselves in a little natural clearing among the bleached trunks and dark , distorted branches . At the back of the clearing a tall wooden cross , with gray arms wide-stretched , faced out toward the sea . Helen dropped his hand , and they entered side by side , quietly , as if into a little chapel . They stood in shadow , the sunlight barely tipping the dark trees . " Here is where I come on Sunday mornings , " she said with reverence . " It 's my ? it 's everything to me . " Together they read the inscription on the gray cross .. " He was my brother , " said Helen , almost in a whisper . " Older than I , and dearer to me than any one else . I ca n't remember my mother , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just his age , and somehow like him : that was what made my father ? made him more sad even than usual , last night . " The gulls complained in the wide solitude of the air . " This is your church , " said Archer , at last . " And if your brother were here , I would tell him just what I told you outside . " The girl gave him her hand with a kind of grave joy . " Perhaps he hears you , " she said , and her voice was full of mystery . " My father comes here seldom ; but once after he had stood here for a long time , he said at last , ' Henceforth thou art the genius of the shore . ' I like to believe that of Arthur . " Hand in hand they moved away . " Was that a noise in the trees ? " she asked , stopping suddenly . They looked about , but saw nothing , and went on , slowly , out of the little clearing . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Archer took her hand in both of Ins . " You believe now , " he said . Swiftly , for an instant , she clung about him , astonishingly small at close quarters , and hiding her face comically under his elbow . " Oh , I knew you would come ! " she said brokenly , laughing and crying together . " I knew you ' d come . When you drank from the spring , and answered the two questions , I knew it was you ? all the time . No , no , you must n't . " She sprang away , laughing , and raced down the slope toward the sunset . Archer could run , but the chase lasted to the brink of the farthest hill . They stopped , laughing with what breath they . had , and from the height , still lit by the sun , looked down into the cove and the fields of home , ? a deep bowl of soft evening shadows . " Oh , my poor father , " said Helen , changing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , in a study . " You must n't come to dinner , " she said . " Come in late , and make some excuse . I could n't carry it off with you there . Do go over the hill and see them fish . He has n't forbidden you . " Her face was clouded at the prospect of deceit . " I 'll go , then , " said Archer , bitterly . disappointed , and yet happy as a lord of the world . " But I ca n't stay . " " Oh , to-morrow , " she called back from below , " to-morrow we must talk ? a great deal . We must know each other first . But your ship ? " " Oh , I 'll go see the captain , and he ' ll swear , " said Archer . " There she is . " And he pointed to the masts of a barkentine lying at a wharf in the distant town . " But she can sail without Inc , ' he laughed , and tossed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainland . Then he watched Helen as she ran down the lower slope , into the pastoral shadows . V He walked slowly over ledges and grass , the long shadows creeping to meet him . The sunlight stole upward , left his face , left the white birch tops , left the fir points , and was gone from the island . The breeze grew cool . And when he stood on the pink ledge above the downward pass to Black Harbor , lights already twinkled from the town , and the northern headlands were black against the afterglow . He stood looking for a while , his joy quiet and deep . Yesterday , and the two years before , he had been a cheerful runaway , letting money and goods lie fallow ashore , rejoicing in bare , hard life and in youth . He had come over to this island to fill an idle day or two , ? and here was Helen , ? and in the twinkling of an eye life had changed , had grown more complex , serious , yet strangely fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I did n't know it would be like this , exactly , " he said to himself . Always before he had craved to have things go swiftly ahead , event succeeding event while his mind still tugged forward to the future ; but now a little pause in the present , a breath- in g space , to look happily about in , was his sole desire . It was only his promise to Helen that made him renounce the tempth , tion of smoking his pipe and thinking there on the summit , and go slowly down through the black firs . For the first few steps he could look down the evergreen glacier , miles down , it seemed , upon the dimly shining harbor , two or three boats at anchor , the dark curve of the bar , and a sombre headland along which a single belated gull went winging swiftly . Then he was immersed in darkness . As he stumbled downward , he found his thoughts strangely mingled : Helen with her shining hair confused somehow amid a new-born pity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lives of others , the man with the blue-veined forehead , his pert little brother , the fishermen silent in their cups . " He must have had a hard deal sometime , her father , " thought the young loan ; " and the others , too . " Last night they had seemed mere figures in the darkness , the pawns in a game of adventure , the " persons who do not count . " Tonight he would like to learn more of them . In this friendly spirit he finally broke into the open , on the hillside behind the huts . The barroom , as he passed , was lighted but empty , save for the little man waiting before his bottles . Archer went on , through the stink of fish among the gray huts , down to the beach ; and here he came upon small groups , some twenty men in all , smoking , talking , and looking down over the long slope of wet pebbles and seaweed to where a few boats waited at the water 's edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctance . They peered at him through the dusk , with perhaps a little surprise , then smoked and spat with unconcern . They were sober to-night . By their faces ? all dark and thin , some vicious , some dull ? they were simple men enough , quiet , ordinary , and poor . " Wha ' d ' ye git under-runnin ' yer trawl , Kellum ? " one asked finally , between puffs . The loud young man laughed again . " I seen ' er , " he echoed . " She 'd go like ? like a horse . " This simile exhausted by popularity , the group was silent once more , with pipes glowing in the dusk . A bent figure slouched past them down the beach . " Hey , Mulb'ry , " some one called after it . " Goin ' out a'ready " There was no answer . " Mulb'ry ' s sore ' cause he did n't git all that bottle O ' gin las ' night , " mocked the Yankee . Another figure tramped down through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring group . " Sebattis , ai n't your got that ho't down yet ? " The soft voice of an Indian replied . With quiet command of the vernacular , he advised his questioner to go deeper than Purgatory . Old Kellum straightened his curved shoulders . " Sebattis , " ire shouted , " you go git that bo't off ' fore I give ye a lift . " There came the hollow grating of a boat pulled down to the water . " That Nun ' II be Lakin ' charge round here , " growled Kellum . Other figures went crunching downward through the dark , till the footsteps glimmered with phosphorus on the distant seaweed . A newcomer joined the group . " Here 's Blue Peter , " said the Yankee . " I was puttin ' another bow on my dip-net , " explained the deep voice of Archer 's ruling friend . The net , on its long pole , stood high above his head , like some drooping standard , obscure in the , starlight . " Beaky 's hot ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe 's , an ' Benny 's . " The men started down the beach . " Can I go out with you , Peter ? " asked Archer , on the impulse . The reply came in an odd tone of surprise mingled with something else . " Oh , that you , sir ? Yes , sure , if you 'd like . " As Archer slipped his money into his shirt , and threw his coat on the beach , he wondered at the touch of respect . They trooped clown together . Under the heavy boots , glow - worm drops of phosphorus filled the wet seaweed with spreading blots of brightness . To the " chock - chock " of oars on thole - pins , some half - dozen boats were already crowding out through the gap in the seawall , every keel a running line of blue-geld fire . Among the half-dozen more which now put out , Archer found himself in the bow of Peter 's roomy skiff . " Let me row , " Hippolyte had begged . So the youngster pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liquid gold dripped from the oars ; fan-shaped clouds of blue-gold smoke swept astern with each pull ; and to Archer , in the bow , seeing the dim shin ing of the oarblades , the bright arrowhead of ripples that spread from the cut-water behind him , it seemed that they must be rowing forward into tire lights of a great town . So strong was the delusion that he turned his head , and was surprised to find only the looming of the sea-wall as the boat slipped through , the blackness of the ocean outside , the running lines of golden fire under the other keels . Their small flotilla moved somewhere to the southeast , hugging the shore under the cliffs , skirting the bunts of a weir or two , rugged blacknesues picked out with lapping phosphorus round the foot of the poles . A deep , irregular drumming started up ahead , like horses running confuscdly across a bridge , or empty trucks rumbling over a stony road . " What 's that ? " said Archer . " They 're spiulgin ' , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy . " The youngster began jumping his oars about on the gunwale . The boats astern took it up , till the wide air rumbled with the heavy drumming and the echoes of the cliffs . " It 'll make ' em rise , " Peter explained . " You take the oars , sir , and Hippolyte , you come down stern here . I 'll go in the bow . " They crawled past each other over the thwarts . Archer soon caught the knack of drumming and rowing by turns . The boy pounded the sides with both fists . " See , " called Peter suddenly . " There ' s some . " The water was stirred into millions of tiny golden globules ; golden streaks shot in crisscross multitudes , like tiny comets smothered in deep sea . Peter plied his dip-net swiftly . With a swash and a thump , some half-barrel of herring fell aboard , in a writhing , flipping heap , alight with phosphorus . More splashing , and a few more tumbled in . " ' T wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s many ' s they seem . Head ' er out again , sir . They ' re tryin ' to drive ' em ? with the torches . " Archer turned the boat , and pulled out to sea , until the order came to turn again . " I 'll light the dragon , " said Peter . " This is against the law , ye know , sir , but the law ai n't got ' s long an arm 's they say . " With a crackle of birch-bark and the smell of burning kerosene , a light flared ? up as if their bow had been on fire . Other torches flared far along the water , coursing shoreward till the giant shadows of men and rocks tossed and swung high on the dim red crags . " Keep ' er headed just as she is , " commanded Peter . " Now pull like the devil , sir . " Archer obeyed till the sweat trickled down his forehead . " A little faster , sir ? a little faster " ? his captain kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other boats flamed alongside of them . " We 've caught up , going famously , " he thought . Just why it happened he never could have told . Suddenly a torch-lighted bow swerved astern of them , ? nearly ran them down ; and he saw above the smoky flame the goblin face of Beaky Lehane , ? the flat , cartilaginous nose , the wide-spaced teeth , the evil little eyes , a face distorted in a mania of drunken passion . " God damn yer soul ! " he raved . " Git out o ' my way ! " The boy in the stern half rose in terror . Behind the grinning face a hand left the pole of a dip-net , and tried to catch Lehane by the shoulder . But in the same instant he swung out savagely with the torch . The iron-shod slake crashed down on the head of the little boy , who fell with a kind of whimper into the bottom of the boat . Archer , rising in a rage , heard Peter roar at his back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better place , and swung the oar like an axe with all his strength . It struck Lehane with a wooden resonance and a tingling shock that ran through Archer 's forearms . Both boats upset in a souse of phosphorus . The water was shockingly cold . Squirting a salt and golden jet from his mouth , he looked about . Two black hands , the fingers spread stiffly apart , sank in the boiling witch-fire . They were too large to be the boy 's . Next instant he bumped into Peter , whose face was smeared with an unearthly glow as if rubbed with wet matches , and who held the little body under one arm , while he lashed out the other through the blue-lighted spray . " No , no ! " gasped Peter . " You ca n't help ! Swint ashore ! I 've got him . They can all swim . Get out ! Swim to the ledge , anyway . Go on , man . Oh , by God ! " He was sobbing as be swam . Archer could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's every man for himself , " lie thought , and struck out vaguely for the shore . Through the cold , shining water he swam , through shoals of fish quick and startling to the touch , and at last pulled himself out , shedding glow-worm drops , upon the round stones of the seawall . Here he waited . But by the torches , the other boats seemed to be looking for something . He dimly saw men pulled aboard , and still the search went on . No one came to join him . Then he remembered a little ledge offshore , bare at low tide . The others must have swum to that . He grew very cold as he waited ; still the torches hovered aimlessly in the distance ; and at last , with teeth chattering in the night air of autumn , he clambered over the breakneck stones , followed the inside curve of the wall , until , after many falls and infinite groping , he stumbled upon his coat . Carefully drying his hands in the beach-grass , he hunted matches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cedar shavings from weir-poles , soon snapped and blazed on the pebbles . He sat drying himself as well as might be , and waited for news of this sudden and strange mishap . He was un easy over the stroke lie had dealt with the oar ; yet the thought of the little boy braced his conscience at the same time that it made his heart sink . In these thoughts by the fire , growing warm and sleepy , he was startled by a growling voice . " Who the hell are you , buildin ' fires on my beach ? " The speaker was a man of middle height , prodigiously broad and bulky , with a wide red face in which the eyes were so staring and the big red nostrils so far apart that he had the aspect of a bull . As the question came rumbling again in a thick bass , Archer noticed that the hands , in the firelight , were fat , freckled , and immensely powerful , like the hand thrust in at the barroom door . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resemblance to the face at which Archer had swung his oar , it was-Beaky Lehane 's father . " Oh , go to the devil , " he answered , too cold , and tired , and bitter to let any man stare so at him . " This is n't your beach , anyway . It 's Mr. Powell 's . Go stare at somebody else . " " Well , by the " ? wheezed the man , and stopped , cut speechless by wonder and rage . Then the hulking body lurched nearer . " Look here ! " cried Archer , jumping up and shaking his fist . He had lost his temper , as in a bad dream . " Be off with you ! This is my beach as much as yours , if it comes to that . I 've lighted a fire , and I 'm going to sit alone by it . Alone , do you hear ? You ' re only a squatter . Well , here I squat , too . You 'd better go look after your son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and serve him damned good and right ! " He expected that on the heels of this they would be rolling down the pebbles in a clinch . Instead , the big man breathed hard with a startled puff , and asked anxiously , ? " Where ? Where is he ? What was it ? " " Oh , over there , " said Archer wearily , pointing by guess toward the foot of the cliffs . " Been a fight ? overboard ? I do n't know , go look for yourself . " The man reeled off into the dark . Archer was so tired that he merely felt relieved , as from a bore . He piled the fire till it blazed high , dried himself fairly well , and waited sleepily . Still nothing appeared from harbor mouth or sea-wall . Suddenly it flashed through his drowsy brain that he was expected back at Pow-ell 's that night . This bit of civilized obligation came like something laughable , out of some other person 's life . It was in a droll dismay that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap in the black lay-ers of the fir branches , he caught the shine of lights far below . " Let them go till morning . I 'll be back , " he thought . Perhaps the little boy was not hurt so much , after all . Like one in a heavy dream he climbed wearily over the ldll and downward through starlit fields to the house . A candle , burning low , waited for him in the little brown hall . He locked the door without a sound . " What a mess for a visitor ! " lie pondered ruefully . But the thought that Helen was in the same house , even though she were asleep , came to him like a comfort . VI All night a land-breeze swept overhead from the north , as if streaming down an interminable valley . Despite his weariness , he slept ill ; his dreams were a riot of pictures , ? the firs , the gulls , the witchfire , Helen looking away from him at the sea , the boy rising , in fear , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-remembrance of the blow he had struck with the oar . When he woke , at sunrise , the wind had fallen . The house still lay drowned in sleep . He dressed , stole downstairs , and looked about for his cap , which he had left there two nights before . It was not to be found . He did not know then that Helen had taken it to her room , laughed and cried and committed pretty follies over it , and at last gone to sleep , intending to leave it in the hall before he should be up . So he went outdoors bareheaded . The wind had swept away with it all vestiges of summer , and brought in a pure dawn of uncompromising autumn . The night had drawn a sharp line between the seasons . The air was crisp and chilly ; gossamer films of frost silvered the grass ; and round the upper outline of the headland that shut off the south and east , a faint , cold smoke rose in the first warmth of morning . What remained of sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale yellow . Climbing over the fields to the pass , he was aware that some one sat waiting for bins on the edge against the sky . He climbed faster . The figure resolved itself into the lean , solid body of Peter , his blue jersey , his heavy rubber boots rolled down below his knees in the fashion of some uncouth cavalier . " How is he ? " called up Archer . " How slid it come out ? " The blue eyes under the blue-veined forehead looked down gravely , as Peter shook his head . Even through the dirty growth of beard , the lines of his face were hard and old . With fears suddenly full grown , Archer sprang upward and stood before him . Something made him wait for the other to speak . " It 's bad , " said Peter , at last . " Bad , " and he stared out over the fields and the channel , like a steersman , who has the air of listening to talk in the boat , while his eyes look miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy 's dead . " " Oh , Peter ! " cried Archer , and was struck dumb . " Oh , my God , I 'm sorry ? I 'm sorry for you . " He could find no words , but the tone must have meant something , for the other suddenly lost his set composure and covered his swarthy face and blue-scored forehead with his hands . " I knowed you was a good feller all right , " lie said brokenly . For a time neither spoke . It was Peter who began . " I was up on the cliffs yesterday afternoon , " he slowly declared , " and saw you . She heard me in the trees " ? " What ! " cried Archer in surprise . And then with disappointment , " Well , I did n't think it of you , if " ? " Why , " said the other , once more gazing off before him , " how was I to know , then ? I had n't no means o ' tellin ' for sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Archer exclaimed , hotly and yet with wonder . " There are n't any others . That 's a lie . There never were any . " The blue eyes looked squarely at him , deep , with a weary brightness . " Oh , yes , the ' was , " the fisherman replied . " The ' was one other . Wait ! " he added sternly . " I 'm slow at these things , but you 'll ketch my drift . It 's eight years that I 've kept an eye on her . Beaky was round after her . She never knowed it . The ' was a girl ashore , over in town , he got after , that ? Never mind . That was n't goM ' to happen here , if I c 'd stop it . I 've licked Beaky twice ; and so long ' s he was on the island , I never left it , ? never , for all his old man ordered me off . Do n't ye see ? When she 'd go round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've knowed ' er longer ' n you , anyway ? or up on the head ? why , I was always round , spyin ' out . Why , man , that 's only why I stayed here . " He looked down and fumbled with the dirty cloth lining of his boots , in a pathetic kind of bashfulness . " I 'd never ' a ' told this to a soul , but I see you was all square ? an ' meant 472 Blue Peter right by ' er ? an ' how it was between ye . Well , she 's never come to harm , an ' ' t was me that had the hand in that " He ground both fists between his knees , with the effort of expressing these long-stifled thoughts . Then he looked up once , in the pale light of sunrise . " I 'll ask ye to take that back what ye said about lyin ' . " " I beg your pardon , " said Archer , deeply humbled . " I took it wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon . " " That 's all right , then , " he answered simply . " Now to come to the point . The 's no time to lose . Beaky Lehane 's paid for it . He 's gone . " Sunlight , ledge , black firs , and circle of air , looked pale and sickly round Archer . lie thought he could not have understood . " You do n't mean " ? he began weakly , trying to stave off what he knew would be the truth . " Yes , " said Peter . " They found him ' bout four this mornin ' , on the beach . " Archer , wrestling with this thought , found that the fisherman had risen and was patting him roughly on the shoulder . " That 's all right , " he was saying . " Do n't look so cut up . That 's all right . ' T was n't you . He started out drunk ? jus ' got drowned , that 's all . You did n't no more'n give him a clip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s straight . If ye had n't , I 'd ' a ' given worse to him . An ' if ye hail done it , I 'd ' a ' owed ye one . fe 's a good riddance . Do n't ye see , sir , he was crooked , bad clean through . It 's better for her now that lie 's gone . Do n't lake on , now . " 1 ' was him that killed the little boy . " Archer was ashamed that he could receive better comfort than he had given this man . He pulled himself together . " You said there was no time to lose , " he ventured , remembering dizzily . " Well , what 's to be clone ? " " That 's it ! " cried Peter , with bitterness . " What ? It 's a bad business . Matt Lehane ? the old man ? they told ' im it was you that done for Beaky . He thinks it was about her ? the girl . He 's down there ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mt ? it ? there . An ' drunk ! Lord ! But he do n't lose his legs , nor his head ; the drink jus ' sharpens ' im . Well , he 'll git ' em all drinkin ' , ? likely he 's started that by now . Then he 'll bring his gang up over here ; it 's you he 's gunnin ' for , but I wo n't answer for what 'll happen at Powell 's , when they git started . It 'll be a pretty crowd . An ' here ' s you an ' me , an ' old man Kellum , ? an ' p'raps Benny , ? an ' for a long guess Sebattis , ? ' cause Beaky was always cuffin ' ' im round , ? if he do n't git drunk first .

I 'm not afraid of him , I hope . " And he told briefly of the encounter by the fire . " He did n't seem so terrible . " " That may all very well be ? for last night , " declared Peter , his blue eyes alight with keen thought . " He 's rotten , an ' a brute , but you must remember the ' was jus ' one good thing in ' im , he thought the world o ' Beaky . He 's the only one to do that . Oh , I tell ye he 's a devil anyway , an ' worse when he 's drunk . They 'll be too scairt not to foller anywheres he says . That 's all that kep " em together as a gang .

An ' the ' ai n't a stitch o ' canvas on them pinkies . Oh , the Old Man 's cute ! He do n't mean to have you git off this island . When he gits ' em lo'ded , he 'll go up to the house , an ' whether you 're there or not , they 'll raise hell ! An ' now how ' II we stop ' em ? We ai n't got no guns . But they 's axes an ' bo't-hooks , " he cried savagely . " We 'll do for some one ' fore we git laid out . " " Powell let his boat go adrift last spring , " Archer reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get help . Swim it . " " By the Lord ! " cried the other , astonished . Then , shaking his head , " Can ' t live in that cold for two miles an ' a half . An ' it 's slack water ROW . By young Hood it 'll be the whirlpools . " " We must try it , " said Archer . " It 's been done once , years ago . I must take the chance . You delay them down there . " Blue Peter thought for a second , then nodded grimly . " You 're all right , " he said . " I 'll put a spoke in his wheel . You ' re all right . ' T wo n't be no easy job for ' em . " He hesitated . " Look here , somethin ' may happen .

Might ' a ' done better'n me , oearin ' thirty an ' good for nothin ' but fish . I want ye to promise me one thing , " he jerked out . " Quick , ' cause we 've been standin ' here talkin too long . " " I 'll promise it , " said Archer . " Do n't tell her ? Helen , " said Blue Peter , looking down , " none o ' what I told ye ? ' bout me or the boy ? an ' our loin 's . I knowed some one ' ml come along like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise that . " " All right , then , " said Archer . Suddenly he held out his hand . " Peter , you 're the best fellow I ever knew anywhere . " Their grip was strong but brief . " I wish we 'd ' a ' growed up together ? Hugh , " said the fisherman . " Now hurry . Swim like hell . I 'll hold on till you git back . That 's my promise , for yours . I 'll hold ' em , damn their souls . " He went scrambling downward to his desperate politics . Archer bounded off down the slope , through the field and the frost-bitten rows of vegetables , to the back door . The good old woman was lighting her kitchen fire . He cut short her wrinkled smile of welcome . " Barbara , " he said , snatching a bottle of oil from her shelf , " I must frighten you a little , but you must stand it , for Miss Helen 's sake . There ' s danger from that crowd over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say . I 'm going across to the town , and bring over some men to see no harm 's done . But meantime , you must keep the house shut up , tight . Do n't let them go out , or any one in . " The old woman 's face looked very white , but there was pluck in her eyes . " It 's for Miss Helen 's sake , " he repeated . " Keep tip your courage . I 'll be right back . " " All right , Mr. Archer , sir , " she faltered . " I 'll do it , sir . " He was off , running to the beach , and along it northward , to make his start as far as possible above the line where the whirlpool might appear . Ripping off his clothes , he ran naked down to the water 's edge , doused the oil over his body , and rubbed hastily till the great white muscles glistened in the sun . Ile felt hollow from lack of food and sleep ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement as he ran splashing out , and the cold shock of the plunge , set his heart thumping stoutly . His first thought was one of despair , ? " It ' s too cold . " But he shut his mind to that , and clove his way ahead through the bright green water , swimming with a powerful side stroke . That lowness of vision over a flat surface which is peculiar to swimming made colors and lines abnormally distinct . With his cheek gouging through the water , he could see the ruddy cliffs retreating behind him , the greenness and the black shadows of little trees that clung in crev- ices , the pink curve of the beach , the shining , shifting lines of the water , his own legs , distorted by refraction till theylooked ridiculously pale and green and thin , kicking away like alien marine things in pursuit of his body and of the big , glistening deltoid that capped his shoulder , strongly contracting and relaxing . Ahead , as he shot his arm forward , appeared his first distance mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the channel ; beyond that , a broad eddy of the tide , a slightly raised surface , smooth and yellowish-white , like a sheet of ice , where hundreds of white gulls wheeled or floated in search of breakfast ; and beyond these again , the wharves and meagre shipping of the town , ? the square-rigged shapely tangle of his own ship , the Elizabeth Fanning . The numbness began to leave him , though an ice-cold ring circled his neck where wind and water met . Like all swimmers , he grew confused in his sense of time , and had strange thoughts . Half way to the can-buoy now ; no longer . slack water ; must hurry . A half-eaten apple came bobbing peacefully toward him on the young flood . He wondered who had eaten it , and whether it were sweet or sour . But where the devil had all his Latin gone to ? Her father had said " enaviganda . " Did that mean it could be swum through , or it could n't ? He suffered a morbid worry over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret of his present fate . The thing had been done ? that fellow in ' 56 . At all events , he shifted his stroke again , and swam on tediously . Of a sudden he noticed that the apple was bearing rapidly down , ? was alongside , on a little raised rim of water like a moving flaw in glass . Next instant he had spun about and was facing seaward . Something below twirled his legs violently . " Hello ! " he sputtered aloud . " Good Lord ! " he thought . " This is bad . I must get out of this . " But the running ocean was stronger . The water hissed , curved on a slant , boiled upward , regurgitated in patches white as with melting snowflakes . A submarine force , gigantic and appalling , spun him round and round and whirled him downward . He wrestled frantically . His head sank inside a wide cylinder of smooth green glass , laced about spirally with running silver threads . His ears , long deafened by the noise of swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It 's all up . I 'll see where it goes to , anyway , " he thought insanely , and strained for a last breath as he shot under . In a green light he was slatted about dreadfully , spinning upright , then horizontal , his useless arms and legs flying wide and shaken . A giant weight , a personal , hateful weight , began pressing on his back , pressing him slowly down into the dark . Acute worry seized him because this thing was unfair ? would not give him a chance to get just one more breath ? was squeezing him down into a funnel , and he did not think the bore at the end was big enough to let him through . " Why , " he thought , " why , this is It ! This is dying . What they call Death ! ? I 'm very sorry for them all up there . " And then he thought , as suddenly , " Hold on ! I ca n't yet , because before this sort of thing I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've drunk from here spring ? Helen ? that was the agreement " ? But still he was pressed downward , and the pain grew heavy and dull . No one would ever tell her of the cold , the dark , the loneliriess . It was all years ago , anyway , and very deep . Slowly he was rising . " Where next ? " he thought cynically . Perhaps it was over now , and this was just the fellow 's soul going up , up . " No , by golly , there 's too much pain about it . It ' s lighter ? The sun ? It 's me , and I 'm out ? Air ! " He struck out in leaden imitation of swimming , just to take it up where he had left off ; then stopped ; then began again . He was more interested in a pale thing that accompanied him , large and speckled , like a potato , but twitching round the edges , round the nostrils . " Why , it 's my nose , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The humor of this woke him up , and now he really swain . " I 've wasted a lot of time down there , " lie mourned . Something large , white , and round came rushing at him through the water . The can-buoy , ? the tide was carrying him past , he must n't lose that . He lashed out for it blindly , and managed to be flung against the slope . Though it dipped , swayed , and rolled , he slowly climbed up , over barnacles and painted sheet-iron , to where he could grasp the iron ring at the top . It must have been for a long time that he clung there . The tiny knives of the barnacles had sliced his legs , and blood ran in slow red streams through the hair on his shins . " It 's all up , " he reflected , watching the tide race by . " I 've come through the upper tip-edge of the whirlpools , off there . Just a baby one that got me ; but it 's done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will Peter say , and Helen ? " The only answer was despair ; he grew colder and weaker , his aching fingers loosened , time dragged on , and he longed to go to sleep . There came a puffing from somewhere . Ile looked up to see a smoky , brindle-colored tug off to the left , making for the town . He waved one arm , and gave a feeble hail . Nothing happened . He tried again and again , without much hope . At last she gave a short toot of her whistle , came about , headed toward him , turned near at hand , and stood off in a lathering wake . Two staring men lifted him precariously into a rowboat , and pulled back through the sweep of tide . " How many men have you got aboard ? " Ise kept asking , as plainly as he could for the chatter of his teeth . " He 's bughouse , " flatly asserted the man at the oars . " Lord , he 's blue as my shirt . Git him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slug o ' whiskey . ? What 'd ye try to swim it fer ? ? No ' use askin ' , he 's bughouse . " Then all that Archer remembered was being lowered into the warns depths of the tug , and standing before the red blaze of the furnace door , with the water forming inky puddles round his feet in the coal dust . And the deck-hands choked him with vile Irish whiskey . Then he found himself talking lucidly with a fat , jovial , and astonished captain , and , by a last effort of the will , making him understand that he , Archer , this naked Wills-/per , could pay a hundred dollars to have a posse of men taken over at once to the island . And then they had touched at a wharf , where dozens of men had sprung aboard , shinning down the slimy green spilings . The tug was off again . The engineer gave him cotton waste to rub down with , and dressed him in a blue jumper and overalls . They sped past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tide . Throughout this dream every one was wonderfully kind to him , and seemed to think him a decent fellow , somehow . The captain introduced him formally to Sheriff Moriarty. a keen , elderly man with a gnawed mustache , who asked many questions briskly , and kept repeating , " Always said so . Knew something of the kind would happen . Old man Powell ' s a damn fool . I knew it . " And then in admiration , " Young man , there 's few could have swum to that boo-y at any time of tide . " Yet all this was unreal ; it was only when they steamed into the cove , and could see the close-shuttered house , that men and things seemed to Archer more than a tangled farce of dreams . Three boatloads pulled quickly landward . But as they rowed , Archer saw a little squash of men appear over the slope , running toward the house ; and a man in a blue jersey was running with the first of them . The island was very still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battering of blows on the door came down to them while they struggled 476 Bine Peter up the sand , more boatloads racing after them ; but when they reached the field , they saw the little mob still outside , swarming like hornets round the doorstep . Something had checked them : there was a surge of conflict , but no advance . As the townsmen ran up the slope , two figures rolled down past them , ? the dark Indian face of Sebattis , who was trying to bite a white man 's ear , ? both growling and punching in a drunken dogfight entirely beside the point of the main quarrel . Some of the less eager among the sheriff 's men stopped to separate them , but Archer and the others swept on . Already a few of the gang scattered from the door in flight , running unsteadily round the house and up through the vegetable garden . One man fell blindly through the beanpoles , with loud oaths and breakage . Those who stood their ground had their backs turned , and were apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archer saw what it was . Before the broken panels of the door , old Lehane and Peter stood in a clinch so desperate that the rest had fallen back to watch them . Even in the heat of running Archer could see the wrench of muscles under the blue jersey of the one and the coat , green with age , that covered the broad back of the other . Peter , with both hands aloft , gripped Lehane 's wrist so that a pistol pointed skyward ; but round his own throat a great , fat hand was murderously at work . Both bodies , the lithe and the bulky , were strained to the last fibre . " Old fool ! " grunted Peter . His eyes were almost shut against the sun , the blue veins showed like a Biblical seal on his forehead . " Quit it ! " A sudden ripple of tense motion ran through his body from boot-heel to wrist . There was a sound like a stick snapping . " Ah ! " bellowed the big man . The pistol fell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden , and ran upon them all in a victorious scuffle . It was more than two to one , andwith old Lehane surrounded , the fight was laughably simple . Archer found himself shoving off an overzealous deckhand who would have seized Kellum . The old man sat against the red stone wall , his little knees drawn up with a comical air of comfort , but a red stream from his cheekbone trickling into his yellow-stained beard . " tie hit me a proper hard poke , " he was muttering , dazed but philosophic . " It could n't ' a ' come square on , though . " Helen appeared from somewhere with towels , a basin , and a bottle . Her brown eyes sought Archer 's for one bright instant , and then she was at work over Kellum , deftly and sensibly . The old man looked up at her like a dirty , bearded child . " Ye done well , Hugh , " said the deep voice of Peter . The two big men grinned at each other like schoolboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat the red stripes from the old man 's fingers . " To speak plain , ye done better ' n I thought ye could . ' T was an awful resk . " " I have n't done so much as you , " replied Archer . He meant far more than this , for new and strange thoughts had been swarming in his mind through all this tumult . " Nothing like , Peter . " Both men had stopped smiling . " It was both of us , ? both fer the same thing , anyway , " the fisherman said . " ' T was a narrer squeak , " he added , with forced cheerfulness . " We had n't ought ter complain , ' cept fer the boy . " He turned away slowly , and walked a little distance down the field , where Archer did not follow him . In the meantime Helen had disappeared . Farther down the slope old Lehane was raving in the midst of a group . " Leggo , damn ye , my arm 's broke , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the feller , up there , ? the red-headed one in the overhalls ; he done fer Beaky , I tell ye . " " That 'll all come out at the inquest , " Sheriff Moriarty called down to him . " Take him over to town and get his arm set , " he ordered , and came stalking upward to engage in conversation with Mr. Powdl . The scholar had now ventured out , pale and bewildered , into the sunlit flower garden ; and over the tangle of swectpeas Archer could see him shaking hands timidly with the sheriff , like a mild curate receiving congratulations on a discourse . The sheriff was introducing several other men . " Mr. Powell , " he said briskly , " I want you to know my brothers , Mr. John Moriarty , and Mr. Michael , and Mr. Florence Moriarty ; he 's a lawyer , sir , and may be able to help you about this matter of the squatting ; and Mr. Hugh Moriarty , that I think you 've dealt with in groceries ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale little man shook " hands very precisely , all round . " I am glad to meet you , sir , " he repeated , without an inkling of what this intrusion from the great world was all about . " Ah , Mr. Ferris , ? non ? Innis Moriarty , " he chirped , and in spite of the blank looks from the group of kinsmen , was visibly pleased with his joke . Archer turned to Kellum . The old captain was not much hurt ; in fact , after Helen 's ministration he seemed almost neat , and looked up with sage and weatherbeaten resignation . They fell into the friendly talk of allies , in which Archer caught , by the light of many a homely phrase , glimpses of how Peter had played for time , played with craft and force , delaying , desperately delaying , the drunken crew in the harbor . Yes , it all strengthened what he himself had been thinking . " He 's a good lad , " We call him that for a joke . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , an ' he 'll be goin ' away now , he tells me . He seems dretful cut up about the boy . Well , they 'll most all be goin ' in a month , fer the winter . It 's only a summer camp , ? ' cep ' fer a few of us , the devil 's orts , that has to stay all the year round . " " Captain Kellum , " asked Archer , suddenly , " what would you do if you had your choice , instead of staying here ? " The little old sailor wagged his yellow beard sadly . " ' T ai n't no use talkin ' so . But by the powers , " he ejaculated , " if I had the money , I 'd buy back the Regina . Lyons ' nil sell ' er ; lie wants a bigger bo't . Some fools ' II tell ye a centreboard schooner 's no good , " he cried , warming with enthusiasm . " But she , ? I had ' er fourteen year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck , ? why , she 'd go like ? like a horse ! The ' ai n't much left fer ye , my boy , when ye come to my age , p'r'aps . But I 'd ask nothin ' better than jcs ' to come up on deck again on a winter mornin ' and see where the vessel ' s lyin ' . " " If I buy her , " said Archer , " will you take her and pay me a quarter of what she brings you in two years ? Sine 's yours on those terms . " The old man 's eyes peered at him , hard and bright at this cruel joke . " Where 'd ye git the money ? " he retorted . " I 've got enough for that , " replied Archer , laughing . " What do you say ? I 'll get Moriarty to telegraph Lyons today , when he goes over . You say he 'll sell . You can go aboard the first of the week . " Captain Kellum was astonished at this magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye mean it ? ' T ai n't a fair bargain to you , but if ye mean it " ? His old face looked very queer and puzzled . Helen was coming from the house . " I mean it . Think it over , " said Archer , as he moved away to meet her . By tacit assent they walked together apart from the groups of men , past the house , between the rows of frost-bitten vegetables . Her hair shone once more with bronze gleams in the sunshine . He felt infinitely glad to be with her again , as if he had come back to her after a long time and from a far country , ? indeed , from the dark limbo of the farthest country , where time is unknown . She was good to look upon ; he loved her with all his heart ; yet what should have been happiness was overpowered with sorrow and self-reproach . " Tell me , " she asked in her quiet voice , " what is it all about ? I 'm in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barefoot . What does it all mean ? Hugh ? " He answered her smile at this first use of his name . Then very seriously he explained it all , ? the fight in the dark , what he had done by water that morning , what Peter had done by land ; everything save what his promise to Peter forbade him to tell . Her clear brown face was alight and alive with the swift-changing emotions . When he had ended this story of rough deeds , she was deeply moved and silent ; but be knew she had acquitted him of his worst responsibility . " But why , " she asked in a puzzled way , " why did that old man think it started about me ? What have I " ? She had gone so straight to the point that he was both amused and dismayed . " You must n't ask me that now , Helen , " he answered . " I 've promised not to tell it all " ? " Not to me ? " she asked , disappointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not to you . " In the long silence he stooped and plucked at the withered tops of potatoes . " Oh , Helen ! " he broke out at last . " It 's that that worries use and makes me ashamed ? the promise , and a great deal more that I 've been thinking all the way over , through it all . I 'm ashamed . I came here , " be hurried on breathlessly , " I came here and stole it from you , all at once , as if I 'd been the only man in the world , ? or the best , ? without giving you a chance , even , to know what the others were like ? Oh , I 'm ashamed ! " he cried . " It was like a cad , ? it was n't fair to you , dear . " Her face had turned pale in the sunlight . " Are you sorry ? " she asked , with a cold voice that was not her own , and that did not conceal her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly . " It 's the happiest and truest thing in my life . Oh , do n't you see why ? , It 's just because it is n't fair to you . I wanted you to know that there were better fellows , off the island ? and on it . Here goes my word ! " he exclaimed in dismay . " I ca n't keep it . You said , the other time , that you never used to feel alone , ? that there was a kind of ? of presence , you said , among the trees and places . Well , there was . " And he told her all that Peter had said that morning . " There , I 've broken my promise to him . But it 's best . He 's given up everything , thought , and care , and work , and his little brother , and I just came along and stole it . Why , Helen , you grew up in a kind of garden ? an enchanted garden you might have played it was ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walls you could n't see . And what am I before a man like that ? Just look , without any make-believe . We have n't even talked things over as we were going to this morning . But see . I 've run away from everything ? just drifted along ? never thought much ? took chances ? only had good luck . Do n't you see ? " She surveyed him oddly . In her eyes was a shine as of transfiguration , but he could not understand it . " You 're very young about some things , " she said " Younger than I ? years . Did n't you see , up there ? ca n't you remember ? that our one look ? and what it meant ? Did n't you see that it settled it all ? I know there are other men , and noble and good ? the world full of them ? not getting their deserts ? deserts much bigger than a girl like me . I know that . But what of it ? This Peter , oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must be wonderfully good . But ? do n't you see ? " she begged helplessly . " I ca n't explain ? but if you do n't ? if you have the least doubt ? then we 've made a mistake " ? Her eyes shone pitifully and her lip trembled // " Helen , you know I could n't , " he said , frightened at the thought . " You know that . Why , when I was in the whirlpool , and it on my back ? this Death your father spins words about ? pressing me down , what do you suppose I thought ? Just that I could n't die then , because the drink from your spring , ? our poor little foolish game , lasting through it all , right to the end of everything , down there in the dark . Oh , just believe that ! I ca n't explain , either , half of it . " The color of reassurance came back to her cheeks . " Look , " he said , pointing before them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a lane went by to the pastures on the northern headland . " This will help . See , this puddle of water here , where your cow 's been drinking . It 's full of her hoof-marks , and shallow , and dirty , and everything . Now stand over here . " Moving away , they leaned forward together and looked . The light so caught the little surface that the water was deep as the sky , and the clouds and the blue air were in it . " There , you see . That 's my life , before you , and since . I do n't know how else " The girl was the first to speak again . " I ca n't tell you so well , " she said . " But the long winter evenings with the snow against the panes , ? and the sum-mer nights and no one to talk to , ? there 'll be no more of those . " Then she changed , happily mocking his sober face . " Parables in puddles , ? and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know , " he confessed . " But I 've been through something that 's made me preach these things to myself . And two persons I met this morning , one on the island , and one in the water . Let 's not talk about it . But I 'm not going to let things go to waste any longer , or run away . Old Kellum ' s happy ; there 's a beginning , and there are lots of chances . You 're at the bottom of it all . If we could only do something for Peter " ? Helen looked thoughtfully down toward the house and the cove . " Poor fellow , " she said at last . " I 'm glad you told Inc . I must talk with him , though it will be very hard for us both . Let 's go back now ; and good-by , for a while , dear . Oh , you ' II tell my father soon , wo n't you ? It 's best not to keep the truth hidden . Good-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not one ! " he answered earnestly . " I wish I could do it for you ? this " ? " No , " she said . " You did your part this morning . There are other hard things that only a woman can do . " From the little flower garden , all crushed and torn with the recent scuffle , they saw the men moving away , part climbing the hill toward the harbor , part returning to the beach . At the edge of the slope toward the cove , Peter , alone in the field , stood looking toward the mainland . Helen walked slowly down toward him . Archer pattered indoors barefoot , and at the desk in the dark corner of the library , began a letter . " Powell 's Island , Wednesday . To Captain Berry , Barkentine Elizabeth Fanning . My dear Sir : ? An accident involving the death of two persons " Her father 's commonplace book lay open before him . As he cast about for the right words , his eye lighted on a recent addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Metaphysics of Love . ? This ablest of modern thinkers has said very wisely : ' And yet , amid all this turmoil we see a pair of lovers exchanging longing glances , ? but why so secretly , timidly , and furtively ? Because these lovers are traitors secretly striving to perpetuate all this misery and turmoil that otherwise would come to a timely end . ' " " Ilm ! " ? he pondered . " It seems her father may not need so much information as we supposed . She fails as an actress , " he thought with joy . Then he took the liberty of closing the book and
