 |p696  NEXT to being a factor in a great movement , the post of independent spectator seems most desirable , for as such one may watch the march of events with the interest but without the anxiety of a partisan who is forced to observe , in state of impotent quiescence , much that must violate his feelings and his principles . Such has been my position during the past momentous year in France , in which I have endeavored to meet people of all classes and parties and to understand their widely differing points of view . In October I reported in The Outlook a Frenchwoman 's view of French Clericalism . It seemed worthy of record as being , I believe , typical of the attitude of a large number of liberal French Catholics who , while deprecating the haste of the Government and the consequent sorrow which it entails on hundreds of good and presumably devoted men and women in the religious orders , yet feel that the Church has so ill fulfilled its trust in the matter of education that it is time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious schools , from whatever motive , have failed to give . Now , as a resident of X in the past four months , I have seen and felt the political situation from the point of view of a society whose sympathies are clerical , national , even monarchical . Three hours from Paris , the seat of an Archbishop , surrounded by the chateaux of the nobility , home of a great church printing-house , headquarters of an army corps , X is , in sentiment , plus royaliste que le roi , and more clerical than the clerics , and yet has been obliged to suffer a Radical as its military head , and to harbor a strong body of Socialists . This combination is not constituted to make for harmony , nor has it ; although , considering the bitterness of feeling , the cases - of disorder and violence have been surprisingly few , yet numerous enough to impress the Clericals with a fear of what may come . It happened early in the fall that I found myself one Sunday under the guidance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to a question , offered to take me to see the annual benediction of the people by the Archbishop in the garden of the Archeveche . We descended together in that charming place where , from under the tropical palms , you get a delightful glimpse of the cathedral towers . The great doors of the Archbishop 's palace , giving on this place , and usually closed , were open to admit the quiet , orderly crowd which surged through , and of which we became a part . Once inside the garden on the wide sweep of gravel before the sixteenth-century building , my guide found friends , respectable citizens like herself , and a conversation ensued in which I was politely included . The woman regretted that I had not seen the fete in former years . " How it was beautiful ! A long procession through the streets , banners , clergy , and music 1 " Then in a lowered voice ? one becomes used to this tone in France to-day ? " But now , madame , it is forbidden . Ah , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets in his carriage for fear that he may be killed ! " The faces of her friends expressed horror and concurrence . One young artisan protested . " But , yes , but , yes ! " insisted our friend . The artisan still shook his head . " He need not fear for himself , Madame ! we do not wish violence , but liberty . The Government ? " " Bah I " cried the woman , " ce vilian gouvernement . " " Not fear ! " went on a small man in shabby black , holding his huge umbrella firmly and pressing close ; " dost thou not know , Antoine , that two sisters of St. Martin have been attacked on the street returning from their errands of mercy after dark ? The first fled  |p697  from her pursuer for refuge within the Cathedral , and fell senseless at the very door , her head cut open by a blow from the coward . The other was set upon , choked , and thrown to the ground , where she lay until found by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " whispered the woman . Ah , ces pauvres chreres Sczurs . " The conversation was interrupted at that moment by the appearance of about twenty men in cassocks and caps upon a terrace connected , at the height of the second story , with the palace . Each one carried his surplice rolled up under his arm , and they all approached the parapet , laughing , chatting , and bowing to the people . " The seminaristes and the cures from the country parishes , " my guide explained , delightedly . Presently the students and cures shook their white surplices to the wind , made the sign of the cross , and donned them with much hilarity and to the great amusement of the crowd . A moment later the terrace became quiet , hats came off , and all fell back before the Suisse who , bearing his staff of office , preceded the Archbishop , followed by four Bishops . The Archbishop came forward to the balustrade and stood there looking down on the people for a long moment before he began to speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any church in France at the present time . He emphasized the fact again and again that safety to the people and the Church lay in union ? that clergy and people together can accomplish anything . There seemed to be no outward sign of response in the crowd to his earnest appeal . They listened respectfully but without emotion , received his benediction with bowed heads , and only woke up to a laugh at his joke as he turned to go , " I should like to be there among you , but I see no way unless I jump ! " From the garden we crossed to the Cathedral , closed in after the procession of clergy , and entered the great church . I have never seen a more impressive sight than the congregation there assembled . It was impossible to make way through it , for nave , aisles , and ambulatory were crowded with a solid mass of people . In spite of the fears of the clericals , the day passed with no hostile demonstration . The first burning question with which I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I had two children to educate , I naturally sought advice and information from friends who by experience and long residence seemed best qualified to give it . Mme. N Clerical and Legitimist , said , " Your boy to the Lycee . If it were last year , you would have put him with the Christian Brothers , but now it is closed . The Lycee instructs well , but it has no good influence . " I interrupted her : " Shall all the boys of family be sent to the Lycees when the Brothers ' Schools are closed ? " " Never , " she answered , firmly . " You are a Protestant and an American ? you may do so ? but we , no . Our sons shall go to Catholic schools in Spain , in Italy , in Jersey , in Belgium , in England . In closing our religious schools the Government drives our children from France . As for your girl , " she continued , " you will send her to the Sacre Cceur . There is no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may be weak on the sciences ? qu'importe ? Is it not more important that your daughter be educated in the fear of God by women of breeding and traditions than by diplomaed professors who own no God and no manners ? " " You exaggerate , " I said , laughing . " Wait , you will see for yourself , " she answered . I put the boy in the Lycee . I took time to decide for the girl . I had a prejudice against convents , and I knew that the Lycee des Jeunes Filles was installed in a building which for perfection of equipment can not be surpassed in America . I decided to brave the opinion of my friends and place my daughter there ; and I therefore went to an interview with the head of the Faculty . After a short conversation I knew that , just as surely as a school takes its tone from its head , just as surely was the Lycee out of the question . I left , asking myself how it was possible that the person whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position ; later in the day I received an  |p698  answer in the simple word " Politics . " My experience at this Lycee was repeated in the case of two other American women last fall . We were asked by the French Protestant clergyman to report our reception and the ensuing conversations to the proper authorities . Next , not wishing to be hasty , I made a trial of the best private school in town ; and then , convinced of the wisdom of Mme. N ' s advice , finally sent the child to the Sacred Heart . In a choice of evils as they now exist , I personally prefer those of the convent to those I have found in the other schools . To me , the spirit of patience , courtesy , kindness , and self-control which prevails there outweighs the evident superstition and bigotry , and compensates for modern methods and text-books when accompanied by the " diplomaed professors with no God and no manners . " " How is this ? " I asked of a French Protestant . " Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really the only possible schools for girls of the upper classes ? And why ? " " It is generally true , " she said . To have one 's daughters with children of their own kind , taught by ladies , they must go to the convents . Why ? Because among the laity teaching is a despised profession . " I began to wonder selfishly what I should do were the Sacre Coeur to be closed , and in that moment understood something of the problem which is facing hundreds of Catholic parents in France to-day . At the Lycee religion is ignored in the daily programme . The children march into the class-rooms , begin their lessons , and continue through the day without any acknowledgment of the existence of a higher power in the universe . All this gives cause for fear to even the most thoughtless of Frenchmen . " Close the convents ? " cries a young officer , after giving you a half-humorous , half-cynical description of marriage a la mode . " Mon Dieu l When the convents are closed and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I would not marry a wife who was not pieuse . The Church is all that holds French women ; when religion goes , marriage in France will be l'enfer . " The school question settled for the moment , I found that the political crisis was very much alive whichever way one turned . It walked with you , talked with you , and was a skeleton at every feast . The feasts , by the way , would be , I was assured , far from festive . " There will be no balls this winter ; no one wishes to dance ? none of us , bien entendu . No one feels very gay in France just now . " What of the Prefect and the government officials ? " I asked , maliciously . There must be so many of this class in X --  that they might even have a circle of their own , but society knew them not . Everywhere I have found the settled and apparently resigned conviction that the upper class has " no chance " under the Government , in army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A case up for trial in the court here caused great bitterness among the friends and acquaintances of the accused , Baron He was condemned to penal servitude for three years for shooting a burglar who attacked him in his own house at night . The day of the sentence , the Comte de C , coming from the Palais de Justice , announced the verdict to a roomful of people . The news was received in dismayed silence , and the general feeling was voiced by the remark , " He was innocent . If he had been a grocer , he would have been acquitted . France has fallen low . " At that moment , baffling the sympathy I felt for my friends , came the thought , " If it is true , as they say , that this man has suffered unjustly because he is a noble , has not many an ancestor of his done his man to death without cause , safe because he was a noble ? And who shall say that this and others like it are not the tardy event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Even a stranger must have felt the pity of the following announcement in a radical newspaper a few days later : " The street commission has decided to replace the street names which a free conscience condemns and which are synonymous of ignorance and servitude by those of men who have rendered service to humanity . " Then followed the names  |p699  of thirty streets or squares which are to be changed , among them : Place de la Cathedrale ? Place de Quatorze Juillet . Rue Sainte Catherine ? Alexandre Dumas . Rue St. Francois de Paul ? Jules Favre . Rue Saint Paul ? Edmond Pottier . Rue Saint Sauveur ? Felix Pyat . The Blessed Saviour and Saint Paul " synonymous of ignorance and servitude . " Cela , c'est un pen fort ! One or two of the names mark a loss to the future historian . At a time when " delation " in the army was occupying space in the columns of French and foreign journals , it was natural to come in direct cognizance of its existence and effect . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit next to an officer just in from a stag hunt , who , after an unquiet silence , finally burst out , " Madame , it is intolerable . " " What ? " " The present state of affairs in France . To-day I lunched before the hunt with the G- s . The conversation turned to politics . It always turns to politics now , and it is impossible to talk of politics now en amitie . The Dreyfus affair divided families that have never become reconciled ; to-day the Government is doing as much . Eh , bien ? at luncheon Mme. G said to me , des chases blessantes , " How can you accept pay from such a Government ? Refuse it ! Resign from the army . Have you no self-respect ? ' Those were her words , Madame , and because I feel their truth , they cut ? but what can I do ? I was educated for the army . It is my profession . There is no place for me in France out of the army , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . " " What do you mean ? " I asked . " That a good name is a curse in France to-day , a barrier to all Government advancement . There are many men in my position , good soldiers , ambitious , who know that their career is blocked . " . This statement I believed exaggerated , but I have since heard it repeated again and again , and later events too pointedly proved its truth , for an acquaintance asked a week later , " Have you heard about Captain ? " ( he of the dinner party ) . ' The spies have done their worst . There are charges against him . He is too well born ; besides , he goes to mass on Sunday . Already the army people are afraid to receive him . " Sad is the position of the victims of M. Combes 's system of espionage ? for calumny is fairly sure to poison the most innocent life to some degree . It is a satisfaction to know that the spies ? casseroles , or saucepans , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are outcasts , detested even by men of their own party , and whether the Government fixes its blame upon them or not , public opinion has visited them with a crushing condemnation . " We are all like this , " as one officer expressed it , several weeks ago , shaking from head to foot . " But , " I said , " if , as you say , your army is an army of Nationalists with the sympathy of the Church and the upper classes , why are you content to submit to the outrages of the Combes administration ? " " Because we have no one to lead us . Even a Boulanger , poseur as he was , could save the day , could achieve a coup a ' ' etat , but there is no man in the country to lead us . " No man to lead , perhaps ? and too many Republicans in the ranks ? We did not realize then , what shortly became evident , that this very spying in the army was to prove the overthrow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts was the suppression of seven convents of the Sacre Cceur , including the one of which I have spoken here . Seen at close range , the closing of this famous school seemed crude , arbitrary , and quite all wrong , so does the personal bias of sentiment , sympathy , or mere comfort affect one 's focus on events . But I believe that though the Government methods are harsh , this convent , type of all that is best and most elevating of its kind , should go ? with the religious schools in towns and the parochial schools in the country ? to my and others ' inconvenience , to the sorrow of its happy pupils and good women , to make place for the final establishment of schools , which must arise to meet the demand , where the best of modern teaching shall go hand in hand with liberty of con/ science and the fear of God . The religious schools abolished , France may swing far from bigotry to atheism , as one is constantly hearing , but as long as " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the search for truth can not end in darkness , but in more light . These incidents , a few out of many such , indicate the feeling of the upper classes as it prevails in one large provincial town ? a feeling of contempt , hostility , and hate towards the Government which , while openly expressed , achieves nothing ? nor will . Why ? Because the upper classes are forced to accept the present situation at the hands of the people ? of the people and of that large body of bourgeois who deride the pretensions of the aristocracy , and are determined that the future of France shall be out of their hands and out of the hands of churchmen who support them . France is a nation imbued with class hatred , where , unless all signs fail , the future holds no hope of restored power to aristocracy or Church . The century will bring no stranger spectacle than this : the masses , recognizing the force of representation , invested with power ; the aristocracy oppressed in army , Church , and State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combes , the Clericals and Nationalists pretend to hope ; but a change of Cabinet will not change the will of the people , which is the force in France to-day .
