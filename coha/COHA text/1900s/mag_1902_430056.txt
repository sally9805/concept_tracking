IN every European state the rights of the individual are protected in matters great and small . If he buy a dozen fresh eggs and four be found stale , the shopkeeper suffers a penalty , the buyer making complaint . If a free-born American buy a dozen eggs and four be found " ineligible , " he thanks his stars , be:ng a prudent man , that the rest are usable ; or if , disposed to stand for his rights , he makes protest to his grocer , he may , as a matter of sheer good humor , have his loss made good to him ; though equally liable to be asked what he is going to do about it . Truly individualism with us has been virtually unlicensed , and things have come to such a pass thatalmost everything but the air we breathe is manipulated , directed or controlled to the end of profiting some one group of individuals to the wronging , in most instances , of all others . IN no direction does . this policy of unholy greed work so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the most abundant , superlatively goodin-quality supply vouchsafed to any peo- ple on earth . So great indeed are our food riches that our artisans may live as well as the landed gentry of Europe , our wealthy classes as well as prances and kings . Yet , so great are our food wrongs , that we are actually in danger of physical degeneracy from food adulterations . A staggering statement , alas ! too provable . We sit at our tables loaded with the good things of earth , air and water , knowing that nothing more puzzling in the way of a problem could be propounded than that of defining accurately the composition of the separate , seemingly simple dishes before us ; and if a truthful list of every item entering into an elaborate dinner could be submitted to us , we should doubtless he aghast . But the climax of these commercial outrages seems to have been about reached ; our slow anger is arousing to their enormity , and we are ripe for rebellion . In short , the individual is ready to act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point ? " how , " indeed ? Thinking men all over the country are  | bringing pressure to bear upon legislators , and legislators are moving for effective laws ; yet enormous moneyed interests are bound up in the various phases of the pure food question and the fight can not be other than a gigantic and protracted one . Conceding that it is " on , " for once ( at least ) woman has , by all that is just , a right to legislative voice ; if not directly , indirectly by the very facts of the situation . We are the food handlers of the world ! And if we are alive to the possibilities of purity or impurity in all that we use , if we have an intelligent knowledge of foods ( as it is clearly our business to have ) , if we set our faces determinedly against food frauds , refuse to aid , abet , or submit to them , what can manufacturers do , legislation or no legislation ? Legislation , however , is a prime necessity ? being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperative , both in bringing about proper legislation and to make it effective when enacted . I F every woman in the land could be made to realize that what is doing in Washington and in our state legislatures ( in the matter of pure food agitation and legislation ) has an actual , definite , and incalculable bearing upon her darling baby 's smile , her boy 's sturdiness , her ( laughter 's beauty and grace , the happiness of them all , she would sit up nights to study that question in all its ins and outs , and give by day her fine and faithful energies to its practical elucidation . Fortunately no great amount of time or study is necessary to an intelligent comprehension of food legislation , though a considerable amount would be required to gain a full understanding of what food products are adulterated , how they are adulterated and what the result is of such adulteration . Up to the present time legislation has been directed against the most mischievous adulterations only , innumerable minor food frauds having by necessity to remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been enlightened as to pure food legislation by Senator William E. Mason , the real leader of pure food aitation at Washington , and chairman of the senate committee on manufactures ( to which all bills relating to pure food and drugs are referred ) ; and I have also received information and help from congressmen interested in the pure food subject . When it was intimated to Senator Mason by a mutual friend ? a grave and precise judge ? that a lady interested in the matters of pure food desired some information from him , he expressed himself as graciously ready for any discussion , but doubtful as to the probability of the feminine mind being open to the legal aspects of a question . I mention this to prick the pride and to arouse that really never-failing acumen which is a concomitant of femininity under real incitement . KNOW , then , that unlike European states , where all laws emanating from a central legislative body are enforced unquestioningly throughout the provinces of that state , our federal government concedes to each state a large measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of articles , and the sale of such manufactured articles within its own borders . The United States laws are effective of course in the territories ; but beyond that , they can only control manufactured articles when handled or sold outside of the state where they are manufactured . That makes a complicated situation , and the hope of all pure food agitators and legislators is of course that state and national laws may be made uniform ? to absolutely agree in spirit and letter . To a " fresh eve " that would seem an easy matter to bring about , but the factor of special , individual interests in the various states comes in to embarrass measures conceived for the good of the whole . A large number of states already have passed laws prohibiting the adulteration  | of food and drugs ; and if these laws were enforced , such states would now be fairly protected from fraudulent products manufactured within their own borders . But right here is a point difficult for the feminine mind to grapple , namely , that the making of laws is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , for instance , the laws , say , of Massa. chusetts , regulating the conduct of citizens after 6 o'clock Saturday night , were enforced this coming week , the following Monday morning would find many of that state 's best behaved citizens in jail . It may be said that the efficacy of law in any state or country is proportionate to the intelligence or genius of its people . As was said in the pure food congress convened at Portland , Oregon , in July of this year , " whatever laws may be enacted , their impartial en-forcement depends upon the tireless energy and broadmindedness of those intrusted by the people to enforce them . " And again : " Public sentiment will enforce a law when conditions become so dangerous as to be recognized by the public at large . " We give , by the way , a portrait of the new president of the National dairy and pure food association , Mr J. W. Bailey of Portland , Oregon , a native of Maine and for four years past the dairy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population of a state an element of lawbreakers , those who defy established order for the sake of personal profit . If such defiance meets no opposition it soon becomes open , as in the case of our state food laws . As a case in point : at the recent Portland congress a representative of the manufacturers ' association actually and unblushingly attempted to convince the delegates that " it is not possible to put articles on the market without the use of antiseptics and preservatives . " Think of it ! Is it not time for individual - citizens to act , to stand for the rights insured to them by legislation ? And that is where women , as food handlers , can of themselves ( far more than voters or legislators ) regulate the enforcement of pure food laws . THE next point in pure food legislation that may properly be considered here ( which women should understand ) refers to internal revenue laws . When a national law is enacted , and the govern- ment further undertakes the enforcement of that law through inspectors appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ; and any article coming under such law is absolutely safeguarded from fraud . A few food products are now so protected , as flour , which , thanks chiefly to the efforts of Mr Mason , was put under internal revenue law . To illustrate the all-around advantage gained by such protection , it may be mentioned that since the passage of the flour hill the adulteration of flour has practically ended , every mill engaged in i t s manufacture having closed . The consumer is now protected , t h e honest manufacturer relieved of unfair competition and the reputation of American flour has so improved abroad that its export has increased twenty - five per cent . It is presumable that the logic of flour legislation w o u l d hold good in regard to all articles coming under internal revenue regulation . The question naturally arises , " Why not put all food products under internal revenue protection ? " THE answer is , that it is not practicable , for the reason that the tax imposed for the inspection of a food product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of such inspection . Therefor , an inspection of all food products , particularly minor articles , would be a losing arrangement for the government , and while good law , I suppose would be deemed bad politics . Still , the members of the senate committee to which the pure food bill was referred evidently are of the opinion that the government should protect our food supply at whatever cost , for in the report recommending the passage of the bill appears the following ! " It may become necessary , if the real purpose of this bill meets with opposition and defeat , wise and prudent , for this committee to have prepared ' and ready revenue legislation to reach some of the most glaring evils by adding it to the next revenue bid . " Mr Mason 's committee ( acting under resolutions pointing to the regulation of interstate commerce , resolutions inspired by all that had been done by pure food agitation , b i 1 1 s , etc ) examined the pure food question comprehensively from beginning to end . " without fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by this committee is found this : " It is only fair to say that a large proportion of American manufacturers who are engaged in adulterating food products do so in order to meet competition . and it is the expression of those gentlemen that we would like to quit putting this stuff in coffee , and would be willing to brand our syrups for what they are , but our competitors get a trade advantage which we can not surrender . ' " Also this : " It is the purpose of this committee to adopt this uniform rule ; to prohibit the sale of deleterious and unhealthful food products ; and as to those food products  | which are simply cheapened by adulterants , to compel the marking of those goods for what they are . " As a summary of the committee 's work two general plans for food regulations are recommended , namely : " to put the important food products under internal revenue law , as has been done in the case of butter , filled cheese and flour " ; or " to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further provide for the establishment of a board which shall carry out the part of the rule established by this . committee , and fix the standards for food , drinks and drugs . " THIS brings us formally to the " Hepburn bill , " by which name the senate bill considered by Mr Mason 's committee is known in the house of representatives ? t h e great measure pending in both houses of congress , so important to our national health . The bill embodies the best thought and the measures passed by all the food congresses which have been held throughout the country as well as the most careful consideration given the subject by students of the food situation and by state and national legislators . It was introduced into the house of representatives December 6 , 1900 , by Mr Hepburn , under the cation , " A b11 for preventing the adulteration , misbranding and imitation of foods , beverages , candies , drugs and condiments in the District of Columbia , and the territories , and for regulating interstate traLc therein , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conviction that it covers every point which its title suggests ? first of prohibiting the manufacture or sale of any food product containing deleterious adulterants ; secondly , of compelling manufacturers so to label all food articles sold that consumers may know exactly what they are and what they contain . Harmless adulterants may be used , but in every case where used must be plainly indicated on labels , that the price of pure goods may not be demanded . It was hoped that the bill would be acted upon during the last session of congress ( the committees of both houses having recommended i t s passage ) , but it was laid over for action during the coming session . If it passes , it is thought that state legislation will soon be brought to conform to it . And the separate measures therein contained , being doubly fortified by national and state enactment , it is believed will find practical enforcement by an intelligent people . For again , be it urged , it is we , the people , who stand for that enforcement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we need not be apathetic now , waiting for laws to measurably solve for us the problem . Why not inform ourselves now , somewhat , as to food adulterations , and individually stand for what is pure ? IT is the purpose of this magazine to enlighten its readers as to the most glaring food adulterations now practiced , and how to avoid them ; in short , to do  | all it can for the cause of pure food . It is a crusade undertaken with unselfish enthusiasm , in the belief that every intelligent reader must feel the subject to be one of vital , personal interest . For what indeed could be more important to the individual ? What legislation more important to the mass ? OUR grandmothers " preserved " from May until November , from two motives : that they might have a supply of good things for winter , not purchasable ; and secondly , for the very delight of the process ? that fascinatingly interesting process in which every really good housekeeper honestly revels . But conditions of the " old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us in this period of complex interests , duties and twentieth century activities to do our preserving as it would be to knit our stockings , first spinning the wool , or to go from New York to Philadelphia by stage coach . Yet we simply are obliged to do it ; have no alternative , indeed , if we would have things pure . To be sure , in all cities it is now possible to buy " homemade preserves , " etc , put up by women living in the country who make fruit preserving a business ; but the prices of such goods are ridiculously high , too high for reason or encouragement by any but the wealthy . If absolutely pure preserved and canned fruits could be put upon the market at prices proportionate ( to their cost ) to canned tomatoes , there are very few housekeepers in cities and large towns who would think of doing their own " preserving . " But we must wait for many features of the coming domestic millennium , with what patience we can command . MEANTIME , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensnare the unwary . Beware of all " fruit preservatives " ! There is not one of them that does not take from the wholesomeness of any canned or preserved article , while most of them are positively dangerous . Before me as I write is a " free sample package " ( sent through the mails ) of a preservative , labeled thus : " A tasteless fruit preserving powder , guaranteed to successfully preserve all kinds of fruit , tomatoes , etc. in jars that are not air-tight . . . . Fruit that has been spoiled after being canned , can be re-cooked with some of this powder , and its original flavor and sweetness will be restored , and it will remain sweet afterwards ; etc . Each heaping teaspoonful will preserve eight quarts of fruit . " Now would n't that label make a chemist shudder ? And yet a sweet old lady in the country told me last summer that that stuff ( or a similar one ) was " just splendid . " Set it down as a fact beyond disputing that care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rubbers are all the requirements for perfect preserving , canning , jellymaking , etc . ' WHILE the putting up of some of the spring and summer fruits is important , it is autumn which most enriches our store closets . Always bear in mind that it takes choice fruit to obtain results which are choice . If asked to make a list of what I considered the most desirable of autumn 's preserving possibilities , it would be , as follows : Peaches , in any or every form ? canned ( using onefourth of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ) ; preserved ( using three-fourths of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ) : pickled ; brandied ( using one-half pound of sugar to a pound of fruit , and adding a large coffee cupful of brandy to each quart of the cooked fruit ) ; jam , and marmalade . Of pears , the Duchess , just a few , canned . Wild plums ( or sloes ) preserved and jam are delicious , as they keep the wild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , canned . Jellies : green and ripe grape , quince , wild plum ( the best of all jellies for game ) . Pickles : Watermelon rind , cucumber , chow-chow . Grapes , canned ( seeded ) for pies , also jam . And a large  | quantity of grape juice ( unfermented ; for a refreshing drink the year ' round Lastly , tomatoes , being so easily done and more wholesome than the canned ones put up at wholesale for the trade .  |
