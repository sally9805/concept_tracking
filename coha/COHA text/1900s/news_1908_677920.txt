txt Rescued after two steamers had passed them by and when they believed they were doomed to die on their fast-filling craft , Capt . H. W. Morse , Frank Vargas , engineer- ; William Morse , cook , and son of the Captain , and Jolio Fernandez and Sabino Gonzales , deckhands , who manned the coal-carrying schooner barge Matanzas , were brought into port yesterday by the Italian steamer San Giovanni from Naples . The Matanzas was one of three barges that left Philadelphia last Tuesday in tow of the tug Concord . They belonged to the H. Staples Coal Company . Behind the 225-fathom steel hawser from the Concord when she started were the Matanzas , carrying 2,900 tons of coal ; the Fall River , with 1,500 tons on board , and the Grafton , with 900 tons . The last two were destined for Newport and the first was to be dropped at Boston . Capt . John Taylor and three men were on the Fall River , and on the Grafton were a Captain and two deckhands . Capt . Morse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England yesterday told the story of what happened after that attempt to flee from the Winter gale . " There was nothing left , " he said , " after that attempt to round Point Judith , and so the tugboat turned tail and started to run before the storm . The wind was increasing every minute , and the barges even then were rolling heavily and the sea was pounding and breaking over us . " All day Thursday we were straining and groaning at the hawser and making slow headway through one of the worst seas I have ever seen . " We gathered in the pilot house aft , and in order to get water it was necessary to go for 'd . To make the trip was to take your life in your hands . The water was breaking over us continually . " At 9 o'clock that night it was snowing so hard and was so thick that we could not see anything . And just when things were worst , what we had been expecting happened . The hawser connecting us with the tugboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an awful sea . We knew that the Concord could not get us again . " We were then , I should judge , about eighty-eight miles east of Sandy Hook and abtrut-fortylvites off Montauk Point . I had soundings made , and finding thirtytwo fathoms under us decided to anchor . One did not hold , and we let the other go . The hawser connecting us with the other barges went soon after we lost our tug . For a time we were able to make out dimly at intervals the red lights of the other barges , but they soon left us I alone in that boiling fury . " Our , situation was almost hopeless , but fortunately our head was held up to the wind . At times the sea made clean breaches over us . The cabin was flooded and the fires put out between decks . " We had some canned stuff in the pilot house and we warmed coffee over a small oil stove . We ran up our flag upside down as a distress signal , and at night we hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday the weather moderated and the wind shifted to the northwest . The Matanzas rode easier , but she was leaking too fast for the steam pump to keep her clear . " On Friday night a steamer passed to the eastward , but she did not see us . At 11 o'clock Saturday morning another passed , only five miles away . She , too , did not make us out . At 1:30 this morning we sighted the Giovanni coming ... Into port . We wrapped some oil-soaked waste about an iron pipe , lighted it , and waved it from the stern . The steamer sheered off , and we had about given up hope when her lights again came into view . " Information was received yesterday by wireless that the crew of the Fall River had been rescued by the outgoing Cunarder Mauretania and that they are now on the way to Liverpool . The barge was sighted with decks almost awash , and in response to signals the big liner stopped and took off the men . It is believed the Grafton and her men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
