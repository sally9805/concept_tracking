 | THE religious world stands today before a great fixed gulf . it was always there ; but hitherto has been evaded , concealed or bridged . On one side of this gulf is tradition on the other truth ; on one side the servile repetition ; on the other free invention ; on one side imitation of the dead letter ; on the other reproduction of the living spirit ; on one side constrained assent to doubtful ideas on the other joyous response to compelling ideals ; on one side extraneous revelation attested by miraculous credentials ; on the other original righteousness appreciated by the pure in heart ; on one side static legality ; on the other dynamic love ; on one side the sanctity of selfcentered isolation ; on the other the sacredness of sacrificial service ; on one side passion , hope of a better world hereafter ; on the other active work for the betterment of conditions here ; on one side dubious proofs of the existence of God as a formulated proposition ; on the other triumphant demonstration of His unfolding presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest work and the fair trade , the clean city and the just State . Of course the same external fact may be both traditional and true . But between the attitude of mind which accepts a proposition on the authority of ecclesiastical tradition and the attitude which demands scientific evidence of its historical truth there is no compromise . Between these two attitudes the great gulf is fixed . To be of any use a discussion of the college and the seminary must locate these institutions with reference to this gulf . Each of these two institutions may be on either side of it . That gives us four things to describe : the college of tradition , the seminary of tradition , the college of the truth and the seminary of the truth . Between these there are four possible combinations : ( 1 ) the college of tradition with the seminary of the truth ; ( 2 ) the college of the truth with the seminary of tradition ; ( 3 ) the college of tradition with the seminary of tradition ; ( : ) and the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First : The college of tradition has a fixed curriculum composed mainly of dead languages and changeless mathematics . On this skeleton are hung a few brief text-book courses in elementary science . On top of it all is placed a course in the evidences of Christianity , aiming to prove by what is found in the world a God who never can be found outside it , and to confirm the student in the childish views of religion he brought with him from the nursery and the Sunday school . The effect on the students is obvious and inevitable . For a good account of it read in Andrew D. White 's autobiography the story of the idleness and dissipation in the church college he attended before he went to Yale . Of course all the virile , vigorous fellows in such an institution plunge into dissipation . What else that is genuine and interesting is there for them to do ? While the strong and vigorous majority of the boys in such an institution go straight to the bad , there will be a feeble remnant who meekly swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sugar-coating of prizes and scholarships profess to like it . Out of the most feeble in this weak minority the candidates for the ministry are drawn . They have  | never done a bit of original thinking or independent acting in their lives . They are leaners on their teachers ; they never can be leaders of their fellows . The seminary of tradition is tenfold more the child of this same docile unreality . Dead languages again , the deadest of the ( lead , are the spinal column of the seminary course . The student must be taught the exact words in which the miraculous and final revelation was deposited . Church history is the cut and dried narrative of the perfecting of the precise views and ceremonies and institutions of the particular denomination to which , in the Providence of God , the student and the seminary happen to belong . Dogmatics will be injected by authoritative dictation ; lest , if taken by the method of reading , discussion and reflection , some precious particle might be regurgitated , which would be evidence of dangerous heresy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form what he has heard in concentrated technical terms . Add a few points about raising money for foreign missions and home expenses and the proper length of pastoral calls , and the seminary of tradition is ready to present its graduate for ordination . Next : What is the college of truth ? What shows that a college is on the right side of the gulf ? For admission , and for a portion of the early years , it requires that discipline in conformity to fixed forms of truth , which is the foundation of the old and the new education alike . On this basis it opens up a world of natural and human interests . It tests its science in the laboratory . It sifts historic evidence in the library , and discounts prejudice and personal equations . It feeds the imagination on literature , and teaches the difference between fact and fable , poetry and prose , wherever found . It portrays the economic struggle where the weak are crushed , and the strong take unfair advantage . It shows the tragedy of ethics , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of society for the petty gains of selfish and sensual indulgences . It offers the life of intimate fellowship with congenial friends in an atmosphere of freedom . It trains in honorable struggle in athletics and debate . It holds up in lecture room and chapel great men and great motives for admiration and emulation . Some men go thru even such a college and come out untouched . But those who catch its spirit learn to know and love truth and to be free and fearless in its pursuit . They learn admiration for personal greatness and sympathy for human need . They acquire the impulse to share the best they have with those who have it not . The many go into the active business of the world , to become centers of light and good will in quiet , unnoticed ways . Some of the more earnest and thoughtful aspire not merely to live out this spirit of truth and liberty and service themselves , but to carry the conscious principle and spirit of it to their fellows . These are the men who enter the ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call of God comes to them , not thru conventional experience or traditional notions , but thru the vision of God 's great goodness in nature and history on the one side and man 's ( lire need in his economic , moral and spiritual life on the other , and the desire to stand between the two as the medium thru whom God 's abounding grace and goodness shall go forth to meet and redeem man 's suffering and wrong . Fourth : What is the seminary of the truth ? And what is its life and training ? It will teach Greek and Hebrew ? not necessarily , however , to every student ? and in so far as it does it will aim , thru them , to teach the precious record of those typical experiences in which great , original souls went forth to do in their day and their way the same splendid work of righteousness and service which the minister is to help men to do in novel ways under the vastly different conditions of today . Even Christ will be valued , not chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the specific examples he set and the particular precepts he laid down ; least of all for the notions other men have held concerning him and hardened into Christologies ; but the students will study him for the personality that spoke thru his words and shone thru his deeds , that they may learn to think thoughts and do works as perfectly fitted to the complex conditions of our modern life as were his thoughts and deeds to the sim-  | ple conditions of his Judea and Galilee . They will follow him , not as servants of an arbitrary lord , but as friends of a supreme friend , in absolute freedom of thought and originality of service , according to the problems of the hour and the needs of their day and generation . Dogmatics will be the attempt to formulate the appreciation of God 's goodness and man 's need ; and the processes and methods by which the one can be made effective for the help of the other ; and to describe the steps by which man , lost in sensuality and materialism , returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church history will trace the many ways in many lands and ages in which the conquest over evil has been won and the kingdom of love adapted to different races and temperaments , different stages of culture and types of political organization . Homiletics will aim , not at training pulpit orators , but at making men so alive with truth and love that the Gospel will shine thru all they say and do . Side by side with these subjects , the seminary of the truth will study the great masters of secular literature , the conceptions dominant in science and philosophy , and the economic and social needs of men . Not until the student knows the words and deeds , the men and institutions by which God 's goodness has expressed itself in days gone by ; not until he knows these things in their relations to the current problems and urgent needs of the men and women of today ; not until he is prepared to bring these things to bear on each other in thoughts that are original at least in their immediate application ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in institutions and agencies no precise pattern of which was ever revealed in any mount ; not until then will the seminary of the truth offer its graduates as candidates for ordination to the Christian ministry . Thus we have the four institutions : The college of tradition and the seminary of tradition ; the college of the truth and the seminary of the truth . Now let us consider the four possible combinations . First : You may try to send a student from the college of tradition to the seminary of the truth . What is the result ? His contracted lungs can not breathe the freer air . He is confused and confounded . His faith seems to be slipping from him . With the backing of his pastor , or some presbytery or house of bishops , he brings charges of heresy against his seminary professors . The result is unpleasant , but on the whole does little harm . A few students who were never fit to enter the ministry any way are diverted from the profession to its great advantage ; or , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creed or tethered to an ecclesiastical body , a professor or two may be removed . It is hard for the professor ; but the men who are sacrificed in this way are comparatively few and the colleges usually are glad to pick them up . Second : We may , have the college on the side of light and liberty and the seminary bound in darkness and tradition . and then try to send students across the gulf . The difficulty is that few students will go from such a college to such a seminary ; and the few who go will not stay long after they get there . I speak feelingly on this point ; for I came from the reading of Lyell and Darwin ; from the study of history without text-hook or formal lecture , and from three years of reading of Descartes , Locke , Berkeley . Hume and Kant at Harvard , to Union Seminary at a time when a system of theology concocted before modern philosophy was born was crammed down the throats of the students . That is why I remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an alumnus of Union Seminary today . A man who was at Union from Yale at the same time is now the bitterest infidel I know . You can not make him believe Christianity is anything but a gigantic fabric of priestly and professorial lies . I fared little better , so far as philosophical theology was concerned . at the seminary to which I went . I never heard a fundamental question get a serious and square answer from Professor Park in all the time that I was there . Things have changed since then at both institutions ; but the majority of theological seminaries are still so wedded to indefensible traditions that no intelligent graduate of a college of the truth can enter there and long remain . Over their entrance is written in Greek and Latin and Hebrew the superscription : " Let none but the scribe of the letter , the pharisee  | of tradition , the hypocrite who is ready to believe in absence of sufficient evidence ; let none but these presume to enter here . " These two combinations , the college of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college of the truth with the seminary of tradition are practically impossible . The institutions are on opposite sides of the great gulf , and the students who try to cross it fall into the abyss . The last two combinations , the college of tradition with the seminary , of tradition and the college of the truth with the seminary of the truth , are both practicable , tho leading , of course , to diametrically opposite results . The man who has graduated from a college and a seminary , both hound in tradition , knows absolutely nothing cf what the world is thinking about and what people want . Ile moves about in worlds not realized . lie is safe and sound , but useless and juiceless . He can doubtless comfort a few sisters weaker than himself ; and even thru so dry and dead an instrument the grace of God sometimes ; contrives to make itself felt . When the ink in his note - book grows dim , and the memory of his professors ' words fades out , the , minister trained in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines which publishing-houses in this and other cities put up . For less than thirty pieces of silver they will sell him insincerity enough to last him a lifetime , and ruin his moral constitution forever ; and when they have done it they have not , like Judas , the grace to wind up their business and go hang , themselves . Trained in both institutions to lean and not to lead , the graduate remains a leaner , not a leader , to the end ; and the end generally comes a little this side of the age of fifty . It is a mistake to call that age the dead line , however . Ministers who graduate from such institutions are dead the day they graduate ; while a minister who is once really alive can never die to useful and honorable service . There remains the fourth and last combination : the college of the truth with the seminary of the truth . There are in the United States scores of colleges of this type and half a dozen or ore seminaries to match them . Happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both institutions of this type . Keenly sensitive to the standards of intellectual honesty ; warmly alive to the problems and troubles of actual human life ; thoroly acquainted with the natural and economic and ethical laws which underlie the world , as a result of his college course in the seminary , he acids to all that an intimate acquaintance with the Master and the men , the literature and the life , the methods and institutions thru which the simpler spiritual problems in the childhood of the race were solved , and gains the power to apply the spirit and principle of those typical solutions in original and masterful ways to the infinitely more complex problems of strenuous modern life . Such men speak with authority and not as the scribes . Such men are qualified for spiritual leadership . Such men will lift the profession of the ministry from its low estate to the position of deepest usefulness , and therefore of highest honor in society . One question more . The world unquestionably is hungry for just such spiritual leadership . Is the Church vet ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effective leadership ? Or are the men who manage the ecclesiastical machinery , both clerical and lay , hopelessly given over to the idols of unverifiable tradition and irrational authority . Are they still strong enough and perverse enough to keep out of the ministry all men more progressive , more honest , and therefore more effective than themselves ? That is the question the graduate of a college of the truth asks himself before he risks the next three years of his life in a seminary . Not very many clays ago I received a letter from a graduate of my last class . He was one of our most thoughtful and earnest students . He came at once to New York and entered upon social and philanthropic work . Within three months he was promoted to be the head of a social settlement in one of the great cities of the Middle West . From this settlement where he now is comes the following letter . Here is a man right between college and seminary , frankly expressing his desires and his doubts , his hopes and fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard facts of the world of human sin and suffering , tie has felt the forces of materialism so keenly that , like Elijah , he almost doubts whether any form of spirituality is real and worth while . Still , he is drawn with a divine yearning to do for men a spiritual work which he sees that material means alone never can accomplish . The problem confronting me is , Shall I enter the ministry or no ? For some time I have seriously considered such a move , altho I have been unable to reach a satisfactory decision either one way or another . In fact , I have delayed the determination of the point , waiting for something to decide for me . But , like Mahomet , finding that the mountain does not come to me , f must go to it . The reasons why I think of becoming a clergyman are not many . I have a natural love for such work , far greater than for any other . I think I might meet with moderate success . The field is in imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such arguments seem flimsy when placed over against the array that point to some other life work . Wealth is perhaps the means wherewith we can do the greatest good in the world , and if I set about business with the notion of becoming wealthy I can accomplish that end . Moreover , perhaps it is a duty to my father and mother and brothers and sisters to succeed in business . By so doing I should have the means with which to repay the noble sacrifices they have made . " Sometimes , too , I feel that clergymen and altruistic workers are working with a false impression ; that their influence really amounts to nothing ; that the only thing that counts is to do tangible things . Again , the church is so narrow that I am not sure that I should be allowed to do my best , to speak honest truths , to organize for social betterment , to be active in everyday ethics and progress . My own beliefs in matters of theology and doctrine are so radically heretical from the standpoint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . And last , but not least , I would have great difficulty in training myself to present a respectable stage appearance and learning the art of effective speaking . " Here we see a great gulf inside the young man 's mind . To lead his fellow men in the joy and blessedness , the service and sacrifice of the Christian life , is what he longs to do above all else , For the sake of it he is willing to trust that the power to speak will come ; take his chances on making the intangible things of the spirit as real as the tangible forces of sense ; forsake the sure prospect of wealth and the dear ministry in material things to father , mother , brothers and sisters . All this sounds strangely like Jesus 's tests of discipleship . Yet this young man has doubts ; doubts about the traditional creeds and doctrines which he regards as a matter of course ; more serious doubts whether spirituality can be made effective against the vast momentum of materialism ; doubts about the willingness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may say this last doubt is superfluous . Two tramps approaching a house were met by a furiously barking dog . One started to run . The other said , " Do n't you know barking dogs never bite ? " " Yes , " said the other ; " you know it and I know it , but the dog does n't . " You know and I know that there are many churches that want an honest and fearless minister . But the young men do n't know it and the heresy trials do n't help them to find it nut . They believe , rightly or wrongly , that the ecclesiastical machinery is mainly in the hands of the same sort of men that held it in Jesus 's clay ; men who will neither look truth fairly in the face themselves nor stiffer any man who does to enter the official service of the churches they control . The church can have all the strong . broad , forceful , devoted ministers it needs and wants , provided it will permit them to stay on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands them . Does it want such men enough to make personal loyalty and love to Christ , moral integrity and intellectual sincerity , social service and self-sacrifice . the sole tests of its membership and ministry ? If not , the decline in quantity and quality of its ministry will be the first step toward its dissolution in favor of some form of spiritual life more simple , more sincere , more serviceable , more essentially Christian .
