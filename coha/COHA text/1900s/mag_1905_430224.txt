 |p895  HAD we been princesses , the hurrahs of the crowds could not have been louder , nor their friendly greetings more hearty , than they were when my nurses and I landed in Japan . We had crossed a continent and a great ocean to give a little help to a people engaged in a life-and-death struggle , and that people poured out its gratitude in a thousand ways during the whole of our stay in the land . We were told that Japan , high and low , rich and poor , had never before given such a welcome to a foreigner ; but , fortunately for our modesty , we knew that this was not a tribute to ourselves as individuals . To the Japanese we were the personal representatives , not of a  |p896  government , but of a nation , and that nation the greatest , and to them the most friendly , on earth . Besides , we were women , we belonged to another race , to another religion , and yet we had traveled from the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes this was the height of charity and friendship , and their admiration and gratitude knew no bounds . The nine trained nurses in my party had served well and faithfully in the army of the United States ( luring and after our war with Spain . Some were in Cuba and in the Philippine Islands , and one was also with our soldiers in the Chinese Boxer campaign . Now they were to serve in another army , under conditions which will be better understood by a word regarding the true meaning of the " Red Cross . " In Geneva , Switzerland , in 1864 , certain governments signed a treaty binding themselves in time of war to give the privileges of neutrality to wounded soldiers and to those caring for them . This Geneva , or Red Cross , treaty provides for the recognition of the red cross , when officially authorized , as the emblem of neutrality . There is no reference in it to any society or civil organization ; but at the present time most of the governments which have signed it have under their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are virtually auxiliaries to their army medical departments , operating in war only under orders from their governments , which receive no aid except through them . The spirit of such organizations finds a much-appreciated expression in the exchange of Red Cross courtesies between societies of different nations ; and now no war is declared without many offers of personal aid and supplies being made to the combating armies . America and England have no great official societies comparable with those of Japan and certain European countries ; but , notwithstanding this , their people have taken part in such international courtesies . For example , during the Boer War Americans sent the Maine , a hospital-ship with physicians and nurses , to South Africa , and many English and Canadian nurses served in our army in the Spanish War time . Before 1898 the nursing in the United  |p897  States army was done exclusively by enlisted men ; but the need then became so great that before the close of the war with Spain about fifteen hundred women nurses had been appointed for regular military service , and hundreds more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful was the work of the trained nurses that when Secretary Root framed the army reorganization bill , at the close of 1900 , one of its important features was a section making the " Nurse Corps " of women a permanent part of the United States army . The organization being thus completed , I resigned my position as Acting-Assistant Surgeon , United States Army , in charge of the Nurse Corps , but my nurses still continue me as president of their society of Spanish-American War Nurses . Acting in the latter capacity , I addressed a letter to the Japanese minister in Washington , in October , 1903 , offering to his government the services of a party of our nurses for six months , without compensation , in case a war with Russia should be declared . Of course hundreds of similar offers had been made by Americans , but it so happened that this was the only one which the Japanese medical and military authorities decided to accept . Immediately after the war began , a cablegram to the minister asked me to bring a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently having been their previous army training and experience , which , ( luring the time they agreed to serve , could be not only utilized , but also critically observed and compared with the Japanese methods . The small but active and public-spirited society of the Red Cross of Philadelphia most generously cooperated with the Spanish-American War Nurses in this humanitarian effort , and I selected five of the party from Philadelphia . So it was as representatives of both these societies that my nurses and I arrived in Japan in April , 1904 . We little dreamed what was before us that day and many days thereafter . The governor of the province and other officials of Yokohama , with delegations from  |p898  Tokio and many representatives of the press and of patriotic societies , came out to our steamer in decorated launches , and hundreds of people were assembled on the wharf to greet us . Vie passed through the city in beflagged jinrikishas , bowing to the hurrahing crowds , and were entertained at " welcome-meetings " and banquets , until we doubted whether all could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how can our welcome to the capital city of Tokio next day be described ? Representatives of the government and of the House of Peers ; generals of the army ; officers of the Red Cross Society ; the governor and the mayor ; princesses and other distinguished ladies , titled and untitled ; missionaries ; trained nurses ; delegations  |p899  of school children , and finally the common people of the city , all offered their heartfelt greetings . At the time of our arrival in Japan the great battles of the war were yet unfought , and so general was the desire to see and hear us that we were kept in Tokio about four weeks , before being escorted to our main post at Hiroshima in western Japan . This time was filled to the brim with welcome - meetings , receptions , - official calls , visits to hospitals , to public , private , and missionary schools , to city improvements ( some of them surpassing what we have in our own capital ) , to churches and temples . Everywhere I was called on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were under orders from the moment of landing , and our movements were directed by the officers of the Red Cross Society , especially by one who kindly acted as escort and guide on all important occasions . This was our honored friend , Dr. Takaki , surgeon-general of the navy , retired , and member of the House of Peers . While we were in Tokio , the Empress visited the Red Cross Society hospital , in which a room is reserved especially for her use on such occasions . Here we were formally presented , and her Majesty 's words to me , as interpreted by a maid of honor , were these : " Empress is very glad to hear about Mrs. McGee 's kindness of coming to Japan from such far-distant country on purpose to assist in the charity affairs of nursing the Japanese sick and wounded soldiers and also the others who belong to the present war . " ( The last words evidently refer to the Russian prisoners . ) Both the Emperor and the Empress afterward gave repeated evidences of their interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true of other members of the imperial family and of high officials , especially the Minister of War , to whom we owe a great debt of gratitude for numerous kindnesses , both official and personal . Of the enthusiasm and gratitude shown by the people themselves a few typical instances may give some idea . The trip  |p900  from Tokio to Kioto , the ancient capital , took about twenty-four hours , and although the train started at six o'clock of a rainy morning , bearers of some , of the most honored names in the empire were there to bid us farewell . At every station we passed in daylight there was a crowd to greet us , to present addresses of welcome , gifts of flowers , cakes , fruit , and local productions of all kinds , ? and to shout , " Benzai ! " ( " Hurrah : " ) Besides the governors of the provinces through which we passed , and the mayors of the towns , we met delegations from patriotic societies , from Christian churches , from the army and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants were watching for us and ran toward the train , waving flags . There was little sleep for any of us that night . At 1 A.M. , when we stopped at Gifu , some thirty men and women , each bearing a lantern painted with a red cross , showed their respect by silently standing in a row opposite our car , all immovable except one who , when I bowed , approached to present flowers . The day in Kioto was full of most delightful and interesting experiences , after which we continued our journey to Hiroshima under the escort of Baron Wawa , vice-president of the Red Cross Society , and other gentlemen . The garrison city of Himeji , west of Kobe , was reached at three in the morning ; and in spite of the darkness we were aroused by " banzais " from the hundreds of people who crowded the platform . The train stopped long enough for the lieutenant-general and other high officers , the city officials and their wives , soldiers and citizens , to offer us a welcome to Japan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my window in a little speech which my interpreter knew by heart from scores of previous deliveries . A band ? and bands are rare in Japan ? was also there to play for us . Instinctively we turned to one another to ask : " How many generals of our army , busy with war duties ,  |p901  would go in full-dress uniform , in the middle of the night , to thank a party of foreign women for coming to nurse their soldiers ? " Three hours later , the fourth day of our journey was splendidly begun , for I stepped out upon the broad station platform , not only to shake hands with the usual delegations , including several American missionaries , but also to walk before rows of a thousand school children , whose bright , earnest faces made one forget fatigue . The boys and girls of a great orphan-asylum had gathered to sing a song composed in our honor , and they rendered it with genuine enthusiasm . Later that day , at a hamlet which could boast no officials and no societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood a typical country schoolmaster , with his female assistant and their twenty elementary pupils . In very broken English he bashfully told me he had been teaching his pupils about benevolence and charity , and how these virtues were exemplified by our coming so great a distance to aid the people of another land . To impress the lesson more deeply on their memories , he said , he had brought them to see and greet us . An incident like this throws a vivid light on the Japanese mind and ideas of education . One of the most remarkable things in the Japanese character is the combination of that fiery heroism in battle , of which all have read , with the gentleness , courtesy , and simple-minded , almost child-like frankness which was shown to us . Every day of our stay we were more impressed by the marvelous possibilities of this new factor in world-history , and by our own need , as a nation , to understand the Japanese people , to be friends with them , and to learn from them . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have called them and their military organization " perfect , " any more than they themselves do . In fact , I found less vain self-esteem than we may see anywhere in these United States ; and one of their strongest traits is the never-ceasing desire to improve themselves . For a generation they have studied , and they continue to study , the civilization of the outside world , but they are not mere copyists . On the contrary , their greatest strength lies in their ability to judge wisely ; to adopt only what is good , and then to improve on that . But let it not be supposed from the foregoing that we were welcomed only by the men of Japan . On the contrary , the women of this most courteous nation were not behind the men in showing the same feelings , though by somewhat different methods , and for many of them I grew to feel deep affection and esteem . Yet , as every one knows , the growth which contact with the West has produced in Japan has but slightly affected its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without its women is like a man trying to walk vigorously with one foot free while the other is wrapped in confining bandages . That the Japanese are beginning to appreciate this became evident in various ways . The subject was touched on in speeches , and in several of the scores of addresses which were received from all parts of Japan . The president of the Red Cross Society , Count Matsukata , one of the " Elder Statesmen " of Japan , in his formal address at the banquet he gave us , said : " We have every reason to believe that your services will be in a great measure helpful , not only to our society , but also to our countrywomen at large . " One of the finest speeches I ever heard was delivered extemporaneously in English by a Japanese professor of science in a school at Kobe . Addressing us , he concluded thus : Your coming to the help of our country at the time of great need , I am sure , will revolutionize the old idea that has been so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission outside of their home . They will find out what there is in women by your noble example , and waken to their responsibilities . Letters from missionaries tell the same story . One of them wrote of the excellent work being done by a patriotic society of women , founded in consequence of our coming to Japan , and she adds : The women of this country have taken a great step in advance , since this war began , in finding how much they can do , in public and private , which before they never dreamed possible for them . To my surprise and great pleasure , the hand of fellowship was cordially extended us not only by the Christians , but also by the Buddhists of Japan . Their largest sect , the Zen or Soto , after gathering represen-  |p902  tatives of its priesthood from other parts of the country and assembling a large company of believers , gave us a " welcomemeeting " at its Tokio temple , and other sects were equally friendly and broadminded . At the close of the specified six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was planned by the authorities that we were to be taken on a tour of the country ; but the nursing work was then so heavy that we begged permission to remain in Hiroshima until the time came for us to sail from Nagasaki on a United States army transport . Before leaving Japan , however , the scenes attendant on our arrival were repeated on an even larger scale . This story of our reception will have served its purpose if it conveys to Americans the message of Japanese friendship toward them with which I was charged , and if it helps them to understand and appreciate their neighbors across the western sea . AMERICANS generally supposed that the party would be sent to nurse on the battlefield , as though they were volunteer soldiers instead of nurses . In fact , although they did go to Manchuria and served on the hospital-ships running to Dalny and to the Yalu River , their main work was in the largest and most important hospital of the Japanese army ; and this is not in Manchuria , but at Hiroshima , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great military base where the armies are assembled , drilled , and embarked for the field . It has a large and easily defended harbor on the Inland Sea , only a few hours by steamer from the Strait of Shimonoseki . During the war with China , ten years ago , the Mikado resided in Hiroshima and the business of the government was transacted there . In the present war , while Hiroshima is again the principal seat of military activity in Japan , the government is not there . It may be incidentally remarked that this very clever change in the former plan , in consequence of which foreign correspondents recognized nothing between Tokio and " the front , " has been of marked benefit in the maintenance of certain military secrets . The policy of the medical department of the Japanese army makes Hiroshima of even greater importance to its work than it is to that of the line , for wounded soldiers are not operated on in Manchuria . Their first-aid bandages are applied on the field , and then the men are sent to Japan as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or from Antung on the Yalu , is only three or four days ; and after landing the Kiusiu soldiers , the rest are taken to Hiroshima , where the great base hospital is located and the serious surgical work is done . The chief ( consulting ) surgeon here is a famous Japanese , Surgeon-General Sato ; and it was interesting to hear him say that he had served in five wars , including his work under German army surgeons in 1870 , but that he had never been near a battlefield . This policy of the Japanese army is one of the evidences that its surgeons have well studied the lessons of history ; for these have taught the impossibility of obtaining at the front that surgical asepsis which is so essential to good results . When my party arrived at Hiroshima , Surgeon-General Fujita , who was then the chief ( administrative ) surgeon there , said to me , " Except for the smoke and noise of battle , Hiroshima is the front . ' " These words came vividly to my mind one day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Arthur . All had received comparatively light wounds only a few days before , and had been sent directly home on a transport , so they had not received the attentions usual on the hospitalships . After landing at Ujina , the port of Hiroshima , they had been transferred to the hospital in the usual way , on sampans up the river ; and as they walked in the gate they were indeed fresh from the front . But " fresh " is far from describing their appearance . The khaki uniforms were soiled , blood-stained , and torn , ? one man lacking his khaki suit entirely , and having to wear his heavy overcoat instead ; one with an arm bandaged below the remnant of a bloody sleeve ; one wearing his flannel abdominal band like a skirt , in substitution for missing trousers ; many without socks or caps ; and all with bandages proclaiming by their externally soiled appearance their original use on the battle-field . The Hiroshima hospital in October consisted of eight divisions of different sizes , but with a total capacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely crowded . These divisions are lo-  |p903  cated on previously vacant land in different parts of the city outskirts , and in the largest one must walk , in merely passing by the foot of each bed , a distance of six miles . An amazing fact is that the division for contagious diseases , including both typhoid fever and dysentery , is one of the smallest , with only five hundred beds . The wards are one-story wooden structures , on the " pavilion " plan , similar to those our medical department erected in the autumn of 1898 , and are usually planned for sixty or seventy beds each , with increase to one hundred , if necessary . For officers and critical cases certain wards are partitioned into small rooms . Convalescing patients are sent from Hiroshima to the home hospitals of their respective army corps , or to some health resort , at which places many recover so completely as to return shortly to the front . Several train-loads of patients leave Hiroshima daily , so that the wards are scenes of perpetual change . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hospital-ships and in Japan , is done by men . Some are soldiers who have learned only to carry stretchers , while even the most skilled are inferior to the women nurses of the Red Cross Society in the length and completeness of their training . THE Red Cross Society of Japan is probably , all things considered , the finest organization of the kind in the world . It has been growing and improving constantly since its small origin in 1877 , and now has nearly a million members , an excellent relief organization , and large funds . Its methods are radically different from any volunteer aid we have yet seen in America , for its fundamental assumption is that the army knows its own business and is competent to attend to it . Its general attitude , instead of implying , " We know the medical department will break down in the field , and therefore we insist on going to the front and into the camps to supply its defects , " indicates this : " The people of Japan appreciate so highly the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisting in it . " On the contrary , in the Spanish-American War we had a multiplicity of small societies , meaning well , but working blindly and at cross-purposes , accomplishing good at an altogether disproportionate cost of money and labor , and not infrequently in terfering with and handicapping the work of the responsible medical officers . But in the Japanese-Russian War there is a single great , well-prepared organization , the ally and assistant of the medical officers , working only where it is instructed that it will be of use , and accomplishing vast good at a minimum cost . The Japanese Red Cross Society is characteristic of the nation ; for every war , campaign , and great disaster since its foundation has been to its officers a lesson by which they have profited . In the present war they are always on the alert to discover their defects , to learn how to remedy them , and to gain new ideas for improvement . It was as one of many means to attain these ends that some American army nurses were wanted in the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the same reason the writer was appointed by the Minister of War as supervisor of nurses of the Red Cross , with the rank of officer ; sent to many hospitals ; and required to make reports and recommendations to the Red Cross Society . A Japanese lady , by profession a teacher , had formerly held this position , but since her death it had been vacant . Trained nurses in Japan do not attain the executive positions so commonly held by them in our country . They become head nurses and over-head nurses , but generally , if not always , the superintendents of training-schools and the lecturers in these schools are all doctors . Although some of the best schools try to get applicants from the upper classes of society , the required entrance examination covers only reading , simple arithmetic , and writing . The training-school of the Red Cross Hospital in Tokio requires three months of probation , during which twelve hours daily is spent in cleaning and other manual work about the hospital . For the next year and a half alternate days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attending lectures and studying from notes . At the end of this time the pupils receive printed textbooks for reference , and are sent into the wards for eighteen months of practical nursing before graduation . Women nurses are also trained by the Red Cross Society in various cities besides Tokio , but these schools require only one year of study and one of practical nursing in some selected hospital . The Red Cross  |p904  nurses ' training is military throughout , and a large proportion of women take it primarily as an act of patriotism , in somewhat the same spirit that their brothers receive a military training and become reservists . These marry or take up other occupations after finishing their hospital course . All nurses trained by the Red Cross Society must take a binding vow to serve in the army , if physically able , at any time within fifteen years after graduation . By the beginning of autumn , 1904 , the society had supplied for military service all available graduates and pupil nurses as well , a total of 2200 women ( besides 594 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , in October last , decided to accept nurses from three other trainingschools of the best standing , and perfected plans for utilizing the professional nurses of the country by giving a short course in military requirements to those applicants whose general reputation was excellent . They expected thus to obtain 506 additional nurses . One of the'most remarkable things about these Japanese women , whom we are accustomed to consider delicate , even frail , is their extraordinary strength and endurance . When we first heard that nurses were on duty at the Hiroshima hospital for twenty-eight hours continuously , with only such sleep as they could get in the ward anteroom , subject to calls , we exclaimed , " Impossible " But they did it . All through the hot summer those dear little women were in their wards from eight one morning till noon the next day , followed by a third day of eight hours , and beginning on the fourth another long period . Like all Japanese , they drank hot tea at any hour , but they took scarcely fifteen minutes to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying a man on their backs , just as in childhood they had probably carried their little brothers , or perhaps more recently their own children . But if the women of the Japanese army rival the soldiers in their marvelous endurance , with little sleep , and on a habitually slender diet , they are also like them in their cheerful , generous , and uncomplaining disposition . Their unfailing kindness and willingness to serve are charming traits . The Red Cross Society considers the essentials in a nurse to be obedience to discipline and the possession of a fine sentiment of humanity . Nurses with these qualities and , incidentally be it noted , paid only one yen ( fifty cents ) a day , are certainly to be valued highly , even if , as an American surgeon says , " they are not half doctors , as is the case with many from our training-schools . " The work of the Japanese nurses in the operating-room is the same as that of nurses in America . If in the wards the Japanese do not appear to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is largely because they pay far more attention to the wishes of the individual patient . If he is asleep , his temperature-taking is postponed ; if he f eels hungry and wants one of his eggs boiled , or if he needs water after drinking his medicine from its bottle , he calls a nurse to wait on him . It is perfectly evident that such attentions are impossible in a ward where everything must be on schedule time ; but perhaps we Americans , in some cases , carry our ideas of system too far . In the opinion of more than one person , there exist hospitals in our country where a somewhat larger corps of nurses , with a little more time to give individuals attention , would be of material advantage to the patients . The Japanese patients ' ideal of a trained nurse is one as kindly attentive as are his own female relatives . The greatest difference between the work of Japanese hospitals and those of our country is the former 's greater simplicity of equipment and economy of management . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices " that the mere care of them becomes a burden , and in our hospitals there is generally a liberal use of supplies . At Hiroshima the really important things ( including an X-ray and photographing outfit and a chemical and bacteriological laboratory ) are all to be found , but not things which are considered unessential . Bandages from clean wounds are washed , rolled by hand , and used repeatedly , while laundry is kept at a minimum by rules specifying the length of time bedding and kimonos are to be used . All military patients wear as their sole garment an unbleached cotton kimono fastened by tying a strip of the same material around the waist , and this gives an effect of order and cleanliness which is exceedingly attractive . One of the hospital rules is , " Patients shall attend to keeping their kimonos and themselves clean , " and they obey it to the best of their ability . Each  |p905  soldier furnishes his own little towel , which he washes out after using . A sink on the roofed veranda of each ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain hours for the use of patients who are able to bathe themselves . One of the most important duties of the American nurses , both at Hiroshima and on the hospital-ships , was giving bed-baths , for the doctor at the former place promptly ordered a supply of towels when he learned of their ability in that direction . The gratitude of the patients on this account can not be described . The poor helpless paralytics smiled volumes , and men who had forgotten how it felt to be clean expressed their delight and thanks anew with the wa'shing of each portion of their bodies . One patient said that he had taken his last bath in Japan six months before , and that he had not even been able to wash himself for three months . And there were many with dirt so ground into their skins that it took long and repeated applications of soap and hot water to restore them to a normal appearance . More than once a man 's comrades would preside over the interesting process and add their repeated thanks to his . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had some fever objected to being touched , but he never objected a second time . Most of the patients felt it a special honor to receive the attentions of the Americans . One , whose wound had resulted in a partial paralysis of arm and hand , had great faith in the effects of their massage , and , eagerly showing me the improvement from two treatments , he asserted that with two more he would be entirely cured . When the Crown Prince sent his representative to visit the hospital , he encouraged such sentiments by the following message to the men in the wards : " The wounded here must specially endeavor to recover quickly , since they have the great good fortune to be nursed by the ? ladies who have come from so great a distance . " According to a visitor who spent considerable time in our hospital , the amusement some of the men got from the broken Japanese speech and sign-language of their American nurses was a distinct factor in their improvement . One of my nurses assisted in the operating-room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital and on the hospital-ships shared in all the tasks of their Japanese co-workers , except the keeping of records , of which a large number were necessary on account of the frequent changes . It was unusual , not only for nurses , but also for any one at the hospital , to know the manner in which the men received their wounds ; but now and then an unusually interesting story would come to our attention . The general appearance of the great majority of the patients was one of abundant health and strength . One of these robust-looking persons was Private Shimpei of the Imperial Guards . On July 18 he and a comrade were on outpost duty when they were surprised by Russian scouts , and he was shot in the left knee and in the foot . His comrade , while trying to rescue him , was shot in the head and instantly killed . At that time and place bits of disputed ground were being held first by one side and then by the other , so Shimpei was left where he fell , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and night , and at the close of a still longer second day of pain , he saw five men at last approach ; and though they wore the Russian uniform , he called to them for help . Incredible as it seems , each of these five scouts answered his appeal by running a bayonet through his body . Then the tide of battle turned , the Russians vanished , and comrades came and carried him to safety . Two months later , when his photograph was taken at Hiroshima , his knee was stiff , but otherwise he was in excellent condition , with only a collection of harmless scars to tell the story of what he had suffered . One of the interesting features of the hospital work was the presence on certain days of the members of the Ladies ' Volunteer Nursing Association , an auxiliary of the Red Cross Society , with branches in the provinces . The ladies of the Hiroshima branch have an office-room at the main division , from which they send cards to the relatives of each newly arrived patient announcing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or severely wounded . Besides such work as this , members of the society meet the hospital-trains at each stopping-place , make immense quantities of bandages and first-aid dressings , and use their funds to secure comforts of various kinds for their country 's soldiers . During the time our party spent in Tokio , I was invited to give an address  |p906  before a special meeting of the society . In the course of remarks about our army nursing , I showed the little book on emergency diet framed by one of our own army nurses for use in teaching our hospitalcorps men how to prepare dishes for the sick from the army ration and standard hospital supplies . Beyond furnishing plenty of milk and eggs and cooking the rice soft , special diets for the sick seem unknown in Japan , and the greatest interest was taken in the subject by the large audience , which included four imperial princesses and several officers and doctors of the Red Cross . As a result , the little book was borrowed and translated into Japanese . The Ladies ' Volunteer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society work , for it utilizes in an eminently wise and practical way the patriotic zeal of ladies who are not trained nurses , yet are able to give important assistance to the army . Its original purpose was to raise the social and ethical standing of the trained army nurses through the influence of its imperial and aristocratic members .
