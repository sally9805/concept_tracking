ON the main road in Hingham , Massachusetts , a short distance from the station , may be seen two buildings of historic interest ? the Derby academy , built more than a century ago , and the old meeting house , built in 1681 , now the oldest place of worship in use in the country . Standing well above the road that runs in front of them , and kept in place by a high retaining wall , these buildings testify to the bygone time when the road turned aside and encircled the foot of the hill which it has now in part replaced . It was on ground at present occupied by this road that a small colonial cottage was built somewhere between 1660 and 1680 . A persistent tradition asserts that when the carpenters were at work on the oak frame of the old meeting house they kept their tools in this cottage , and the tradition alone warrants the statement that the little building antedates 1681 . This suffices to put the little homestead among the oldest houses in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its age , the little building appeals to us far more strongly because it represents a type of early colonial homestead of which but few examples survive to-day . This is apparent when we recall the picture that usually rises before our imagination when a colonial house is mentioned . In fancy we see , not a homestead , but a mansion . A broad porch runs across the front of it . A stately avenue shaded by ancient trees leads from the  |p517  roadway . The atmosphere of these idealized pictures bespeaks more than colonial comfort . It presents a colonial affluence that was found only in the later days of the colonies , and then in widely separated and favored sections . Great manor houses , it is true , were built along the shores of the James river , in Virginia , and upon the banks of the Hudson . A few survivals still may be seen in the region of Narragansett bay . But familiar as these splendid homes are to us in the stories of the period before the revolution , they were scarcely more numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the country seats of our wealthiest citizens in modern days . And in the seventeenth century , it must be remembered , they hardly existed at all . Both in the seventeenth and in the eighteenth centuries the great majority of our forefathers lived in much simpler  |p518  dwellings . These of necessity conformed to the narrow margin of their means , just as our apartment and tenement houses and suburban cottages conform to our present industrial conditions . And since in the study of colonial history our interest is not awakened by what was exceptional so much as it is by ghat was the usual setting of life , we welcome every opportunity to look beyond the two centuries which divide us from the early clays of the colonies . Snell an opportunity is given us by this little colonial cottage . The little building has thrice been moved . Sawn into two sections , it safely traveled , since it came into the possession of the present owner , over the highroad to a spot somewhat nearer its first location . Here it stands to-day , well back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and surrounded by the high elm trees for which Hingham is noted . Here its massive chimney still appears to the casual observer to be cheerfully out of all proportion to the fire which so small a house could need . And here its tiny windows , and its general air of comfort , tempt the visitor to see for himself the kind of home his fourth great-grandfather built when his fourth great-grandmother decided to set up housekeeping . Passing through the trellis covered doorway , where hospitable seats invite hint to rest while his host is answering the summons of a big brass door knocker , the visitor finds himself in a tiny entry . Directly before him the stairs mount steeply to the second floor . For the moment declining their invitation , he enters to the left , to find himself in a large sitting room . The side toward the chimney is wainscoted to the ceiling . On the walls he sees a few family portraits belonging to the present owner . Back of this sitting room is the old-time . " downstairs bedroom , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entry , the visitor finds himself in a long parlor , where his interest perhaps will center around the fireplace . Here may be seen the colonial wall-cupboard , which for saving space and adding beauty might well be copied into our modern chinmey places . And here too may be found the door leading into the glory hole , which was at once the vegetable cellar , the ice chest , and the safe deposit vault of our ancestors . This was not , as it might at first appear to be , waste space . In order to gain the thickness of brick wall needed for the deep ovens , and for the fireplaces in three rooms , it was necessary to build the massive chimney in a shape not  |p519  unlike a pyramid , very broad at the base and sloping at a sharp angle to the roof , which it must be remembered was only a story and a half from the ground . This left in the middle of the chimney a considerable space , conical in shape , and broad enough at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter it kept the vegetables from freezing ; in the summer it kept the milk and butter cool . And throughout the year the family valuables here were safe from fire . This glory hole is lighted dimly by a bullseye glass , one of the porthole lights from Commodore Farragut 's famous battleship , which , let into the chimney near the roof , gives a faint streak of light high above the visitor 's head . As lie stands in this queer little brick closet , which measures four by six feet , he remembers that it is fireproof , warm in the winter and cool in summer . He remembers , too , what he pays every year for his safe deposit box and for his ice . It may be that the visitor will sigh for the return of the glory hole , and the simple way of living it represented . He will be cheered again , however , when he looks at the fireplace in the dining room and recalls that long ago this room served also for the kitchen . Before him are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and late . Across the throat of the chimney a stout iron bar , fastened securely into the brick , supported the heavier kettles when such work as soap making w s in progress . The crane was filled in the old days , as it is in the picture , with the lighter pots and kettles which served for the boilings . At the back of the fireplace are the two oven doors . These were opened with pokers , and long-handled shovels were used for handling the loaves of bread . The room is only six feet high from floor to ceiling . It measures sixteen feet by eight . When he remembers what these dimensions mean the visitor begins to pity those women of long ago who cooked by this open fireplace in the hot New England summer . His thought turns back gratefully to his own kitchen , with its screened doors and windows , furnished as it is with gas range or oil stove , a room in which his women folk may do their work with comparative comfort . But as a dining room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , ceiled with broad hewn boards , the huge fireplace , the little curtained windows , have a charm not easily forgotten . Leaving the lower floor and climbing the steep stairs , the visitor finds one large and two small bedrooms , a bathroom and storage space . The roof at the back of the house has hem raised  |p520  all the way along by two dormer additions , put on at different times , making more room for modern needs . Between the oak rafters the roof has been plastered , and the rafters themselves have been oiled until they are in color a dull rich brown . The partitions between two of the rooms and the hall have not been carried to the roof . Instead , a grill work has been set above them , which gives a circulation of air between the windows and the skylight . This detail might well be copied in all one-storyand-a-half houses , for it insures much of the comfort of a higher ceiling . The furnishings , inherited , or gathered with greatest care , by the present owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bygone period which the little house bespeaks . Willingly would the visitor linger , but , " The little road says Go , The little house says Stay . " Surely this little house has " no word but stay . " Yet , the little road that leads back to the highway has its message too . Perhaps , as the visitor again takes up his journey , some suggestion from this old colonial home may travel with him to the home where he himself is living . He has furnished it with many things he did not want . He has wanted many furnishings that he might as well have had , if only he had known where to buy them . Gladly would he produce in his own home something of this colonial charm , if lie knew in what qualities it consists . Perhaps the peculiar charm of this cottage may lie in two characteristics , its home feeling and its simplicity . And homelikeness and simplicity may still be had for the seeking by those who have the will and courage to seek it .  |p521  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
