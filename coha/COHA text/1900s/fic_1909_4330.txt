PRINCESS . Yes . JARVIS . Then you 'll understand  --  those shots you heard , that was the end of a feud . I was called home suddenly by the death of my father  --  shot in the back  --  feud  --  man after man  --  two families  --  the Marcums and my own had shot each other down . Then my Dad fell and I was left to fight it out alone . PRINCESS . Could n't you ? JARVIS . Could n't I ? God only knows what I 've been through since . Those two shots you heard  --  that was the finish . This morning when I got back to my hotel , there was a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the family , and proposed that , as we were out of Kentucky , we meet and end the feud amicably . He asked me to meet him at this hotel in his room  --  no matter what hour  --  he would be waiting . He was leaving at six in the morning and wanted it settled . It was a pretty scheme . I knew the man and I saw the trap . I came over here prepared and went directly to his room . It was on this floor . I flung open the door and met Jim Marcum face to face . He was waiting . Without a word he fired . I fired , and he dropped . Now do you understand why the law would not give me justice ? PRINCESS . Did you kill him ? JARVIS . I do n't know  --  I did n't wait .

Yes , I do know , because I too am fighting against fearful odds . JARVIS . There is no man to fight for you ? PRINCESS . No man left who dares . JARVIS . God , if there had only been some woman to fight for in my fight ! PRINCESS . Your mother ? JARVIS . She 's gone , too . PRINCESS . Are you alone ? JARVIS . Alone . PRINCESS . If you 're caught it means your life . JARVIS . Yes . PRINCESS . Suppose I decide to help you ? JARVIS . What do you mean ? PRINCESS . You have no fear of death ? You are not afraid of ghosts ? JARVIS . No , I 'm not afraid of ghosts . PRINCESS . If you escape from here it will be because I helped you  --  we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me is true  --  and if I do it , it will be from a selfish motive entirely  --  it will be because I have work for you . Do you understand ? Work  --  hard work  --  dangerous work . It may mean your life in the end . JARVIS . You are frank , anyway . PRINCESS . It 's a chance  --  and you have nothing to lose . JARVIS . And if I agree ? PRINCESS . You will begin by taking the ancient feudal oath of my country . JARVIS . Oath ? Is n't my word good enough ? PRINCESS . You will pardon me if I insist . JARVIS . Very well  --  I 'll swear the blackest oath you can utter . Let 's hear it . PRINCESS . What 's your name ? JARVIS . Jarvis . PRINCESS . Your full name ? JARVIS . Warren Jarvis . PRINCESS .

DUKE . Who could bring me to America but you ? PRINCESS . How did you find me ? DUKE . It was n't easy . Spain had no attraction for me after you left , and I followed . Is not that true devotion ? ( Two long whistles . PRINCESS gets up confusedly as though she would not listen and goes to window back . ) PRINCESS . ( Up to window C. ) Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on deck  --  I want one last look at America . DUKE . Thank you , cousin , I can do very well without it . PRINCESS . Oh , Carlos , do n't be absurd ! Please . ( Whistle . ) We 'll be gone in ten minutes . ( She goes toward door . CARLOS gets up and opens it for her . Not wanting to , PRINCESS exits , followed by CARLOS , who closes door after him . Trunk lid raised slowly after PRINCESS and DUKE exit . JARVIS ' head appears and looks about . Throws back lid and stands up . Gets cigarette and matches out of pocket , lights and smokes . Expresses satisfaction . Lifts one leg to step out of trunk ; gets stitch in back at movement . ) JARVIS . Oh  --  oh  --  Lord ! ( Carries this business at far as legitimate . With every movement getting out of trunk finds new pain . ) If I only had that last baggage man by the neck ! Oh  --  a  --  oh , Lord ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm all here , most all . ( Feels elbow that is evidently skinned . Shoes are bent up from being doubled up in trunk . Sees them . ) My feet are bent . ( Goes to stoop down to get them  --  gets stitch in back . Drinks . ) Oh  --  oh  --  o ! ( Hobbles over to looking glass , then to telephone R. ) Hello  --  hello  --  give me Mr. Jarvis ' stateroom . Please  --  Jarvis  --  Warren Jarvis . No . I do n't know the number . All right . ( Pause . ) Hello  --  Rusty ? Come on up here quick and bring me an overcoat , cap and scarf . What 's that ? Hold on , I 'll see . ( Pause , then opens door L. and looks at number on outside ; shuts door ; back to telephone ) Stateroom A  --  promenade deck  --  and bring up that big bundle  --  quick , now ! ( Hangs up  --  crosses and looks out window . ) Well , good-bye , America . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Shuts trunk and sits on it . ) If Rusty gets here before that Exalted Cousin returns , I 'll be all right . Hm  --  ouch !  --  I wonder what the game is ? ( Knock at door . ) Go away  --  we 're all very ill . ( JARVIS , uncertain who it is , starts to hide . Door opens very cautiously . Enter RUSTY carrying bundle of trays taken in first act . ) RUSTY . ( Looking over shoulder ) I knows where I 'm goin ' , all right . JARVIS . Come on in , Rusty . RUSTY . ( Crosses to back of trunk ) How did you get on board ? JARVIS . I came in that trunk . RUSTY . You came in that trunk ? JARVIS . Did you see any signs of the police ? RUSTY . No , sir . JARVIS . Are you sure ? RUSTY . Yes , sir . JARVIS . Did you look ? RUSTY . No , sir . ( Handle of door R. rattles . JARVIS to open door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Princess ? PRINCESS . How do you do , Rusty ? ( Exclamation C.R. ) Oh , there you are ! You 're all right , are n't you ? JARVIS . ( Rubbing sore places ) Yes , I 'm all right . PRINCESS . But your hand  --  you must have that attended to at once . JARVIS . That 's all right . I 'll see the ship 's surgeon . PRINCESS . Do , please . JARVIS . ( R. ) You can go now , Rusty . Oh , listen ! What is the number of your stateroom ? RUSTY . Number Seven twenty-nine . JARVIS . Seven twenty-nine . Now get this : Go there , lock yourself in , and do n't talk to anyone . You 're deaf and dumb  --  understand ?  --  deaf and dumb . RUSTY . I got you first . ( Exit upper deck . ) PRINCESS . There is something I must tell you . My cousin , the Duke D'Alva , is on board this boat . JARVIS . ( Whimsically ) He professes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JARVIS . ( Pointing to trunk ) The trunk . It was n't my idea , you know . ( With feeling  --  yet knowledge ) You are afraid of him ? Why ? PRINCESS . Well , he is very powerful  --  and I may be driven into his hands . JARVIS . You mean  --  you might have to marry him ? PRINCESS . ( Looking nervously toward door C. ) Yes , if you fail . JARVIS . ( Breath being taken away ) If I fail  --  Say , hold on a minute ! Things are coming too fast for me . I  --  you  --  how do I  --   --  PRINCESS . ( Interrupting ) He may come back any minute  --  and I do n't dare tell him what happened at the Manhattan Hotel  --  but he will want to know who you are and why you are with me . JARVIS . That 's what I want to know . You forget I am completely in the dark . PRINCESS . ( Looking out of window ) The police ca n't be on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going to window beside her , and then back again ) You ca n't tell until you see who goes ashore with the pilot . They may be working on Rusty as a clue , but it wo n't lead them to anything so long as they do n't connect him with me . We 'll take no chances until we get past the danger line . Now let 's get down to business . What is the matter  --  and what am I to do ? PRINCESS . ( Hesitating ) I hardly know how to begin  --  it seems absurd in this broad daylight to talk of ghosts  --  but the fact is , my castle is haunted . JARVIS . ( Laughing ) Spooks ? Illustration : " THE GHOST BREAKER " See Page 34 PRINCESS . ( Very seriously ) Call it anything you like , but the castle is haunted , just the same . My grandfather was one of the wealthiest nobles in Spain . When he died my father went to take possession of his estate in Segura . He found the town full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted , everyone had fled and all told of something in armor that stalked the halls at night . JARVIS . O-o-o-o-o-o-o-h ! PRINCESS . My father laughed at the silly natives and said he would go into the castle and show them how foolish their fears were . He went , and was never seen again . JARVIS . ( Naturally deeply interested ) What happened to him ? PRINCESS . No one knows . He disappeared  --  vanished utterly , without leaving a single clue  --  and the treasure 's gone . JARVIS . ( More interested at word Treasure ) Treasure  --  what treasure ? PRINCESS . My grandfather is known to have converted all his wealth into Spanish gold . It amounted to about a million dollars in your money . JARVIS . How long ago was that ? PRINCESS . Fifteen years ago . Since then two other men have disappeared  --  just as my father did  --  and now , the Duke tells me that my brother has entered the castle . You see it runs in the blood . Up to a week ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then suddenly the messages ceased . All this week not a word . Now I know  --  my brother has entered the castle , and  --  well , that is the end . JARVIS . Why did you leave Spain ? PRINCESS . A part of the legend was that a plan had been made showing just where the treasure was located  --  but this plan could never be found . Only by accident I learned that this plan had been hidden in the back of a locket and the locket , I discovered , had been sold and was in America . It was to find this locket that I left my brother and came here . JARVIS . Then my work now is to find your brother and solve the mystery ? All right ! We 'll explain to the Duke that you are taking me to Spain for no other purpose than to solve the mystery . In America we 've had trust-breakers and strike-breakers , and now why not Jarvis , the Ghost Breaker ? PRINCESS . Why , yes , why not ? Carlos would believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) And you will tell him you have made me a  --  er  --  what is it ? A vassal ? PRINCESS . ( Almost shyly ) I think not  --  not just yet . JARVIS . By the way , your  --  er  --  just how should a perfectly good vassal address his Princess ? PRINCESS . ( Hesitatingly ) Highness  --  is correct . JARVIS . Highness  --  tell me , your Highness , a vassal does n't amount to much , does he ? I thought he was a piker . PRINCESS . ( Mystified ) A piker  --  a man who carries a pike ? JARVIS . ( Trying to explain ) No , no  --  a piker is a tin horn . PRINCESS . Tin horn ? JARVIS . Well , a sort of pawn in this game of chess  --  along with your kings and queens and castles and things . ( Seriously , yet playfully ) Could a good , hard-working , reliable vassal work his way up to be a Duke or a Lord , or something like that ? PRINCESS . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't you ? I 'm afraid you would n't be content with being anything less than a king . JARVIS . ( Meaningly ) A king  --  a prince  --  or a bandit . PRINCESS . A bandit ? And why a bandit ? JARVIS . A king might command  --  a prince request  --  a bandit seize . PRINCESS . Seize what ? JARVIS . ( Daringly ) That which a mere vassal can only admire . ( Knock at door . Both brought back to earth . ) PRINCESS . There he is now . JARVIS . Hooray ! PRINCESS . What shall I call you ? JARVIS . ( Whispering ) Oh , any old thing  --  Warren , Mr. Warren . ( Pause . PRINCESS crosses to door , hesitates a moment , then opens it . ) PRINCESS . Come in . ( Enter DUKE . Stops at sight of JARVIS . ) DUKE . Oh , I 'm intruding . ( Spoken as though he expected JARVIS to go . ) PRINCESS . Allow me to present Mr. Warren , whom I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My cousin , Duke D'Alva . ( She crosses L. ) JARVIS . ( Cross to DUKE  --  easily ) Glad to know You . ( PRINCESS back R. ) DUKE . ( Patronizingly ) I am honored . Interesting task you have undertaken . May I ask if that is your regular profession ? JARVIS . That is my business , solving mysteries , looking up the family skeleton , hunting out spooks . What we call in America a Ghost Breaker ! DUKE . Ghost Breaker ? A strange calling . I indeed never heard of anything more extraordinary . JARVIS . It is not surprising , your Excellency . We are living in an age of specialists  --  and like every other profession , this calls for its own peculiar training . PRINCESS . ( Interrupting ) I am so glad you are here , cousin  --  you will be able to tell Mr. Warren , so much better than I , all the circumstances . DUKE . I 'll be delighted to throw any light I can on the mystery , but first tell me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother to come to America ? PRINCESS . ( Takes locket from reticule ) This little locket is what brought me to America . DUKE . ( Crosses to her , holding out hand to take it ) May I see it ? PRINCESS . ( Takes out memo . ) No , Carlos , you may see the locket  --  no one must see the memorandum . DUKE . Memorandum ? PRINCESS . Yes . JARVIS . ( Seated on trunk  --  to DUKE ) A wise precaution . DUKE . ( Picking up locket ) Curious old piece of work  --  and you came all the way to America for this ? PRINCESS . Yes . DUKE . You were very fortunate to find it so soon . ( Cross R. ) PRINCESS . I knew where to go to find it  --  and yet I was nearly too late . Think of it , after that dear old locket had lain in an antique shop for ten years , suddenly in one day there came two inquiries for it . ( JARVIS sits looking at CARLOS . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the morning , described it roughly to the old man and got him to hunt for it . He had just found it when I came in . I doubled the distinguished-looking gentleman 's offer and got it . ( Another look at DUKE . ) Who do you suppose wanted that locket , Carlos ? DUKE . ( R. , being cornered and with effort to throw it off lightly ) I see that it has already occurred to you that I am the distinguished-looking gentleman whose offer you doubled . PRINCESS . ( With curiosity ) But how did you learn about the memorandum , Carlos ? ( JARVIS sits on trunk . ) DUKE . I did n't , Cousin . I had not the slightest suspicion that the locket contained the supposed secret . I was merely following my pet hobby , trying to recover some of those precious heirlooms which have been scattered to the four winds . ( Quickly ) You would be surprised , Mr. Warren , to see the collection I have already rescued and which some day may be yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , so much for the treasure . Now let 's hear about the ghost . What 's your opinion of this , your Excellency ? Do you put any stock in ghosts ? DUKE . Yes , Mr. Warren , I am convinced there are such things . JARVIS . You believe that this castle is haunted ? DUKE . I know it . JARVIS . You think this ghost is dangerous to encounter  --  that it is the cause of the deaths and disappearances in the castle ? DUKE . I do . JARVIS . Well , what do you think about that ? Ghosts  --   --  That 's a pretty broad term , your Excellency . Can you tell me just what you believe this ghost is ? DUKE . There are certain occult forces in this world , Mr. Warren , that science can not fathom , and some of them are manifested in that castle now . A priest might call it a demon or a fiend ; a psychologist , perhaps a returning spirit . I ca n't say  --  but I know there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle , and while it haunts those halls , it is madness for any man to expose himself there . JARVIS . Have you ever seen this ghost ? PRINCESS . My brother has . JARVIS . What ? PRINCESS . Twice . JARVIS . Good night ! PRINCESS . So has my father , and the others when they disappeared . No one has seen it three times and lived . JARVIS . ( Interrupting and looking at DUKE ) In just what way do you connect this spook with the treasure ? DUKE . Spook ? I see no connection . What do you mean ? JARVIS . Oh , there is always money where the ghost walks . DUKE . I do n't know what your experience has been , Mr. Warren . You are evidently a brave man  --  but you have yet to encounter a real ghost . JARVIS . Brave ! It takes no bravery to fight a coward . That is what this ghost is  --  it 's a coward like every other ghost . I tell you that men are not half so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face the supernatural  --  and it is beaten to a frazzle before the fight begins . Spooks  --  horse-thieves  --  and peevish wild-cats can all be tamed by the same little charm . PRINCESS . ( Mystified ) Charm ? DUKE . ( Leaning forward ) What is it ? JARVIS . I 'd hate to tell you . It 's part of my system . ( Taking out pistol . ) DUKE . ( Scornfully ) I had been hoping , Mr. Warren , that you had some subtle method of handling this problem , but you evidently propose to meet the forces of the supernatural with firearms . I  --  I may tell you that this specter has been shot at before without the slightest effect . JARVIS . ( Smiling ) Quite likely , your Excellency . I have seen rifle fire that had not the slightest effect on a wild-cat for the very reason that the firing was wilder than the cat . DUKE . ( As though pitying him ) I am sorry for you Mr. Warren . You will find the ghost more real than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure is real , Carlos . Would I have crossed the ocean for this locket unless I knew ? Why , with this paper anybody  --  a total stranger  --  could walk right up to the very stone that hides it  --   --  JARVIS . ( Meaningly ) Pretty dangerous paper to have around . Look out somebody does not get there ahead of you . DUKE . ( Meaningly to JARVIS ) Yes , it is a dangerous paper  --  if it leads anyone into the castle . JARVIS . ( Laughingly ) Well , your Excellency , I 'd go a long way for the fun of unravelling a good mystery with a little spice of danger thrown in . DUKE . You need n't have gone so far , Mr. Warren . You are leaving a very unusual case behind you in New York . The papers are full of it . Have you read them ? ( Picking up newspaper . ) It will interest you too , Cousin . You were at the Manhattan last night , I believe . PRINCESS . Yes ! ( JARVIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper . ) JARVIS . Why , no  --   --  ( Glancing at trunk . ) I was so wrapped up in my baggage I really did n't have a chance . ( Looks at PRINCESS . ) DUKE . " Pistol duel in Manhattan Hotel . Colonel James Marcum , a prominent and wealthy Kentuckian , nearly met his death at five o'clock this morning in a pistol duel in his room at the Manhattan Hotel . " ( Glancing down a little further ) " At a late hour the police had no clue to the identity of his assailant , except the remarkable fact that the person is still hiding somewhere in the hotel . " JARVIS . ( Interrupting ) He 's probably a long way from the hotel by this time . DUKE . ( Looking at paper ) They say that he could n't have gotten out without being seen . JARVIS . That 's the theory of the police or reporters . DUKE . What do you think ? JARVIS . He might have escaped in a thousand ways  --  but that work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gum-shoes . " DUKE . Gum-shoes ? JARVIS . Yes , ordinary detectives . ( Enter NITA . ) NITA . Excuse , Madame  --   --  PRINCESS . No , Nita ! Not just yet . I 'll call you when I want you . JARVIS . We are keeping you from getting settled , I am afraid . ( Cross toward door . ) So , if you will excuse me , I 'll see you at luncheon , perhaps . Hooray ! I am glad to have made your acquaintance , your Excellency . DUKE . Thank you , Mr. Warren , I find you most interesting . I shall be glad to hear more of your remarkable profession . ( WARREN crosses to door and opens it , disclosing two detectives and steward . ) DETECTIVE . Are you Miss M. T. Ar  --  ra  --  gan ? PRINCESS . ( L.C. ) Yes ! DETECTIVE . You was at the Manhattan Hotel last night ? PRINCESS . Yes . DETECTIVE . The lock on your door was broken ? PRINCESS . Yes . DETECTIVE . ( Removes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have orders to clear up one or two little matters with that affair at the hotel last night . DUKE . Orders , orders ! To break in here  --  what headquarters ? DETECTIVE . Police headquarters . DUKE . Do you know whom you are addressing ? DETECTIVE . Say  --  that will be about all from you ! PRINCESS . Yes , Carlos . Please let me attend to this matter . Wo n't you come in , gentlemen ? DETECTIVE . Thanks . ( Realizing they are already in the room ) That 's all , Steward . ( Exit STEWARD ; enter DETECTIVES , closing door . JARVIS slips wounded hand into coat pocket . ) JARVIS . Yes , we were just discussing that mystery , Inspector . DUKE . You are , I take it , one of the  --  er  --  gum-shoes ? ( JARVIS laughs and goes up stage . ) DETECTIVE . ( Glaring angrily for a moment , walks over toward him and shouts in his face ) Gum-shoe ! Say , are you trying to be funny ? DUKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with undue asperity . I presume I have offended you . DETECTIVE . You presume ! That 's a hot one ! Say , who are you , anyhow ? DUKE . I am Carlos Hernando Duke D'Alva . I have other titles , but they would hardly interest you . DETECTIVE . Dook de Alver  --  and then some , eh ? Ai n't that nice ? Well , if you was the Archbishop of Canterbury I 'd run yer in and take yer ' shore if yer give me any more lip ! ( To PRINCESS , sucks his teeth contemptuously and turns his back on DUKE . Produces notebook from pocket and addresses PRINCESS . ) As you was saying when we was interrupted , you was in the hotel when the shooting occurred . Did you hear it ? PRINCESS . Yes , I heard two shots . DETECTIVE . Did you hear anything else ? PRINCESS . Yes , I heard some people running near my door . DETECTIVE . Any one come in ? PRINCESS . Yes , my maid was frightened and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your door get broken ? PRINCESS . It was broken when I came . I explained all that at the hotel . DETECTIVE . Um  --  all right . What about the colored man who came to your room and carried away a large bundle . PRINCESS . That was my servant . I sent for him . They were purchases I made too late to put in my trunk . They are here , unopened ; you may examine them if you wish . DETECTIVE . That 's all right , Miss , but what do you know about this ? ( Produces knife from pocket  --  walks slowly to her , examining it . ) The initial on it is " W. " PRINCESS . Did I leave that ? Thank you . I 'm so glad you found it . DETECTIVE . Then it 's yours ? Who is W ? Your name is Aragon , I believe . PRINCESS . I am Maria Theresa of Aragon . DETECTIVE . But who is W ? PRINCESS . Why , er , it is n't W  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theresa . DETECTIVE . That 's all right , ma'am . Now there 's just one thing more . DUKE . ( Cross and touch DETECTIVE on arm ) You will pardon me , but I wish to inform you that this man 's name is Warren  --   --  DETECTIVE . ( Crossing toward him ) Say ! Who 's conducting this inquiry , you er me ? DUKE . But , my dear man  --   --  DETECTIVE . I am not your dear man . Cut that ! You get out of here . ( Forces him toward door . ) PRINCESS . Yes , do go , Carlos . Leave us to attend to this matter . I am sure we can finish this better without you . DUKE . I merely wished to point out  --   --  DETECTIVE . ( Interrupting and hustling DUKE out ) You hear what the lady says . ( SECOND DETECTIVE cross to DUKE . ) Cut it , or out yer goes , and if ye butt in again I 'll fan yer . Do you hear ? ( SECOND DETECTIVE slaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUKE . ( At door ) Infernal outrage ! I shall report this to the King ! DETECTIVE . To the King , huh ? Did you get that , Tom ? Well , what do you know about that ? ( SECOND DETECTIVE closes door . ) JARVIS . Do n't be disturbed , gentlemen ; he 's quite harmless . You heard him talking about the King  --  he suffers from Regalmania . He has grandiose ideas . DETECTIVE . ( Aside ) What does that mean , Tom ? SECOND DETECTIVE . ( With gesture to head ) Wheels . DETECTIVE . You mean he is crazy ? JARVIS . Yes , he is at times ; but he is not at all dangerous . DETECTIVE . You lookin ' out for him ? JARVIS . Yes , that 's my job . DETECTIVE . Sorry I had to be rough with him like that , Miss , but you saw he was gumming the game . I 'm going back to New York in the pilot boat shortly and there was n't no time to waste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the blood on that knob of your door ? PRINCESS . Blood , on my door  --   --  Why , I  --   --  JARVIS . I think I can explain that , Inspector . DETECTIVE . Go ahead , then . JARVIS . ( Cross C. ) Allow me . PRINCESS . Certainly . JARVIS . The colored man , the one you were talking about , the one who brought the bundle , that bundle there , carelessly broke the blade of that knife and cut his hand . That was it , was n't it ? You see the large blade is snapped off near the handle . DETECTIVE . Where is this colored man now ? PRINCESS . He is in stateroom 729 . DETECTIVE . All right , I will just take a look at him . 729 ? Sorry to bother you . They was the Chief 's orders . Good-bye . ( Exit . ) PRINCESS . But his hand is n't cut . JARVIS . ( Cross to ' phone ) No , not yet  --  but it soon will be . Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hello , hello , Rusty ? Damn it all , answer me , do you hear me ? ( Pause . ) Yes , I know I did , but I am telling you to talk now . Do just what I tell you and do it quick . Take your knife and cut your left hand . What ? No , no , you a  --  damned fool , do n't cut it off , but just enough to make it bleed a little and then tie it up with a handkerchief . Never mind . Do it quick , and remember , do n't answer questions . You 're deaf and dumb again . ( Hangs up receiver and turns to PRINCESS . ) By gee , you 're game ! You certainly buffaloed that Detective . Then your cousin Carlos broke in at the psychological moment to scatter their gum-shoe wits . ( Laugh . ) PRINCESS . They believe he 's crazy . JARVIS . That 's just it . Now they wo n't listen to him . Yes , he 'll be crazy , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRINCESS . Yes , you have your hand dressed . JARVIS . Then I 'll hunt up the ship 's surgeon  --  and be back directly . Gee , you 're game ! ( Cross to door R. DUKE enters at door R. JARVIS turns . ) Crazy ! That 's funny ! ( JARVIS exits , laughing . ) DUKE . ( Showing suppressed emotion , stands R.C. glaring at PRINCESS ) Well ! PRINCESS . Well ! DUKE . Well , I 'm waiting ! PRINCESS . For what , Carlos ? DUKE . For some explanation . Who is this man Warren ? PRINCESS . He is a professional ghost breaker , as he explained . DUKE . How did you find him ? PRINCESS . I met him quite by accident . DUKE . What do you know about him ? PRINCESS . Why , he is as well known in America as you are in Spain . DUKE . Indeed ! ( Cross to center . ) Well , he will be better known when I turn him over to the police . PRINCESS . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you know that which I mean , Maria . ( DETECTIVE sticks head in door . ) DETECTIVE . It 's all right , Madame , but you might have told us that your nigger was a dummy . DUKE . ( To PRINCESS ) One moment , gentlemen , one moment . ( DETECTIVES enter . ) If this person is famous , these gentlemen should know him . Do you know Warren , the Ghost Breaker ? DETECTIVE . The what ? DUKE . The Ghost Breaker ! DETECTIVE . ( Both grinning ) He 's off again , Tom . ( Enter JARVIS . ) DUKE . Now we 'll see . Is this man Warren , the Ghost Breaker ? ( Warren winks at DETECTIVES . ) DETECTIVE . ( To SECOND DETECTIVE ) He 's hip , all right . JARVIS . Agree with anything he says . DUKE . ( Furiously ) Answer my question  --  is this man Warren , the Ghost Breaker ? DETECTIVE . Now , that 's all right , Dook . Sure he 's a Ghost Breaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you know . DUKE . Sacristi , am I , Carlos Hernando D'Alva , to be mocked at by two grinning , bull-necked scullions ? ( Ship 's officer appears in door . ) SHIP 'S OFFICER . Hurry up , there , if you 're going ashore with the pilot ! DETECTIVES . ( As they go through door ) You 're all right , Dook , old boy ! Ghost Breaker ! Ha , ha ! ( They exit . ) DUKE . ( Crossing toward door ) I 'll see the Captain . JARVIS . ( Back against door ) I think not just yet ! CURTAIN ACT III SCENE : The main room of an Old Spanish tavern , Segura , Spain . Singing and mandolins heard from Wine Room . AT RISE , MAXIMO , an old discharged Spanish veteran , and GASPAR , a villager , discovered playing cards at table down C. This continues some time . MAXIMO slaps down cards exultantly , leans back in chair and laughs . GASPAR stares peevishly at cards . DOLORES discovered gazing out of window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.L. , carrying basket , covered by lid or napkin . Seeing DOLORES . Spaniard on steps . Lights full up , amber and white . Blue lights behind in windows , R. and L. VARDOS . Still watching for a signal , Senorita ? DOLORES . ( Turning to VARDOS ) Yes , Vardos . Have you any news ? VARDOS . Nothing . Here 's the basket of food untouched as usual . This is the fifteenth night . DOLORES . Once tonight I thought I saw a light in the tower , Vardos . VARDOS . If you did , Senorita , it was an unblessed flame . DOLORES . You have n't given up hope , have you , Vardos ? VARDOS . I gave up hope when the Prince went into the castle . Tonight I waited till an hour past sundown , and twice I called . Once a wail came back to me . It sounded like a sigh of the damned . When I called the second time , something moved in the turret of the keep , like a man waving ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harsh cry , a black , ugly bird flew from the turret straight toward where the sun had set  --  on my left , mind you , the sinister side , the left , the left ! ( Castanets heard off stage , left . ) DOLORES . Oh , if her Highness were only here . VARDOS . What can she do ? DOLORES . She would go straight to the castle , and will Segura have it said that they let her go alone as they did the Prince ? VARDOS . God forbid it should come to that . ( Gives basket . ) Good night , Senorita . ( Start for door down R. ) DOLORES . Good night  --  ( Crosses C. )  --  Vardos . You will go again tomorrow night ? VARDOS . Yes , Senorita , willingly , until I know it is useless . ( Off stage voice : " Bravo , Senorita ! " ) Good night ! ( Off stage voice : " Bravo , Senorita ! " Laughing and clapping of hands . Exit C. VARDOS . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOLORES lifts napkin and looks into basket ; crosses and exits D.R. Enter door L.C. ROBLEDO ; stands , looks about insolently for a second . ) ROBLEDO . Eh  --  hey , you , Pedro ! ( Receiving no answer , he crosses to table L.C. , bangs crop on table and shouts again . ) Hey , you , Pedro ! What 's the matter here ? Where are you ? ( Enter PEDRO , door R. Seeing ROBLEDO , is immediately scared and anxious to please . ) PEDRO . Oh , Senor Robledo ! ROBLEDO . Wake up ! What 's the matter with you ? PEDRO . One thousand pardons , Senor . What can I do for you ? ROBLEDO . My horse is outside ; he has had a hard ride . Wash him off , and do n't give him any water until he is cool . PEDRO . Yes , Senor , it shall be just as you say . ( Starting . ) ROBLEDO . And leave the saddle on . I may want to use him again . PEDRO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward door C. ROBLEDO halts him . ) ROBLEDO . Where is your daughter ? PEDRO . I will call her , Senor . ( He crosses to door R. , calling . ) Dolores , Dolores ! She will come , Senor . She will come . ( Cross to door L.C. ) ROBLEDO . And , Pedro  --   --  PEDRO . Yes , Senor  --   --  ROBLEDO . If that rat-infested larder of yours is empty , get it filled before the Duke arrives . PEDRO . The Duke coming here , Senor ! When ? ROBLEDO . Tonight ! Do n't stand and stare . Hurry up and see to my horse . PEDRO . Yes , Senor . Yes , Senor . ( Exit door L.C. DOLORES entering R. ) DOLORES . Yes , Father ? ( Sees ROBLEDO . ) Oh , it 's you . ROBLEDO . ( Pause  --  cross toward her ) Well , well ! Ca n't you say you 're glad to see me ? DOLORES . I can , but I wo n't . Where 's my father ? ROBLEDO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . DOLORES . You do ? Well , you wo n't in that tone . ( Start to cross left . ) ROBLEDO . ( Intercepting her C. ) I wo n't hey ?  --  And why not ? You little spit-fire ! DOLORES . What do you want to say to me ? ROBLEDO . You little devil ! ( She starts away ; he grasps her wrist . ) Come here ! ( Throws her quickly and easily around stage L. , still holding her wrist . ) Say , what 's come over you these days ? You are about as fond of me and as sweet tempered as a tigress . What have I done ? DOLORES . It is what you have not done , Don Robledo . For fifteen days your Prince has been in need of you and you have not had the courage to go to him . ( Enter MAXIMO door R. and beckons GASPAR and VILLAGERS up . ) Let go my wrist ! ( Struggling . MAXIMO , GASPAR and VILLAGERS watch end of scene . ) Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait a minute ! You ca n't get away . Do not try . ( She strikes him , frees herself and crosses L. to window . ) You little cat , I 'll trim those claws ! ( VILLAGERS laugh . MAXIMO nudges GASPAR . ) GASPAR . Sh ! sh ! sh ! Look out ! ROBLEDO . ( To them ) Well , what are you laughing at ? MAXIMO . Why , why  --   --  ( Stammering . ) GASPAR . A jest in the wine room , Senor . ROBLEDO . Huh ! Lucky for you ! Get out of my way ! ( Pushes them aside and swaggers through door R. ) DOLORES . Gaspar ! Maximo ! Come here quickly ! MAXIMO . ( Crossing to DOLORES ) What is it ? GASPAR . What is the matter ? ( Crossing to DOLORES . ) DOLORES . A light ! A light in the castle ! GASPAR . I thought I saw it a while ago . MAXIMO . I do n't see it . DOLORES . But I tell you I did see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Father  --  come quickly . PEDRO . ( Entering R. ) What is it ? What are you looking at ? ( Cross C. ) DOLORES . ( L.C. , pointing out window ) A light  --  a light in the castle . I saw it ! PEDRO . ( Going to window ) Nombre de Dios . ( MAXIMO and GASPAR back to L.C. ) DOLORES . ( C. to GASPAR and MAXIMO ) Well , why do n't you do something ? Are you going to stand there like scared sheep , and let a man , your Prince , signal to you in vain ? ROBLEDO . Who 's the little devil tearing to pieces now ? ( C. cross to DOLORES . ) DOLORES . You , Don Robledo , sword-fighter , toreador , fire-eater , hero of a hundred duels  --  you  --  Don Robledo  --  coward ! ( He chucks DOLORES under the chin . She throws his hand off . ) I asked you to go into the castle and rescue your Prince . I ask you now to answer the signal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince has just crawled to that tower window where he can see our lights . Perhaps he has burned something , a scrap of paper , in the hope that some of you gentlemen would notice it and come to his assistance , but he does n't know what cowards you are or he would n't have wasted his matches . Don Robledo  --  coward ! ROBLEDO . Coward , never ! A fair fight in the open and I 'll meet the best man that walks the earth . ( Turns to VILLAGERS . ) Any two or three ! ( To table L. ) DOLORES . I do n't ask you to kill one or two or three of these poor whimpering sheep ! I ask you to dare something . ( DUKE enters C. ) I ask you and these gentlemen  --  ( Point to VILLAGERS )  --  to go to the aid of your Prince  --  and there is n't a man among you who dares ! God , how I could love such a man ! DUKE . ( Down C. , sarcastically to DOLORES ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUKE , removes hat and bows ) Your Excellency ! GASPAR . The Duke D'Alva ! ( VILLAGERS remove hats and bow to DUKE . ) PEDRO . His Excellency ! VILLAGERS . The Duke , His Excellency , etc . DUKE . Charming sentiments you express for your fellow townsmen , whose healthy common-sense prevents them from rushing to a fool 's death . Still , all fools are not dead yet . One of them will be here tonight . And you , Senorita , will doubtless be pleased to look upon him , as he has come all the way from America for the privilege of entering the castle and playing your hero . DOLORES . ( To ROBLEDO ) And did her Highness have to go all the way to America to find him ? DUKE . Yes , he 's from America , where all the fools come from . ( Everybody laughs but DOLORES . To ROBLEDO ) A word with you alone , Senor . ( ROBLEDO looks at GASPAR and MAXIMO . PEDRO , scared , motions VILLAGERS off to R. PEDRO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get your Excellency anything ? DUKE . Do n't mind me . I 'll look out for myself . Her Highness will be here very soon and will doubtless remain here for the night . I drove ahead to prepare you . DOLORES . Yes , your Excellency ! ( Bowing  --  exit door R. ) DUKE . ( Half sits on table L. , watches DOLORES off . To ROBLEDO ) You 've got work before you  --  Robledo . ROBLEDO . ( Center ) I 'm ready , Excellency . DUKE . ( Rising , across to ROBLEDO ) Yes , but this American may be dangerous . ROBLEDO . In what way ? DUKE . Unless he is stopped he will go into that castle tonight  --  and I look upon you to stop him . He is coming here to solve the mystery and to find the Prince . I shall endeavor to stop him , but if I fail , Robledo , it rests with you . ROBLEDO . I can assure your Excellency I will convince the American that his presence in the castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUKE . Any way you please , Robledo  --  means are of no consequence in this world . What I want is results . Only do n't underestimate your man . He will shoot , and I think he will shoot quick . ROBLEDO . Good ! ( Enter PEDRO door R. with tray and bottles and two glasses . Cross and put them on table up C. ) DUKE . ( Taking coin from pocket ) Here , take this and have them drink to my health and that of her Highness ! ( ROBLEDO bows and exits R. ) PEDRO . Is there anything else your Excellency desires ? DUKE . Yes , hot water , soap and towels . ( Looks at hands . ) PEDRO . This way , your Excellency . ( Exit DUKE and PEDRO upstairs and off L. ) ROBLEDO . ( Heard off stage R. ) To his Gracious Excellency , the Duke D'Alva ! VILLAGERS . ( Off stage ) The Duke ! The Duke ! The Duke ! ( Enter DOLORES R. , crossing to window L. ) ROBLEDO . Louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something to yell for ! VILLAGERS . ( Much louder ) The Duke ! The Duke ! Long live the Duke ! The Duke ! etc . ( Lights seen of automobile approaching . ) DOLORES . Her Highness ! ( Calls ) Father ! Father ! PEDRO . ( Entering ) What is it , Dolores ? DOLORES . Quick ! Her Highness is here ! PEDRO . Her Highness ! ( He bustles downstairs . ) Her Highness ! ( Calls off R. ) Her Highness ! ( VILLAGERS enter door R. Enter PRINCESS , NITA and JOSE in motor clothes . PRINCESS comes C. JOSE door L. NITA left center up stage . DOLORES L.C. PEDRO right center , C. VILLAGERS in door R. , bowing low . ) PEDRO . Your Highness does my humble inn great honor  --   --  ( VILLAGERS bow . ) PRINCESS . Thank you . ( She nods to VILLAGERS , extends her hand to DOLORES , who carries it to her lips , curtseying . ) DOLORES . Your gracious Highness , we are ill prepared for this great favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . PRINCESS . My child , any place to remove the dust of travel will do for the present . Jose , I shall want the car later . NITA . ( L.C. ) Your Highness is not thinking of going on to the castle tonight ? PRINCESS . I must have news . NITA . But you 're all worn out . You 're all unstrung . PRINCESS . When Mr. Warren comes , tell him I will be down directly . DOLORES . I will tell the Senor American , your Highness . PRINCESS . Thank you . ( Exit PRINCESS and NITA , PEDRO showing them upstairs . ) ( Enter JARVIS D.C. ; followed by RUSTY , both carrying suitcases . DOLORES bows . RUSTY comes to DOLORES . JARVIS L.C. RUSTY crosses JARVIS to L. DOLORES returns bow . ) DOLORES . Gentlemen  --  a man ! JARVIS . Rusty , we 're discovered ! Did you by any chance address me , Senorita ? DOLORES . I called the attention of these valiant gentlemen of Segura to the only man who dares to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOLORES . All Segura knows by this time . ( Enter ROBLEDO door R. , pushing through VILLAGERS ; DOLORES tries to stop him ; he pushes her aside , swaggering toward JARVIS . ) ROBLEDO . So you 're the brave American , Senor ? JARVIS . I 'm an American . ( Turning to RUSTY on L. ) Here 's another one . ( RUSTY salutes . ) We 're both Americans . ROBLEDO . And you both want to die ? ( RUSTY makes wry face and big eyes . ) JARVIS . ( L.C. ) Well , I 'm not really anxious about it , Senor . ROBLEDO . Better keep out of the castle , then . JARVIS . Oh , you mean that ghost ? Oh , I 'm not afraid of a little thing like that , Senor . ROBLEDO . No ? ( Turns to DOLORES C. ) Well , Senorita , we gentlemen of Segura will drink to your American . ( To JARVIS ) The maddest fool that ever came to Spain ! ( ROBLEDO crosses to DOLORES , chucks her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; motions Villagers off , and exits after them . JARVIS and RUSTY watch them off . ) RUSTY . He 's a nice man . JARVIS . Pile the bags up there , Rusty . ( Put bags on table L. ) RUSTY . Yas , sir . JARVIS . Looks like we were in for a warm reception . RUSTY . Yas , sir , ' t is a trifle warm . ( Crosses below table L. , back to audience . ) DOLORES . Pardon , Senor . Her Highness wishes me to tell you that she will be down directly . JARVIS . Thank you , Senorita , and who , may I ask , was the cheerful individual that flattered me with such a toast ? DOLORES . ( At C. , looking after ROBLEDO  --  crosses to JARVIS ) Don Robledo , Senor . JARVIS . Don Robledo  --  sounds dangerous , but does n't mean much to me . DOLORES . It may mean much before you reach the castle . Let me tell you something . Quick , your hand , Senor ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I 'll pretend to read your palm . Every one of those breaks in your life-line means a moment when you stood face to face with death , and yet , see those little squares of protection around each break ! Senor American , there is one break which you have not yet reached , and the protecting square is not perfect like the others . JARVIS . I reckon that square will take care of itself when the time comes . DOLORES . But the time is now , Senor . JARVIS . So  --  and are the senorita 's eyes so sharp that she can tell the day and the hour ? DOLORES . Not my eyes , Senor American , but my ears . ( DUKE comes downstairs . ) In all my experience I have seen but one hand like yours  --  it speaks of danger , and that hand belongs to Don Robledo . DUKE . ( Still on stairs ) Well , Mr. Warren ! DOLORES . Pardon , Senor ! ( Curtsies to JARVIS and steps back from him . ) JARVIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom . I 'll take good care of that little square . ( DOLORES crosses , bows to DUKE , exits R. , closing door . ) Illustration : " THE GHOST BREAKER " See Page 46 DUKE . ( Coming down ) Well , Mr. Warren , looking into the future ? ( Lays coat on table C. JARVIS L.C. ) JARVIS . Yes , Duke . The immediate future promises to be very interesting . A dark man is to cross my path . DUKE . ( R.C. ) Do you believe in such foolery ? JARVIS . I like to , on this occasion , for I hope it means someone I very much want to meet . DUKE . Mr. Warren , I feel a certain responsibility for Her Highness ' actions , and the prospect of your death tonight is most uncomfortable . JARVIS . You think I wo n't come back ? DUKE . I think if you go to that castle tonight you take your life in your hands . JARVIS . I 've got a pretty good grip . DUKE . Look here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dollar when you bargain . You are not giving away your life for nothing . Now , what was the price ? JARVIS . Oh , not very much . The deal was made on bargain day . My life happened to be a little below par . DUKE . Very well , I will release you from your end of the bargain . JARVIS . Your Excellency , I am overwhelmed , but the price is paid and we 're on the job , are n't we , Rusty ? RUSTY . Yas , sir , we most certainly is ! DUKE . I suppose that means that you will keep faith with Her Highness ? JARVIS . Yes . DUKE . I never saw a man quite so anxious to be killed ; but there it is : Fools rush in where angels fear to tread . JARVIS . I 'd rather be an energetic fool than an angel with cold feet . DUKE . I am sorry for you . JARVIS . ( Crossing to DUKE ) Your Excellency , I decline your offer and your advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I once saw a gambler lay down four aces . Just think of it : four fat aces . He looked the dealer straight in the eye and said : " The play ai n't natural . " Now , you tried to have me arrested on the steamer , you have tried to block me in every move I have made . Now , all of a sudden you express the utmost anxiety as to what 's going to happen to me in the castle . You even offer to buy me off . You advise me to stay out . Shall I take your advice ? No . " The play ai n't natural . " DUKE . You have intruded into a matter which you neither understand nor appreciate . If , as you say , the play seems unnatural , throw the cards and stay out of the game . JARVIS . No , I 'll stay right in the game , but I am going to watch the dealer . Well , come along , Rusty . ( Cross to RUSTY . ) Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up bags . ) RUSTY . I 'd like to find a piece of chicken . JARVIS . Chicken , Rusty ? What put that in your head ? RUSTY . I 's powerful hungry , Marse Warren . JARVIS . What  --  again ? RUSTY . No , sir  --  it 's the same old hunger . JARVIS . Well , Rusty , you are not going to get anything to eat until we finish the job . RUSTY . Good Lord , have I got to wait till you 're dead before I eat ? ( They start with bags to cross to stairway . Enter PRINCESS on stairs . ) DUKE . Well , all Segura will be buzzing with your ghost hunt tonight . The whole town will sit up to hear of the outcome . JARVIS . And where are you going to get the returns , Duke ? DUKE . Unfortunately , I must leave at once . I have an urgent summons to Madrid . JARVIS . Well , that 's too bad . I 'm sorry you 're leaving us . Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DUKE . I am sorry , Mr. Warren , but I must go . JARVIS . Well , I call that a shame . PRINCESS . ( Coming downstairs  --  to PEDRO entering R. ) Pedro , this is Mr. Warren . Attend to his wants . PEDRO . ( Bowing ) Yes , your Highness ! ( PRINCESS crosses L.C. PEDRO goes upstairs . ) This way . ( JARVIS and RUSTY following PEDRO upstairs . ) JARVIS . Your Highness , I 'd like a couple of good horses and two good lanterns . PRINCESS . Pedro . PEDRO . Yes , your Highness . ( PEDRO exits . ) DUKE . Lanterns ? Looking for an honest man , Mr. Warren ? ( C. Lays hat on table C. ) JARVIS . ( Over banister ) Not in this neck of the woods , your Excellency . ( Exit JARVIS and RUSTY . ) PRINCESS . Carlos , what news of my brother have you heard ? DUKE . ( L.C. ) Nothing , Maria . PRINCESS . And yet you are leaving for Madrid . DUKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why must you go so soon ? DUKE . You know my ride is a long one . PRINCESS . But , Carlos , my brother may be dying , dead  --  and yet you have not the time and the courage to help me find him . DUKE . What need of me ? You have your Ghost Breaker . PRINCESS . So , Carlos , that is your excuse ? DUKE . I make no excuse , Maria . I need none . That Yankee adventurer stands between you and me . Send him away , and I will do anything you ask . I 'll put off my journey now to the King . I 'll send one of my men into the castle to find your brother . PRINCESS . Yes , you will send one of your men  --  but you are not brave enough to go there yourself . Yet you ask me to send away this man who of all is willing to sacrifice even his life for me . DUKE . If he stays , I 'll go . PRINCESS . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I choose a man . DUKE . You love him ? PRINCESS . Perhaps . ( R. Turns away . ) DUKE . Well , Maria , you are sending him to his death . ( Enter JARVIS on stairs . ) Success to you , Mr. Ghost Breaker , when you beard the spectre in his den . ( Takes hat and coat from table . ) JARVIS . ( Coming downstairs ) Thank you , your Excellency . ( With mock dignity ) I 'll do my best . ( Changes expression . ) To put salt on the spectre 's tail . DUKE . Good-bye ! ( Exit L.C. ) JARVIS . Good-bye . PRINCESS . ( C. ) Mr. Warren , we must start at once . JARVIS . Courage  --  if your brother is there , I 'll find him . You must be patient and remain here where you are safe , and try to rest . PRINCESS . I can not rest until I know what has happened to him . I shall go mad if I am left alone . JARVIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PRINCESS . Nevertheless , Mr. Warren , I will go to my brother tonight . JARVIS . Now , my dear child ! ( Pause . ) I beg your pardon , but please  --  oh , please let me insist on one condition . PRINCESS . Name it . JARVIS . Let me go ahead and look over the ground . I will signal when it is safe to follow . PRINCESS . How can you signal ? JARVIS . With a light  --  ( Cross to window L. )  --  from one of those towers . You can see it from here . You wo n't have long to wait . It will shine within an hour . PRINCESS . ( L.C. ) But if you  --  if it does not shine ? JARVIS . Well , then I 'll be too busy swapping lead for brimstone with Mr. Spook to stop and hang a lantern . PRINCESS . Oh , but you are brave ! You must have the locket with the memorandum . ( Start to stairs . ) JARVIS . Yes , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . I wo n't be long . ( On stairs . ) JARVIS . Suppose you give me that , and we 'll start at once . PRINCESS . Very well . ( Exit upstairs and off . ) JARVIS . ( Calling ) Rusty ! Oh , Rusty ! RUSTY . ( Off ) Yas , sir ! Yas , sir ! JARVIS . Bring down my hat and coat . We 're starting . RUSTY . Yas , sir . JARVIS . ( L.C. ) I would n't change places with that spook for all the gold  --  ( Enter RUSTY )  --  that she thinks is in that castle . ( RUSTY comes down with hat and coat . ) Oh , do n't hurry like that , Rusty  --  I hate to see you hurry . RUSTY . ( On bottom step ) I smell something cooking  --  smells like a Spanish pork chop . ( Gives hat and coat to Jarvis . ) PRINCESS . ( Calling from upstairs ) Mr. Warren  --  Mr. Warren  --   --  ( Darts up steps ; is met half-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ? PRINCESS . The locket ! JARVIS . The locket gone ? PRINCESS . Yes . JARVIS . And the memorandum ? PRINCESS . Gone , too . JARVIS . Quick , Rusty ! The horses ! RUSTY . Yas , sir . JARVIS . We 've no time to lose . RUSTY . Yas , sir . ( Exits . ) JARVIS . ( Both on stairs ) Your Highness , I 've struck the first trail of the spook that is haunting your castle . PRINCESS . You think  --   --  JARVIS . I think your cousin has not gone to Madrid . Time is everything now . PRINCESS . You know the way ? JARVIS . North road  --  second turn to the right . PRINCESS . Yes , that leads to the postern gate . ( Enter ROBLEDO  --  stands in arch under stairs , revolver drawn . ) JARVIS . I understand . ( Starting . ) PRINCESS . Wait ! This little cross ! Will you wear it for me tonight ? ( Slips chain over JARVIS ' head . ROBLEDO looks up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight ? PRINCESS . You may never see tomorrow . JARVIS . If I do n't see you tomorrow , forgive me for telling you tonight that I love you . ( Raises hand to stop her reply . ) Do n't rebuke me tonight . Wait until tomorrow , if tomorrow ever comes . ( Pause . ) And now your humble vassal goes forth in his lady 's cause  --  and while all Segura waits , ghosts and Ghost Breaker shall stalk those halls . Your Highness , within the hour I will hang your signal from the castle . ( Carries her hands to his lips . ) PRINCESS . God be with you ! ( Exits upstairs . ) JARVIS . ( Watching her off ) Highness .  --  Highness  --   --  ( Starts to go . ROBLEDO cocks revolver .

JARVIS crosses left C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause . JARVIS whistles " Dixie . " Exits door L.C. ) CURTAIN ACT IV SCENE : The Hall of the Knights , in the haunted castle . On walls a few old weapons , thick dust everywhere . Moonlight streams through round window high in wall R. , striking picture . Curtain rises slowly while orchestra plays " I Dreamed I Dwelt in Marble Halls . " Wind moans through grated windows , rats squeal and cross moonlight on floor ; light flickers on tower wall . ( Enter JARVIS from door L. with lantern unlit  --  turns and calls cautiously . ) JARVIS . Come on in , Rusty . ( Enter RUSTY with lighted lantern . ) They 've been in this room . Do you smell that , Rusty ? ( Cross R. ) RUSTY . ( L.C. ) Marse Warren , I 'm so scared I ca n't smell nothin ' . JARVIS . The room 's full of it  --  somebody 's been carrying a smoky lantern . ( Dull thud off left . ) RUSTY . Good God Almighty , what 's that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stands looking around room . ) I want to go home ! ( Put lantern down C. ) JARVIS . ( Looking about ) We 've been in this room before . RUSTY . Is this where that poundin ' came from ? ( Cross C. to Jarvis . ) JARVIS . I reckon that pounding and the smoky lanterns went together . ( RUSTY sees armor on stairs ; backs into JARVIS and sinks to knees ; head on floor . ) Illustration : " THE GHOST BREAKER " See Page 62 RUSTY . O  --   --  oh ! JARVIS . ( Whirls with gun drawn ) What 's the matter ? RUSTY . ( Pointing to armor on stairs ) Look  --  look  --  look at them big black things  --  see ' em standin ' there ? JARVIS . ( Laughing ; putting away gun ) These are the same black things that scared you before  --  do n't you remember ? RUSTY . I 'm so scared I ca n't remember anything ! JARVIS . They 're nothing but suits of armor . Get up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( RUSTY rises . ) The next one of those rear-end collisions and I 'm liable to let some moonlight into you . You 've been treading on my heels ever since we came in here , and when I stop you bump into me . RUSTY . I 'm powerful scared I might lose you ! JARVIS . A fine chance ! ( Looking about . ) Well , Rusty , we 've been through this old castle pretty thoroughly now , from dungeon to tower , and not a sign of the Prince or the Duke or any one else , unless they pound or carry a smoky lantern . It 's a clue , Rusty , it 's a clue . We 'll stick right here till we find out where it leads . I 'll swear the Duke never went to Madrid , but came straight here from the inn . ( JARVIS crosses to fireplace R. RUSTY follows . ) Get away from me . ( Strikes a match and holds in chimney . ) There 's a fine chance for a fire . Good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , bust up the table and start a fire . RUSTY . How can I break it ? Oh , it 's rotten ! JARVIS . You wo n't feel half so scared with a good blaze behind you . ( RUSTY picks up pieces of table . ) I 'll scout around a bit . RUSTY . ( Drops pieces of table ) Do n't you do no scoutin ' outside this room ! JARVIS . Well , come on , Rusty  --  get busy and build that fire . RUSTY . ( Dropping to floor and begins fussing with foot ) Just as soon as I get this here shoe off . JARVIS . ( Looking at him ) What 's the matter with your shoes ? ( Cross L.C. ) RUSTY . ' Tai n't my shoe  --  it 's my foot . You know I was holdin ' them horses and waitin ' and waitin ' for you to come out . Dem guns went off and all dem horses jumped right on me . JARVIS . There were only two horses , Rusty . RUSTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , tie up your shoe and get busy . ( Looking around . ) RUSTY . Yas , sir . ( Rises , picks up pieces of table , crosses to fireplace . ) JARVIS . This room was probably used as a banquet hall . RUSTY . ( Gathering up few pieces of table and taking them to fireplace , puts them on fire ; looks up ) Yeah  --  when we goin ' to eat ? JARVIS . Not till we have finished this job . RUSTY . ( Putting pieces of table on fire  --  still at fireplace , back to audience ) Tuesday  --  Wednesday  --  Thursday  --   --  Ah ca n't wait no longer than Saturday . ( Strikes match and lights fire . Glow from fire . ) JARVIS . ( Runs up steps at back , looking left ) That way leads through those two long rooms to the postern gate . RUSTY . ( Looking up ) That 's where that black thing followed me . ( Crosses to JARVIS L.C. slowly . ) JARVIS . Well , a black thing followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken . RUSTY . Oh , I could n't see where I was steppin ' . JARVIS . ( Looking about ) That goes to the Armory . RUSTY . ( L.C. JARVIS on steps ) Ah seen eyes in there , and a cold , grimy , green , slimy smell in there . Ai n't that where that broad-faced bird flew at me and I fell down them slippery stairs ? JARVIS . ( Laughing ) That broad-faced bird was an owl , Rusty  --  just a common , ordinary owl . You know what an owl is . RUSTY . O  --  ooh  --  ooh ! JARVIS . ( Sees door R.C. ) Where can that door lead to ? That 's it . ( JARVIS goes to the door in R.C. Steps on trap and falls suddenly . ) Wow ! That was a close one . ( Lantern goes out . ) RUSTY . ( Advancing ) Lord , Marse Warren , what is it ? ( Starts up to Jarvis . ) JARVIS . Get back ! Give me that lantern . ( RUSTY hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold me ? ( RUSTY holds out hand and JARVIS cautiously steps on trap door ; it sinks and other end rises . ) God ! I thought so . Water and a long drop ! No wonder people disappear in this castle . Good Lord , what if her brother went down there ? Rusty , whatever happens , keep clear of this . If you step on this you will never see Kentucky again for sure . ( Groan heard off left . ) RUSTY . Did you hear that groan ? ( Wind changes to low moan . ) JARVIS . Groan  --   --  There it is again . It sounded just like a man . RUSTY . Ough ! Ough ! JARVIS . Shut up ! ( Crosses to L.C. ) RUSTY . Marse Warren  --  look out ! JARVIS . Listen ! ( Crosses and stands moment at door . Wind moans . ) I guess it 's the wind . ( He crosses to fireplace . ) This place is getting on my nerves . RUSTY . ( R.C. ) That was n't no wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a sure enough human groan . ( He looks at picture L. ) And Ah want to tell you som'pin ' else . Have you ever been in church or somewhere and all of a sudden a feelin ' come over you that there was eyes a-starin ' at the back of your head ? You just knowed it  --  until you could n't stand it no longer , and just turned around and see who it was ? JARVIS . Why , yes , Rusty , I have had that happen . Why ? RUSTY . That 's just the way I feel now , like there was eyes a-lookin ' at me . ( Turns to picture . ) You see that picture ? Seems like that feller was lookin ' at me  --  like he 'd step right out of the frame . ( He points to armor on steps . ) Or them two battleship boogies  --  just jump right down here . JARVIS . It 's been a good many years since those boys jumped , Rusty . ( Noise off stage of running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.C. , pistol drawn ; stands listening . ) Somebody 's running  --  coming this way  --   --  ( Dull thud at back . ) RUSTY . I want to go home ! JARVIS . What do you know about that ? RUSTY . I do n't want to know nothin ' about it . JARVIS . I thought so . RUSTY . What is it ? JARVIS . The man with a smoky lantern has been up those stairs . RUSTY . You ai n't goin ' up there , is you ? JARVIS . I am not  --  because the Duke or some of his men are probably waiting for me at the top of the stairs with a big long gun , and I 'm no book hero . RUSTY . Suppose it 's the Prince ? JARVIS . Well , suppose it is the Prince . He might blow my head off , because he does n't know what I came here for  --  and if it 's someone else , they 'll blow my head off , because they do know . RUSTY . ( Looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds like somebody was runnin ' round . JARVIS . ( C. ) They 're trying to scare us , Rusty . They 're probably watching every move we make . That 's where that pounding comes from . Why do n't they shoot ? They 're trying to scare us , like they did the poor boobs down in the village . ( RUSTY crosses to fireplace . ) They want to get us out of here . They want to get us out of this room . Rusty , someone was working in the room . Now , where was he working ?
