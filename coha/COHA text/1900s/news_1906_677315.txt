txt Complete Agreement between the President , Speaker Cannon , and the House Committee on Agriculture was reached this afternoon on the Meat Inspection bill , and the committee voted practically unanimously to - report It to the House with a favorable recommendation . It will be taken up either to-morrow or Wednesday and passed . The bill is a compromise , each side yielding on some of the matters in dispute . There were five material points of difference . First  --  The President desired to have restored the provision of the Beveridge tider requiring the dates of inspection to be printed on the labels covering canned goods . The committee opposed this provision and the President gave way . Second-'The President yielded also on the section providing for payment of the expenses of inspection , although the committee made a concession- He desired to halm the oust put on the packers . The 00=anittee insisted on laying it on the Gkreoimrnent The committee bill as at first reported carried a semi-annual apprcprlation of $1,000,000 , in addition to $840,000 appropriated by other sections of the Agricultural Appropriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on under existing law . The bill will make a flat appropriation of $3,000 , - OM and provide that it shall be continuing . The Bureau of Animal Industry says this is an ample sum Third  --  The waiver of the civil service requirement , so that the Secretary of Agriculture could appoint Inspectors as he pleased , which was put in by the committee , was eliminated , the committee yielding to the President . It was inserted in the belief that it would be of assistance to the Secretary in organizing his new force , but inasmuch as the President and the Secretary both objected it was stricken out . May Withdraw Inspection . Fourth  --  The right to withdraw inspection from any plant failing to comply with the rules and regulations of the Secretary with regard to the destruction of diseased or condemned carcasses was inserted specifically in four places . In this the committee acceded to the desire of the President There was no objection on the part of the committee to making such a provision , and it would have been included in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was felt that the right was conferred upon the Secretary by five other sections of the bill ' in even wider form than thus speeined . Fifth  --  The appeal and court review set. - tions both go out , and the insertion of the words " in the judgment of the Secretary of Agriculture " as affecting the passing or rejection of meat Is not insisted on . In this both sides yield , the President giving up " in the judgment of the Secretary " and the committee giving up the court review . All the other minor differences as to the form of expression were settled satisfactorily , the language desired by the President being accepted . So the spectacular fight for a meat inspection bill , which has occupied Washington and the country for a mouth , ends . The bill will be passed as promptly as may be , but whether with or without debate has not yet been determined upon . There are two sides to that question . One element , of which the Speaker is the head , is anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has already been too much delay and too much talk . The votes are ready whenever needed , and the Speaker favors putting the bill through under a special rule that *111 prevent any further discussion , which he believes to be useless . The other element , which ' ncludes some of the influential members of the committee , believes that some debate would be better and would like to have any way three or four hours of talk . These men agree that a great damage has been done to the meat industry by the agitation , and they think that about the best thing that can be done now to help the industry to recover is for everybody to get up in the House and tell the world what a fine bill has been agreed upon . Cannon Gets Into the Fray . This was a liv-ly day for the makers of the bill . Speaker Cannon took a hand himself . He concluded that there had been more than enough time wasted already , and he assumed charge personally of the negotiations with the President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity was the information which reached him that Messrs . Wadsworth and Brooks were undertaking to rewrite the committee bill in order to " Put in the substance of what the President wanted . On the receipt of that information the Speaker is reported to have leaped up with a loud ejaculation and declared that if there were any more delay or fooling with the bill there would n't be ten Republicans from the Middle West in the next Congress . When the conference at the Shoreham Hotel broke up last night it was with a disagreement as to the inclusion of " in the judgment of the Secretary . " Messrs . Adams , McCabe , and Reynolds stood for it , and Mr. Brooks opposed . This morning Mr. Adams went to see the Speaker and was going over the bill with him when Mr. Wadsworth came in , having just returned from Geneseo . A threecornered conference was then held , and after some consideration it was concluded that an agreement with the President was entirely possible . As soon as the House convened the bill which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which immediately held a meeting , at which Mr. Adams explained the objections of the President , going over the bill in detail for that purpose . After much discussion the general sentiment of the committee was expressed that an agreement could be had at once if the President would yield on the inclusion of " in the judgment of the Secretary . " It was decided to make the appropriation $3,000,000 instead of $2,000,000 , and Messrs . Wadsworth and Brooks undertook to put the bill in shape so that it could be printed to-night and be ready for action to-morrow . Conference at White House . Then one of the committee , members suggested that Speaker Cannon be requested to take the new bill to the President . This request went to the Speaker , coupled with the information as to how the new bill was being prepared . His response was immediate . The House had adjourned , because of the death of Representative Lester , and the Speaker was at liberty . He insisted that Mr. Adams should accompany him to the White House , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long to reach an agreement . The Speaker argued that the court review had been inserted by the committee because of the language in the Beveridge rider which provided that " the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture in all matters submitted to him shall be final and conclusive . " It was all right to eliminate the court review proposition , inasmuch as this language went out with it , but to insert " in the judgment of the Secretary " was tantamount to reinserting this provision of the Beveridge rider and con-ferred by indirection the power at first conferred directly . The President replied that he preferred to have th8 words inserted , but inasmuch as there had been such strenuous objection he would he willing to have them emitted . Tie had been told by the Attorney General that the phrase was not essential to the effective working of the bill , therefore he would not insist on its inclusion . As to the other matters , particularly the court review and the dating of the labels , he referred the Speaker and Mr. , A4e.Ms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he agreed to the elimination of both features . That was the end of the negotiations . The Speaker and Mr. Adams at , once hurried back to the Capitol . The Speaker went before the committee and explained what had been done . He urged prompt acceptance of the remodeled bill , and expressed his opinion that it was the best that could be prepared . The committee acted on his advice , and voted to report the new measure to the House at once . The only point of difference remaining in the committee was over the matter of the cost . Three Democrats reserved the right to file a minority statement favoring the levying of part of the ixpense on the packers through tho creat- ' ing of a special fund made up of fees . Messrs . Cromer and Henry , Republicans , who voted against the committee bill at first , voted for it in its revised form . Minor Changes in the Bill . Besides the principal points of difference already cited there are several other respects in which the new bill is changed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the strength of Senator Beveridge 's advice , objected so strenuously in his first letter to Mr. Wadworth , has been strengthened by the addition of the words " by day or night , whether said establishment is in operation or not , " so that there can be no shadow of doubt as to the right of Inspectors to go into any plant at any time . There is also a change in the section regarding the use of preservatives . The part of the committee bill reading " provided , that the provisions hereof in regard to preservatives shall not apply to meat-food products intended for export " is altered to read " provided that , subject to the rules and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture , the provisions hereof shall not apply to meat-food products for export . " This strikes out the word " intended , " to which the President especially objected , and inserts the " subject to the rules and regulations of the Secretary . " The provision for attachment of labels by the packers , which the President criticised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labels shall be attached " under the supervision of an Inspector . " The provision regarding the use of trade names is amended to permit those " which are not false or deceptive . " The words " clean or " unclean " are also inserted everywhere in the bill where the description of meats to be passed or condemned occurs . In the section authorizing the Inspectors to refuse to stamp goods until they have been found to be sound , healthful , wholesome , and fit for human foods the words and to have been prepared under sanitary conditions as herein provided " are added . The general opinion to-night is that the strongest bill that could be prepared has now been obtained by the President , and unless there is delay on the part of the Senate in accepting it it should be a law soon . The only objection that is yet likely to appear is from the packers to the delay until Oct. 1 in putting it into effect . Senator Burkett to-day presented to the Senate a resolution adopted by the Nebraska Stock Grokers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve and strengthen Government inspection of meat and better the sanitary conditions of packing houses so that there will be left no room for criticism .
