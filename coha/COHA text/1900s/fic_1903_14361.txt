The living-room in the Terrills ' country-house . Doors R. and L. A window or windows at the back . Easy chairs R. C. and down L. Other chairs , divans , etc. , ad lib . JOE TERRILL , genial , kindly , tender but capable of determined tenacity of purpose , disposes his generous length and avoirdupois as best he may at the top of a shaky step-ladder , while he suspends a branch of mistletoe from the top of a doorway R. leading to the hall . GLADYS , his wife , stands on the easy-chair near an opposite door , L. which leads to the library , arranging vines over a picture-frame . She is of medium height , slender , graceful , impetuous , with a musical voice and a quick and captivating manner . Their , task is almost finished . One or two unused wreaths lie on a small table ( up C. ) , and the room is more or less in disorder . ) GLADYS What time is it , Joe ? JOE ( looking at his watch ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two minutes . I wonder if it will be on time ? JOE ( his mouth full of tacks ) . Ted 's is due in five . GLADYS Dear old Ted ! I shall be so glad to see him ! He has n't been here in  --  how long is it , Joe ? Three months ? p. 3 JOE Well , it 's even longer than that since we 've seen Dolly . GLADYS I suppose she 's been too busy preparing her trousseau to make visits . She has n't even written to me for weeks . She accepted this invitation by postal ! JOE ( fumbling in his pocket ) . Oh , by Jove ! Here 's a letter that came for you yesterday and I forgot to give it to you . GLADYS Oh , Joe , how could you ! JOE ( contritely , scrambling down from the ladder ) . I 'm sorry , dear . It 's from Dolly , too . GLADYS ( standing in chair ) . From Dolly ? I hope she has n't decided not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily opens it . ) Not dated , of course ! Just like Dolly ! ( Reads . ) " Dear Gladys : Before I come to you , I think I 'd better tell you  --  " Oh , she 's coming , then ! ( She perches on ar arm of the chair , her feet in the seat , and reads rapidly and indistinctly . JOE returns to his task . ) " Save us all embarrassment  --  m-m-m-m  --  you understand  --  m-m-m-m  --  my engagement to Mr. Owen  --  " Joe ! JOE Well , what is it ? ( GLADYS reads on rapidly , ignoring him . ) Gladys ! Gladys ( impatiently , rejoining her ) , what 's the matter ? Ca n't you tell a fellow ? p. 4 GLADYS ( tragically , lowering the letter ) . Joe Terrill , we 're in the most awful scrape ! You must wire Ted not to come . ( She reads the letter again . ) JOE Wire Ted not to come ! Why , my dear girl , he 's almost at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help that . He must n't come ! JOE Why must n't he come ? Is n't Dolly coming ? GLADYS That 's just it ! Dolly is coming ! JOE Well ? GLADYS Listen to this ! ( Reads . ) " Dear Gladys : Before I come to you , I think I 'd better tell you something that will perhaps surprise you . It will save us all embarrassment if you and Joe understand before I arrive that my engagement to Mr. Owen has been broken off . Please do not question me , as I prefer not to talk about it , and I have nothing further to say except that this is final . I will never forgive him ! Never ! Yours , DOLLY . " JOE ( slowly , in consternation ) . By the great horn spoon ! What are we going to do ? Did n't you tell Dolly that we had asked Ted to come , also ? GLADYS Why  --  I do n't remember what I said . No , of course I did n't ! If I had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 JOE ( impatiently ) . Just like a woman ! Ca n't even state plainly a simple invitation to spend Christmas ! GLADYS Well , it has n't been necessary to tell her anything about Ted 's movements lately . She 's known more about his plans than he has himself . JOE I know ; but there 's always danger of a situation like this . A little plain , business caution is never out of place . Now , if you had said  --  GLADYS ( with spirit ) . Oh , well , there 's no great danger , after all , for of course you told Ted that we had invited Dolly . JOE Er  --  no  --  I  --  I wrote rather hastily , you know , and  --  GLADYS ( mischievously ) Yes , but there 's always danger of a situation like this , you know , and if you had used a little plain , business caution  --  ! Now , I make no claim to a knowledge of business methods , but certainly I have a right to expect that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE ( hotly ) . Now , see here , Gladys , it 's all very well for you to sit up there and jeer , but a man has rather too many things on his mind to pay much attention to social  --  p. 6 GLADYS ( teasingly ) . Now , Joe , do n't try to crawl out through that little aperture . You have done it often enough , I admit , to have worn an easy passage , even for your figure , but you must have learned , also , that it leads nowhere . And as both Dolly and Ted will be here within ten minutes we have something more pressing to do than to sit here and revile each other . ( She steps down from the chair and joins him at C. ) The question before the house is , what are we going to do with them ? JOE There 's only one thing to do . Dolly 's the aggressor ; Dolly must go . GLADYS It would be interesting to know how you make that out . JOE Dolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would have been no such situation ; ergo , Dolly is responsible and must bear the consequences . GLADYS But if Dolly broke the engagement , it was because Ted was unendurable . JOE ( strolling past her to straighten a wreath L. ) . Oh , I do n't know . My knowledge of Dolly would lead me to suspect that it might have been because he wore a blue cravat , or because he said he liked terrapin . GLADYS You never were fair to Dolly ! She 's capricious ; I admit that frankly  --  p. 7 JOE ( drily ) . Thanks for the concession ! GLADYS But she 's not unjust , and if she found it necessary to break her engagement to Ted , it was because  --  JOE ( rejoining her ) . Now , see here , Gladys , Ted 's a gentleman , is n't he ? GLADYS ( promptly ) . Yes . JOE And an uncommonly thoughtful and unselfish fellow , is n't he ? GLADYS Y-yes . JOE And head over heels in love with Dolly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Gladys ! GLADYS Oh , yes ( impatiently ) , yes , I suppose so ! JOE And Dolly is  --  well , call it capricious , is n't she ? GLADYS ( reluctantly ) . Yes . ( goes to chair R. C. and sits . ) JOE And inclined to look with impartial favor on the sons of Adam ? GLADYS ( with spirit ) . Dolly is not a flirt ! p. 8 JOE ( mildly ) . Oh , is n't she ? Well  --  I did n't say she was , did I ? GLADYS N-no , not exactly . JOE And it stands to reason that if Dolly and Ted have had a few words and parted , it was not Ted 's fault . GLADYS ( resentfully ) . I never saw anything like the esprit du corps of you men ! You 'll quarrel bitterly among yourselves , but if it comes to a question of simple justice between a man and a woman , you 'll take it for granted that the man is right , without making the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man through thick and thin , right or wrong , to the bitter end , just because he is a man ! JOE ( coolly ) . Thanks . I 'm glad to see that even in the heat of something approaching anger , you can still be just to us , and I regret that I can not remember having found ( with a deprecatory smile ) , in other members of your sex , the quality that you so generously attribute to mine . However , that 's neither here nor there . As you said a few moments ago , we have no time to exchange compliments . We must decide what we are going to do . GLADYS ( rises , listens and looks out a window ) . Too late ! There comes the carriage , and Dolly 's in it ! p. 9 JOE ( looking out another window ) . And there comes Ted from the other station in the trap . GLADYS ( coming down ) . Well , you 'll have to explain to Ted  --  JOE ( remaining where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If there are to be any explanations , you 'll make them  --  to Dolly . GLADYS Joe , I ca n't send Dolly away . She was my maid-of-honor . JOE You seem to have forgotten that Ted was my best man . GLADYS ( almost in tears crosses to chair down L. and sits on the arm ) . If Ted stays , Dolly and I will have our meals served in our rooms . I will not have her subjected to his persecutions ! JOE ( gravely coming down C. ) . You will , of course , do as you think best , but I should feel it a serious affront if my wife refused to receive a guest whom I had invited to our house . ( The door-bel rings . ) GLADYS ( nervously ) . There she is ! Oh , dear , what shall I do ? JOE Once for all , Gladys , Ted stays ! ( He removes stepladder , etc. , takes them off L. and immediately returns . ) Meanwhile , enter from the hall DOLLY WAKELEE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair hair curls softly over a pink-and-white blossom face , and whose merry mouth is surrounded by twinkling dimples , the radiance of which is only faintly dimmed by her somewhat pensive bearing . She is in traveling dress and wears furs. ) p. 10 GLADYS ( running to meet her ) . Oh , you dear thing ! DOLLY Oh , Gladys ! ( They come down C. ) GLADYS ( kissing her ) . I thought your train would never come ! DOLLY The old thing just poked ! It stopped every time there was a board off the fence ! GLADYS ( unfastening DOLLY 'S wraps ) . Such ages since we 've seen you ! DOLLY Perfect ons ! GLADYS I 'm so glad you could come ! You 're such a popular young person , we feared our invitation might be too late . JOE ( in the backgound ) . Are n't you going to give me a chance to say a word to Dolly , Gladys ? GLADYS Oh , of course ! Joe 's been so impatient for your arrival , Dolly ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last hour . DOLLY ( between GLADYS and JOE , shaking hand with JOE ) . Joe 's good to me always . I 'll never be able to tell you ( pensively ) what a relief it is to be down here to-day ! ( The door-bell rings. ) p. 11 GLADYS ( starting nervously and looking at JOE ) . Oh , we 're delighted ! Simply delighted to have you here all to ourselves , you know . ( Behind DOLLY 'S back , she makes frantic signals to JOE , who is wilfully obtuse , to intercept TED . ) Katie took your bag , did n't she ? Let 's go right up to your room , where you can lay aside your wraps . ( Takes DOLLY 'S arm as if to go and moves toward door L. ) JOE Perhaps you 'd better explain to Dolly before she takes off her things  --  GLADYS Oh , we shall have plenty of time for explanations and arrangements . JOE That other train goes in half an hour , you know . GLADYS ( tranfixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I know ; but it 's too cold to go out again . I 'm sure Dolly 's had all the drive that she wants to-day . You 'd better send one of the men ( with significant emphasis ) to the train with that letter . JOE What letter ? GLADYS The one that you expected Dolly and me to mail at the train , dearie ! Come , Dolly ; we 'll go this way  --  through the library . p. 12 TED ( in the hall ) . In the living-room , Katie ? All right ; I know the wav . DOLLY ( pausing , startled ) . Whose voice is that ? GLADYS ( hurriedly ) . That ? Oh , that 's  --  that 's a man who has come to see Joe about  --  about game . He 's been trespassing . He wo n't be here long . Joe will send him away . Come , Dolly , come ! This way ! DOLLY ( uncertainly ) . It sounded like  --  GLADYS Yes , yes , it sounded like  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a very superior sort of a trespasser . Do n't be too tender-hearted , Joe , and make him understand ( meaningly ) that this must not continue . ( Exit GLADYS , pushing DOLLY before her to the library . ) JOE Whew ! ( Enter from the hall TED OWEN , a frank , energetic , vigorous young fellow , whose naturally hearty manner is somewhat subdued by the weight of a heavy heart . ) JOE ( cordially ) . Hello , old man ! TED ( shaking hands ) . Hello , Joe ! p. 13 JOE I 'm mighty glad you 've come , old chap ! We were afraid you might have some other engagement . It would have broken Gladys all up , you know . Actually , she 's been trying to hurry the clock for three hours ! TED ( nervously walking about ) . Thanks . Gladys is always good to me . You and she are the right sort . I  --  er  --  has she heard  --  that is  --  is she well ? JOE Fine as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er  --  have you had any  --  that is  --  many guests lately ? JOE No , and we were saying just before you arrived that it was months since you 'd been here . TED Yes . Er  --  Joe , old man , have you  --  have you anything to smoke ? JOE I beg your pardon , Ted ! Here ( offers cigarette-case ) , or do you prefer a cigar ? TED Oh , thanks ! ( Takes cigarette and absently thrusts it into his vest-pocket , to JOE 'S manifest amazement . ) I wonder  --  has Gladys heard from  --  that is  --  have you heard the latest news from Venezuela ? JOE Still looks pretty squally , does n't it ? p. 14 TED Yes , and the worst of it is , she wo n't accept any explanation . JOE Eh ? TED ( groaning ) . Oh , by Jove , I hoped she 'd told you about it ! JOE Who ? TED Dolly . JOE ( a sudden light of comprehension in his face ) . Oh ! She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old man ! ( They shake hnds solemnly . ) TED Does Gladys know ? JOE Gladys knows . Oh , yes , Gladys knows ! TED ( sighing ) . Oh , that 's all right , then ! I dreaded to tell her , for she and  --  and Dolly are such friends ; I feared  --  JOE ( with exaggerated cordiality ) . Surely you did n't think that Gladys would blame you ? You ? Oh , come , now , Ted ! Gladys blame you ? TED Then she does n't think  --  ? JOE Oh , no , she  --  that is  --  she  --  oh , here she comes ! ( Sighs deeply and wipes his brow . ) ( Enter GLADYS from the dining-room. ) p. 15 GLADYS Oh , here 's Ted ! How do you do ? ( She looks inquiringly at JOE , who vigorously shakes his head , behind TED 'S back . ) TED ( between GLADYS and JOE ) . How do , Gladys ? It 's very good of you to ask me down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I appreciate it . GLADYS Then Joe has n't told you  --  JOE ( hastily ) . No , I have n't had time to tell him . The fact is , Ted , Gladys and I  --  er  --  Gladys and I  --  ( suddenly ) want you to spend every Christmas with us ! We consider you quite one of the family , you know , and we simply wo n't take no for an answer ! Every Christmas , old man ! TED Now , that 's mighty good of you , Gladys ! That 's what I call friendship ! ( GLADYS perfunctorily smiles at him , but her glance at JOE is thorny . ) JOE Then you 'll do it ? TED You may count on me every time ! JOE Good ! GLADYS But this year , Ted  --  JOE ( hastily ) . Yes , this year we should have been heart-broken  --  simply heart-broken , if you could n't have come ! By the way , you have n't seen our new team , have you ? Do n't you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them ? p. 16 TED Delighted . JOE Come on , then ; Gladys will excuse us . ( He hurries TED into the hall , and pauses at the door , speaking cautiously to GLADYS . ) Have you told her ? GLADYS ( spiritedly ) . Indeed , I 've not ! If you do n't tell him soon , he 'll miss his train . JOE I intend that he shall miss it ! ( Exit Joe . ) ( GLADYS makes a little gesture of weariness and despair . ) ( Enter DOLLY from dining-room . ) DOLLY Where 's Joe ? I thought I heard his voice . GLADYS He 's gone out to the stable to see the new team . DOLLY ( with enthusiasm ) . Oh , let 's go , too ! I simply adore horses ! GLADYS We 'll go later  --  to-morrow , I mean . It 's too cold now . DOLLY ( strolling about ) . Do you mind cold ? I do n't . GLADYS ( shivering ostentatiously ) . Oh , yes , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She approaches the window , and pauses , looking out , speaks in startled tone . ) Gladys , who 's that with Joe ? p. 17 GLADYS With Joe ! Oh , it 's just the man I told you about ; the horse man . ( She hurriedly draws DOLLY away from the window . ) Come and sit down . DOLLY ( trying to look out ) . The horse man ? What horse man ? You did n't say anything about a horse man . GLADYS Why , yes , I did ! The man who came to see Joe , you know . DOLLY You did n't say a word about a horse man . If you had , I should have stayed . I adore horses . You said a trespasser . GLADYS Did I ? Oh , yes , of course ! Well , he is a trespasser . He 's a horse man , and he 's been letting his horses get into our field , and that ( triumphantly ) is trespass , you know ! ( She engineers Dolly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . ) DOLLY Oh ! Well , what had that to do with game ? GLADYS Game ? DOLLY Yes , you said something about game . GLADYS Oh , no ! No , I did n't , Dolly . DOLLY ( positively ) . You said that man had come to see Joe about game . p. 18 GLADYS ( disconcerted for an instant ) . Oh , I  --  I  --  why , no , I did n't , Dolly ; I said claim ! Joe 's claim  --  for damages , you know . C , l , a , i , m , claim ! DOLLY ( eyeing her incredulously ) . Oh , did you ? ( Turns toward window . ) GLADYS ( detaining her ) . Of course I did ! What a dear little ring , Dolly ! Where did you get it ? DOLLY Why , do n't you remember ? He  --  that is  --  Ted gave it to me , long before we were  --  at least , a long time ago . GLADYS Why , Dolly ! Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Certainly I did ! But this little ring ( pensively ) was  --  different ! It was the first thing he ever gave me , and I promised him ( tremulously ) that no matter what came , I would always wear it , so  --  so I had to keep my promise , you know . GLADYS Then this is just a tiff ? DOLLY Not at all ! This is the end of everything ! ( Tragically . ) Everything ! Why , Gladys , what do you suppose he did ? p. 19 GLADYS What did he do ? DOLLY Well , you know that horrid little fox terrier he 's so fond of ? GLADYS Blitzen ; yes . DOLLY I heard him say , one day , that nothing but death should ever separate him from that dog , so  --  just for fun  --  I pretended to take a dislike to the beast , and asked him to give it away , and he refused  --  point-blank ! GLADYS Of course he did ! DOLLY Well , I do n't see any " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , but after that , I thought I 'd find out , once for all , which he cared most for , the dog or me , and  --  well , I found out ! And it was n't me ! GLADYS ( rising and looking sternly at her ) . Dolly Wakelee ! You quarrelled with Ted and broke your engagement just because he would n't yield to a silly , selfish whim like that ? DOLLY ( with dignity ) . I broke my engagement because I have no intention of marrying a man who would hold me second to his dog ! If it had been his horse , I might have endured it  --  but his dog ! ( Under GLADYS 'S disapproving glance she grows resentful . ) You do n't mean to say that you would have submitted to such treatment ! p. 20 GLADYS ( going to chair down L. where she sits ) . When you 've had a little more experience , Dolly , and know men better , you 'll learn to appreciate  --  DOLLY ( pettishly ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gladys ! You 're only two years my senior . And you know perfectly well ( tearfully ) that it was brutal of Ted ! Simply brutal ! JOE will understand . ( She weaps disconsolately . ) GLADYS Joe will do nothing of the sort ! He 'll tell you , as I do , that you 're a very silly girl to let a thing like that separate you from a man like Ted Owen , and advise you to apologise at once , before it is too late . DOLLY I apologise ? To Ted ? Not for anything in the world ! Not if he begged me on his bended knees . GLADYS ( shortly ) . Well , he wo n't ! Ted 's not that sort . ( JOE and TED are heard talking outside . ) Here come the men . Let 's go upstairs . ( Rises and goes toward door L. ) DOLLY ( mutinously ) . No , let 's do n't ! I 've hardly seen Joe at all . GLADYS ( regarding her with critical deliberation ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see him in that plight . Your hair is mussed , and your eyes are swollen , and your nose is  --  p. 21 DOLLY ( furiously , jumping up ) . Gladys , you 're simply horrid to-day ! ( Exit hurriedly to library , followed by GLADYS . ) ( Enter JOE and TED from hall , disputing . ) TED But I tell you it was simply a whim , and I would n't cast off a good dog for any woman 's caprice . JOE If you 're going to be as stiff-necked as all that , you 'd better get you to a monastery , where you wo n't have women to deal with ! All charming women have whims  --  if they had n't , they would n't be so charming  --  and any man ought to be glad to gratify them  --  when they 're not too unreasonable . TED But this was too unreasonable ! JOE Pooh ! Nonsense ! I do n't blame her in the least . Naturally , she wanted to think she was first in your affections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flying off the handle in that hot-headed fashion . TED I suppose I should have sent poor old Blitzen to the pound , too ? JOE Oh , stuff ! She did n't want you to send him to the pound ! She merely wanted to be sure that you would send him there , if she should ask it . Now , you go and apologise at once , before it 's too late . p. 22 TED I ? Apologise ? Not much ! JOE Now , do n't be a donkey , Ted ! TED ( stiffly ) . I do apologise to you , however . I have evidently made a grave mistake . I came down here under the impression that I was coming to friends who would understand my position and sympathise with my point of view . I still hope that Gladys  --  JOE Gladys will tell you , as I do , that you 're making a blooming idiot of yourself , and that you 'd better make your peace while you can . TED Since you entirely fail to grasp the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed your advice ! ( Exit stiffly to hall . ) ( Enter GLADYS from library . ) GLADYS Well , of all the silly performances ! JOE What 's the matter now ? GLADYS ( sits down L ) . Dolly has just told me the story of the quarrel . JOE ( sits R. C. ) . Sheer idiocy , is n't it ? GLADYS You know ? JOE Yes , Ted told me . GLADYS So foolish ! p. 23 JOE Absolutely senseless ! GLADYS And selfish ! JOE That 's what I told him . GLADYS I would n't have believed it possible . JOE I hope you told her what you thought of it . GLADYS I did that ! JOE Ted 's in a towering rage with me . GLADYS Ted in a rage ? What about ? JOE Because I told him plainly that he was an ass , and advised him to go and make his peace on any terms , as soon as she 'd let him GLADYS ( sitting very erect ) . Advised him to  --  Joe Terrill ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who would n't ? GLADYS ( rising and walking about nervously ) Well , I would n't ! JOE You do n't mean to say that you think there 's any sense in his attitude ! GLADYS I think he was entirely right . Why should he sacrifice his dear old dog just to satisfy a silly , vain little impulse of hers ? JOE On the contrary , if he ca n't yield gracefully to a trifling little request like that , he 'd better not hope to make her happy . p. 24 GLADYS But it 's so senseless ! If she had any earthly reason for it  --  JOE She had her own reason , probably ; and if a man 's going to stop to find a reason that appeals to him for everything a woman asks of him , he 'd better remain a bachelor ! Dolly has her caprices , of course , but she 's very sweet about them . GLADYS Oh , you men ! A pretty , insipid face , with a dimple or two in it , will make putty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who could be true to a friend , no matter how many pink cheeks beguiled ! JOE ( teasingly ) . When you find him , he 'll be the husband of a consistent woman . GLADYS Oh , of course ! You change your mind ; I 'm inconsistent ! But I want to know what we 're going to do with them . Here they are , both under our roof , and the last train 's gone . You may humor Dolly if you like , but I refuse to be a party to any of her nonsense , and I shall see that Ted 's not slighted , at any rate . JOE ( rises and goes to her , up L. C. ) . My dear girl , Ted 's a man and can take care of himself . He has the stable and the grounds and the billiard-room at his disposal , and a little time for uninterrupted reflection will be salutary in his present frame of mind ; but Dolly , poor little girl , is in trouble and needs your sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from him ) . Well , she has n't aroused it to any appreciable extent , as yet ! JOE ( up L. C. persuasively ) . Gladys , you must n't neglect Dolly . It would n't be decent . She 's your guest . GLADYS ( down R. obstinately ) . So is Ted . ( Enter DOLLY , stormily , from the hall , carrying a man 's hat . ) DOLLY ( at C. tragically ) . Whose hat is this ? JOE ( coming down ) . That ? Oh , that  --  that 's mine , you know . DOLLY ( sarcastically ) . And those are your initials , are they ? T. J. O. stands for Joseph Corbin Terrill , I suppose ? JOE Oh , T. J.  --  oh , yes , that 's  --  that 's Ted 's hat , you know . DOLLY And he is here ? JOE ( looking imploringly at GLADYS , who is stonily silent ) .

No , no , Dolly ! Really , we did n't know  --  DOLLY ( wrathfully ) . Oh , no , of course you did n't know ! I had n't written to Gladys , explaining it all ! JOE But you see , I  --  DOLLY Oh , this is unendurable ! Unfortunately , the last train has gone , but I will remain in my room until there is an opportunity to get away , and I shall be grateful for the privilege of remaining there  --  alone ! ( Exit to library . ) GLADYS There ! You see how sweet and reasonable she is ! ( Enter TED from hall , carrying a lady 's handkerchief . ) TED ( sternly ) . Whose handkerchief is this ?

She may have left it here . TED I found it in the hall just now , and I caught a glimpse of flying petticoats at the same time . Is she here ? In this house ? GLADYS ( laughing nervously ) . Why  --  what a singular notion , Ted ! ( She looks pleadingly at JOE , who regards her with a sardonic smile . ) TED Do me the honor to tell me the truth , if you please . Is she here ? GLADYS ( weakly ) . Y-yes , but  --  TED ( angrily to JOE ) . And this is the reason for your sudden invitation to spend Christmas with you , is it ? You thought you 'd get me down here where your roof would prove an obligation , and where the lack of transportation facilities would prevent flight , and force me to adopt the course you had laid out for me ! JOE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  TED A very pretty scheme , but you forgot one little detail . " One man may lead a pony to the brink , but twenty thousand can not make him drink !

( Sits down L. ) GLADYS Well , it 's all your fault , anyway ! If you had given me that letter when it arrived , we might have been spared all this ! JOE If you 'd take a firm stand with Ted , it would all smooth out now . GLADYS You try taking a firm stand with Dolly . JOE ( placidly ) . Do n't want to . Dolly 's all right . GLADYS ( at C. ) . Oh , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimples  --  so it 's not of the least consequence that she has neither right nor reason on her side ! That 's what it is to belong to the logical sex !

One would think , to hear you , that you were more than half in love with Dolly yourself ! It 's to be regretted that you did n't marry a woman of that type ! JOE ( in exasperation ) . I did ! p. 29 GLADYS ( incredulously ) . What ? JOE ( doggedly ) . I did . GLADYS Joseph Terrill ! I have forgiven you many things , but this is the last straw ! I will never forgive you ! Never !
