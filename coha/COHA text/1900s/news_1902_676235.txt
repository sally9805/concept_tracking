txt Ex-Judge A. J. Dittenhoefer , counsel for David Belasco , obtained from Justice Fitzgerald yesterday an order for the at rest of Mrs. Bertrand Babcock ( Onoto Watanna ) in connection with a libel suit for . $20,000 damages . She is accused of having charged Mr. Belasco , through various newspaper publications on Monday morning last , with having deliberately appropriated ideas , characters , and incidents from her two stories , " A Japanese Nightingale " and " The Wooing of ' Wistaria , " In connection with " The Darling of the Gods , " David Belasco 's new Japanese drama , written in conjunction with John Luther Long , in which Blanche Bates and company will appear for the first time in New York at the Belasco Theatre to-night . The defendant announced a few days ago that she intended to apply for an injunction restraining Mr. Belasco and Mr. Long from producing their play , called " The Darling of the Gods . " She sold the dramatic rights of " The Japanese ' Nightingale " to Klaw &; Erlanger . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was in possession of the dramatized version of the book , she having submitted the manuscript to him with a view of selling him the rights . After he had kept the manuscript for months , she said . he returned it to her , but she discovered . so she claimed that he had made use of it for the piece he wrote later . In a communication sent out last night Mr. Belasco said : My purpose in causing the arrest of Mrs. Babcock tOnoto Watana ) is to stop once and for all the groundless persecution to which I am subjected whenever I dare to //resent a new play . That my productions are thorns in the sides a several managers I am perfectly aware , hut through Mrs. Babcock , who will now have to give an account of her claims against me in court , I hope to reach the real instigators of this attack against my integrity as a manager and a man . I have never met Mrs. Babcock in my life , nor have I read either of her books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I they have purchased the dramatic rights . ' The first I ever heard of Mrs. ' Babcock was about two months ago , at which Lime my Mal ' I had neither been put In rehearsal nor  --  read to any , one who could peasibly have told her of Its plot , characters , or incidents . At that time she informed a prominent morning newspaper writer that the firm of KlaW &; Erlanger was very anxious to have her bring a suit against me for plagiarism . I laughed at the whole matter , for , knowing that " The Darling of the Gods ? was entirely original with Mr. John Luther Long and myself . I could not conceive of any person being foolish enough to make such it charge . But it was the last shot in my enemies ' locker . Front the day I started work on this production I have been harassed in every direction . I ant almost as anxious to get this case into court and settled once for all as I am to hare the " Du Barry " controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen to pursue my business ventures unmolested . The whole affair from start to finish is a conspiracy to throw a nasty slur on my name as a playwright and manager on the eve of a new production , in which I have invested a great deal Of money , and with the courts to help me I intend to unmask a few of the real culprits . Furthermore , I find now that Mrs. Babcock 's story , " The Wooing of Wistaria , " was not published until last ' Septemb .. r . Our play was finished early in June . By causing the arrest of this woman I hope , in addition to justifying myself , to establish a precedent whereby other playwrights. when they happen to be successful , may be able to take drastic means to protect themselves against similar persecutions . Marc K./aw said in regard to Mr. Belasco 's statement : " T don ' t quite understand why he draws Klaw 45 : : Erlanger into this matter . He is in trouble with Mrs. Babcock about ' The Wooing of Wistaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she came to us with ' A Japanese Nightingale . ' She does not claim that he stole , the story of this at all , and therefore we are not concerned . However , since we are drawn in , we will defend ourselves . " I am willing to place $1,000 as a wager that Belasco never carries this matter to a final issue . As regards his suing of Mrs. Babcock , I think she is well prepared to give him all he wants . "
