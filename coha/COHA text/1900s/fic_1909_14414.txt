SCENE .  --  A large Room in the " Golden Goose , " on the ground floor ; window in back , through which the distant country is seen ; doors , R. 1 E. , L. 1 E. , and L. 3 E. ; fireplace , L. 2 E. ; table , Chairs , &amp;c . Enter BARBEAU and CANNELLE , door , L. 1 E. BARBEAU This is indeed extraordinary , Monsieur the Mayor  --  ex-mayor , I mean ! What , our old landlord , the Marquis of Courville is dead at last ? MONSIEUR a--a Very dead indeed , neighbour ; and he has done our village cemetery the honour of being buried there . BARBEAU Dear me ! that will not do us much good . So he is dead ? I really thought he intended to live to the age of Methusalem , poor old fellow ! MONSIEUR a--a Old fellow ! Is that the mode , Barbeau , in which you name departed nobility ? in which you speak of the lamented deceased , Alexander Julius Csar Antony Augustus de Courville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It is too much for my philosophy ! BARBEAU I meant no offence , Monsieur Cannelle ; I was merely about to observe  --  MONSIEUR a--a Observe it then with more deference to departed dignity ! Well , you were going to observe ? p. 3 BARBEAU That as the old  --  I mean the venerable Marquis  --  never was married , he can not have left any heirs . Now , who think you , will succeed to the property ? MONSIEUR CANNELLE Friend Barbeau , in this province , it does not become individuals to be curious . Suffice it to be known , there is a successor  --  a cousin . BARBEAU Morbleu ! There 's a successor ! Perhaps  --  MONSIEUR a--a Not a bit of it . It is no perhaps ; it is , I may say , a decided fact  --  a certainty . So this successor , when he appears , will be received with due honours , by a loyal and devoted tenantry . BARBEAU And when is the gentleman  --  the successor , the heir coming ? MONSIEUR CANNELLE Parbleu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he may arrive at any moment . BARBEAU But after all , who is he ? What is his name ? MONSIEUR a--a Hush ! hush ! ( looks around , cautiously ) I do not object letting you into a secret , Barbeau ; his name is for the present a mystery . BARBEAU A what ? MONSIEUR a--a A mystery  --  that is , he does not wish anyone to know anything about him . p. 4 BARBEAU Good ! And does he not in his letters to you , Monsieur the Mayor , ex-mayor I mean  --  does he not mention the time of his arrival ? For of course he will alight here , the chateau being in a most tumble-down condition . MONSIEUR a--a A tumble-down condition ! Was there ever a more disrespectful epithet applied to an ancient feudal residence ?  --  to the Chateau de Courville , the most picturresque ruin , I mean edifice , in the province . BARBEAU Picturesque , if you please ! Only half the rooms have no ceilings , and the rest of them no floors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chateau , that I suppose Monsieur the Marquis will take up his quarters here at the " Golden Goose . " When you do write to him , Monsieur Cannelle , you can just hint that my hotel is the only hotel in the town worthy of being called an hotel . And although the Silver Lion pretends to a great deal , it is not fit to hold a candle to the " Golden Goose . " Only just put in a good word for me , and I shall be one of your best customers . MONSIEUR a--a So I would , Barbeau , only , between friends , the heir has not written to any one , not even to old Babette , the concierge of the chateau . I have heard that he intends to steal a march on us . He travels incog . BARBEAU Ah ! he travels incog . Is that any new-fangled sort of a carriage ? p. 5 MONSIEUR CANNELLE Barbeau , your igno ance shocks me . I blush for you . Learn , sir , that incog. means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MONSIEUR a--a Exactly so ; it means  --  incog ! BARBEAU Wonderful ! MONSIEUR CANNELLE He has left Paris , and it is supposed for this village ; but nobody is to know anything about it , so  --  mum !  --  you understand ? BARBEAU Perfectly ! But if monsieur the heir has any nouse  --  MONSIEUR CANNELLE Nouse ! What a barbarism ! Barbeau , as if a great nobleman could want nouse ! It is all very well for the cannaille , who have to work for their bread , but great noblemen are not obliged to be at the trouble of thinking . BARBEAU Pardon me , I was only going to observe , that the gentleman is sure to select my house : so I shall begin to bustle about , and get the best room ready . Oh , dear me , how very unfortunate ! my best bed room  --  MONSIEUR CANNELLE It has not been stolen , I presume ? BARBEAU No ; but I have let it to that young gentleman who came here two days , and is a stranger to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barbeau ? A stranger here , and I not yet informed of his appearance ! Who knows what he may be ? BARBEAU You were out of the way , Monsieur Cannelle , and as you are  --  pardon me  --  ex-mayor  --  MONSIEUR a--a Never mind that , friend Barbeau . BARBEAU And as his passport was all right , it was no business of mine to enquire who he was . MONSIEUR a--a But there are ways of ascertaining ; there is perhaps a name on his valise ; he has papers . BARBEAU Not a scrap ; and he came from somewhere on foot , carrying a small portmanteau , so securely locked , it would puzzle the Paris police to make anything out of it . Besides , the mayor , with whom he had an interview , appears satisfied . He pays regularly . I am satisfied , and  --  bless me ! I think that must be the young gentleman himself  --  here he comes . ( EUGENE is seen passing , the window , L. to R. ) MONSIEUR a--a Why , surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes roving about the country making sketches , taking long walks , and giving remarkably short answers when addressed by any one . But I shall ferret out who he is. p. 7 BARBEAU As you please , monsieur the ex-mayor ; but be discreet , if you please , for he is a good customer , and I can not afford to affront him . MONSIEUR a--a Offend him !  --  certainly not ; but I suspect there is something suspicious about this young stranger . So , Barbeau , I shall just step into the next room , and take counsel with myself as to what is to be done respecting him . Exit , door L. 1 E. BARBEAU A meddling old noodle ! What business is it of his ? Yet , I confess , I also have my suspicions . Enter EUGENE from door , R. ; he is very plainly dressed in the fashion of the times , hair powdered , but he wears no sword , and his costume should be that of a traveller  --  boots , overcoat , &amp;c . EUGENE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good morning ! What can I have for breakfast ? The air of these hills gives a famous appetite , and seems to produce nothing else . BARBEAU Oh , monsieur , you do us injustice ; the country round Courville is most fertile . EUGENE Ah , I forgot ! It certainly boasts of the greatest variety and abundance of thistles and dandelions , and the largest jack-asses I ever beheld , I should say that their progenitors must have been the aborigines of the place ; no offence , Barbeau , to the two-legged animals who now form the population . But apropos , of breakfast . p. 8 BARBEAU In less than five minutes , I promise you a first rate cutlet , a fricassee of rabbit , and such coffee ! EUGENE Capital ! I have great faith in your cutlets , but the last fricandeau of rabbit was rather suspicious ; I fear , Barbeau , that when alive those rabbits used to hunt mice and mew . BARBEAU ( expostulating ) Oh ! now really , monsieur , on the honour of an innkeeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it flavours more of the bean , than of the berry ; all very judicious were I a horse , but as I go on two legs , I prefer biped 's food . Now make haste , and let me have breakfast as soon as possible . BARBEAU You shall be served directly . ( aside ) So , he suspects my rabbits of being cats ! Well , my young gentleman shall have his joke , and pay for it . Exit door , L. 1 E. EUGENE ( throws his hat on table ) How provoking it is that I can discover no trace of this man , who seems to have disappeared at the same time that my only parent was forced from her home and child ! The old concierge , at the ruined chateau , can tell me nothing , or , what is much the same , will tell me nothing : and my clever acute notary , Monsieur Vichy , is equally in the dark  --  yet we have discovered that a domestic , named Phillipe , was in the confidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can not ascertain . What a foundation for a grand romance my early history would furnish !  --  An orphan  --  so very interesting , that  --  educated , and liberally supplied with funds by an unknown benefactor ,  --  how terribly mysterious ! But suddenly the supplies cease ; and , one never-to-be-forgotten day , an ominous-looking letter , with a black seal , rivalling in size a crown piece , informs me that I am nobody , and have nothing  --  remarkably pleasant that piece of intelligence . But as a remedy to this ill luck , a good-natured notary , of whom I had never heard , suddenly appears on the scene , as appropriately as the fairy godmother in the story book , and informs me that I am  --  Enter a--a from door , L. p. 9 MONSIEUR a--a ( speaking as he enters ) Never mind , Barbeau , I will wait here . ( affects surprise at seeing EUGENE ) Ah ! I beg pardon , Monsieur ; I hope that I am not intruding . EUGENE Not in the least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself at home . MONSIEUR CANNELLE You are very polite , Monsieur . Ah ! Monsieur Dubois I believe . EUGENE Oh ! ah ! yes  --  certainly Monsieur Dubois ; at your service . ( aside ) I may as well be Dubois , as any one else . It is an excellent travelling name , almost as good as Smith , to which our English neighbours are so partial . ( to CANNELLE ) I am as you say  --  Monsieur Dubois . Whom have I the pleasure of addressing ? MONSIEUR a--a Permit me to introduce myself as Monsieur Cannelle , ex-mayor of Courville . EUGENE Ah ! Monsieur Cannelle , grocer at the Mandarin and Sugar Loaf . MONSIEUR a--a Grocer if you will ; but let me assure you that I have a soul above cinnamon and treacle . Monsieur is travelling , I believe ? EUGENE Travelling  --  yes . ( aside ) Very inquisitive ! p. 10 MONSIEUR CANNELLE For pleasure or for business may I ask ? EUGENE Why , partly for one and the other . It saves an immensity of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EUGENE Not in your line , Monsieur Cannelle ; I am amusing myself here before I proceed to Lyons . MONSIEUR CANNELLE What a curious coincidence ! I have a cousin at Lyons ; perhaps , Monsieur Dubois , you may know him , or you may have heard of him  --  my cousin , Phillipe Dochefort  --  a notary . EUGENE Dochefort ! No , indeed , Monsieur Cannelle  --  I never had that honour . ( aside ) Tiresome old twaddler , why do n't he go ? ( to CANNELLE ) So , your cousin lives at Lyons ? MONSIEUR CANNELLE Yes ; and great a man as he thinks himself now  --  he was only a poor lad here at Courville , the son of the old steward , Nicole Pataud . EUGENE ( eagerly ) Pataud !  --  Pataud ! did you say ? MONSIEUR CANNELLE Yes  --  Pataud  --  neither more nor less ; but he succeeded to a fortune , in some unexpected manner ; married a rich wife  --  and is now the respected notary , Dochefort. p. 11 EUGENE ( aside ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search . ( to CANNELLE ) Monsieur Cannelle , I find your conversation so very pleasing , that I trust you will not think of leaving me just yet . I am going to breakfast ; do me the favour of sharing my repast . ( goes , L. 1 E. ) Barbeau ! Barbeau ! Is breakfast ready ? Mind  --  covers for two . Monsieur Cannelle joins me . MONSIEUR a--a Monsieur , I accept with pleasure . ( aside ) Do me the favour  --  I think that to an Ex-mayor , he might have said  --  do me the honour . One can easily see that he is not a man of rank . Enter BARBEAU , L. 1 E. , with tray , on which are covered dishes , glasses , wine bottles , plates , &amp;c . BARBEAU Here you are , monsieur  --  the most delicate cutlets , la Maintenon. ( places tray on table  --  then brings forward chairs , R. and L. ) EUGENE ( to CANNELLE ) Be seated , I beg , monsieur . ( they sit  --  EUGENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , Monsieur Cannelle  --  I can safely recommend Barbeau 's wine ; especially when he does not , by mistake , draw it out of the vinegar cask. ( pours out wine  --  they drink , having first touched glasses in the French fashion ) p. 12 BARBEAU Monsieur is pleased to be witty . ( aside ) At my expense , Parbleu ! that adds another item to the bill . EUGENE ( helps CANNELLE ) Now Monsieur Cannelle , I should like to have your opinion of the cutlet . Barbeau , we shall do very well  --  you need not wait . ( they eat ) BARBEAU I was going to forget a most important piece of information , and that monsieur will be charmed to hear . The owner of the Chateau de Courville is hourly expected ! EUGENE ( looks up ) Is he ? Then I strongly recommend him to set the stonemasons and bricklayers to work . BARBEAU And Monsieur Cannelle informs me that he is coming Incog  --  there ! EUGENE Oh , he comes Incog  --  With all my heart ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will do me the honour of coming here . EUGENE Well , he might do worse , Barbeau . Monsieur Cannelle , you positively eat nothing . MONSIEUR a--a Thanks , Monsieur , I do very well  --  in fact I am doing justice to this excellent breakfast . p. 13 EUGENE Another glass of wine to our better acquaintance . ( they drink ) BARBEAU But , Monsieur  --  in case the illustrious traveller should come here  --  EUGENE Meaning the owner of the chateau yonder , I consider him as a benefactor to all the owls and bats of the province . BARBEAU A benefactor  --  Oh , he will doubtless become one to others , as well as to the bats and owls  --  But I was about to observe  --  EUGENE As usual !  --  Barbeau , you are a man of great observation . BARBEAU Monsieur is pleased to compliment me . I was about to observe  --  the gentleman , who may arrive , will require a room . EUGENE Of course he will : you are not in the habit of lodging your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have but one best bed room , that which you occupy  --  Monsieur  --  EUGENE Put the illustrious traveller into the second best bed room . BARBEAU Oh ! monsieur really is joking ! The idea of putting my feudal lord , the owner of Courville , into the second-best bed room ! Most decidedly , I decline the proposal . In fact , monsieur , I must request that you will be so good as to give up the apartment you occupy . p. 14 EUGENE ( rises  --  comes forward ) Upon my word , Barbeau , you are the funniest , the most facetious , and the most fussy little fellow I ever had the good fortune to encounter . So you coolly ask me to turn out of my comfortable room , and for a stranger ? BARBEAU Consider , Monsieur . This , the Seigneur of the village , who may arrive , even to-day . EUGENE It would not in the least surprise me if he were to drop in unexpectedly , and perhaps to-day . MONSIEUR a--a ( rises  --  comes forward ) Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has left Paris ; and is said to be on his road to Courville . BARBEAU Does monsieur know the gentleman ? EUGENE Well , I believe I do know something about him . BARBEAU Does he resemble the late illustrious Marquis , of happy memory ? EUGENE It is to be hoped not ; for the late Marquis was not celebrated for personal beauty . Was he not humpbacked , and rather disposed to squint ? MONSIEUR CANNELLE Oh , dear no ! Monsieur Dubois . It was merely a slight elevation of the shoulder , and a trifling obliquity of vision . p. 15 EUGENE I can assure you then the present lord of the village is very like other two-legged beings . I am sorry to disappoint your expectations ; but he has no hump , and his eyes always look the same way at once . ( sits at table ) Enter LE DOUX hastily from door , R. MONSIEUR LE DOUX Good morning , gentlemen  --  Ah  --  Ouf ! ( fans himself with his three-cornered hat ) How terribly I am out of breath ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Barbeau that the illustrious traveller is coming . BARBEAU You do n't say so ! MONSIEUR CANNELLE You do n't say so ! MONSIEUR LE DOUX ' T is a fact  --  He is actually coming !  --  You must know that I was taking a little stroll just to removate my ideas touching the composition of a masterpiece of confectionary , on which I am engaged , when , what should I see coming down the hill , but and four , at full gallop . I regret to say , that within a few yards of the foot , the leaders fell , and over went the carriage , into a ditch , which , very fortunately , nappened to be a dry one . My dear friends , I do assure you , that , at that moment , I was shaking all over  --  like one of my own cream custards . Imagine what we should have felt , had the Marquis been in the mud . p. 16 BARBEAU Horrible  --  too horrible to think of  --  but go on , Le Doux . MONSIEUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I advanced , and making three distinct bows  --  you know I am renowned for the grace of my bows  --  BARBEAU Oh , bother your bows  --  do tell us what happened next . MONSIEUR LE DOUX Friend Barbeau  --  you are mighty impatient ! Well , having bowed , I helped his lordship out of the ditch , and on being questioned as to where he could go to refresh himself , I told him that he could not do better than put up at the " Golden Goose . " So while the postillions busied themselves in raising the carriage and horses , I ran on to apprize you . BARBEAU ( to EUGENE ) Oh , Monsieur Dubois  --  do you hear that ? EUGENE ( still seated ) Yes ; it must have been very amusing to every one but the principal performer . BARBEAU But surely you will not refuse to give up your apartment  --  you hear that the Marquis has been upset . EUGENE ( rises  --  comes forward ) So much the better for the coachmaker  --  there will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marquis has been thrown into a ditch ! and most likely is injured . EUGENE So much the better for the doctor  --  there will be a patient for him . BARBEAU But , Monsieur , do consider  --  EUGENE Barbeau  --  do n't bother ! Here I am ; and I promise you that while the seigneur of the village is here , here I also shall and will remain . Why , where on earth , man , would you have me go ? MONSIEUR CANNELLE Oh , Monsieur Dubois , I shall be happy to receive you : Madame Cannelle will be enchanted at making your acquaintance ; you will find her the model of domestic virtues . I need only observe , that her caf la creme is faultless . Then , Monsieur  --  our daughter  --  EUGENE Oh , ho ! you have a daughter , Monsieur Cannelle . MONSIEUR a--a A charming girl of seventeen  --  Mademoiselle Juliette Adolphine , one of the best matches in the country  --  beautiful  --  accomplished . MONSIEUR LE DOUX I have the honour of being her godfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the assertion . You should see her drawings  --  a head of Scipio Africanus  --  that would do credit , even to the Louvre . p. 18 EUGENE My good Monsieur Le Doux , I do n't understand drawing . MONSIEUR a--a And then , Monsieur Dubois , if you admire family portraits , we have in our saloon , I may say , a rare collection : first , the likenesses of Madame Cannelle and of your humble servant , represented as a shepherdess and shepherd of Arcadia ; but the gem of our treasures of art , is the portrait of Mademoiselle de Courville , the sister of the late Marquis , to whom Madame Cannelle had the honour of being femme de chambre . EUGENE ( eagerly ) How ! Madame Cannelle knew Madame  --  I mean Mademoiselle de Courville ? MONSIEUR CANNELLE Most intimately : she was brought up with her from childhood , and only left her when she married me . Ah , Monsieur Dubois , that picture alone would temptan amateur  --  My cousin , Phillipe Dochefort , would give anything to possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accept your obliging offer . The portraits , and , above all , the head of Scipio Africanus , have decided me . I shall be happy to become an inmate of your house  --  ( aside ) I shall learn now something of this Dochefort , who has hitherto been such a mystery to me. ( to BARBEAU ) Now , Barbeau , my little bill  --  quick ! p. 19 BARBEAU Your little bill , Monsieur Dubois  --  here it is , just fifteen francs . ( presents bill ) EUGENE And very reasonable , too : here is a louis  --  give the change to my friend Picard  --  let him drink to the health of the new proprietor , and strongly recommend him at the same time to polish the gentleman 's boots a little better than he has mine . Now , Monsieur Cannelle , in two seconds I am at your service . Exit door , L. 3 E. BARBEAU Monsieur Cannelle , you are in luck ; I know that Monsieur Dubois must be rich ; he pays like a prince  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who knows what may not happen . Re-enter EUGENE , door , L. 3 E. EUGENE Monsieur Cannelle , I am ready  --  Barbeau , let my portmanteau be sent after me. ( smacking of whip without ) What is all that noise about ? Enter PICARD , door , R. PICARD Oh , master ! master !  --  here 's the great gentleman  --  He 's a coming  --  he 's at the door ! BARBEAU I fly to receive him . Get along  --  do , stupid ! ( pushes PICARD out before him , door , R.  --  a--a and LE DOUX run and look out at window ) p. 20 EUGENE So the new seigneur du village is here at last ; I must , unknown to him , catch a glimpse of this very august personage , for whom I am so unceremoniously dismissed . ( opens door , R. ) Here he comes  --  Ah !  --  surely I know him  --  yes ; it is the same  --  Ha , ha , ha ! this is an excellent joke , and one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. ( slouches his hat over his eyes  --  pulls up his coat collar ) In case I am scrutinised , this will sufficiently conceal my features . Now Monsieur , the Ex-mayor , I am at your service . MONSIEUR a--a ( comes forward , L. ) In a moment ; I only await the entrance of the illustrious personage  --  he comes . The door , R. , is suddenly flung open . Enter BARBEAU and PICARD bowing in , and preceding MARCEL , who swaggers in  --  he should be very gaudily dressed in the Louis Quinze style  --  powdered hair  --  three-cornered hat , bordered with gold lace , with brilliant loop  --  velvet coat  --  satin waistcoat  --  shoes , with red heels , and paste buckles  --  and sword , which is perpetually getting between his legs  --  EUGENE stands aside as he enters , and slips out unperceived at door , R. BARBEAU ( bowing very low ) Welcome , Monseigneur  --  I mean Monsieur , welcome to the " Golden Goose . " p. 21 PICARD ( awkwardly imitating him ) Yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Golden Goose . " BARBEAU ( pulling PICARD by the ear ) Booby  --  will you be quiet , and go away . ( pushes PICARD out door , R. ) MARCEL ( c. , affectedly looking round ) So this is the " Golden Goose ? " You , I presume , are the landlord  --  . A chair . ( BARBEAU brings a chair from table  --  MARCEL sits ) Another for my feet . ( BARBEAU brings forward second chair , on which MARCEL puts up his legs ) MONSIEUR a--a ( to LE DOUX ) Evidently a great man  --  ( advances ) Monsieur , I trust , is not seriously injured . MARCEL ( looks at CANNELLE ) Landlord !  --  Who is that fellow ? BARBEAU Oh , Monseigneur  --  Monsieur , I mean ; with all deference , that gentleman is not a fellow  --  he is a Monsieur Cannelle . MONSIEUR a--a Ex-mayor of the town  --  at the service of Monsieur . I have long been honoured with the custom of the late Marquis . p. 22 MARCEL ( starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur Cannelle , I have the honour of making the acquaintance of the ex-mayor. ( aside ) Confound him  --  I must be civil . He is the father of my adorable Adolphine. ( to CANNELLE ) I really have the pleasure of addressing the ex-mayor of  --  MONSIEUR CANNELLE Of Courville , Monsieur . ( bows very low ) MARCEL So this delicious abode is the Courville of which I have heard so much . ( aside ) Oh , blind goddess Fortune , why did you let me be upset into a dry ditch in this place ?  --  I should have preferred the dirtiest of horseponds , in any other locality . ( to CANNELLE ) Your friend there , is , if I mistake not , the kind person who extricated me from my unpleasant position , in the ditch yonder . MONSIEUR LE DOUX ( bows ) The same , Monseigneur  --  I mean , Monsieur  --  My name is Le Doux , confectioner en chef to the late Marquis , and also , I may add , to the nobility and gentry of the province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose delicate productions have immortalised his name . ( aside ) Hang it ! he is my stepmother 's brother : I have fallen among foes ! p. 23 MONSIEUR LE DOUX I flatter myself , that when monsieur has tasted my last great achievement , he will be convinced that I am worthy of the good opinion he has of my poor talent . MARCEL Oh , Monsieur Le Doux , I have had an opportunity of tasting some of your excellent pastry ; ( aside ) and of suffering fearful indigestions in consequence . But , gentlemen , I fear that I am detaining you . MONSIEUR CANNELLE Oh , not in the least , Monsieur . MONSIEUR LE DOUX Oh , not in the least , Monsieur . MARCEL And I retire to my apartment . Here , landlord ! BARBEAU Barbeau , of the " Golden Goose , " at the service of monseigneur  --  I mean , of monsieur ! MARCEL These gentlemen will dine with me , I hope ; meantime , Monsieur Cannelle and Monsieur Le Doux will excuse my taking leave of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MONSIEUR CANNELLE We will no longer intrude on monsieur . MONSIEUR LE DOUX We respectfully take our leave of monsieur . MARCEL Au revoir , gentlemen  --  we dine at four precisely  --  Barbeau , mind , we shall expect a first-rate dinner  --  everything of the best . p. 24 MONSIEUR a--a ( bows ) Au revoir , monsieur ! Exeunt CANNELLE and LE DOUX , door R. , after many bows , as if each wished to give the precedence to the other , finally CANNELLE goes out first , with great dignity , followed by LE DOUX . BARBEAU Monsieur has no other commands to give . MARCEL None . By-the-bye , my hair is a little disordered  --  have you a hairdresser , or a decent barber in the place ?  --  if so , send him to me . BARBEAU We have an excellent perruquieur , who will be charmed to wait on monsieur . MARCEL Good . Now leave me . BARBEAU ( bows ) I obey . ( aside ) One can see , with half an eye , that he must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . E. MARCEL ( throws himself into a chair ) Ha , ha , ha !  --  I shall expire with laughing . What wonderful politeness ! I am evidently mistaken for a great man , travelling incog  --  but who I am supposed to be , is a perfect mystery to me . I would rather have arrived at any other town , however " vogue la galre . " I shall be for the nonce , whoever they please  --  count , duke , or even a prince of the blood ! Enter EUGENE , cautiously , from door R. 1 E. ; he goes behind MARCEL ; taps him on the shoulder . p. 25 MARCEL ( looking up ) What is it , friend ? EUGENE A word with you , monsieur . MARCEL A word with me ! Really , I have not the honour of your acquaintance . EUGENE Possibly not . Yet , if I remember rightly  --  and my memory is pretty correct  --  you are one Marcel , clerk to Monsieur Nicholas Vichy , notary of Paris . MARCEL ( starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you are ; travelling on private business , relating to a client of Monsieur Vichy 's . You are , or ought to be , on the road to Lyons ; but your carriage breaks down here , and you very naturally take refuge in the first inn you come to . MARCEL That is not high treason . I should imagine . EUGENE Certainly not ; but some people might object to your opening a valise of which you had the key , and putting on a coat , waistcoat , and sword , to which you are not entitled  --  eh , Master Marcel ? MARCEL ( aside ) How could he find that out ? ( to EUGENE ) I protest , sir , that I do not comprehend you . p. 26 EUGENE I speak pretty plainly , I think ; and I must own that you do not look at all amiss in your borrowed plumes . ( walks round MARCEL ) MARCEL In the name of wonder who are you ? You seem intimately acquainted with me . EUGENE Monsieur Cannelle , the grocer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me this morning , and who is to have the honour of dining with you this afternoon , at the expense of your master 's client  --  he will tell you that I am named Dubois . MARCEL Dubois !  --  Dubois !  --  a very general name ! Well , Monsieur Dubois , what do you require of me ? EUGENE That you will on no account undeceive these good people here , who have mistaken you for a gentleman of rather higher rank than you are . Continue to personate him ; and contrive to extract from Cannelle all the intelligence you can respecting the sister of the late marquis . You will oblige me , and I shall not be ungrateful . Exit door , R. door . MARCEL Who can that mysterious individual be ? I must serve him , or he may betray me to Cannelle  --  and then , farewell all my hopes of obtaining the hand of Juliette Adolphine . Enter LE DOUX cautiously , door L. 1 E. p. 27 MONSIEUR LE DOUX Hist  --  hist , monsieur  --  MARCEL Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX ( mysteriously ) Might I be so bold as to intrude on monsieur 's precious time . MARCEL Most certainly , Monsieur Le Doux ; in what way can I serve you ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX Monsieur is too good ; I fear that I am very presuming , but my object is to be of use to monseigneur  --  I mean monsieur . MARCEL Ah , indeed ! and in what way ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX Monsieur has certainly a right to appear here Incog , and we should respect the scruples of a great man . MARCEL My good Monsieur Le Doux , why will you insist on mistaking me for a great man  --  I am merely a plain , unpretending traveller . MONSIEUR LE DOUX Just as monsieur pleases . But I know that you are interested in the affairs of the family of Courville . MARCEL The Courvilles ! Ah , let me see  --  did they not formerly reside at the old chateau here ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX The late marquis did till the death of his sister , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell you terrible tales of the old chateau . p. 28 MARCEL I suppose that it has a respectable assortment of family ghosts and hereditary hobgoblins ! MONSIEUR LE DOUX Oh ! worse than that . You must know that , many years ago , there was a beautiful young lady at the chateau . MARCEL I am sorry that it was many years ago , because time is very damaging to beauty . Pray who was this beautiful young lady ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX Sister to the marquis ! And there is the mystery ! MARCEL I confess that I see nothing very mysterious in that circumstance , because I happen to have a sister . Is that all the information ? ( aside ) Shall I be able to extract any intelligence from this compound of puff-paste and sugar ! MONSIEUR LE DOUX But this sister , monsieur , disappeared in a very mysterious manner . MARCEL Oh , ho !  --  it was the manner , not the lady which constituted the mystery . So she disappeared ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX And has never been heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lady , if living , is the next heir . MARCEL Precisely so . MONSIEUR LE DOUX And as no one ever heard of her again , she must be dead ; and the greater part of the estates must go to a stranger , formerly the son of the old steward . p. 29 MARCEL Yes , I see . You mean  --  monsieur  --  monsieur  --  dear me , how stupid of me to forget a name  --  ( aside ) which I never remember to have heard . MONSIEUR LE DOUX Monsieur Dochefort  --  formerly a Pataud  --  now a notary at Lyons . MARCEL Dochefort  --  of Lyons , did you say ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX Dochefort  --  and he it was who gave us a hint that monseignenr  --  monsieur I mean  --  might be travelling this way . MARCEL Did he ? ( aside ) So , my old master , Dochefort , has a finger in this . He has never forgiven me for running away from him and his rogueries . A pleasant circle of unwelcome acquaintance I have tumbled into . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dochefort ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX We all suspect , here , that he knew what became of Mademoiselle de Courville , and that she was  --  ( CANNELLE is seen passing the window ) Dear me , here comes that tedious fellow , Cannelle . I do n't want him to see me with monsieur  --  he would suspect that I suspected something . Au revoir , monsieur . I shall have the pleasure of renewing this conversation at a more convenient time . Beware of Cannelle  --  he and Dochefort are cousins , and hand and glove , as one may say . He will be wanting  --  p. 30 MARCEL To pump me , you would say ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX Monsieur has just hit upon the truth . I must not be seen here  --  I shall return when there is no fear of interruption . ( aside ) What a wonderful family likeness ! he is every inch a Courville . Exit , door L. 1 E. MARCEL Well , my Incog is doing some good to the other gentleman , who is also Incog . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know who I am supposed to be ! Mum  --  here comes my intended father-in-law . Enter CANNELLE , cautiously , door , R. MARCEL Ah ! Monsieur Cannelle , this is indeed kind of you . MONSIEUR CANNELLE Oh ! monsieur , could I speak two words to you ? MARCEL Two hundred , if you will , excellent Monsieur Cannelle . If our conference is to be a long one , we had better be seated . ( brings forward a chair  --  a--a does the same  --  they sit ) And now I am all attention , monsieur . MONSIEUR a--a Monsieur will not deem me impertinent if I venture to say that I know he is deeply interested in the affairs of the family of Courville. p. 31 MARCEL Well  --  a little  --  yes , I am rather so ; you understand , Monsieur Cannelle  --  a word to the wise  --  MONSIEUR a--a And you are perhaps aware that there has been something wrong there ? MARCEL Yes  --  a screw loose somewhere , and an immensity of botheration . MONSIEUR a--a There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up with it . MARCEL Really  --  vastly unpleasant that ; but what has the botheration to do with me ! MONSIEUR a--a Monsieur , I could tell you a secret about that family , which may affect the present heir . MARCEL Oh , oh , a secret !  --  out with it then  --  who is it about ? MONSIEUR a--a The sister  --  Mademoiselle de Courville  --  who disappeared ;  --  yes , Mademoiselle Adolphine . MARCEL Adolphine , did you say !  --  what a charming name ! Do you know , Monsieur Cannelle , that I quite adore the name of Adolphine , and I would choose a wife of that name , above all others . MONSIEUR a--a How very remarkable that my daughter  --  my only child  --  should be named Adolphine. p. 32 MARCEL Very remarkable !  --  She is a mere child , I suppose ? MONSIEUR CANNELLE Oh , no , monsieur  --  not a child  --  an accomplished young lady of eighteen , whose education was completed at Paris  --  But to my story  --  MARCEL ( interrupting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head all day , and I shall dream of it all night . Of course , your daughter is surrounded by adorers ? MONSIEUR a--a Well , sir , she might choose from among the most eligible matches in the province ; but to the business in question , monsieur , touching this sister of the late marquis , who is  --  Allow me first to ascertain if no one can overhear us . Goes cautiously to door , L. 1 . E. , opens it , and BARBEAU enters suddenly.Good gracious , Barbeau ! what brings you here ? ( aside ) If he has listened . BARBEAU ( to MARCEL ) I have the honour of announcing to monsieur , that the hairdresser awaits his pleasure . MARCEL Only the hairdresser : let him come in . Exit BARBEAU , door L. MONSIEUR CANNELLE As we are interrupted , monsieur , I take my leave for the present ; but allow me to continue this conversation when you are more at leisure . p. 33 MARCEL I shall be enchanted . Exit CANNELLE , door R.Fortunately , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seven years since either of them saw me . What would the latter say , if he learnt that I am the secret adorer of the lovely Adolphine , whom I saw at Paris  --  and whom I mean to marry ? Oh , why am I only clerk to a notary ! Enter BARBEAU , door L. , speaking as he enters . BARBEAU Yes ; you can come in , Monsieur Le Blanc . MARCEL ( starts ) Eh ?  --  whom did you say ? BARBEAU Monsieur le Blanc , the hair-dresser . Oh ! quite a paragon , I assure you . He comes from Paris ; and wields his powder-puff better than any man in the province . Exit BARBEAU , door L. 1 E. MARCEL Oh , my prophetic soul !  --  it is uncle Peter Achilles  --  who believes me to be scribbling at this present moment , in the office of Monsieur Vichy , at Paris . How shall I be able to impose upon him ? Here he comes , to exercise his art upon my head  --  he has often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognise me ! I must brazen it out that I am not myself . ( MARCEL sits with his back towards door , L. , takes out a letter , pretends to read ) I can amuse myself with my tailor 's bill . ( during this Scene , LE BLANC should be constantly endeavouring to obtain a glimpse of MARCEL 'S face , which MARCEL prevents , by either turning his back to him , or else by holding the powdering mask before his face  --  MARCEL also speaks in a feigned voice ) Enter LE BLANC as a hair-dresser of the time , L. ; he carries a dressing gown over his arm , and has in one hand a powder mask and a dressing case . p. 34 MONSIEUR LE BLANC I have the honour to pay my respects to monsieur  --  MARCEL ( in rather a gruff voice ) Monsieur le Blanc , I believe ? I suppose that you can dress a gentleman 's hair ? MONSIEUR LE BLANC I dressed the late Marquis de Courville 's scores and scores of times . ( pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will monsieur permit me to divest him of his coat , and to assist him in putting on this powdering robe de chambre . MARCEL There , never mind my coat ; just throw the gown over my shoulders . ( rises , stands with his back to LE BLANC who places the gown on him ) Now for the mask . ( snatches powder mask from LE BLANC and holds it before his face ) And now , make haste . MONSIEUR LE BLANC Monsieur shall look like an Adonis , with the mere application of my comb and powder-puff. ( begins dressing MARCEL 'S hair ) Monsieur has just arrived from Paris , I believe ? MARCEL ( gruffly ) Yes , you know Paris ? MONSIEUR LE BLANC I formerly resided in it  --  and I have still a wild scamp of a nephew there . p. 35 MARCEL Indeed ! Does he follow your trade ? MONSIEUR LE BLANC My art , you mean , monsieur ? No , he disdains it ; he is clerk to a notary  --  one Monsieur Vichy  --  he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcel . I should have made him my heir , but now , with monseigneur 's permission , I mean to marry . MARCEL My good Le Blanc , are you not rather too old to think of marrying . ( aside ) If uncle Peter marries , good-bye to my inheritance . MONSIEUR LE BLANC Oh , no , monsieur , the young lady 's friends are willing enough  --  they will give their consent . MARCEL ( aside ) Very pleasant news ! ( to LE BLANC ) But the young lady herself may object  --  MONSIEUR LE BLANC Oh , monsieur , I flatter myself that she will not object . My magazine will receive a charming mistress , whose accomplishments are first rate . You should hear her play and sing  --  you should see her drawings , and in particular , a head of Scipio Africanus , from the antique . I tell her it would be perfection if it had been represented in a perriwig ; though Monsieur Cannelle assures me it is classically correct . MARCEL ( eagerly ) What name did you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-mayor , whose daughter I shall have the honour of making my wife . MARCEL ( starts up , throws the powder-box , puff , and powder mask at LE BLANC , who is seized with a violent fit of sneezing ) What  --  you  --  you presuming old powder-puff  --  you marry grace , youth , and beauty ? Go to the  --  the  --  the Antipodes ! ( throws the dressing gown over LE BLANC ) Oh , Adolphine ! Adolphine ! Exit , door L. 3 E.  --  presently , violent ringing of bells is heard . MONSIEUR LE BLANC Good gracious ! what can all this mean ? I begin to think that the illustrious traveller must be mad . What has my marriage to do with him ? Enter BARBEAU , door L. 1 E. BARBEAU I say , neighbour Le Blanc , what have you said or done to the illustrious gentleman ? MONSIEUR LE BLANC Done !  --  Nothing at all ! His lordship was chatting with me in a most charming familiar manner , when all at once he jumps up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost blinds me with a perfect avalanche of powder , thumps his own illustrious forehead , and then rushes out of the room like a maniac ! p. 37 BARBEAU You have offended his dignity , Le Blanc , and have brought eternal disgrace on the " Golden Goose ! " MONSIEUR LE BLANC Barbeau , you are an old fool ! Offend his dignity , indeed ! Never presume to send for me to dress the calves ' heads of your customers ! ( gathers up the things MARCEL threw at him , and amongst them the letter MARCEL was reading ) Good morning , Barbeau . I wish you better luck with the next illustrious person who is travelling incog . Exit angrily , door R. BARBEAU What can he have said to my guest ? I must find out ; and here is a packet of letters for him from old Cannelle. ( bell rings ) Coming , monsieur . Exit , door L. 3 E. Enter EUGENE , door R. EUGENE I have watched them all out  --  the last departure from the levee of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I trust that he has no suspicions respecting Marcel , for on that young clerk rests my hopes of obtaining the information I require . Not a word can I learn from Madame Cannelle , Heavens ! every hour that detains me here gives this Dochefort time to put his wicked plans into execution . Enter BARBEAU , door L. 3 E. p. 38 BARBEAU ( speaking as he enters ) Yes , monsieur , I will attend to it directly . Ah ! young gentleman , ( to EUGENE ) you are the very person that is wanted . The illustrious traveller , who for the present chooses to remain Incog , does you the honour of wishing to see you immediately in his private apartment . Now pray make haste  --  great men must not be kept waiting . EUGENE Decidedly not , Barbeau  --  I shall go to him . Exit , door L. 3 E. BARBEAU That young man does n't seem to know his place n society : with what familiarity he speaks of monseigneur . Now I must prepare the table for dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to place the knives and forks . Enter PICARD , with a cloth and tray , door L. 1 E. PICARD Here you are , master  --  all ready ! BARBEAU There , there , make haste , and tell cook to hurry the dinner . PICARD The cook !  --  you mean mistress : you had better tell her yourself , master  --  I do n't want to have my head broken any more with the rolling pin . BARBEAU Picard , you are a terrible dolt  --  get away with you , do . p. 39 PICARD Ah ! master knows the weight of that rolling pin as well as I do . Exit , door , L. 1 E. BARBEAU ( arranging the table ) Now , where ought the great man to sit ?  --  At the head of the table , of course . Cannelle , as ex-mayor , on his right  --  Le Doux on his left  --  though I expect they will quarrel for the best place . Why I declare , here they come , and disputing about something . Enter a--a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( speaking as he enters ) Are you really quite certain , LE DOUX ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX Oh , quite positive ; the messenger arrived on horseback ; he told the mayor that he was the bearer of a most important letter for a gentleman who had been staying here for some time . The mayor referred him here , and the man hurried away before I could even catch a glimpse of the letter .  --  Is not that very mysterious ? MONSIEUR a--a Bless me ! what can it mean ? I have it  --  the two great men are both here Incog . BARBEAU ( advancing , ) The two !  --  which two ? MONSIEUR a--a The two heirs  --  the cousin who has just arrived , and  --  ( aside ) I was nearly letting the secret out . p. 40 BARBEAU Another heir !  --  impossible ! Oh , there can be but one  --  the illustrious gentleman who came in his carriage , and who must be monseigneur ; besides , remember the wonderful family likeness that you discovered immediately , Monsieur Cannelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Marquis , save that he does not squint . MONSIEUR LE DOUX And the figure the very counterpart as well  --  only  --  . BARBEAU The young gentleman has no hump . Should he happen not to be the right one ! Suppose that I have turned the real heir out of his room to make way for the false one ! MONSIEUR a--a Nonsense , Barbeau . He must be the real heir  --  I mean the gentleman who has invited us to dinner . Enter LE BLANC hurriedly , door R.Why , neighbour Le Blanc , what a flurry you are in ! MONSIEUR LE BLANC Flurry , indeed ! well I may be in a flurry ! I have made such a discovery ! MONSIEUR a--a A discovery ! What is it ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX A discovery ! What is it ? MONSIEUR LE BLANC You know that I was sent for to dress the hair of a gentleman who is here incog ? p. 41 BARBEAU Yes , yes  --  we know that  --  go on ! MONSIEUR LE BLANC Well , although I dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the most agreeable manner , he suddenly took offence at something I said , bounced out of his chair , flung at me everything he could lay his hands on , and then darted out of the room . Well , in gathering my things together , I picked up a note  --  a most mysterious note  --  MONSIEUR CANNELLE Which you read ? MONSIEUR LE BLANC Which I read ; and guess my surprise when I found that it was neither more nor less than a tailor 's bill  --  for repairing and turning a coat . Did one ever hear of such a thing as a great man and a nobleman turning his coat ? MONSIEUR CANNELLE I am compelled to say that I have . But to the discovery , Le Blanc . MONSIEUR LE BLANC The discovery ! Why , that I think the traveller is no more a great man than I am ? MONSIEUR a--a Nonsense , man ! Did you observe his features  --  he has the family nose to perfection ! MONSIEUR LE BLANC I can answer for it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentleman contrived to keep his face turned from me the whole time I was powdering his hair  --  I could n't judge of the likeness . p. 42 MONSIEUR LE DOUX A thought strikes me ! Barbeau , have you not a young man staying here ? BARBEAU Yes ; perhaps the paper belongs to him  --  the great man number one has sent for him , and they are now together in the best bed room . Hush ! I thought that I heard loud talking . ( listens at door , L. 3 E. ) MONSIEUR a--a Surely they are not going to quarrel , and perhaps have a duel ; for in that case I as ex-mayor must really interfere . MONSIEUR LE DOUX Had I not better run and apprise our friend the doctor that he may be wanted ; the wounded gentleman will require all our care . MONSIEUR LE BLANC Had you not better wait till he is wounded ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX He will not be able to remain here , the inn would be far too noisy . I can offer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARBEAU Mind your own business , Monsieur le Doux ; attend to your own pie crusts and patties , and leave me to look after my own customers . MONSIEUR a--a Hush , hush ! my good friends , for goodness sake do n't let us quarrel ! Who knows that perhaps the two illustrious gentlemen may , at this very moment , be giving each other a deadly wound . I am going to reconnoitre . p. 43 MONSIEUR LE BLANC Reconnoitre ? bless me ! how shall you manage that ? MONSIEUR CANNELLE Through the keyhole. ( goes cautiously towards door L. 3 E. , followed on tiptoe by LE DOUX and LE BLANC ) They have put the key in the inside ; I can see nothing , but I can listen . Hush ! what is that ? BARBEAU What is it ? MONSIEUR a--a Nothing ! all is quiet . Oh , if there were but a crevice through which one could peep. ( as all are trying to peep through the keyhole the door is suddenly opened , and MARCEL enters , in a plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANNELLE are thrown down ) MARCEL Monsieur Cannelle , a million of pardons ! MONSIEUR a--a ( scrambles up , the others rise ) Oh , Monseigneur , there is no need to apologise . MARCEL Barbeau , you must get the carriage ready instantly ; we start in half an hour . Let me have your bill . BARBEAU Start in half an hour ! But the dinner that monsieur has commanded ? and which will be superb  --  MARCEL These gentlemen will eat it , and I pay for it ; only do hurry the Postillions  --  we must reach Lyons tonight . Now be quick . ( pushes BARBEAU out at door , L. 1 E. ) What a fortunate discovery for us ! Gentlemen , I hope to meet you again , but  --  p. 44 MONSIEUR a--a and LE D. Oh , monseigneur  --  that is monsieur . MONSIEUR LE BLANC ( advances , C. ) Monseigneur ( looks at MARCEL and then staggers back , R. ) Can I believe my eyes ! His very look ; his very voice . MARCEL What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside ) Uncle Peter is astonished rather . MONSIEUR a--a ( to LE BLANC ) What you also are struck with the wonderful likeness to the late marquis . MONSIEUR LE BLANC ( angrily ) The late marquis ! late fiddlesticks ! If I am Peter Achilles Le Blanc , that must be  --  MONSIEUR LE DOUX Monseigneur  --  I said so , did I not ? MARCEL My good friends , how often have I told you that I am merely a plain traveller ? I am no monseigneur at all . MONSIEUR LE BLANC No indeed ! I can vouch for the truth of that , for as I am an honest man  --  MONSIEUR a--a My dear friend , be cautious , pray do . MONSIEUR LE BLANC As I live then , monseigneur , as you will style him , is no other than my scape-grace of a nephew . p. 45 MONSIEUR a--a ( to LE DOUX ) Your nephew ? Impossible ! MONSIEUR LE BLANC My nephew I tell you  --  Jules Marcel : let him deny it if he can . MARCEL Gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notary of Paris . MONSIEUR LE DOUX Jules Marcel ! the step-son of my sister ! MONSIEUR CANNELLE Jules Marcel , the good-for-nothing scamp , who has presumed to fall in love with my daughter . MARCEL Gently , gently , papa Cannelle ; if loving your daughter , the charming Adolphine , be a crime , there is old uncle Peter as great a culprit as myself . Now go and abuse him . MONSIEUR LE BLANC So you are the formidable rival whom Mademoiselle Cannelle prefers ? MARCEL I am ; and I applaud her good taste  --  why , uncle Peter , you would n't have her marry her grandfather . MONSIEUR a--a ( in a rage ) That I  --  Cannelle  --  ex-mayor , should have been so duped  --  so deceived ! Why I have been as respectful to him !  --  How dared you allow me to continue in error , you low-born fellow , and mistake you for the marquis ? p. 46 MONSIEUR LE BLANC Low-born fellow ! my nephew is every bit as well born as yourself , neighbour Cannelle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful family likeness you both discovered , and were so angry with me for not seeing with half an eye ? MONSIEUR LE DOUX If you are not the heir of Courville , I should Like to know who is ? MARCEL I shall be delighted to introduce him . ( opens door , L. 3 E. ) Enter EUGENE , dressed as a nobleman of the time , L. 3 E.Allow me to present to the real heir of Courville , some of his most humble servants . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ( nudges CANNELLE )
