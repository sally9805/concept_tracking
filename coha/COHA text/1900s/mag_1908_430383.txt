 |p1275  stress upon his own individuality than upon the needs of the community , and where he cultivates a temperament besides , and you have a section that can only be changed by colonization . In other places , the emphasis is beginning to be placed upon the community rather than upon the individual , and in the East , for instance , only artists are supposed to have " temperament " ; but clown here the meanest man has his exaggerated sensibilities and shows them as quickly as if ' he were a petted prima donna . There never were a people who have chosen so arbitrarily what they will be and what they will do , and who have accomplished their will with so much courage and so many absurdities , in the face of greater odds or more ridicule . This is their dominant characteristic and shows in the smallest details of life . In the North , for example , the worst people speak good English ; here , the best ones do not . A wag once boasted that he could always tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because biscuit was immediately substituted for baker 's bread . A quicker way would be to observe when the passengers begin to use two negatives in the same sentence . All possible pains may be taken in training a Southerner to speak correctly , even to forcing him into association with New England teachers who would rather commit suicide than to be guilty of a sin against syntax , but the moment he is free of restraint he will snap in the extra negative . I have sometimes thought it might be the language symbol of the elemental kicking sensation in every Southerner 's mind against the other fellow 's mind . There is a difference also in what they mean when they speak . What people say in the North and East does not represent them , what they are , but what they think , or it may even be a clever repreresentation of what some one else thinks . The fact that a man in New York lectures on ethics is no sign that he is not a scamp , nor must he be a civil engineer because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing an article thru his hat on the Panama canal . They all have Burbank intelligences. curious , artificially grafted , variegated brains , and that kind of acquisitiveness which produces the hybrid mind but does not affect character . Now the Southerner 's mind is identical with him . If he is a rascal , he talks like one . He is too honorable even then to talk ethics . And you never see him skipping the rope intellectually , just to see what and how far he can think in a given direction . He recognizes this as folly , no matter how grave it sounds in words . And all this explains why the Southern people are more truthful than the Northern people . They have not so much diabolical mental versatility for temptation . A Southern man only exaggerates , he does not lie . And he exaggerates for the noblest of reasons ? the little of truth that he knows is too small for his great spirit . He stretches it therefore as a bird stretches its wings . Also , it is a point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , by any chance , a South Carolinian should win thru the gates of heaven , there is no doubt that his first request would be that he might be introduced to the Hosts as an humble sinner from the South ! Recently this writer entered a Northern church while the minister was upon his knees , concealed by the pulpit , leading the prayer . That man who is praying is from the South . " " How do you know ? By his pronunciation ? " inquired my friend . " No ; by the eloquence of his humility , by the way he puts his best foot foremost before the Lord , by his courtier consciousness that he is engaged in a royal ceremony with the King of heaven , and by the elegance of his spiritual satisfaction in the performance . " " Absurd ! " exclaimed my friend . But when the man arose from his knees he proved to be an obscure , fiery-eyed little preacher from Georgia ! Now I do not know what a Yankee would do in heaven , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prayer , but down here he very often wishes you to believe that he has almost ceased to be a Yankee . At a recent dinner , the person next me was a poetess from Massachusetts . By way of putting herself amiably within reach of us. she declared that she had nearly got all the " Yankee rubbed off ! " But there never was a Southerner , I suppose , so mean ,  |p1276  so insincere , so lost to self-respect that he would wish to seem less a Southerner . When he travels out of his own section , in fact , it becomes his insufferable proclamation , often offensive to those who have not had the same advantages in the matter of nativity . Very much more might be said of the Southerner 's way socially , but now we come to his way financially . And that is deplorable . We have learned to work but not to save , not to look ahead and invest . We do not think definitely and altogether in any profitable direction . There is the " solid South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no protection out of that beyond self-protection from the Republican guardians of negro interests . We are not pragmatists , but idealists still . We have more imagination than enterprise . We are not nearly so lazy as we have the reputation for being , but we spend too much energy just hoping . We do not know how to pool our means , organize and work together . There is too little room for personal dignity in organization . About the town of R ? in North Georgia there are mountains of material out of which cement is made . With comparatively small capital a Northern company has bought these deposits , built a plant and is coining money . The villagers are the day laborers in the plant , where the dust produces galloping consumption . Meanwhile the slate quarries , owned by Southern capital , at the same place , are closed because the property has been tied up for years in a typical Southern law suit . The same conditions exist in hundreds of cotton factories all over the South . They are owned by Northern capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low wages . John W. Gates and other Northern speculators own most of the timber in the great pine belts . If things go on as they are going now , presently the Southerners will have nothing left but the bare ground . But that is the point . The order of events will be changed , and changed after the desperate manner of these people . And this brings me to consider a matter very much discussed from time to time ? that is , lawlessness in the South . There is more lawlessness everywhere else in this country than in the South . There is so little lawfulness in Chicago , for example , that ' even a novelist will not go there any longer to lay the scene of a story . And the whole country has been blushing for New York till it is almost apoplectic . The most brutal violence of the year has taken place in Ohio . But the reason why so much is said of Southern lawlessness is because it is different from that in any other part of the country . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that practiced by the same kind of criminals elsewhere . In the North , when one prominent man kills another prominent man , it is nearly always about a woman , and not much of a woman at that . Most of the scandals published in the newspapers for years have been frightful expositions of social and domestic depravity among the wealthy people of the North and East , in which pistol shots have been exchanged . But down here , when one prominent man kills another , it is at least a distinctly masculine affair , usually political . And while it is easy to recall many such instances , this writer does not now remember one to have occurred for a number of years where the sex motive has entered into any of our distinguished men 's murder cases . I am not intimating that murder , wherever committed , does not indicate moral degradation , but there are degrees even in degradation , and that of the North far surpasses that of the South in this particular . The motives for murder among the people there who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who belong to , prominent families with wealth and social position , are as revolting as those which lead to murder in the lowest dives , and they are not down here . They may be quixotic , bad , the results of frightful passions , but they are not sexual . However , the term lawlessness in the South was first applied after the Civil War to the Ku-Klux-Klan . To prevent negro supremacy forced upon us by the North , white men in disguise patrolled the country at night ordering and arranging matters satisfactorily with the negroes . It was not gently done , nor wisely , but it was done . Then the phrase had reference to mob violence in the South , but when the same mobs appeared  |p1277  elsewhere , and for the same reasons , this violence ceased to be merely Southern . More recently lawlessness in the South has reference to the " night riders " in Kentucky , Tennessee , Georgia and other Southern States . But there is one kind of lawlessness in the South , and everywhere else in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lawlessness ? that is , the lawlessness of those whose duty it is to enforce law . There is a law against trusts , but the tobacco trust put the price of tobacco down so low that the tobacco growers of Kentucky and Tennessee could not earn a living . This is why the trust warehouses are being burned . The same thing is true of cotton in Georgia , and explains the burning of gin houses . Many poor men of large families lived by fishing in Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee until the lake was bought by a rich private corporation for a fashionable game preserve and the fishermen were forbidden to fish in it . This accounts for the Reelfoot Lake tragedy in which the night riders figured . It will account for the burning of the cotton factories and saw mill plants in the South later on . I am stating facts and making a prophecy . I am not defending the night riders . They must be put down , of course , but it just is n't in any kind of Southerner to stay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organize and protect himself legally . He can hardly bear one boss , much less a labor union boss . Therefore the union system is not for him . And a strike does not give him sufficient freedom of action . Besides , he is a rural man ; he does not live in a compact community where the strike method succeeds . If you push any kind of a Southerner too far he sheds civilization , arms himself with fire and sword and steps back into the middle centuries , where he feels more at home , anyhow . He goes mad quickly , and then the only thing left to do is to kill him , or imprison him for life ? which , of course , must be done . But is it fair , in this age of enlightened humanity , when there is so much talk of " brotherhood " in the very region whence most of the oppression springs , to drive simple , helpless men to madness , and then make a legal virtue of killing them to protect society ? To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible memories and still more terrible grievances . Such things make brutes of men . We must punish them , but certainly we ought not to try to shine while we are doing it . To be obliged to hang a man because we have made him a murdering night rider ought to be a very chastening duty . These are some of the ways of the South , the kind of high roads the people there make thru difficulties within and without themselves . They might be better , more grammatical , for example , more thrifty , but after all they could be worse . If the Southerner is bad , he is not mean ; if he is improvident , he is not stingy ; if he is insolent , he is not hypocritical ; if he is sometimes a night rider , at least we may still be thankful that he is not a pharisee . And he is incapable of that self-assured superiority which inspires those otherwise highly civilized people of the North to nag and abuse an unfortunate people for forty years , never seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned always in the direction of their backdoor faults . To conquer your enemy in war , and then to spend the rest of your life picking at him has always seemed to me a curious but correct evidence of Northern nobility of spirit .
