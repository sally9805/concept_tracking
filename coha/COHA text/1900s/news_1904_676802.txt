txt Swinging at anchor off Tompkinsville are five of the finest fighting ships in the United States Navy  --  the battleships Kearsarge , Missouri , Maine , and Alabama and the fleet cruiser Minneapolis . In a day or two these will be joined by the battleships Illinois , Iowa , Massachusetts . and Texas , and the cruisers Columbia and Prairie , making one of the strongest aggregations of naval vessels that ever visited this port . The vanguard of the fleet which is being assembled to do honors on behalf of the American Navy at the launching of the battleship Connecticut at the navy yard next week , came into port unexpectedly , Yesterday morning . The vessels , all of which with the exception of the Minneapolis , are of the battleship squadron of the North Atlantic fleet , came direct from three weeks of target practice off Martha 's Vineyard . The Minneapolis is attached to the Atlantic Training . Squadron , and is the flagship of Rear Admiral Wise . Thousands journeyed down to Staten Island yesterday afternoon to have a look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command of Rear Admiral Barker , whose flag was flying from the battleship Kearsarge , has teen on an extended cruise in European waters this Summer . The ships of his command , however , showed little trace of their long voyage , and their fine appearance was generally commented upon by the crowds that made the trip to see them . The Staten Island ferry boats ran crowded all day with sightseers . Shortly before 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon the passengers on the ferries witnessed a piece of striking naval ceremony as the vessels paid their respects to the French cruiser Troude from Cape Breton , which passed up the harbor on her way to anchorage in the North River . The little Frenchman , a lone pigmy among many giants , saucily filed past the mammoth battleships firing an Admiral 's salute of fifteen guns as she went . The next moment , amid the cheers of thousands that thronged the shores and the ferry boats , the tricolor ifluttered to the foremast head of the mighty Kearsarge amid the deeper thunder of her heavier guns . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four battleships under Admiral Barker engaged in a.spirited fourhear race , in which the MiesourZ came ? cut winner by some nine hundred yards . The occa.aion was the , seini-annual - full power trial prescribed by naval regulations . Though the ships have not been docked for upwards of a year and their bottoms are foul they fell little short of the best speed on their trial trip , or seventeen knots . The speed they attained during the test was about sixteen and one-half knots . Admiral Barker , in speaking abut the trial , said that this was only an other evidence of the preparedness for an emer= geney at any time of the American Navy . Thaugh the engines of the battleships had not been overhauled for many months they worked without a hitch , though the presure was so high that the paint scaled off the smokestacks of the vessels as a IF suit of the heat during the four-hour test . As a result of the successful night attacks which have been such a feature of Japanese tactics at Port Arthur in the present war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target drill at Marthas Vineyard . The best results ever achieved were obtained on board some of Admiral Barker 's ships . On board the Kearsarge two pointers at night practice scored eight hits with as many shots , using the aft starboard 8-inch gun . One pointer on board the Iowa scored seven hits in eight shots , which is quite a remarkable record . Some novel experiments were made in tracing shells b ' means of a coat of linninant . The vessels of Admiral Barker 's fleet had a hard tima in the storm of Wednesday night and Thursday morning . The Missouri lost a man overboard . Something happened to the anchor of the Missouri , which began to drag , and Lieut . W. P. Scott , with a detachment of bluejackets , went to the forecastle head to heave in the anchor and get the vessel under way and started for shelter . Thirty men were on the forecastle when a mountain sea rolled over it . The men were scattered in all directions . It was found soon after that C. Young , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dressed in oilskins and heavy rubber boots , and was rapidly sinking when Louvri Hailing and Alexander Peters , both of them boatswain 's mates of the first class , threw themselves overboard and swam to his assistance . Before either of them could reach his side he had disappeared under the waves , and in the heavy sea it was only with the utmost difficulty that the two petty officers were saved . Mani , stories of the cruise in European waters were told on the Kearsarge yesterday . On the trip typhoid broke out on the Kearsarge . Lieut . James W. Clement and a seaman named Pendleton died from the disease . Five of the officers and several seamen were stricken but recovered . The best story brought home by the Kearsarge was one of international portent which was told by a boatswain 's mate , who said , that his name did not matter . The scene of his deep-sea yarn is laid at the Royal Gun Club in Lisbon . One evening , so the story went , the band of the Kearsarge gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading naval and military officers of Portugal . The King was there . Several officers of . the fleet had been invited to the reception at the club , and a number of petty officers and bluejackets were ordered there to give's/I exhibition , and some of the tars took their boxing gloves with them . The King , so the story went , after having witnessed a couple of sparring bouts , grew so enthusiastic that he put on the gloves himself with one of the , petty officers , ( name withheld . ) " Say , if you write anything about this , " the salt continued , " put it down good and strong that the King of Portugal is a dead game sport . The fellow from ' our ship handed him a few hard ones , - and he took his medicine without turning a hair , and said he was going to give the fellow who did the stunt a medal . No , he has n't sent it yet , but it may come with the ner ? man     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
