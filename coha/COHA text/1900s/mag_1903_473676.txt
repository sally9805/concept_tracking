I WAS speaking to Ferguson about the way he had degenerated since he came to New York . When I had known him in Slinterville he had been a person , but I had to confess to him that , in so far as I could judge from an observation which , to be sure , was superficial , he had come to be something no better than an incident . He did not deny it . It was true , he said , that he was hardly a person any more , but had become the attribute of an environment ; but he maintained that his state was not so very bad so long as he recognized and accepted it for what it was , and did not delude himself with the notion that it was really life . " There is life , " said Ferguson , " and there is work . There is a species of life of which work is an incident , and there is a species of work of which life is an incident . That phase of activity which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as I am concerned , under this second head . Of course , considered as life , it is ridiculous ; but considered as work , it has many agreeable alleviations . " " It is captivity , " said I. " Life in any big city is captivity . " " You may call it that , " said Ferguson . " A man who has to work for other men is more or less a captive while he is busy with his tasks , wherever it is that he puts his work in . To spend the day be ? tween plough-handles ( if there are such things now ) is captivity while it lasts , and a species of it to which a great many persons find more objections than to life in a big town . Life itself is captivity . We are captives because our spirits are shut up in bodies which have to be fed , and which have no wings to fly- with . The fact that our bodies happen to be in New York and not in Slinterville is n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . It is what we think about and what we do that make the difference , rather than where we are , and there is no doubt that multitudes of people find thought and action satisfac ? tory in New York . Yet there prevails a consciousness , wide-spread and regret ? ful , that life in great cities is not quite real life . Some observers even go so far as to insist that it is incorrigibly artificial . It suits most of us in a general way , be ? cause we also are considerably artificial . We get used to our kind of factory life . We do n't like to get up our own steam , but find it easier in the morning to throw in the clutch that connects our personal ma ? chine with a line of shafting that never ceases to turn . We need compulsion : we need to be driven ; to be in such close relations with a progressive community that we have to do our daily . stint if we are to keep our place . But back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of fuller freedom than we know , whereof the impulses come more from within and are shaped by greater considerations than immedi ? ate daily needs , and the hope of living somewhat more to our taste for a few years before we die . It is not a state of ease ? this real life that we dream of ? for we know that too much ease is no better for us than too much food or drink . It is not even a state of wealth , except that we are all prone to believe that if we had larger incomes , and were less strictly bound to the work of earning them , we could shape our lives more to our sat ? isfaction . It is a state in which we shall think higher and wiser thoughts ; shall love better , shall help more , shall work more efficiently for nobler ends , and be happier and better justified in doing so . The realization of a higher destiny is what we are after . Almost universally we city-dwellers seem haunted by a de ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modify the influences of man-made ma ? chinery and man-made streets and habi ? tations by the inspirations of nature . It troubles us that spring , year after year , should work its miracles in the fields and the woods and we not see them ; that year after year the cherry-trees and the apple-trees should blossom and we not be there . We arc missing too much ; far too much ! To watch the signs of the changing seasons is a consideration of things in general that is profoundly rest ? ful to us in our daily battle with details . Are there not compensations for our losses ? Do we want the earth ? Oh yes , there are highly important compensa ? tions , else the town would never keep us ; but we do want the earth , and our craving for it is a healthy appetite based on an instinctive appreciation of what , in the long-run , is good for us . We want real life , or at all events as large a share of it as we can get . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal includes fishing . Every spring these many years he has broken out of town and hied him to the North Woods to he eaten of black flies , and to angle for trout . That is a taste of the real thing for Brown ; the most real experi ? ence of all his twelvemonth , and it helps him to sustain the artificial comforts and duties of the rest of the year . Jones makes an analogous sortie in due season , and goes far north to kill salmon . Rob ? inson journeys westward after big game . Smith has a yacht . Thomson shoots ducks . Fessenden has a farm with real cows on it , and hens . Simpson has the strongest impulse to get back to nature of any of them . Simpson is a plumber by profession , and has some skill at car ? pentering . He can make a living and something to spare by those industries whenever he is content to stick to them . He works at them diligently from No ? vember to May . But he has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May comes he quits working at his trades for his living , and turns to his avocation and to the enjoyment of nature . Gathering in his surplus , and making a bundle of his belongings , out he goes onto the road with his sketch-book , and is a blessed tramp all summer long , wandering where he will , taking time as though all time were his , sketching and painting with as much pleasure as though he could do it well ; denying his stomach somewhat , but in ? dulging his soul , owning the earth , and enjoying the fulness of it . I am told that Simpson 's enjoyment of life is prodigious . There seem to be immense compensations about tramp life , for men who take to it are apt to stick to it in spite of its mani ? fold drawbacks and its obvious discom ? forts . Simpson follows it in a respectable and responsible fashion . He can do it , for he is a bachelor , indifferent to pecuniary acquisitions , and careless as to what kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Brown 's , Jones 's , Robin-son 's , Smith 's , Thomson 's , and Fessen den 's , is reversionary ? an impulse towards the occupations or conditions of a more primitive life . Our forebears fished , hunted , sailed , and farmed . If we go back far enough some of them were no ? mads . We seem to have inherited pro ? clivities for all their occupations , and long for them with recurrent yearnings , and pursue the faint shadows of them from time to time at great cost of time , labor , and money . Our quest is for a state of mind . We do n't go fishing after fish , nor hunting after meat , but because we want to think different thoughts and feel different sensations . We would cheat time , and swap illusions . One great charm about children is that life is always real to them , and they . do n't have these reversionary longings after something more genuine . The bird in the hand is the bird for them . The bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes time to go to the country they are ready : aye , they are eager . For any good thing the coun ? try may offer ? flowers , grass , trees , birds , water , ponies , pets ? they have lively an ? ticipations beforehand , and in due time appreciation to match . They take short views of life : that is one of their good traits . Awhile ago Blandina had a birth ? day . There are five birthdays in our family , and hers is the only one that is kept . Two of the five belong to grown ? up persons , who have reached a time of life when the sentiment about birthdays is , " Least said , soonest mended . " Two others of them fall in the Christmas holi ? days , and tend to be merged in the gen ? eral activities of that season . But Elan ? dina 's birthday is at a safe distance from any other festival , and suffers from no sort of blight . It is kept because she keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tending to all its details . Months ahead she blocked out her birthday party , and as the time came nearer , chose her girls . When it was time to send out invitations , Blandina knew exactly how many were to be sent , and where each one was to go . Such details as the complexion of the ice-cream and the species of the cakes were clear in her mind . Everything about that party , down to her father 's birthday offer ? ing , was predestined by herself . She had no misgivings about it ; no fears that the company would not have fun or that she would fail to find clue joy in her labors . Neither had she any doubts whether , on the whole , birthday parties were worth the trouble . Doubts seldom bother Blandina . She knows what she likes , and when her turn comes she ar ? ranges to get it . She also knows pretty definitely what her duties arc , and they are usually done . To make her birthday party was a comparatively easy labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course her party was a success . It is a comparatively simple labor to contrive success for persons of constant minds , who know what . they want , want what they can have , and are pleased when they get it . They are the people to whom life is always real . I hear no complaints from Jonas about the unreality of life . Jonas is away at school in the State of Massachusetts . Life with him goes so earnestly that it is only by a prodigious effort that he finds time during the week to scribble a letter in pencil to his mother . Re tells how Brampton of the Sixth form reached second base in the recent match while the guardian of that bag was in the air aspiring to the ball , and how the said guardian came down on Brampton 's hand and spiked it , to the grief of the school , which fears that Brampton 's injury may prejudice its chances in the coming important match with St. Kits . He speaks of his progress in learning ; cheerfully in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of that , and in the postscript he usually records : " I have busted my glasses . " But when they ore not busted , the life he sees through them is real . So as to Clementine . If there is saw ? dust in her doll she does not know it . Not but that she has sorrows . The day she came home to find that our dogling had gone to live permanently with the man who spaded up our back yard it seemed for a time that there was no balm in . Gilead . To say that the lost one had neither good sense nor good habits , that he was unteachable , unreliable , impossi ? ble , had no bearing on the case as Clem ? entine saw it , " 1 never even had a chance to say good-by to him , " she wail ? ed , and though when dinner came she ate her soup , her tears fell into it . No , life is no fiction to Clementine . It is a very real experience , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a satis ? factory experience , too , full of close oh ? servation , swift reflection , and conclusions that are always interesting , though not always sound . To see Clementine stand ? ing by her bicycle at the other end of the block , inspecting the babies who are out taking the air , is to see a live person abounding in contemporaneous human interest . One of the greatest shows of real life anywhere to be witnessed may be seen any fine Saturday in May in Central Park . Give the great town credit for its wonderful May parties . On one Satur ? day last May twenty thousand children , the papers said , revelled in the Park all day . Certainly in one great meadow there were thousands ; an incessant com ? pany , bright with color , careless , delight ? ful ,  - -  supervised , but not constrained , by hundreds of astute elders . Who has eyes to see will not ask for a sight more heal ? ing to the spirit than a Park meadow full of joyous children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the country , and the woods and streams , in their power to distract our minds from the machinery of living , and bring them back to the realities of life . If we keep the child in us alive , we get along , and children help us vastly in doing that . Most of them have an advantage over us grown-ups in not being much concerned with the ways-and-means problem , and with money-making . They realize , as we may not , the injunction to take no thought for the morrow . They repre ? sent the primitive human being to whose attitude towards life we have periodical impulses to revert . It is a truism that the attitude of a right-minded child tow ? ards life is the ideal attitude . Suppose all the world took it ? Suppose all the world lived by the day , doing its daily task , and leaving the future to shift for itself ? Would it get on worse than it does , provided each day 's work was done ? The future is the issue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us can change it much . The great mass of Earth 's people do actually live much as children live , doing daily what comes to hand , and leaving the final issue to Fate . The dog hides the hone he does not need to-day against to-morrow 's wants . The squirrel lays up a store of nuts against the winter . The bees gather honey all summer long and accumulate a surplus . Men do the like , and do well . They need far greater stores than bees or squirrels , and they gather them . But when it comes to shaping the distant future , how much of the thought taken to that end is beneficially effective ? Think of the Philippines , think of the Transvaal , think of the Southern negroes , think of all the trusts and commercial combinations that shrewd men have bent their brows and lost their sleep over ; think of enormous fortunes won , of vast power exercised by few men ? how much of all the scheming and planning of grown-up humans yields results that last beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratio be ? tween benefits and mischiefs ? The day 's work counts for good or bad accord ? ing to its wisdom and its spirit , but the plans men make to shape ultimate hu ? man destiny tend to be either super ? fluous or ineffectual .
