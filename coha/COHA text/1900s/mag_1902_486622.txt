SIR : The subject of lynching has a threefold interest  --  historical , etymological , and practical  --  and deserves to ne treated at length , but the material already collected by the present writer is so extensive that only an outline can be given here . There are various conjectures as to the origin of the term , no one of which as wholly satisfactory . In Naes 's Register for August 8 , 1835 , it was stated that the practice arose " many years ago " in Washington County , Pa , and that the party which held an impromptu trial of a poacher " proceeded to try him in due form , choosing one of their number , a farmer named Lynch , to be judge " 402 ) . Nothing further is known of this alleged farmer . Lynch law is also variously stated to have derived its name from James ( or Walter ) Lynch , Mayor ( or Warden ) of Galway in 1491 , from a man named Lynch who is said to have been sent to America in 1687-88 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynchburg , Va. , was named , and from Charles Lynch of Virginia ( a brother of John ) . Of these , the only one Whose claims deserve serious consideration is Charles Lynch . For a fuller and more accurate account of him than can elsewhere be found , the reader is referred to an article on " The Real Judge Lynch , " by T. W. Page , in the Atlantic Monthly for December , 1901 ( lxxxviii. 731-743 ) . Charles Lynch was born in 1736 , he was a justice of the peace both before and after the outbreak of the Revolutionary war , in 1780 he illegally fined and imprisoned certain Tories , in 1782 an act passed the Virginia Assembly holding him and others indemnified for suits brought on account of such illegal acts ( Va . Statutes , xi . 134-5 ) , and he died in 1796 . Unfortunately , Professor Page assumes but does not prove the connection between Charles Lynch and lynch law Other derivations of the term have been suggested . Meanwhile , what are the facts in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate this history from the earliest known appearance of the term down to 1850 . " In the year 1792 , there were many suits on the south side of James river , for inflicting Lynch 's law " 1817 , Judge S Roane , in W. Wirt 's Life of P Henry ( 1818 ) , p 372 In a note ( but whether written by Roane or by Wirt is uncertain ) we read ; " Thirty-rune lashes , inflicted without trial or law , on mere suspicion of guilt , which could notbe regularly proven This lawless practice , which , s einetimes by the order of a magisti ate , sometimes without , prevailed extensively in the upper counties on Jemesriver , took its name from the gentleman who set the first example of it " " Two years ago , a young Yankee , of the name of Williams , became the object of a malicious prosecution here , on suspicion of robbing a store Circumstantial evidence of the worst land only could be adduced , and he was , as is common in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudiced against him , as a Yankee , deputed four persons to inform him , that unless he quitted the town and state immediately , he should receive Lynch 's law , that is , a whipping in the woods He departed , with his wife and child , next day , on foot ; but m the woods , four miles from Princeton Indiana , they were overtaken by two men , armed with guns , dogs , and a whip , who said they came to whip him , unless he would confess and discover to them the stolen money , so that they might have it . He vainly expostulated with them , but , m consideration of his wife 's entreaties and cries , they remitted his sentence to thirteen lashes . . . This poor fellovr was of respectable parents at Berlin , in the state of New York . . . . He quitted the state , and returning , soon after , to pros cute his executioners , died at Evansville , before he had effected so desirable an object " 1819 , Nov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , pp 304 , 805 . On Deo 27 Faux met the widow of Williams ( p 326 ) . " Among the early settlers there was a way of trying causes , which may perhaps be new to you . No commentator has taken any notice of Lynch 's Law , which was once the lex Ion of the frontiers Its operation was as follows when a horse thief , a counterfeiter , or any other desperate vagabond , Infested a neighbourhood , evading justice by cunning , or by a strong arm , or by the number of his confederates , the citizens formed themselves into a ' regulating company , ' a kind of holy brotherhood , whose duty was to purge the community of its unrulymembers . Mounted , armed , and commanded by a leader , they proceeded to arrest such notorious offenders as were deemed fit subjects of exemplary justice ; their operations were generally carried on in the night Squire Birch , who was personated by one of the party , established his tribunal under a tree in the woods , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted , he was then tied to a tree , lashed without mercy , and ordered to leave the country within a given time , under pain of a see and visitation . Whenever a county became strong enough to enforce the laws , these high-handed doings ceased to be tolerated " 1828 , Judge 7 . Hall , Letters from the West , pp 291. 292 . " ' Lynch 's law ' We have heard , that capt Slick summoned his corps the other night , and obtained possession of a man with whose misdeeds they had become familiar , carried him to the prairie near town , and administered ' Lynch 's law ' upon him in fine style . He received about fit ty lashes-and was ordered to decamp The offence consisted in cheating at the gambling table " 1833 , Oct. 5 , Niles ' Register , xlv 87 This was at St Louis " He was , therefore , for tying the young Indian to a tree and giving him a sound lashing ; and was quite surprised at the burst of indignation which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is too often the administration of law on the frontier , ' Lynch 's law , ' as it is technically termed , in which the plaintiff is apt to be witness , jury , judge , and executioner , and the defendant to be convicted and punished on mere presumption . " 1835 , W Irving , Tour on the Prairies , pp. 41 , 42 . " In Natchez , negro criminals only are thus honoured-a ' coat of tar and feathers ' being applied to those white men who may require some sort of discipline not provided by the courts of justice . This last summary process of popular justice , or more properly excitement , termed Lynch 's law , ' I believe from its originator , is too much in vogue in this state " 1835 , J H Ingraham , The South-West , n 185 , 186 " Warwick , the murderer of Mr Fisk , . . was tried this week at Fayette Miss .

He was afterwards whipped until almost insensible to pain , and to restore his feeling senses , we understand , a large quantity of spirits of turpentine was poured upon him . . It is said that during the execution of judge Lynch 's sentence , the culprit frequently begged to be shot , but was told that such a death was too easy for him " 1835 , Aug. 8 , Niles ' Register , xlvm. 397 . " We mentioned above that P C Damewood had been discharged ; but no sooner was he out of the view of the court , than apprehending judge Lynch 's law , he put out in a hurry .

" 1835 , Aug. 22 , ibid. , xlviii 436 " I suppose you have heard of the presentation of a stout gallows to me , at 23 Brighton Street , Boston , by order of Judge Lynch It was destroyed by the city authorities . The slave States continue to be excessively agitated . They appear to have organized Vigilance Committees and Lynch Clubs in various places " 1835 , Sept. 17 , W. L Garrison , in Life ( 1885 ) , i. 519 . Garrison refers to the erection before his house of a gallows on the mght of Sept 10 , bearing " on the cross bar ... an inscription , Judge Lynch 's Law " - ( Boston Advertiser , Sept. 12 , p 2J4 . ) " Our village Kanawha Salines , W Va was thrown into considerable commotion on Friday morning last in consequence of the arrival of judge Lynch among us His business was soon ascertained , and by his authority four white men from Ohio , . were soon arrested and tried before 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several slaves to leave their masters , for some free State . . .

In consequence , Lovejoy was forced to remove his paper to Alton , Ill. , but not before the St. Louis mob gutted his printing-office . His subsequent mobbing to death in Alton is well known . " On this night it appears that some personal friend of Mr Brux who had been killed by Gigue ' , in company with several other individuals , feeling exaspeiated at the release of Giquel , and the judge who bad been the author of it , proceeded to the residence of judge BERMUDEZ , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe pusishment upon his person " 1833 , Oct 1 , zbid h. 69 .

" 1850 , Ames scan Rev , , xi . 460 . From this evidence and from other material in my possession , it appears that the original term was " Lynch 's law " ; that this was soon shortened to " Lynch ( or lynch ) law , " and then to " lynch " , that originally lynch law was a whipping or other personal chastisement , that lynch law originally obtained only in the border settlements , where the administration of justice either was or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lynch law , innocent persons were sometimes punished , and suits for damages were by no means unknown ; that , about 1830 , writers regarded the practice as on the wane and likely soon to disappear altogether ; that before about 1835 the victims of lynch law were generally Whites , occasionally Indians , but never negroes ; that soon after 1830 a revival of lynch law took place , due to the anti-slavery agitation , and the practice spread throughout the country ; that between 1830 and 1840 the term lynch underwent a change in meaning , and " to lynch " acquired the sense of to put to death ; that during the same period negroes were first lynched , that about 1835 we first hear of " Judge " Lynch ; and that in recent years lynching has been confined largely , but by no means wholly , to negroes in the South and West . It further appears that there is a direct historical connection between the killing of a negro in a highly civilized community in 1902 and the whipping of a white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illegal whippings of 1817 have led to the illegal burnings alive of 1902 . In short , the more civilised the country has become , the more brutal has been the punishment meted out under lynch law . It will be observed that in some of the extracts cited above , there is mention of lynchers under the name of " regulators . " Now the words " regulating , " " regulation , " and " regulator " were first employed in this country , so far as I am aware , at the time when the so-called " Regulators " came into existence in the back settlements of the Carolinas in 1768 . It has been asserted that lynch law derived its name from Lynch 's Creek , S C. , because at that place the practice of lynching began This derivation of the term has yet to be proved , but the following extracts show that there were at that period instances of lynch law , in its original meaning of a whipping , and that the Regulators held a meeting at Lynch 's Creek . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 25 . . The last Accounts from the Back Settlements , say , that the People called the RaeuLATorts were to have a Meeting at Lynch 's Creek , on last Friday , where it was expected noo would be assembled " 1768 , Aug. 22 , Boston Post Boy , No 575 , p 2 , ? 1 .. " Charlestown , ( South-Carolina ) Sept 12 The people called regulators have lately severely chastised one Lum , who is come to town ; bat we have not yet learnt the real cause of this severity to him " 1768 , Sept 26 ? Oct 3 Boston Chronicle , No. 42,1 381 ; 2 . " Charlestown South-Carolina , August 16 . The outrageous opposition lately offered to the civil authority near Mares Bluff on Pedee river , being at present a general subject of conversation , and by many attributed to the people called Regulators it may not be amiss to lay before the public the following information , viz That there are two parties so called , and the proceedings of the one is frequently confounded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honest party ) consists , in general , of people of good principles and property , who have assembled chiefly about the Cougarees , the Ridge , &c; professedly with the view of driving all horse thieves , with their harbourers , abettors and other vagabonds , from amongst them ; and that the other ( called the rogues party ) are a gang of banditti , or a numerous collection of outcast mullatoes , mustees and free negroes , all horse-thieves , 85c from the borders of Virginia and other northern colonies ( the very people whom the regulators would have expelled the province , or brought to justice ) and have taken up arms to carry on their villainy with impunity . The last accounts we have received of both are , that the former , on the 11th past , took one Charles Sparks of infamous character , on Pedee , and orderedl him to receive 100 lashes , and quit the province And of the latter , that an armed company of them , headed by one Gideon Gibson , on the 25th past , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were sent to bring one of the villains before a magistrate , and after a smart skirmish , wherein two of the canstable 's party were mortally wounded , and one shot through the shoulder , took the rest prisoners , whom he discharged , after ordering them 30 lashes each .

Obviously , we here have the thing itself , though not our now familiar term , and references to lynch law between 1768 and 1817 , under any name , are much to be desired . ALBERT MATTHEWS . BosToN , October 24 , 1902 THE SPANISH NEGOTIATIONS . To TraE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : As I read the correspondence between the United States and Spain ( Foreign Relations of the United States , Dec 5 , 1898 ) relating to the period immediately preceding our latest war , I notice two letters that have a very strong bearing on the case , but to which , in your splendid article " At the Bar of History , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , One , dated April 4 , 1898 , and written by Mr Day to Mr. Woodford , reads ( 02111,880 oinittendis ) : " We have received to-day from the Spanish Minister a copy of the manifesto of the autonomy government . . . It is not armistice . . It is simply an invitation to the insurgents to submit . . . . It need scarcely be pointed out that this is a very different thing from an offered armistic e . " The other letter , written by Senor Polo de Bernabfi to Mr. Sherman , reads , in part , thus " . . . that her Majesty the Queen Regent has given appropriate instructions to the general-in-chief of the army of Cuba , to the end that he shall concede an immediate suspension of hostilities for such a time as he shall deem prudential General Blanco . . . reserves to himself to determine the duration and other details " Your conclusion , drawn solely from the Queen 's manifesto proclaiming " immediate and unconditional suspension of hostilities , " would have been greatly modified had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your premises But , though your conclusion was defective for want of some relevant premises , ethically it is the only just conclusion  --  a conclusion not dependent on the infantile technicalities of diplomatic correspondence . Yet , in justice to those who , without tearful cant , openly advocate aggression , it should be admitted that , if by some unthinkable chance they can escape the " re-barbarizing " reaction of warfare , they will , in a measure , further evolution by killing off those whom they accuse of retarding it The more scrupulous , however , who are not inclined to be the scavengers of evolution , ought to be progress .

En . NATION , - THE FOOTBALL DEBAUCH . To THE EDITOR OF TAD NATION : SIR- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have ideals for higher education , to take a moment of meditation to ask themselves whether they propose , without protest and in despair , to permit the colleges and universities of the country to continue the annual football debauch ? That it is a debauch we used only present as testimony the columns of the daily press for the past month , including the notes on betting . But there are inside facts which we may well doubt whether many good people who lend their approval to the game are aware of , The brutality of the game may easily be seen , but the secret dishonesty ' which the excited rivalry leads to is not perhaps known to many outside college walls . What this rivalry is , how presidents of the smaller colleges are coming to regard the football teams as advertising adjuncts in the competition of student-getting , only those who are on the inside can know . I have myself heard a college president appeal to a football team , in an assembly of all the students , in terms that would lead one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning a certain game . Now what all this leads to is a disgraceful winking at anything to win . , It is bad enough for thoughtless students to fall into the temptation of playing men under false names without the knowledge of the college authorities ? I have known this to be done  --  but the debauch has not stopped at this . By the connivance of college authorities men are played who have only a fictitious connection with the college ; and the students of the college know that the college authorities aid and abet such action . In another college than the one referred to above I know the following facts to be true . A. student was matriculated at 4 P M. one day to play the next morning , when there was no intention on the student 's part of attending the college . He has other business . In this same game two other players had , by the college rules , absolutely forfeited their right to play . This seas known to the students , and yet not a member of the faculty was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about winning the game . I may add that the game was won , and mainly through the " great work " of the false student matriculated at 4 P. M. on the preceding day . The opposing team had consented to accept him because they themselves had been guilty of an irregularity . I have before me a letter received by a friend from a correspondent living near another college . It is proper for me to say that the specific instances I cite refer to small colleges . I suppose the larger institutions have not the same temptation of playing false students The college to which I now refer has hitherto prided itself on its high moral tone Its new President has the reputation of being a hustler for athletics , and by personal appeal he secured the return of B. for the football season . B. had already made arrangements to attend a professional school . The letter says . " B did matriculate and take a class or two , and will be paid enough for playing to get his outfit for winter , and to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , and she is satisfied provided he does not get hurt . He will go to ? as soon as the ball season is over , about the 25th , I believe . " Many are Quite disgusted with Dr. ? , Say he is doing so much about athletics , and letting down the dignity of the university in many ways , just to get a large number enrolled , and does not care whether they stay or not if he can make it appear in the catalogue that the number of students has increased under his presidency . " Unless I am greatly mistaken , this private note , which had no thought of publication , will touch many responsive chords . In this communication I have spoken only of the moral side of the football debauch . I have said nothing of the neglect of work caused thereby This is another story . Very respectfully , MEDIUS .
