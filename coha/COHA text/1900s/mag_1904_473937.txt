WE are accustomed to speak of the middle West as if there were an eastern West and a western West , and . somewhat subtilely , we are right . The appellation is at least not inappropriate ; it possesses spiritual , intellectual , and material truth ; there is in reality an eastern , a middle , and a western West . What is , for the occasion , most important to us is the fact that in the old Northwest Territory we End the part for which we are looking , the middle West , the edges of which are spattered with influences from the regions back of it and in front of it . It is not as western as it was ; it is not eastern , and its people are grateful for both blessings , as they would call them . It is western to the Bostonian and the New-Yorker , and it is far-eastern to the man of the plains . Its people are proud of certain inclinations toward the East , as they are of certain racy characteristics of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women look to the rising sun for its possessions of ripeness , while their adventurous children look to the setting sun for the promises of stirring life which are hidden under the entrancing , mysterious shadows . Its people , especially its women , love the virtues of the older parts of the land , and are proud of the descent which links them to the birthplaces of the nation ; they are also acquiring some of the vices , or , if this be too strong a phrase , some of the lack of the sterner virtues , found in the older parts . In this region of the country , which starts in at Buffalo , and runs through to the newest fringe along the Mississippi , the extremes are not the most awakening and stimulating to the visitor from the ? well , to please the centre , let us say the imitative East . In a topsy-turvy sort of way one goes from a hoary East at Buffalo , through ripened life in which the pulse of youth still stirs at Chicago and St. Paul , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joyous music of extreme youth and despotic equality . To the man from the older section the middle part of the West affords more entertainment than does the eastern West , because it differs far more from his own home in the most ancient of our geographical fringes ? that along the Atlantic seaboard . It is the punditory custom to say of this section when it is contrasted with New York , for example , that it is " more American , " just as it is customary to knit the brow over the selfsame phrase when the " far West " is contrasted with the remainder of the land , including this central cradle of modern Presidents . But no part of the country is more American than any other part ; the shouting , pistol - shooting , broncoriding nuisance on the plains ? a remnant of whose class is still on this side of the grave and outside of the jail ? is no more American , as he is no more pleasing , than is the most simian of New-Yorkers whose consuming love of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad manners in the dining-rooms of the Savoy or of Claridge 's on a Sunday night . When we get into the Middle West on our journey from the Atlantic , we see Americans most of whom have a great advantage over certain characteristic Eastern Americans . They start and go on through the race of life depending more on their own powers , and arrive at their goal not only self-reliant , but more kindly inclined toward the democracy which gives the free opportunity . At the same time one can not say that these typical lives of the Middle West are not also typical of the East . We have a social fringe as well as a geographical fringe , a great distinction being that the one is more bedraggled than the other ; and our social fringe on the so-called upper side of our national life gives a coloring to the fabric which makes what we call a " social atmosphere ! " This atmosphere is a bit clearer in the Middle West than it is in the metropolis , while democracy is more real , more impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more oppressive to thoee who do not . In the end all that one can say is that social distinctions are more abundant in one part of the country than in another , just as social exactions arc heavier in the city than they are in the country ; that there is more leisure in one part of the country than in another ; that there is a larger distribution both of capital and of culture in one part than in another ; that there is a more promiscuous democracy in one place than in another ; and that . the American who starts in the race of life without fortune and without powerful friends will get on best in that part of the land where there are , proportionally , fewer strivers and more numerous opportunities . What ought to be insisted upon by all Americans who believe that character is better than ancestry is that democracy does not consist alone in freedom of manners and in lack of social distinctions . While it is true that you feel your approach to the Far West while you are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more as you linger in it ? and linger in it you will if the hospitable people can keep you ? that the influence of the " old home " is gaining ground there . Yet , after all , the product is very different , and it is also very likeable . Let it be borne in mind that we are not now walking in the business streets of these Middle-Western cities and towns as if they were the one object of our tour , but that we are glancing at them while we hasten on to the resonant parts of the town ? that is , the parts known as " residential . " But business is a necessary evil , like most government , or as war used to be when the Christian spirit was trying to force its way into human society , and as it is still thought to be by some who regard Christianity as essentially feminine , not realizing or comprehending that which is the beautiful side of the masculine character . Ostensibly this is a land of business , the Middle West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enterprise show their black sides by filling the normally blue atmosphere with black smoke . Cleveland permits busiuess to push its way into Euclid Avenue . Chicago puts its oldest and its most conspicuous club where its genial midday habits may act as a preventive of nervous prostration , and other towns have other ways of showing , by involuntary cerebration , the need of laying the foundation in good , stiff gold mortar . In its material aspect , its marvellous growth , in the fruits of prescience , of courage , and of industrious toil , the Eastern man of long ago has vindicated his emigration to the West of his day . Here is a fat land , here are wealth and comfort , and a cultivation with a much larger measure of refinement in its leading social circles than is always to be found among some similar circles in the farther Eastern cities . Say what the East may , or the West does , it is here that one finds the largest sum or aggregate of the comforts , the conveniences , and the luxuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid hotels than Chicago ? I have not the intrepidity to assert that it does , ? but in a large measure these concentrated magnificenees and sublimated palaces of ease are the abidingplaces of Western men who have learned , by their own exertions and achievements , what a man ought to have if he pays enough for it . The electric street-railway starts out here and goes East when the old horse-car " plant " has been destroyed . The electric light does its police-work and illumines the pathway to the church and the lyceum in the Middle West before its beams ? if you can call them beams ? are thrown into Eastern purlieus . It may be that some Eastern town , or several Eastern towns , actually began the use of these comforts , but they were first general in the Middle West , as were the telephone and other devices which lighten , or completely perform , the necessary drudgeries of life . It is in this stretch of country that we find the most luxurious trains on the railroad , and here we find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " library " and from the scenery to the weary tasks of life . This Middle West , to continue for a moment on the materialistic side of the subject , is the natural distributer of the country , and it is in the way of vindicating the expectation of those whose conjectures are called prophecies that some day Chicagowill be bigger than New York . As railroads have driven river-freighting and river passenger service , except for pleasure , largely out of business , the cities called railroad centres have increased in population and productiveness . The market of the great commerce of the country is what we must call this Middle West . It is the centre of the enormous energies where exchange takes Place ; it is the centre of the largest commerce of the continent , the busy expanse where the products of the entire world arc bought , and where are sold the products of the land on which the food of this people and most of the food of Europe are grown and raised . It has its own great ocean , more crowded than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white sails , but with the white steam ( and the black smoke ) of commerce . Through these waters one may sail a thousand miles in ships which rival the transatlantic liners in their stores of luxury , and which equal the trains that delight the sense of success that is the rightful joy of these sons of American pioneers . There are not so many ships as trains in these days and in these parts . Only those go by water who do not care when they get to their journey 's end , to their summer 's outing in the " old home , " or to their sports among the lakes of Wisconsin or Minnesota , charged to the brim with fish , or to their shooting on the remoter plains or in the still farther mountains . Going to the " old home " for recreation is now a game that two can play at . The old home in the East still calls to the sons and daughters in the Middle West , but also is it true that the Middle West is old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there are annual summer and autumn gatherings there of the children who have gone back to the earliest shrine to dwell permanently amid the luxuries of the older civilization ? for it is the fashion to speak thus of an older civilization , although our country is still so new that it is really absurd to speak of one thing , or of one class in it , as older than any other American thing or American class . Possibly it would be more nearly correct to say that there are a little larger variety and a greater abundance in the East than in the inner parts of the country of opportunities which men and women of leisure enjoy . At all events , pilgrims now go to the domestic shrines in the Middle West for the annual vacation , even for the Thanksgiving turkey , in numbers that excel those of the pilgrims who used to go eastward on such occasions in the earlier day ? for the reason , perhaps , that the serious pioneers of that time were too busy to take - Vacations . It is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a doctor 's warning is too often the necessary condition precedent to a belated hunt after enjoyment . As one passes through these lakes , taking pleasure in the very wideness of their waters as well as in the panorama of scenery which is the distinctive feature of every considerable journey in this favored land , one sees not only the monuments of splendid energy , but , struggling through the necessary grime of successful work , of beneficent achievement . One sees too the joyful spirit of recreation , and the material evidences of that intense determination to make the most of the mind and spirit which is such a beautiful sign of the American , notably in the homes of the second and third and fourth generations of the English people who settled in the old Atlantic fringe in the seventeenth century . I am not losing sight of the mingling of other people with the children of our earliest immigrants . It is an agreeable mixture where there is a mixture , although the lines of social demarcation are visible even in the second generation . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up so large a part of the population of some of those States which , together , constituted that proud earliest general territory that once belonged to the Eastern colonies ( Eastern , Middle , and Southern , let me hasten to say , in order that I may avoid sectional controversy ) , and which was the first part of our land in which the freedom of all men was declared by law . The Germans have their quarter " across the Rhine , " or their streets , their newspapers , their language , and they make the beer which they drink in company with the Americana , who have learned to like some German customs . But the people of the second generation of Germans rather resent their inherited foreignness , an &; become more sternly American than those whose fathers and grandfathers were not only to the manner , but to the manor born . The Americanism of the young German who insists on the English tongue and who discontinues the paternal German newspaper is newer and shinier than the old nativity , smoothed as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the GermanAmerican , as he is called , is genuine ; and there are others , too . But , to return , the American , he of the American ancestry , has stamped himself , his social traits , his intellectual quality , his moving energy , his spiritual gifts , upon this Middle West . The institutions of this land are his . The New England prayer-meeting and the New England town meeting have moved onward through the Mohawk Valley and have settled down in Ohio and the other States in near neighborhood to the social graces of the Old South , with its dominating county , the two joined more closely by the propinquity of the New-Yorker and the Pennsylvanian , who were prone to the middle way , intellectually and politically as well as geographically . On these lakes ? to return once more ? we see the tall chimney , and the great oreship of seven or eight thousand tons burden , its heavy cargo loaded and trimmed at the ore-docks at Duluth in little more than a half-hour . We see the great masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houghton . We are rarely out of sight of trade and commerce . We arc rarely without a reminder of the enormous riches which are stored up in the earth under what used to be the forest where the old French explorer trod , and whose people were taught in spiritual things by the old French Jesuits , and whose cruelty and savagery were set aflame by French and English soldiers . " Gone is the forest primeval , " but suddenly we find , in the lands which the lumberman deserted because he thought that he had robbed them of all their commercial value , such stores of iron ore that the like has never been seen before ? ore that is shovelled out as the ooze of rivers is shovelled out by great dredges . We see , too , the school for the teaching of mining engineers rising above the copper-heaps at Houghton ; we see from the dock of the boat the monument at Cleveland a.constant reminder of the fervid patriotism of Garfield 's State ; we catch glimpses of other schools marked by the constant flagstaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strangest of all , or at least most original of all , the little summer community at St. Clair ? the " Little Venice , " with its villas built on the edge of the water , with canals for its pathways , while its people , who seem to live in bathing-clothes and in boats , fill the air with a constant splashing and laughter which must disturb the placid British demeanor of the near-by opposite Canadian shore . From these lakes we would know the land on which they border ? its enterprise , its vocations and its avocations , its mysterious and poetic history , punctuated here and there , as by the white fort at Mackinac ; but the country , like other countries , must be studied more closely than from the decks of a steamer . To the great joy and happiness and profit of this part of the land , remoteness from the seaboard seems ; to diminish social conventions . One finds both free manners and stiffness in the West , as in New England and in the Middle States ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abandon following the wedding , and a stiff formality which is made most apparent . in the observance of the social requirements of a funeral . To look at social life in a large or in a general way , we find first of all a more definite line drawn between the sexes . The women flock together and the men together more than is the case in the East . There is a distinction between the intellectual planes occupied by the two , a good deal to the advantage of the women . The Middle West , or that phase of it which we are now considering , has so long ceased to be frontier that it is only on the extreme verge , as your train moves off toward the Rocky Mountains , that you encounter crudities of a new land . Here we are in a land where fortunes are laid by , and where life takes on the aspect of social fruition , for the attainment of which , with certain spiritual and ethical increments , labor struggles . The average man has not yet entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still enamoured of activity ; and he is the exceptional individual of a community , perhaps , - too , he who is most intensely preoccupied by such gigantic business enterprises as are so obvious in the West , who fills a library with books or a gallery with fine pictures . He is therefore known in the community for his exceptional , perhaps eccentric , traits as he would not be known for them in the far East , where the man who is a collector of precious things of the mind or of the hand of the artist is rather common , and has taken a matter-of-fact sort of place among experts . It is probably the tendency of the Western community which possesses one of the book or picture collectors to exaggerate his accomplishments or achievements ; it seems so extraordinary to the man who is doing a hard day 's work in " progress " that a captain who is doing infinitely harder and more successful work should have collected an almost unique group of pictures of the Barbizon School , or of some other objects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am aiming to explain is shown by the fact that while Mr. Gladstone , the always hurried Mr. Gladstone , was an intelligent collector of ivories and of Wedgwood pottery , no one exclaimed over his knowledge and intelligence in that pastime . An interest in some achievements of aesthetic or of literary culture would naturally be presumed of Mr. Gladstone , or of any one of his place in an old country . His knowledge and his liking for certain beautiful symbols would not be regarded as a trait of character ; but in a newer community , where these symbols are not or have not been produced , but whither they have to be imported , anything like an expert knowledge of them , or like a real passion for them , on the part of a busy man , is naturally regarded as a trait of character . There are instances , however , which show that the intensity and the large free mind which make of a man the builder up of new and untrodden lands , and of enormous productive or distributive agencies , in turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repose in the great masterpieces of letters and of arts . And when we wonder if a genius of industry has really acquired a true taste for what he buys , let us measure the soul of such a man against the soul of some of the dealers and critics whose business it is to have and to hold the expert knowledge , and to bargain with it against the purse of the Fortunate . The man whose lofty and far-seeing imagination has led him to people deserts and the wilderness and to conquer nature for the material welfare of man is at least not necessarily the man of dwarfed or of blunted sensitiveness to the high thoughts and to the beautiful images which have been wrought by men of other gifts . There is more reason for expecting the flowers of art and letters to bloom in the nature of a mighty leader of the material progress of our time than to find them flourishing in the heart which is vitiated by the constant fumes of pleasure . The maker for men of new pathways through hitherto untried lands must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage with problems of a future which he could see only with the inspired vision of prophecy ; so is it that such as he is often readier to hear and to comprehend the loftiest speech and the noblest vision of the great masters of the past , or of the present. , than is he who may cultivate a taste for the sake of an occupation or of a trade . The social picture of the Middle West as a whole , however , presents the sexes occupying different intellectual and moral planes . There the woman is indisputably the mistress in all that makes for culture ? culture in letters and in art ; the man is king in his own active realm . Each is most deferential to the other in that other 's sphere . The books on the shelves , the pictures on the wall , are of the woman 's choice or selection . The man speaks of her literary or artistic tastes , usually of both combined , with the reverence that is due to her superior intellectual and spiritual gifts and acquirements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her . She is the instructed , and leads the intellectual movements of her town . The book club , the Dante club , the entertainer of the lecturing or the travelling lion , is the woman . Often the clergyman assists ; but she , through her influence over the surrendered man , has selected the clergyman , and on her he must count for the success of himself and of his work . She is , indeed , generous and gracious , and welcomes with joy every man who strays from business into the company of books and pictures , into homes which she has made . They call their houses homes , oftener than the Fast , and these homes bespeak the finer taste of the woman . Her education is likely to be more virile than that of her Eastern sisters , because it is acquired at schools and colleges where coeducation of the sexes is the rule . It is like in essence , very different in kind and in degree , to the mental training of the soft-voiced women of the Old South , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the more ancient classics , to their fathers . Her domination in the home and her primacy in the higher life , as we are inclined to call it , are seen not only in the more obvious social affairs , but in the element of seriousness which marks most life in this midway of the country . As the man pays her high respect by recognizing her superiority in the kingdom of taste , of feeling , of the imagination , of the knowledge which collies from books , she returns his deference by venerating him as the active ruler of the world of affairs . When the man in the Middle West is ready to seek intellectual repose from the business in which he has laid up , or is laying up , his fortune , he is likely to go into politics . Whether he is business man or politician , she who is queen at home is subject when the king is at his desk or in the capital . She is the cheering partner of his toils , who knows nothing of the hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lost in the glory of his successes . To the hard and critical world he may be as bad as politicians can be , but she is content to accept him at his own valuation , and to feel in him , or his career , the confidence which he VOL . CIX. ? No. 649 . ? Sfeels for her as mistress of the home . If he is obedient to her conception of all that constitutes the duty of husband , son , father , and brother , no evil whisper can disturb her faith in him . The model man at home is safe , with his womenfolk , against all the slanders and assaults of rival partisans or of competitors without . This attitude was well expressed by a young woman student in one of the great coeducation universities of the West . She was asked to write her view of Thomas Jefferson , and this was her response : " Thomas Jefferson was timid and sly , but lovely in his family . " She could judge him as one of the " world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if she had been , the last part of her description alone would have sufficed . This Middle West is the heart of the country . It has its faults , but it has many and noble virtues . Like most middle things , it produces the average . It is safe and wholesome ; if it were not , the whole body would be corrupt . Probably in political things we may wish an improvement , but politics is one of the crude occupations of men , and here , as elsewhere , we must judge of men and women by other tests . Judged by those tests , the Middle West is a fine tribute to our race and to democracy . It is the custom to read democracy through the spectacles of the man who gathers news to sell over his counter , and who wants the largest possible return for his outlay . Therefore we hear that democracy is vulgar ; but when that charge is made , the one who makes it really means that democracy is not reticent , ? that its daily press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who walk out of our ordinary paths , and that it spreads abroad the more obnoxious qualities of the class whose members in other countries ? in France especially ? are concealed behind the screen of manners , of traditions , which afford a seclusion dear to an old and established society , but which are not desired by those abounding with the joy of the new country conquered , and with the love of their fellows who have fought up . or who are fighting up , with them . No one need feel shame of democracy at the very heart of the very heart of our country .
