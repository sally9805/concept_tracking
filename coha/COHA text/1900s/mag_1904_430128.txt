The oldest of all existing institutions is the family . In some form or other , the union of father and mother and child must have existed from the earliest dawn of human life . The study of the marriage relation , therefore , carries us back to a past that is ancient beyond all reckoning . Much has been written on this subject , though students have usually limited their researches to some particular phase of the question or to some particular period of its development . But a work has lately appeared that in a measure deals with the whole history of this institution , and carries the discussion down to the immediate present . It is true , the author 's purpose is to trace the history of marriage in the three homes of the AngloSaxon race only ; but to accomplish this he has been compelled to make investigations and to include data which throw a flood of light on the institution elsewhere . The author , Professor George Elliott Howard , is at present professorial lecturer in the University of Chicago . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each , the result of years of continuous labor . The general reader will peruse the text with sustained interest ; he will experience little difficulty in following the author 's argument or in appreciating the force and significance of his conclusions . The scholar will find in the numerous foot-notes , the extensive bibliography , and the carefully executed index , many additional points of excellence . What first impresses the reader is the vastness of the field which the author has aimed to cover , the wide reading and the extensive research that the task has demanded , and the mass of materials that have to be studied and criticized . But on closer examination one is  | still more impressed with the masterly manner in which this variety of materials is handled . In studying a question such as this , it is difficult to get entirely away from the view-point of our social surroundings . In this respect Professor Howard has succeeded admirably ; his treatment is purely scientific . He has studied marriage , not as an institution established by religious authority , but as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work with a study of the primitive family . The doctrine that it originated in a patriarchal aggregation is soon disposed of . More attention is given to the theory that in the beginning the mother was the centre and ruler of the family ; but this is also rejected . The author takes his stand with those who hold to the theory of original pairing . Far back in time , then , there was the free choice of the man , the free consent of the woman . ' This conclusion , however , gives rise to a multitude of problems , to some of which the author seems to provide quite satisfactory solutions ; but some remain and perhaps always will remain unsolved , as they take us back into times and conditions of men that were not productive of records . As culture advanced , however , and the idea of property arose , the status of woman was appreciably lowered . She became a thing of value which was often stolen and sometimes bought . It is wife-purchase that Professor Howard finds in the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first six centuries of Anglo-Saxon history , wifepurchase gives place to self-betrothal and selfmarriage . When the twelfth century closes , we have in England a marriage that is essentially a contract merely . It is not ecclesiastical , for the church does not officiate ; it is not civil , for the state does not intervene ; it is wholly private . And yet , all through the middle ages forces were operating that tended to make marriage an affair of the church . How the priest first began to participate in the nuptial ceremony by benedictions , bride-masses , and other liturgical acts , is told clearly and fully . By the thirteenth century the development is completed . Marriage is now held to be a sacrament ; a priest officiates , and the church controls . A great system of matrimonial law is being perfected by the ecclesiastical jurists : not only does the church solemnize nuptials , it also presumes to say who may and who may not enter into marriage and under what circumstances the bond may be dissolved . Students who are in the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theological standpoint will find much food for reflection in the author 's presentation of the attitude assumed by the medieval church toward these problems . Also interesting is his . review of the matrimonial theories held by the Protestant reformers . But he does not find that the ideas of the sixteenth century affected the , institution in England to any appreciable extent before the nineteenth century . In the eyes of the law , English marriage is at present what it was in the beginning , a simple conLoad ; but the state has succeeded in imposing upon it the condition of publicity ? a task which the church first attempted but failed to accomplish . ' It will no doubt surprise many of Professor Howard 's readers to learn that ecclesiastical marriages in England are as recent as the thirteenth century . Perhaps it may also surprise them to learn that among the New England Puritans marriage was wholly a civil institution at which a magistrate must and a clergyman must not officiate . The author also finds that while in theory the Southern colonists looked on marriage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice they frequently permitted the local magistrates to exercise authority in these matters , as priests and ecclesiastical courts were generally wanting . Matrimonial legislation in the United States since the Revolution is treated briefly and yet quite exhaustively . Statutes and court-decisions in great numbers have been examined and compared , and an extensive analysis is presented which gives a full view of the practice in the different states with their similarities , differences , anomalies and peculiarities , such as is probably found in no other work . The value of Professor Howard 's work lies not only in his excellent presentation of a large subject , in his sane criticism of earlier writers , or in his collection of data for the sociologist and the practical reformer ; he has added a closing chapter in which he discusses the presentday problems that grow out of the family relation , and makes numerous suggestions looking toward their solution . The chief of these is divorce . As there is a necessary connection between marriage and separation , their histories are told in parallel chapters . The author finds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband . In general , dissolution of marriage was looked on as a wholly private matter over which the State exercised little or no control . Even after Christianity had become dominant in Southern Europe , and a new theory of marriage had begun to prevail , the authorities permitted divorces much as of old . During the middle ages , divorces became practically unknown ; the theory came to be held that a valid marriage could not be dis- solved , but the church had multiplied the conditions necessary to such a union , and any one who tired of a spouse could readily find some reason why his marriage should be annulled . In the modern practice the author finds much to commend and much to condemn . Though his attitude toward the question is a liberal one , he deplores the frequency of dissolved unions . But , as he views it , divorce is not necessarily an evil , it is simply the cure for bad marriages . This discussion shows that Professor Howard 's studies have not bereft him of a healthy idealism . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy for the much-discussed divorce evil . The solution of the problem he believes lies not so much in legislation as in education . If there is to be salvation it must come though the vitalizing regenerative power of a more efficient moral , physical and social training of the young . ' And yet , the legislator can do much by providing the proper legal environment . ' Uniform marriage and divorce laws , more general publicity , more dignity in the civil ceremony , are some of the reforms that he urges . As marriage is a civil institution , Professor Howard believes that all marriages should be solemnized by a magistrate ; should the parties desire it , a clergyman might be asked to officiate later . But realizing the practical difficulties that such a proposal would encounter , the author suggests instead that a registrar be appointed for each locality , whose duty it should be to license and register all marriages solemnized within his district . to solemnize marriages when a civil ceremony is desired , and to witness all nuptial ceremonies performed by a clergyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space does not permit us to discuss . As to the future of the family , Professor Howard is seemingly very optimistic . The situation is not so bad as we are led to imagine ; there is no cause for despair . But after one has followed the story as the author tells it , one can hardly repress the question , Is this optimism justified ? Surely it is more difficult to enter into the matrimonial state to-day than in centuries past ; yet it would seem from the author 's own statistics that the practice of divorce grows continually at an alarming rate . Not until the sociologist shall have traced the history of a sufficient number of divorced families back to the period of betrothal , shall we know to what extent divorces can be attributed to bad or thoughtless marriages . Meanwhile Professor Howard 's work will be read and studied with increasing appreciation , not only by the lover of history but also by the devotee of social reform .  |               @ @ @ @ @ @
