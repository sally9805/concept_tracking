txt A " Conference on Trusts " that will continue every evening this week , and in the course of which the question in all its phases will be discussed , opened last night under the auspices of the People 's Institute , in the hall of Cooper Union , which was filled to the doors . " The Ethical Basis of Industrial Organization " was the particular phase before the meeting , and it was dealt with by President WV . H. P. Faunce of Brown University . the Rev. Dr. R. Heber Newton , and Jdhn J. Foote . A feature of the evening was the reading of his recently published poem , " The End of the Century , " by Edwin Markham , who in response to urgent demand , also recited his famous verses , " The Man with the Hoe . " " The End of the Century . " which has been published in Lippincott 's Magazine , was regarded as peculiarly appropriate to the occasion and evoked prolonged applause . It was as fetilows : THE END OF THE CENTURY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is descending from Eternity . And all things , good and evil . build the road . Yea , down in the thick of things , the men of greed Are thumping the inhospitable clay . By wondrous Wits the men without the Dream , Led onward by a something unawares , Are laying the foundations of the Dream , The Kingdom of Fraternity foretold . Be still . 0 Soul , the Future is secure ! For one is knocklag at the gate of life , The Social Man , the ruler of the sphere . And in his brain he bears the Golden Law , And in his heart a music  --  in his feet The free unselfish service of the State . Hasten , 0 men , make ready with glad hands Chapels of worship , chambers of repose , Spread the white table of Fraternity , The high joy falters ell the Great Guest comes . ? Copyright , Edwin Markham . Mr. Markham prefaced the recitation of " The Man with the Hoe " by remarking : " I do not need to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppression , ntYpe that , I think , will some day disappear om the earth . " President Faunee 's address was an argument for true fraternity among men . He took as representative of the body social the man with the hoe , the man with the pen , the man with the purse , and the man with the idea . PRESIDENT FAUNCE 'S ADDRESS . " The man with the hoe , " said he , " has been immortalized by Millet . Is the man in the picture thus ungainly and repulsive be- , cause of forced labor or because he is incapable of doing any other kind of labor ? We can not fully interpret Millet 's thought , but this we do know : that the value of the hoe depends on the man behind it . Hoeing must always be done , by somebody , but it must be done by a man who knows how other 's have done their hoeing . " One of the most cheering signs of the times is the interest men are taking in the individual toiler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road when it should have placed fair homes and good schools at the beginning . " The . man with the pen , President Faunce pointed out , is just as great a toiler as the man with the hoe . The term " workingman " has no me-aning if it is applied to the French tiller of the soil and refused to Sir Walter Scott , Robert Louis Stevenson , John Ruskin , Lincoln , Emerson , and Whittier . The term applies with equal force to the man with the pen in the newspaper office and the counting house . The man with the purse , said the speaker , must perforce be either a blessing or a curse . If he hoards his wealth in mere social indifference he is a mere parasite on the community . If he uses it as the means of production he is a blessing to his fellows . " Next we have the man with an idea , " he went on . " A man 's work is valuable in proportion as it mixed with ideas . Nothing in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor simply damages the raw material and defaces the beauty of the world . " The purse and hoe and pen may work together in unity . We are realizing to-day not simply independence , but interdependence . Brotherhood does not mean physical or mental or social or financial equality . Indeed , the power of the social organism lies in the variety of the units composing it . The real equality we desire is , the equality of opportunity , so that every man born into the world shall have a chance for self-realization . An opportunity to realize one 's highest and noblest self  --  this is the real equality that the world is seeking . " DR . HEBER NEWTON 'S PAPER . Dr. Heber Newton was unable to be present , but sent his paper . which was read by Charles Sprague Smith . It was an argument for the regulation and control of trusts by the State . " The mediaeval system of regulation of the business world by great guilds . " wrote Dr. Newton , " broke down by its own weight . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the nineteenth century , of pure individualism , of almost unchecked competition . This in turn has been breaking down of its own weight . Its evils have been so many and so grave that some remedy has become necessary . " In the natural movement of society that remedy is appearing as a return to concentration and organization and regulation of the business world . Labor organizes . Capital organizes . Capital is organizing faster and further than labor . Within a few years we have the monster developments of the corporation and the trust , as we see them on every hand . This view of the development of the trust indicates a substantial service to be rendered by this organization of capital . Such service iq plain to every thoughtful person . The evils of competition are done away with . The regulation of production is assured . There need not be hereafter oversupply , as we call it , followed by the clogging of the industrial system , stagnation , panic , hard times , &c.; Great economies are possible , higher skill in management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DANGERS OF TRUSTS . " On the other hand , great dangers attend this development , as great dangers have attended the development of earlier systems . These dangers are plain enough to every thoughtful man . Unless labor can organize on the same gigantic scale , it will be more at the mercy of capital than ever . Hosts of men will be thrown out of employment before other avenues of work are provided for them . The market being in control of few hands , prices can be forced up , at least temporarily . Taxation beyond the dream of the past can be laid by private hands upon the whole community , the entire Nation . The enormous power of aggregated capital can corrupt and debauch our City Councils , our Legislatures , and our Congress . A government within a government is rowing In our midst , irresponsible , autocratic , well-nigh omnipotent  --  anti , it must be said , too often conscienceless . " What a revelation of the spirit of our modern corporation has been given within the past few days , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year and for the present year . A company expecting to make from $40,000,000 to $50,000,000 in the current year on a capital of $25,000,000 ? to what extent water we do not know  --  asking the State to taxe the whole nation , under the guise of a tariff , that it may be able to increase the wages of its workingmen ! " No more revolting story is told in the history of the industrial world than the - tale of the Standard Oil Trust , as Henry D. Lloyd has given it . ON THE REMEDIES . " What are the remedies ? Plainly , in the first place , publicity . We can know the facts concerning these corporations  --  how to tax them justly , how to make their capitalization honest . Regulation- Rill follow from publicity . That regulation and control must be vigorously assumed by the State . The end of that control is not to break down the high organization of capital , but to safeguard it from its gwn greed and rapacity , to humanize it and ultimately to socialize it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views were shared by the audience . John J. Cook insisted upon the necessity of placing ' industry upon a moral basis which would also be a scientific basis , and as a result of which the producers of wealth would get a fair share of it .
