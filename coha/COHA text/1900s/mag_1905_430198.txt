 |p1057  started to explain this extraordinary inaction on the part of the Ministerial authorities . One theory is that the Government are determined to make an early appeal to the country by a General Election and meantime do not care in the least about anything going on in the present House of Commons , and are therefore quite willing to give their supporters as easy a time as possible in the interval . Another theory maintained by many on the Opposition side is that Mr. Balfour and his colleagues desire to show their tatter contempt for the Liberals and seceding Tories by declining to take any notice whatever of the hostile resolutions which the Opposition may think fit to bring forward . Then again comes the suggestion , also from the Opposition side , that the Government have been reduced to utter despair ; that they know the next General Election can only end in their complete defeat , and that meanwhile it would be useless to worry themselves or their followers by any preliminary and futile trials of strength . It is certainly an entire novelty for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated by the Government as a pack of children might be treated by their parents who do not think it worth while to interfere with any game of romps which does not involve any actual harm or danger to themselves or others . Mr. Balfour is certainly a man endowed with a large gift of humor , and I can hardly doubt that , whatever may be his underlying policy , he must often find a refreshing amusement in the sight of the great representative assembly thus making preparation for battle again and again and winning a nominal victory for the mere reason that no enemy came into the field to oppose them . Meanwhile the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Mr. Austen Chamberlain , has brought in his Budget . The principal ingredients of his financial scheme are that there is to be a slight reduction in the duty on tea and , contrary to general expectation , no reduction of the income tax . This latter proposal has , of course , created great dissatisfaction almost everywhere , while the reduction of the tea duty is only a benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not make the great bulk of a Tory Government 's supporters . Mr. Austen Chamberlain has been severely criticised even by some of his political supporters , and most of his newspaper critics have disparaged not only his scheme , but also his own manner of expounding it to the House . Without committing myself to any criticism as to the nature of the scheme itself or to any expression of my own views as to what a heaven-born Chancellor of the Exchequer might have done , I may venture to say that I thought Mr. Austen Chamberlain 's speech was on the whole a well reasoned and a gracefully expressed piece of argument . I have a higher opinion of the younger Chamberlain 's intelligence and parliamentary capacity than seeems to be entertained even among the majority of his own supporters , and my readers will easily understand that I am not led to my estimate of him by any sympathy with his political opinions . He had a very difficult part to accomplish in preparing a financial statement under such conditions of uncertainty and confusion as those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he made out an ingenious case for the propositions which he had to offer to the House of Commons . The style of the speech , too , seems to me to have been in good parliamentary form and to have been that of an educated and capable man well qualified to win a distinguished position in the House of Commons . Punch has an amusing and a suggestive cartoon illustrating the relative positions of the father and the son in the present political crisis . Austen , the son , is pictured as a jockey who has just ridden for the Budget Stakes on the horse " Surplus , " in which the other competing horse , " Trade Depression , " has been left nowhere . The winning jockey is met by Joseph , the father , who congratulates Austen on having done so well , but adds that " it would have suited your old dad 's book better if the other horse had won . " Joseph , as my American readers will remember , has always been contending of late that England 's existing financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans who are acquainted with London must have joined in the general regret felt here at the death of  |p1058  Sir Francis Jeune , President of the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division of the English law courts . Sir Francis Jeune had shortly before his death been created Lord St. Helier , when , owing to his increasing ill health , he resigned his official position . Sir Francis Jeune had had a brilliant career at the bar and won added distinction by his great services on the bench of justice . He was a man of high education . much travel and great love for letters and art , was very popular in society and most hospitable in his home . His wife , Lady St. Helier , who will ever be best remembered as Lady Jeune , was one of the most delightful hostesses in London . For many years both before and since her marriage to her late husband ? she was a widow when she married him ? she had maintained a salon in London which would have done credit in every sense to the most distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the salon was a characteristic French institution . Every one distinguished in politics , science , letters or art was sure to be met with at Lady Jeune 's home during the social seasons . Her occupation was not , however , merely that of keeping up a salon and entertaining guests , for she devoted a great part of her life to works of charity and beneficence , to the care of the sick and the poor , to the education of children in the humbler walks of life and to the spread of education among the lowly born . I can speak with some confidence as to the part which Lady Jeune held in the life of London , for I have had the honor of her personal friendship , as I had that of her late husband during many years . The deepest sympathy of countless friends here and abroad is with Lady Jeune in her recent afflictions . For the death of her loved husband was not her only recent calamity . It had been preceded not long before by the death of their dear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now call her , Lady St. Helier , has two daughters living , step-daughters of Lord St. Helier , one of whom is married to the Right Honorable St. John Broderick , Secretary of State for India , and the other to Mr. Allhusen , a member of the House of Commons . Literature has given us some welcome volumes lately . One of these is the third volume of Mr. Herbert Paul 's work , " A History of Modern England , " published by Messrs . Macmillan &; Co . Mr. Herbert Paul is one of the most distinguished among the rising English men of letters at present . He is all the better qualified for his task as historian because of his training in the world of journalism and also in the world of practical politics . He was for many years a writer of leading articles on the Daily News , and is still a contributor to many journals and reviews , and he was for some time a member of the House of Commons . In that House he was rapidly rising to distinction and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political principles to the passion of Imperialism which was for the time sweeping through the country . He is sure , if his inclinations still lead him that way , to find a seat again in Parliament before long and to win new success there . He writes a brilliant style , is a master of telling phrases , a close student of history and a keen , independent critic of public men and political parties . The " History of Modern England " which Mr. Paul gives to the world has to do with events  |p1059  occurring since the late Queen Victoria came to the throne , and it shows at once a most profound and accurate study of the events which belong to all preceding periods of the national development . Mr. Paul is very careful and precise in his statement of facts , and in this sense might well satisfy even the driest and most prosaic student of historical narrative . But he has many qualities which are not usually to be found in association with the faculty for a faithful and rigid record of facts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in portraiture , and the figures which he describes in his pages present themselves to the mind of the reader as living realities . Then he is always the literary man as well as the politician ; he can appreciate to the full the many and peculiar developments of literature which took place during his period of modern history and , in fact , all the various influences which contribute to the character of that era are shown in his volumes as they blend into a harmonious whole . There are two other volumes to be issued before the work comes to its close , and I can not doubt that the series will find its reading public in the United States as well as in the British Empire . " The Bell and the Arrow " ( T. Werner Laurie , publisher ) is the title of a novel ? " an English love story " as it is described by its authoress , Nora Hopper ? Mrs. Hugh Chesson . Nora Hopper ? such was her maiden name ? has made her literary reputation thus far and it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " The Bell and the Arrow " appears to be her first novel , altho she has , I believe , written short stories for various literary magazines . She has indeed been a very prolific writer , and altho she is still a young woman , can look back upon a long and successful literary career . She is the wife of Hugh Chesson , himself a literary man of some distinction , son of Frederick W. Chesson , whose name will be still remembered by some of my older readers in the United States as that of one who showed himself a devoted friend of the cause represented by the North during your great Civil War at a time when that cause had not too many friends in England . The elder Chesson and I were associated then in the editorial work of The Morning Star , the London daily newspaper representing the principles of John Bright and Richard Cobden , a newspaper which was the steady advocate of the Northern side in that great crisis . " The Bell and the Arrow " is a very fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original not only in its conception , but in its treatment . It creates romance out of what might be regarded as the ordinary influences of everyday life and evokes thrilling interest from commonplace elements . It is all through a study of human character rather than of incident , but every touch of human character becomes an important incident for the reader . Everything in the story ends very much as it might have been expected to end in the ordinary course of things , and yet we know when the story is done that a change has taken place in the feelings and even in the lives of the principal characters and that new possibilities have been opened up for these four personages of the life-drama set out in this novel .
