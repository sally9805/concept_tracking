txt Not Mr. Fiske 's " Devil . " In a dispatch from Philadelphia , published . in thITE T1MES this , morning , It is stated that I am to give a production of " The Devil " in that city on Monday night . This evidently is inspired by the gentleman who is busily engaged in multiplying " Devils " of a German origin on the strength of the success of Mr. George Alliss in the original Hungarian Play . Will you kindly publish the fact that there is no foundation whatever for this announcement 7 Owing to the absence of any copyright agreement between Hungary and this country , I am unable to protect my rights against unauthorized Teutonic versions of " Az Or ( " The Devil , " ) but I can at least protect the public by refusing to send out inferior substitute companies In the play . I have not , and I shall not , have any connection with any production of the play except that in which Mr. Armes is now appearing at the Belasco Theatre .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
