txt Pavements Carelessly Replaced . The causes of the complaints of the condition of our street pavements may be as numerous as the complaints , but as I had occasion lately to observe some work on East Twenty-seventh Street , where the pavement was being restored after having been dug up for the laying of electric conduits , it seems to me that the carelessness with which that work was done ( as probably in thousands of other instances ) may be the chief cause of our general complaints . East Twenty-seventh Street is paved with asphalt blocks laid on a thick bed of concrete , which is as it should be . This concrete bed was , of course , cut through to dig the trench for the conduits , but when the work of restoring the pavement was being done , it seemed to be done with undue haste , and a closer inspection revealed the fact that the paving blocks ware being laid on a sand bed instead of concrete . Now , when this work has been finished less than a week , depressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first rainstorm it will be a great danger for a heavy wagon to pass over that strip of pavement . Whoever is responsible for the work should be required to do it properly , and if proper inspection were given when such work is being done , I feel certain our streets would not be in such deplorable condition .
