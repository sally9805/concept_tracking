txt Likes the Times 's Baseball Stories . Before the season comes to a close I wish to write a word of commendation of Mr. Aulicies baseball reports . As to their technical accuracy I can not Judge , for I am not a fan and have not seen the Giants play this season . But considered solely for their merit as humorous writings , Mr. Aulick displays possibilities which , it seems to me , will some day entitle him to rank in the same class with George Ade and Mr. Dooley . Ills resource and versatility seem to be without limitation and his comparisons and side thrusts are amazingly clever . Ile has a large group of admirers In our busy town who hope that when the baseball season Is over you will turn him loose " on some line of work where he will not be restricted as he Is by the technicalities of baseball , but where his evident accomplishments will have free scope . NOT-A-FAN.                   @ @
