txt THE STORY OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY SCIENCE But to deny catastrophism was to suggest a revolution in current thought . Needless to say such revolution could not be effected without a long contest . For a score of years the matter was argued pro and con , often with most unscientific ardor . A mere outline of the controversy would fill a volume ; yet the essential facts with which Lyell at last established his proposition , in its bearings on the organic world , may be epitomized in few words . The evidence which seems to tell of past revolutions is the apparently sudden change of fossils from one stratum to another of the rocks . But Lyell showed that this change is not always complete . Some species live on from one alleged epoch into the next . By no means all the contemporaries of the mammoth are extinct , and numerous marine forms vastly more ancient still have living representatives . Moreover , the blanks between strata in any particular vertical series are amply filled in with records in the form of thick strata in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silurian rocks are directly overlaid by the coal measures ; but elsewhere this sudden break is filled in with the Devonian rocks that tell of a great " age of fishes . " So commonly are breaks in the strata in one region filled up in another , that we are forced to conclude that the record shown by any single vertical series is of but local significance ? telling , perhaps , of a time when that particular sea-bed oscillated above the water-line , and so ceased to receive sediment until some future age when it had oscillated back again . But if this be the real significance of the seemingly sudden change from stratum to stratum , then the whole case for catastrophism is hopelessly lost ; for // such breaks in the strata furnish the only suggestion geology can offer of sudden and catastrophic changes of wide extent . When evidence from widely separated regions is gathered , said Lyell , it becomes clear that the numberless species that have been exterminated in the past have died out one by one , just as individuals of a species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations have passed away , it has been not by instantaneous extermination , but by the elimination of a species now here , now there , much as one generation succeeds another in the life history of any single species . The causes which have brought about such gradual exterminations , and in the long lapse of ages have resulted in rotations of population , are the same natural causes that are still in operation . Species have died out in the past as they are dying out in the present , under influence of changed 101 i THE STORY OF NINETEENT II-CENTURY SCIENCE surroundings , such as altered climate , or the migration into their territory of more masterful species . Past and present causes are one ? natural law is changeless and eternal . Such was the essence of the IIuttonian doctrine , which Lyell adopted and extended , and with which his name will always be associated . Largely through his efforts , though of course not without the aid of many other workers after a time , this idea ? the doctrine of uniformitarianism , it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geologic world not long after the middle of our century . The catastrophists , after clinging madly to their phantom for a generation , at last capitulated without terms : the old heresy became the new orthodoxy , and the way was paved for a fresh controversy . ry The fresh controversy followed quite as a matter of course . For the idea of catastrophism had not concerned the destruction of species merely , but their introduction as well . If whole faunas had been extirpated suddenly , new faunas had presumably been introduced with equal suddenness by special creation ; but if species die out gradually , the introduction of new species may be presumed to be correspondingly gradual . Then may not the new species of a later geological epoch be the modified lineal descendants of the extinct population of an earlier epoch ? The idea that such might be the case was not new . It had been suggested when fossils first began to attract conspicuous attention ; and such sagacious thinkers as Buffon and Kant and Goalie and Erasmus Darwin had // been disposed to accept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1809 , it had been contended for by one of the early workers in systematic paleontology , Jean Baptiste Lamarck , who had studied the fossil shells about Paris while Cuvier studied the vertebrates , and who had been led by these studies to conclude that there had been not merely a rotation but a progression of life on the globe . Ile found the fossil shells  --  the fossils of invertebrates , as he himself had christened them ? in deeper strata than Cuvier 's vertebrates ; and he believed that there had been long ages when no higher forms than these were in existence , and that insuccessive ages fishes , and then reptiles , had been the highest of animate creatures , before mammals , including man , appeared . Looking beyond the pale of his bare facts , as genius sometimes will , he had insisted that - these progressive populations had developed one from lob THE STORY OF NINETEENTII-CENTURY SCIENCE another , under influence of changed surroundings , in unbroken series . Of course such a thought as this was hopelessly misplaced in a generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less so in the generation that accepted catastrophism ; but it had been kept alive by here and there an advocate like Geoffrey St.-Hilaire , and now the banishment of catastrophism opened the way for its more respectful consideration . Respectful consideration was given it by Lyell in each recurring edition of his Principles , but such consideration led to its unqualified rejection . In its place Lyell put forward a modified hypothesis of special creation . IIe assumed that from time to time , as the extirpation of a species had left room , so to speak , for a new species , such new species had been created ( le novo ; and he supposed that such intermittent , spasmodic impulses of creation manifest themselves nowadays quite as frequently as at any time in the past . IIe did not say in so many words that no one need be surprised to-day were he to see a new species of deer , for example , come up out of the ground before him , " pawing to get free , " like Milton 's lion , but his theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noted , was not the theory of Lyell alone , but of nearly all his associates in the geologic world . There is perhaps no other fact that will bring home to one so vividly the advance in thought of our own generation as the recollection that so crude , so almost unthinkable a conception could have been the current doctrine of science less than half a century ago . This theory of special creation , moreover , excluded the current doctrine of uniformitarianism as night excludes day , though most thinkers of the time did not // seem to be aware of the incompatibility of the two ideas . It may be doubted whether even Lyell himself fully realized it . If he did , he saw no escape from the dilemma , for it seemed to him that the record in the rocks clearly disproved the alternative Lamarckian hypothesis . And almost with one accord the paleontologists of the time sustained the verdict . Owen , Agassiz , Falconer , Barrande , Pictet , Forbes , repudiated the idea as unqualifiedly as their great predecessor Cuvier had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , come to believe that there is evidence of a progressive development of life in the successive ages , but no such graded series of fossils had been discovered as would give countenance to the idea that one species had ever been transformed into another . And to nearly every one this objection seemed insuperable . But now in 1859 appeared a book which , though not dealing primarily with paleontology , yet contained a chapter that revealed the geological record in an altogether new light . The book was Charles Darwin 's Oeiqin of Species , the chapter that wonderful citation of the " Imperfections of the Geological Record . " In this epoch-making chapter Darwin shows what conditions must prevail in any given place in order that fossils shall be formed , how unusual such conditions are , and how probable it is that fossils once embedded in sediment of a sea-bed will be destroyed by metamorphosis of the rocks , or by denudation when the strata are raised above the water-level . Add to this the fact that only small territories of the earth have been explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paleontological record as we now possess it shows but a mere fragment of the past history of organisms on the 1o TIDE STORY OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY SCIENCE earth . It is a history " imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect . Of this history we possess the last volume alone , relating only to two or three countries . Of this volume only here and there a short chapter has been preserved , and of each page only here and there a few lines . " For a paleontologist to dogmatize from such a record would be as rash , he thinks , as " for a naturalist to land for five minutes on a barren point of // Australia and then discuss the number and range of its productions . " This citation of observations , which when once pointed out seemed almost self-evident , carne as a revelation to the geological world . In the clarified view now possible old facts took on a new meaning . It was recalled that Cuvier had been obliged to establish a new order for some of the first fossil creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nondescript forms were intermediate in structure between allied existing orders . More recently such intermediate forms had been discovered over and over ; so that , to name but one example , Owen had been able , with the aid of extinct species , to dissolve by gradations the apparently wide interval between the pig and the camel . " Owen , moreover , had been led to speak repeatedly of the " generalized forms " of extinct animals , and Agassiz had called them " synthetic or prophetic types , " these terms clearly implying " that such forms are in fact intermediate or connecting links . " Darwin himself had shown some years before that the fossil animals of any continent are closely related to the existing animals of that continent ? edentates predominating , for example , in South America , and marsupials in Australia . Many observers had noted that recent strata everywhere show a fossil fauna more nearly like the existing one than do more ancient strata ; and that fossils from any two consecutive strata are far more closely related to each other than are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each geological formation being , indeed , in a wide view , intermediate between preceding and succeeding faunas . So suggestive were all these observations that Lyell , the admitted leader of the geological world , after read- // ing Darwin 's citations , felt able to drop his own crass explanation of the introduction of species , and adopt the transmutation hypothesis , thus rounding out the doctrine of uniformitarianism to the full proportions in which Lamarck had conceived it half a century before . Not all paleontologists could follow him at once , of course ; the proof was not yet sufficiently demonstative for that ; but all were shaken in the seeming security of their former position , which is always a necessary stage in the progress of thought . And popular interest in the matter was raised to white heat in a twinkling . So , for the third time in this first century of its existence , paleontology was called upon to play a leading role in a controversy whose interest extended far beyond the bounds of staid truth-seeking science . And the controversy waged over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that over catastrophism not more acrimonious , than that which now raged over the question of the transmutation of species . The question had implications far beyond the bounds of paleontology , of course . The main evidence yet presented had been drawn from quite other fields , but by common consent the record in the rocks might furnish a crucial test of the truth or falsity of the hypothesis . " IIe who rejects this view of the imperfections of the geological record , " said Darwin , " will rightly reject the whole theory . " With something more than mere scientific zeal , therefore , paleontologists turned anew to the records in the rocks , to inquire what evidence in proof or refutation might be found in unread pages of the " great stone book . " And as might have been expected , many minds // being thus prepared to receive new evidence , such evidence was not long withheld . v Indeed , at the moment of Darwin 's writing a new and very instructive chapter of the geologic record was being presented to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the story . In 1859 Dr. Falconer , the distinguished British paleontologist , made a visit to Abbeville , in the valley of the Somme , incited by reports that for a decade before had been sent out from there by M. Boucher des Perthes . These reports had to do with the alleged finding of flint implements , clearly the work of man , in undisturbed gravel beds , in the midst of fossil remains of the mammoth and other extinct animals . Dr. Falconer was so much impressed with what he saw that he urged his countrymen Professor Prestwich to go to Abbeville and thoroughly investigate the subject . Professor Prestwich complied , with the collaboration of Mr. John Evans , and the report which these paleontologists made of their investigation brought the subject of the very significant human fossils at Abbeville prominently before the public ; whereas the publications of the original discoverer , Boucher des Perthes , bearing date of 1847 , had been altogether ignored . A new aspect was thus given to the current controversy . As Dr. Falconer remarked , geology was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of Galileo . But the times were changed since the ( lay when the author of the Dialogues was humbled before the Congregation of the Index , and now no Index // Prohibitorum could avail to hide from eager human eyes such pages of the geologic story as Nature herself had spared . Eager searchers were turning the leaves with renewed zeal everywhere , and with no small measure of success . In particular , interest attached just at this time to a human skull which Dr. Fuhlrott had discovered in a cave at Neanderthal two or three years before ? a cranium which has ever since been famous as the Neanderthal skull , the type specimen of what modern zoologists are disposed to regard as a distinct species of man , Ilomo neanderthalensis . Like others of the same type since discovered at Spy , it is singularly Simian in character ? low-arched , with receding forehead and enormous protuberant eyebrows . When it was first exhibited to the scientists at Berlin by Dr. Fuhlrott , in 1857 , its human character was doubted by some of the witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . // This interesting find served to recall with fresh significance some observations that had been made in France and Belgium a long generation earlier , but whose bearings had hitherto been ignored . In 1826 MM . Tournal and Christol had made independent discoveries of what they believed to be human fossils in the caves of the south of France ; and in 1327 Dr. Schmerling had found in the cave of Engis , in Westphalia , fossil bones of even greater significance . Schmerling 's explorations had been made with the utmost care and patience . At Engis he had found human bones , including skulls , intermingled with those of extinct mammals of the mammoth period in a way that left no doubt in his mind that all dated from the same geological epoch . Ile had published a full account of his discoveries in an elaborate monograph issued in 1833 . But at that time , as it chanced , human fossils were under a ban as effectual as any ever pronounced by canonical index , though of far different origin . The oracular voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the bones brought him for examination the great anatomist had pettishly pitched out of the window , declaring them fit only for a cemetery , and that had settled the matter for a generation : the evidence gathered by lesser workers could avail nothing against the decision rendered at the Delphi of Science . But no ban , scientific or canonical , can long resist the germinative power of a fact , and so now , after three decades of suppression , the truth which Cuvier had buried beneath the weight of his ridicule burst its bonds , and fossil man stood revealed , if not as a flesh and blood , at least as a skeletal entity . The reception now accorded our prehistoric ancestor // by the progressive portion of the scientific world amounted to an ovation ; but the unscientific masses , on the other hand , notwithstanding their usual fondness for tracing remote genealogies , still gave the men of Engis and Neanderthal the cold shoulder . Nor were all of the geologists quite agreed that the contemporaneity of these human fossils with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully established . The bare possibility that the bones of man and of animals // that long preceded him had been swept together into the caves in successive ages , and in some mysterious way intermingled there , was clung to by the conserva tives as a last refuge . But even this small measure of security was soon to be denied them , for in 1865 two as sociated workers , M. Edouard Lartet and Mr. Henry Christy , in exploring the caves of Dordogne , unearthed a bit of evidence against which no such objection could be urged . This momentous exhibit was a bit of ivory , a fragment of the tusk of a mammoth , on which was scratched a rude but unmistakable outline portrait of the mammoth itself . If all the evidence as to man 's antiquity before presented was suggestive merely , here at last was demonstration ; for the cave-dwelling man could not well have drawn the picture of the mammoth unless he had seen that animal , and to admit that man and the mammoth had been contemporaries was to con-cede the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full im port of this most instructive work of art came to be realized , scepticism as to man 's antiquity was silenced for all time to come . In the generation that has elapsed since the first draw ing of the cave-dweller artist was discovered , evidences of the wide-spread existence of man in an early epoch have multiplied indefinitely , and to-day the paleontolo gist traces the history of our race back beyond the iron and bronze ages , through a neolithic or polished-stone age , to a paleolithic or rough-stone age , with confidence born of unequivocal knowledge . And lie looks confi dently to the future explorer of the earth 's fossil records to extend the history back into vastly more remote epochs , for it is little doubted that paleolithic man , the most ancient of our recognized progenitors , is a modern // compared to those generations that represented the real childhood of our race . PI Coincidently with the discovery of these highly suggestive pages of the geologic story , other still more instructive chapters were being brought to light in America . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strata found in ancient lake beds , records of the tertiary period , or age of mammals , had been made and preserved with fulness not approached in any other region hitherto geologically explored . These records were made known mainly by Professors Joseph Leidy , O. C. Marsh , and E. D. Cope , working independently , and more recently by numerous younger paleontologists . The profusion of vertebrate remains thus brought to light quite beggars all previous exhibits in point of mere numbers . Professor Marsh , for example , who was first in the field , found 300 new tertiary species between the years 1870 and 1876 . Meanwhile , in cretaceous strata , he unearthed remains of about 200 birds with teeth , 600 pterodactyls , or flying dragons , some with a spread of wings of twenty-five feet , and 1500 rnosasaurs of the sea-serpent type , some of them sixty feet or more in length . In a single bed of Jurassic rock , not larger than a good-sized lecture-room , he found the remains of 160 individuals of mammals , representing twenty species and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded 300 reptiles , varying from the size of a rabbit to sixty or eighty feet in length . But the chief interest of these fossils from the West is // not their number but their nature ; for among them are numerous illustrations of just such intermediate types of organisms as must have existed in the past if the succession of life on the globe has been an unbroken lineal succession . Here are reptiles with bat-like wings , and others with bird-like pelves and legs adapted for bipedal locomotion . Here are birds with teeth and other reptilian characters . In short , what with reptilian birds and bird-like reptiles , the gap between modern reptiles and birds is quite bridged over . In a similar way , various diverse mammalian forms , as the tapir , the rhinoceros , and the horse , are linked together by fossil progenitors . And most important of all , Professor Marsh has discovered a series of mammalian remains , occurring in successive geological epochs , which are held to represent beyond cavil the actual line of descent of the modern horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and three toed forms , to an ancestor in the eocene or early tertiary that had four functional toes and the rudiment of a fifth . These and such like revelations have come to light in our own time ; are , indeed , still being disclosed . Needless to say , no Index of any sort now attempts to conceal them ; yet something has been accomplished towards the same end by the publication of the discoveries in Smithsonian bulletins , and in technical memoirs of government surveys . Fortunately , however , the results have been rescued from that partial oblivion by such interpreters as Professors Huxley and Cope , so the unscientific public has been allowed to gain at least an inkling of the wonderful progress of paleontology in our generation . The writings of Huxley in particular epitomize the // record . In 1862 he admitted candidly that the paleontological record as then known , so far as it bears on the doctrine of progressive development , negatives that doctrine . In 1870 he was able to " soften somewhat the Brutus-like severity " of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent researches seem " to leave a clear balance in favor of the doctrine of the evolution of living forms one from another . " Six years later , when reviewing the work of Marsh in America and of Gaudry in Pikermi , he declared that , " on the evidence of paleontology , the evolution of many existing forms of animal life from their predecessors is no longer an hypothesis , but an historical fact . " In 1851 he asserted that the evidence gathered in the previous decade had been so unequivocal that , had the transmutation hypothesis not existed , " the paleontologist would have had to invent it . " Since then the delvers after fossils have piled proof on proof in bewildering profusion . The fossil beds in // the " bad lands " of western America seem inexhaustible . And in the Connecticut River Valley near relatives of the great reptiles which Professor Marsh and others have found in such profusion in the West left their tracks on the mud flats ? since turned to sandstone ; and a few skeletons also have been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the lords of creation of their day have been dissipated to their elements , while the chance indentations of their feet as they raced along the shores , mere footprints on the sands , have been preserved among the most imperishable of the memorytablets of the world . Of the other vertebrate fossils that have been found in the eastern portions of America , among the most abundant and interesting are the skeletons of mastodons . Of these one of the largest and most complete is that which was unearthed in the bed of a drained lake near Newburg , New York , in 1845 . This specimen was larger than the existing elephants , and had tusks eleven feet in length . It was mounted and described by Dr. John C. Warren , of Boston , and has been famous for half a century as the " Warren mastodon . " But to the student of racial development as recorded by the fossils , all these sporadic finds have but incidental interest as compared with the rich Western fossil beds to which we have already referred . From records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past few years been made out in greater or less detail . Professor Cope has traced the ancestry of the camels ( which , like the rhinoceroses , hippopotami , and sundry other forms now spoken of as " Old World , " seem to have had their origin here ) with much completeness . // A lemuroid form of mammal , believed to be of the type from which man has descended , has also been found in these beds . It is thought that the descendants of this creature , and of the other " Old-World " forms above referred to , found their way to Asia , probably , as suggested by Professor Marsh , across a bridge at Bering Strait , to continue their evolution on the other hemi sphere , becoming extinct in the land of their nativity . The ape-man fossil found in the tertiary strata of the island of Java two years ago by the Dutch surgeon Dr. Eugene Dubois , and named Pithecanthropus creams , may have been a direct descendant of the American tribe of primitive lemurs , though this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN PALEONTOLOGY Not all the strange beasts which have left their remains in our " bad lands " are represented by living descendants . The titanotheres , or brontotherid e , for example , a gigantic tribe , offshoots of the same stock which produced the horse and rhinoceros , represented the culmination of a line of descent . They developed rapidly in a geological sense , and flourished about the middle of the tertiary period ; then , to use Agassiz 's phrase , " time fought against them . " The story of their evolution has been worked out by Professors Leidy , Marsh , Cope , and H. F. Osborne . The very latest bit of paleontological evidence bearing on the question of the introduction of species is that presented by Dr. J. L. Wortman in connection with the fossil lineage of the edentates . It was suggested by Marsh , in 1.877 , that these creatures , whose modern representatives are all South American , originated in North America long before the two continents had any land connection . The stages of degeneration by which these animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the unique condition of their modern descendants of the sloth tribe , are illustrated by strikingly graded specimens now preserved in the American Museum of Natural History , as shown by Dr. Wortman . All these and a multitude of other recent observations that can not be even outlined here tell the same story With one accord paleontologists of our time regard the question of the introduction of new species as solved . As Professor Marsh has said , " to doubt evolution today is to doubt science ; and science is only another name for truth . " Thus the third great battle over the meaning of the fossil records has come to a conclusion . Again there // is a truce to controversy , and it may seem to the casual observer that the present stand of the science of fossils is final and impregnable . But does this really mean that a full synopsis of the story of paleontology has been told ? Or do we only await the coming of the twentieth-century Lamarck or Darwin , who shall attack the fortified knowledge of to-day with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S PROGRESS IN GEOLOGY r JAMES Hurrox 's theory that continents wear away and are replaced by volcanic upheaval had gained comparatively few adherents at the beginning of our century . Even the lucid Illustrations of the Iluttonian Theory , which Playfair , the pupil and friend of the great Scotchman , published in 1802 , did not at once prove convincing . The world had become enamoured of the rival theory of Ilutton 's famous contemporary , Werner of Saxony ? the theory which taught that " in the beginning " all the solids of the earth 's present crust were dissolved in the heated waters of a universal sea . Werner affirmed that all rocks , of whatever character , had been formed by precipitation from this sea , as the waters cooled ; that even veins have originated in this way ; and that mountains are gigantic crystals , not upheaved masses . In a word , he practically ignored volcanic action , and denied in toto the theory of metamorphosis of rocks through the agency of heat . The followers of Werner came to be known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geology during our first quarter-century is mainly a recital of the intemperate controversy between these op- // posing schools ; though it should not be forgotten that , meantime , the members of the Geological Society of London were making an effort to hunt for facts and avoid compromising theories . Fact and theory , however , were too closely linked to be thus divorced . The brunt of the controversy settled about the unstratified rocks granites and their allies ? which the Plutonists claimed as of igneous origin . This contention had the theoretical support of the nebular hypothesis , then gaining ground , which supposed the earth to be a cooling globe . The Plutonists laid great stress , too , on the observed fact that the temperature of the earth increases at a pretty constant ratio as descent towards its centre is made in mines . But in particular they appealed to the phenomena of volcanoes . The evidence from this source was gathered and elaborated by Mr. G. Poulett Scrope , secretary of the Geological Society of England , who , in 1823 , published a classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , including some of the highest known peaks , are merely accumulated masses of lava belched forth from a crevice in the earth 's crust . The Neptunists stoutly contended for the aqueous origin of volcanic as of other mountains . But the facts were with Scrope , and as time went on it came to be admitted that not merely volcanoes , but many " trap " formations not taking the form of craters had been made by the obtrusion of molten rock through fissures in overlying strata . Such , for example , to cite familiar illustrations , are Mount Holyoke , in Massachusetts , and the well-known formation of the Palisades along the Hudson . But to admit the " Plutonic " origin of such wide- // spread formations was practically to abandon the Neptunian hypothesis . So gradually the Huttonian explanation of the origin of granites and other " igneous " rocks , whether massed or in veins , came to be accepted . Most geologists then came to think of the earth as a molten mass , on which the crust rests as a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that the molten areas exist only as lakes in a solid crust , heated to melting , perhaps , by electrical or chemical action , as Davy suggested . More recently a popular theory attempts to reconcile geological facts with the claim of the physicists , that the earth 's entire mass is at least as rigid as steel , by supposing that a molten film rests between the observed solid crust and the alleged solid nucleus . But be that as it may , the theory that subterranean heat has been instrumental in determining the condition of " primary " rocks , and in producing many other phenomena of the earth 's crust , has never been in dispute since the long controversy between the Neptunists and the Plutonists led to its establishment . II If molten matter exists beneath the crust of the earth , it must contract an cooling , and in so doing it must disturb the level of the portion of the crust already solidified . So a plausible explanation of the upheaval of continents and mountains was supplied by the Plutonian theory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important difference of opinion arose as to the exact rationale of such upheavals . Hutton himself , and practically every one else who accepted his theory , had supposed that there are long periods of relative repose , // during which the level of the crust is undisturbed , followed by short periods of active stress , when continents are thrown up with volcanic suddenness , as by the throes of a gigantic earthquake . But now came Charles Lyell with his famous extension of the " uniformitarian " doctrine , claiming that past changes of the earth 's surface have been like present changes in degree as well as in kind . The making of continents and mountains , he said , is going on as rapidly to-day as at any time in the past . There have been no gigantic cataclysmic upheavals at any time , but all changes in level of the strata as a whole have been gradual , by slow oscillation , or at most by repeated earthquake shocks such as are still often experienced . In support of this very startling contention Lyell gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of continental areas . IIe corroborated by personal inspection the claim which had been made by Playfair in 1802 , and by von Buch in 1507 , that the coast-line of Sweden is rising at the rate of from a few inches to several feet in a century . Iie cited Darwin 's observations going to prove that Patagonia is similarly rising , and Pingel 's claim that Greenland is slowly sinking . Proof as to sudden changes of level of several feet , over large areas , due to earthquakes , was brought forward in abundance . Cumulative evidence left it no longer open to question that such oscillatory changes of level , either upward or downward , are quite the rule , and it could not be denied that these observed changes , if continued long enough in one direction , would produce the highest elevations . The possibility that the making of even the highest ranges of mountains had been accomplished without exaggerated catastrophic action came to be freely admitted . // It became clear that the supposedly stable land surfaces are in reality much more variable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continental masses , seemingly so fixed , are really rising and falling in billows thousands of feet in height , ages instead of moments being consumed in the sweep between crest and hollow . These slow oscillations of land surfaces being understood , many geological enigmas were made clear ? such as the alternation of marine and fresh-water formations in a vertical series , which Cuvier and Brongniart had observed near Paris ; or the sandwiching of layers of coal , of subaerial formation , between layers of subaqueous clay or sandstone , which may be observed everywhere in the coal measures . In particular , the extreme thickness of the sedimentary strata as a whole , many times exceeding the depth of the deepest known sea , was for the first time explicable when it was understood that such strata had formed in slowly sinking ocean-beds . All doubt as to the mode of origin of stratified rocks being thus removed , the way was opened for a more favorable consideration of that other Huttonian doctrine of the extremely slow denudation of land surfaces . The enormous amount of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes intelligently in a mountain district . It will be evident in any region where the strata are tilted ? as , for example , the Alleghanies  - -  that great folds of strata which must once have risen miles in height have in many cases been worn entirely away , so that now a valley marks the location of the former eminence . Where the strata are level , as in the case of the mountains of Sicily , the Scotch Highlands , and the familiar Catskills , the evidence of denudation is , // THE STORY OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY SCIENCE if possible , even more marked ; for here it is clear that elevation and valley have been carved by the elements out of land that rose from the sea as level plateaus . But that this herculean labor of land-sculpturing could have been accomplished by the slow action of wind and frost and shower was an idea few men could grasp within the first half-century after Hutton propounded it ; nor did it begin to gain general currency until Lyell 's crusade against catastrophism , begun about 1830 , had for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slow continuous changes producing final results of colossal proportions . And even long after that , it was combated by such men as Murchison , Director-General of the Geological Survey of Great Britain , then accounted the foremost field-geologist of his time , who continued to believe that the existing valleys owe their main features to subterranean forces of upheaval . Even Murchison , however , made some recession from the belief of the Continental authorities , Elie de Beaumont and Leopold von Buch , who contended that the mountains had sprung up like veritable jacks-in-thebox . Von Buch , whom his friend and fellow-pupil von Humboldt considered the foremost geologist of the time , died in 1853 , still firm in his early faith that the erratic bowlders found high on the Jura had been hurled there , like cannon-balls , across the valley of Geneva by the sudden upheaval of a neighboring mountain range . III The bowlders whose presence on the crags of the Jura the old German accounted for in a manner so theatrics ) had long been a source of contention among geologists . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on numberless other mountains in all north temperate latitudes , and often far out in the open country , as many a farmer who has broken his plough against them might testify . The early geologists accounted for them , as for nearly everything else , with their supposititious Deluge . Brongniart and Cuvier and P , ucidand and their contemporaries appeared to have no difficulty in conceiving that masses of granite weighing hundreds of tons had been swept by this current scores or hundreds of miles from their source . But of course the uniformitarian faith permitted no such explanation , nor could it countenance the projection idea ; so Lyell was bound to find some other means of transportation for the puzzling erratics . The only available medium was ice , but fortunately // this one seemed quite sufficient . Icebergs , said Lyell , are observed to carry all manner of debris , and deposit it in the sea-bottoms . Present land surfaces have often been submerged beneath the sea . During the latest of these submergences icebergs deposited the bowlders now scattered here and there over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And even the catastrophists , though they met Lyell amicably on almost no other theoretical ground , were inclined to admit the plausibility of his theory of erratics . Indeed , of all Lyell 's non-conformist doctrines , this seemed the one most likely to meet with general acceptance . Yet , even as this iceberg theory loomed large and larger before the geological world , observations were making in a different field that were destined to show its fallacy . As early as 1815 a sharp-eyed chamois-hunter of the Alps , Perraudin by name , had noted the existence of the erratics , and , unlike most of his companion hunters , had puzzled his head as to how the bowlders got where he saw them . He knew nothing of submerged continents or of icebergs , still less of upheaving mountains ; and though he doubtless had heard of the Flood , he had no experience of heavy rocks floating like corks in water . Moreover , he had never observed stones rolling up hill and perching themselves on mountaintops , and he was a good enough uniformitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one told him so ) to disbelieve that stones in past times had disported themselves differently in this regard from stones of the present . Yet there the stones are . How did they get there ? The mountaineer thought that he could answer that question . He saw about him those gigantic serpent-like // streams of ice called glaciers , " from their far fountains slow rolling on , " carrying with them blocks of granite and other debris to form moraine deposits . If these glaciers had once been much more extensive than they now are , they might have carried the bowlders and left them where we find them . On the other hand , no other natural agency within the sphere of the chamois-hunter 's knowledge could have accomplished this , ergo the glaciers must once have been more extensive . Perraudin would probably have said that common-sense drove him to this conclusion ; but be that as it may , he had conceived one of the few truly original and novel ideas of which our century can boast . // Perraudin announced his idea to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of the mines at Bex , a skilled geologist who had been a fellowpupil of von Buch and von llumboldt under Werner at the Freiberg School of Mines . Charpentier laughed at the mountaineer 's grotesque idea , and thought no more about it . And ten years elapsed before Perraudin could find any one who treated his notion with greater respect . Then he found a listener in M. Venetz , a civil engineer , who read a paper on the novel glacial theory before a local society in 1823 . This brought the matter once more to the attention of de Charpentier , who now felt that there might be something in it worth investigation . A survey of the field in the light of the new theory soon convinced Charpentier that the chamois-hunter had all along been right . Ile became an enthusiastic supporter of the idea that the Alps had once been embedded in a mass of ice , and in 1836 he brought the notion to the attention of Louis Agassiz , who was spending the summer in the Alps . Agassiz was sceptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw that the implications of the theory extended far beyond the Alps . If the Alps had been covered with an ice sheet , so had many other regions of the northern hemisphere . Casting abroad for evidences of glacial action , Agassiz found them everywhere , in the form of transported erratics , scratched and polished outcropping rocks , and morainelike deposits . Presently he became convinced that the ice sheet which covered the Alps had spread over the whole of the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere , forming an ice cap over the globe . Thus the common-sense induction of the chamois-hunter blos- // somed in the mind of Agassiz into the conception of a universal Ice Age . In 1857 Agassiz introduced his theory to the world , in a paper read at Neuchiltel , and three years later he published his famous Etucics szcr les Glaciers . Never did idea make a more profound disturbance in the scientific world . Von Duch treated it with alternate ridicule , contempt , and rage ; Murchison opposed it with customary vigor ; even Lyell , whose most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could not at once discard his iceberg theory in favor of the new claimant . Dr. 13uc1:land , however , after Agassiz had shown him evidence of former glacial action in his own Scotland , became a convert ? the more readily , perhaps , as it seemed to him to oppose the uniformitarian idea . Gradually others fell in line , and after the usual embitTHE STORY OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY SCIENCE tered controversy and the inevitable full generation of probation , the idea of an Ice Age took its place among the accepted tenets of geology . All manner of moot points still demanded attention ? the cause of the Ice Age , the exact extent of the ice sheet , the precise manner in which it produced its effects , and the exact nature of these effects ; and not all of these have even yet been determined . But , details aside , the Ice Age now has full recognition from geologists as an historical period . There may have been many Ice Ages , as Dr. Croll contends ; there was surely one ; and the conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of our century that no previous century had even so much as faintly adumbrated . But , for that matter , the entire subject of historical geology is one that had but the barest beginning before our century . Until the paleontologist found out the key to the earth 's chronology , no one ? not even Hutton ? could have any definite idea as to the true story of the earth 's past . The only conspicuous attempt to classify the strata was that made by Werner , who divided the rocks into three systems , based on their supposed order of deposition , and called primary , transition , and secondary . Though Werner 's observations were confined to the small province of Saxony , he did not hesitate to affirm that all over the world the succession of strata would be found the same as there , the concentric layers , according to this conception , being arranged about the earth with the regularity of layers on an onion . But in this Werner was as mistaken as in his theoretical explana- // tion of the origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little observation to show that the exact succession of strata is never precisely the same in any widely separated regions . Nevertheless , there was a germ of truth in Werner 's system . It contained the idea , however faultily interpreted , of a chronological succession of strata ; and it furnished a working outline for the observers who were to make out the true story of geological development . But the correct interpret Lion of the observed facts could only be made after the IIuttonian view as to the origin of strata had gained complete ac-ceptance . When William Smith , having found the true key to this story , attempted to apply it , the territory with which he had to deal chanced to be one where the surface rocks are of that later series which Werner termed sec-ondary . He made numer-rous subdivisions within THE STORY OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY SCIENCE this system , based mainly on the fossils . Meantime it was found that , judged by the fossils , the strata that Brongniart and Cuvier studied near Paris were of a still more recent period ( presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which carne to be spoken of as tertiary . It was in these beds , some of which seemed to have been formed in fresh-water lakes , that many of the strange mammals which Cuvier first described were found . But the " transition " rocks , underlying the " secondary " system that Smith studied , were still practically unexplored when , along in the thirties , they were taken in hand by Roderick Impey Murchison , the reformed fox-hunter and ex-captain who had turned geologist to such notable advantage , and Adam Sedgwick , the brilliant Woodwardian professor at Cambridge . Working together , these two friends classified the transition rocks into chronological groups , since familiar to every one in the larger outlines as the Silurian system ( age of invertebrates ) and the Devonian system ( age of fishes ) ? names derived respectively from the country of the ancient Silures , in Wales , and Devonshire , England . It was subsequently discovered that these systems of strata , which crop out from beneath newer rocks in restricted areas in Britain , are spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and in America . Later on Murchison studied them in Russia , and described them , conjointly with Verneuil and von Rerserling , in a ponderous and classical work . In America they were studied by IIall , Newberry , Whitney , Dana , Whitfield , and other pioneer geologists , who all but anticipated their English contemporaries . The rocks that are of still older formation than those // studied by Murchison and Sedgwick ( corresponding in location to the " primary " rocks of Werner 's conception ) are the surface feature of vast areas in Canada , and were first prominently studied there by William T. Logan , of the Canadian Government Survey , as early as 1846 , and later on by Sir William Dawson . These rocks ? comprising the Laurentian system ? were formerly supposed to represent parts of the original crust of the earth , // formed on first cooling from a molten state ; but they are now more generally regarded as once-stratified deposits metamorphosed by the action of heat . Whether " primitive " or metamorphic , however , these Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries , are the oldest portions of the earth 's crust of which geology has any present knowledge . Mountains of this formation , as the Adirondacks , and the Storm King range overlooking the Hudson near West Point , are the patriarchs of their kind , beside which Alleghanies and Sierra Nevadas are recent upstarts , and Rockies , Alps , and Andes are mere parvenus of yesterday . The Laurentian rocks were at first spoken of as representing " Azoic " time ; but in 1846 Dawson found a formation deep in their midst which was believed to be the fossil relic of a very low form of life , and after that it became customary to speak of the system as " Eozoic . " Still more recently the title of Dawson 's supposed fossil to rank as such has been questioned , and Dana 's suggestion that the early rocks be termed merely Archean has met with general favor . Murchison and Sedgwick 's Silurian , Devonian , and Carboniferous groups ( the ages of invertebrates , of fishes , and of coal plants respectively ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith 's system of strata , next above these , once called " secondary , " represents Mesozoic time , or the age of reptiles . Still higher , or more recent , are Cuvier and Brongniart 's Tertiary rocks , representing the age of mammals . Lastly , the most recent formations , dating back , however , to a period far enough from recent in any but a geological sense , are classed as Quaternary , representing the age of man . 140 It must not be supposed , however , that the successive " ages " of the geologist are shut off from one another in any such arbitrary way as this verbal classification might seem to suggest . In point of fact , these " ages " have no better warrant for existence than have the " centuries " and the " weeks " of every-day computa-tion . They are convenient , and they may even stand for local divisions in the strata , but they are bounded by no actual gaps in the sweep of terrestrial events . Moreover , it must be understood that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same name , are not neces-sarily of exact contem-poraneity . There is no sure test available by which it could be shown that the Devo-nian age , for instance , as outlined in the strata of Europe , did not begin millions of THE STORY OF NINETEENTII-CENTURY SCIENCE years earlier or later than the period whose records are said to represent the Devonian age in America . In attempting to decide such details as this , mineralogical data fail us utterly . Even in rocks of ad joining regions identity of structure is no proof of contemporaneous origin ; for the veritable substance of the rock of one age is ground up to build the rocks of subsequent ages . Furthermore , in seas where conditions change but little the same form of rock may be made age after age . It is believed that chalk beds still forming in some of our present seas may form one continuous mass dating back to earliest geologic ages . On the other hand , rocks different in character may be formed at the same time in regions not far apart ? say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a chalk bed beyond . This continuous stratum , broken in the process of upheaval , might seem the record of three different epochs . Paleontology , of course , supplies far better chronological tests , but even these have their limitations . There has been no time since rocks now in existence were formed , if ever , when the earth had a uniform climate and a single undiversified fauna over its entire land surface , as the early paleontologists supposed . Speaking broadly , the same general stages have attended the evolution of organic forms everywhere , but there is nothing to show that equal periods of time witnessed corresponding changes in diverse regions , but quite the contrary . To cite but a single illustration , the marsupial order , which is the dominant mammalian type of the living fauna of Australia to-day , existed in Europe and died out there in the Tertiary age . Hence a future geologist might think the Australia of to-day contempo- // raneous with a period in Europe which in reality antedated it by perhaps millions of year v All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geology anything but the simple matter the fathers of the science esteemed it . No one would now attempt to trace the exact sequence of formation of all the mountains of the globe , as Rile de Beaumont did a half-century ago . Even within the limits of a single continent , the geologist must proceed with much caution in attempting to chronicle the order in which its various parts rose from the matrix of the sea . The key to this story is found in the identification of the strata that are the surface feature in each territory . If Devonian rocks are at the surface in any given region , for example , it would appear that this region became a land surface in the Devonian age , or just afterwards . But a moment 's consideration shows that there is an element of uncertainty about this , due to the steady denudation that all land surfaces undergo . The Devonian rocks may lie at the surface simply because the thousands of feet of carboniferous strata that once lay above them have been worn away . All that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region in question did not become permanent land surface earlier than the Devonian age . But to know even this is much ? sufficient , indeed , to establish the chronological order of elevation , if not its exact period , for all parts of any continent that have been geologically explored ? understanding always that there must be no scrupling about a latitude of a few mill . ions or perhaps tens of millions of years here and there . // Regarding our own continent , for example , we learn through the researches of a multitude of workers that in the early day it was a mere archipelago . Its chief island ? the backbone of the future continent ? was a great V-shaped area surrounding what is now Hudson Bay , an area built up , perhaps , through denudation of a yet more ancient polar continent , whose existence is only conjectured . To the southeast an island that is now the Adirondack Mountains , and another that is now the Jersey Highlands , rose above the waste of waters ; and far to the south stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridge Mountains . Far off to the westward another line of islands foreshadowed our present Pacific border . A few minor islands in the interior completed the archipelago . From this bare skeleton the continent grew , partly by the deposit of sediment from the denudation of the original islands ( which once towered miles , perhaps , where now they rise thousands of feet ) , but largely also by the deposit of organic remains , especially in the interior sea , which teemed with life . In the Silurian ages , invertebrates ? brachiopods and crinoids , and cephalopods ? were the dominant types . But very early ? no one knows just when ? there came fishes of many strange forms , some of the early ones enclosed in turtlelike shells . Later yet , large spaces within the interior sea having risen to the surface , great marshes or forests of strange types of vegetation grew and deposited their remains to form c9al beds . Many times over such forests were formed , a'nly to be destroyed by the oscillations of the land surface . All told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thickness , and the time consumed in their formation stands to all later time up to the // present , according to Professor Dana 's estimate , as three to one . Towards the close of this Paleozoic era the Appalachian Mountains were slowly upheaved in great convoluted folds , some of them probably reaching three or four miles above the sea-level , though the tooth of time has since gnawed them down to comparatively puny limits . The continental areas thus enlarged were peopled during the ensuing Mesozoic time with multitudes of strange reptiles , many of them gigantic in size . The waters , too , still teeming with invertebrates and fishes , had their quota of reptilian monsters ; and in the air were flying reptiles , some of which measured twenty-five feet from tip to tip of their bat-like wings . During this era the Sierra Nevada Mountains rose . Near the eastern border of the forming continent the strata were perhaps now too thick and stiff to bend into mountain folds , for they were rent into great fissures , letting out floods of molten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages of denudation , as the Palisades along the Hudson , and such elevations as Mount IIolyoke in western Massachusetts . Still there remained a vast interior sea , which , later on , in the Tertiary age , was to be divided by the slow uprising of the land , which only yesterday ? that is to say , a million , or three or five or ten million years ago ? became the Rocky Mountains . IIigh and erect these young mountains stand to this day , their sharp angles and rocky contours vouching for their youth , in strange contrast with the shrunken forms of the old Adirondacks , Green Mountains , and Appalachians , whose lowered heads and rounded shoulders attest the weight of ages . In the vast lakes which still remained on either // side of the Rocky range , Tertiary strata were slowly formed to the ultimate depth of two or three miles , enclosing here and there those vertebrate remains which were to be exposed again to view by denudation when the land rose still higher , and then , in our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paleontologist . Finally the interior seas were filled , and the shore lines of the continent assumed nearly their present outline . Then came the long winter of the glacial epoch ? perhaps of a succession of glacial epochs . The ice sheet extended southward to about the fortieth parallel , driving some animals before it , and destroying those that were unable to migrate . At its fulness , the great ice mass lay almost a mile in depth over New England , as attested by the scratched and polished rock surfaces and deposited erratics in the White Mountains . Such a mass presses down with a weight of about one hundred and twenty-five tons to the square foot , according to Dr. Croll 's estimate . It crushed and ground everything beneath it more or less , and in some regions planed off hilly surfaces into prairies . Creeping slowly forward , it carried all manner of debris with it . When it melted away its terminal moraine built up the nucleus of the land masses now known as Long Island and Staten Island ; other of its deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Breeds hills ; and it left a long irregular line of ridges of " till " or bowlder clay and scattered erratics clear across the country at about the latitude of New York City . As the ice sheet slowly receded it left minor moraines all along its course . Sometimes its deposits dammed up river courses or inequalities in the surface , to form the // lakes which everywhere abound over Northern territories . Some glacialists even hold the view first suggested by Ramsey , of the British Geological Survey , that the great glacial sheet scooped out the basins of many lakes , including the system that feeds the Saint Lawrence . At all events , it left traces of its presence all along the line of its retreat , and its remnants exist to this day as mountain glaciers and the polar ice cap . Indeed , we live on the border of the last glacial epoch , for with the closing of this period the long geologic past merges into the present . vi And the present , no less than the past , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hutton conceived more than a century ago , but which his contemporaries and successors were so very slow to appreciate . Now , however , it has become axiomatic ? one can hardly realize that it was ever doubted . Every new scientific truth , says Agassiz , must pass through three stages ? first , men say it is not true ; then they declare it hostile to religion ; finally , they assert that every one has known it always . Hutton 's truth that natural law is changeless and eternal has reached this final stage . Nowhere now could you find a scientist who would dispute the truth of that text which Lyell , quoting from Playfair 's Illustrations of the IZuttonian Theory , printed on the title-page of his Principles : " Amid all the revolutions of the globe the economy of Nature has been uniform , and her laws are the only things that have resisted the general movement . The rivers and the rocks , the seas and the continents , have been changed in all their parts ; but the laws which direct those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , have remained invariably the same . " But , on the other hand , Hutton and Playfair , and in particular Lyell , drew inferences from this principle which the modern physicist can by no means admit . To them it implied that the changes on the surface of the earth have always been the same in degree as well as in kind , and must so continue while present forces hold their sway . In other words , they thought of the world as a great perpetual-motion machine . But the modern physicist , given truer mechanical insight by the doctrines of the conservation and the dissipation of energy , will have none of that . Lord Kelvin , in particular , has urged that in the periods of our earth 's infancy and adolescence its developmental changes must have been , like those of any other infant organism , vastly more rapid and pronounced than those of a later day ; and to every clear thinker this truth also must now seem axiomatic . Whoever thinks of the earth as a cooling globe can hardly doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain of the moon 's tidal pull  --  - whether or not that body was nearer into great billows , daily rising and falling , like waves of the present seas vastly magnified . Under stress of that same lateral pressure from contraction which now produces the slow depression of the Jersey coast , the slow rise of Sweden , the occasional belching of an insignificant volcano , the jetting of a geyser , or the trembling of an earthquake , once large areas were rent in twain , and vast floods of lava flowed over thousands of square miles of the earth 's surface perhaps at a single jet ; and , for aught we know to the // contrary , gigantic mountains may have heaped up their contorted heads in cataclysms as spasmodic as even the most ardent catastrophist of the elder day of geology could have imagined . The atmosphere of that early day , filled with vast volumes of carbon , oxygen , and other chemicals that have since been stored in beds of coal , limestone , and granites , may have worn down the rocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other , with a rapidity that would now seem hardly conceivable . And yet while all these anomalous things went on , // the same laws held that now are operative ; and a true doctrine of uniformitarianism would make no unwonted concession in conceding them all ? though most of the embittered geological controversies of the middle of our century were due to the failure of both parties to realize that simple fact . And as of the past and present , so of the future . The same forces will continue to operate ; and under operation of these unchanging forces each day will differ from every one that has preceded it . If it be true , as every physicist believes , that the earth is a cooling globe , then , whatever its present stage of refrigeration , the time must come when its surface contour will assume a rigidity of level not yet attained . Then , just as surely , the slow action of the elements will continue to wear away the land surfaces , particle by particle , and transport them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation no longer being afforded by the upheaval of the continents , the last foot of dry land will sink for the last time beneath the water , the last mountain-peak melting away , and our globe , lapsing like any other organism into its second childhood , will be on the surface ? as presumably it was before the first continent rose ? one vast " waste of waters . " As puny man conceives time and things , an awful cycle will have lapsed ; in the sweep of the cosmic life , a pulse-beat will have throbbed . CHAPTER V THE CENTURY 'S PROGRESS IN METEOROLOGY I " AN astonishing miracle has just occurred in our district , " wrote M. Marais , a worthy if undistinguished citizen of France , from his home at L'Aigle , under date of " the 13th Floreal , year 11 " ? a date which outside of France would be interpreted as meaning May 3 , 1803 . This " miracle " was the appearance of a " fireball " in broad daylight ? " perhaps it was wildfire , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadow , " being seen by many people , and then exploded with a loud sound , scattering thousands of stony fragments over the surface of a territory some miles in extent . Such a " miracle " could not have been announced at a more opportune time . For some years the scientific world had been agog over the question whether such a form of lightning as that reported ? appearing in a clear sky , and hurling literal thunder-bolts ? had real existence . Such cases had been reported often enough , it is true . The " thunder-bolts " themselves were exhibited as sacred relics before many an altar , and those who doubted their authenticity had been chided as having " an evil heart of unbelief . " But scientific scepticism had ques- // tioned the evidence , and late in the eighteenth century a consensus of opinion in the French Academy had declined to admit that such stones had been " conveyed to the earth by lightning , " let alone any more miraculous agency . In 1802 , however , Edward IToward had read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence recently put forward , he had reached the conclusion that the fall of stones from the sky , sometimes or always accompanied by lightning , must be admitted as an actual phenomenon , however inexplicable . So now , when the great stone-fall at L'Aigle was announced , the French Academy made haste to send the brilliant young physicist Jean Baptiste Biot to investigate it , that the matter might , if possible , be set finally at rest . The investigation was in all respects successful , and Biot 's report transferred the stony or metallic lightning-bolt ? the aerolite or meteorite ? from the realm of tradition and conjecture to that of accepted science . But how explain this strange phenomenon ? At once speculation was rife . One theory contended that the stony masses had not actually fallen , but had been formed from the earth by the action of the lightning ; but this contention was early abandoned . The chemists were disposed to believe that the aerolites had been formed by the combination of elements floating in the upper atmosphere . Geologists , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urging that they might have been thrown up by volcanoes . The astronomers , as represented by ( fibers and Laplace , modified this theory by suggesting that the stones might , indeed , have been cast out by volcanoes , but by volcanoes situated not on the earth , but on the moon . // And one speculator of the time took a step even more daring , urging that the aerolites were neither of telluric nor selenic origin , nor yet children of the sun , as the old Greeks had , many of them , contended , but that they are visitants from the depths of cosmic space . This bold speculator was the distinguished German physicist Ernst F. F. Chladni , a man of no small repute in his day . As early as 1794 he urged his cosmical theory of meteorites , when the very existence of meteorites was denied by most scientists . And he did more : he // declared his belief that these falling stones were really one in origin and kind with those flashing meteors of the upper atmosphere which are familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteors , he affirmed , must tell of the ignition of a bit of cosmic matter entering the earth 's atmosphere . Such wandering bits of matter might be the fragments of shattered worlds , or , as Chladni thought more probable , merely aggregations of " world stuff " never hitherto connected with any large planetary mass . Naturally enough , so unique a view met with very scant favor . Astronomers at that time saw little to justify it ; and the non-scientific world rejected it with fervor as being " atheistic and heretical , " because its acceptance would seem to imply that the universe is not a perfect mechanism . Some light was thrown on the moot point presently by the observations of Brandes and Benzenberg , which tended to show that falling-stars travel at an actual speed of from fifteen to ninety miles a second . This observation tended to discredit the selenic theory , since an object , in order to acquire such speed in falling merely from the moon , must have been projected with an initial velocity not conceivably to be given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing conviction that there are no active volcanoes on the moon , and other considerations of the same tenor led to the complete abandonment of the selenic theory . But the theory of telluric origin of aerolites was by no means so easily disposed of . This was an epoch when electrical phenomena were exciting unbounded and universal interest , and there was a not unnatural // tendency to appeal to electricity in explanation of every obscure phenomenon ; and in this case the seeming similarity between a lightning-flash and the flash of an aerolite lent color to the explanation . So we find Thomas I+orster , a meteorologist of repute , still adhering to the atmospheric theory of formation of aerolites in his book published in 1823 ; and , indeed , the prevailing opinion of the time seemed divided between various telluric theories , to the neglect of any cosmical theory whatever . But in 1833 occurred a phenomenon which set the matter finally at rest . A great meteoric shower occurred in November of that year , and in observing it Professor Denison Olmsted , of Yale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from a single centre or vanishing-point in the heavens , and that this centre shifted its position with the stars , and hence was not telluric . The full significance of this observation was at once recognized by astronomers ; it demonstrated beyond all cavil the cosmical origin of the shooting-stars . Some conservative meteorologists kept up the argument for the telluric origin for some decades to come as a matter of course  --  such a band trails always in the rear of progress . But even these doubters were silenced when the great shower of shooting-stars appeared again in 1866 , as predicted by Olbers and Newton , radiating from the same point of the heavens as before . Since then the spectroscope has added its confirmatory evidence as to the identity of meteorite and shootingstar , and , moreover , has linked these atmospheric meteors with such distant cosmic residents as comets and nebulae . Thus it appears that Chladni 's daring hypothesis of 1794 // TIlE STORY OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY SCIENCE has been more than verified , and that the fragments of matter dissociated from planetary connection ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been shown to be billions of times more numerous than any larger cosmic bodies of which we have cognizance ? so widely does the existing universe differ from man 's preconceived notions as to what it should be . Thus also the " miracle " of the falling stone , against which the scientific scepticism of yesterday presented " an evil heart of unbelief , " turns out to be the most natural of phenomena , inasmuch as it is repeated in our atmosphere some millions of times each day . II If fire-balls were thought miraculous and portentous in days of yore , what interpretation must needs have been put upon that vastly more picturesque phenomenon , the aurora ? " Through all the city , " says the Book of Maccabees , " for the space of almost forty days , there were seen horsemen running in the air , in cloth of gold , armed with lances , like a band of soldiers : and troops of horsemen in array encountering and running one against another , with shaking of shields and multitude of pikes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering of golden ornaments and harness . " Dire omens these ; and hardly less ominous the aurora seemed to all succeeding generations that observed it clown till well into the eighteenth century ? as witness the popular excitement in England in 1716 over the brilliant aurora of that year , which became famous through Valley 's description . But after 1752 , when Franklin dethroned the light- // ping , all spectacular meteors came to be regarded as natural phenomena , the aurora among the rest . Franklin explained the aurora ? which was seen commonly enough in the eighteenth century , though only recorded once in the seventeenth ? as due to the accumulation of electricity on the surface of polar snows , and its discharge to the equator through the upper atmosphere . Erasmus Darwin suggested that the luminosity might be due to the ignition of hydrogen , which was supposed by many philosophers to form the upper atmosphere . Dalton , who first measured the height of the aurora , estimating it at about one hundred miles , thought the phenomenon due to magnetism acting on ferruginous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular one at the beginning of the century . // Since then a multitude of observers have studied the aurora , but the scientific grasp has found it as elusive in fact as it seems to casual observation , and its exact nature is as undetermined to-day as it was a hundred years ago . There has been no dearth of theories concerning it , however . Blot , who studied it in the Shetland Islands in 1817 , thought it due to electrified ferruginous dust , the origin of which he ascribed to Icelandic volcanoes . Much more recently the idea of ferruginous particles has been revived , their presence being ascribed not to volcanoes , but to the meteorites constantly being dissipated in the upper atmosphere . Ferruginous dust , presumably of such origin , has been found on the polar snows , as well as on the snows of mountain-tops , but whether it could produce the phenomena of auroras is at least an open question . Other theorists have explained the aurora as due to the accumulation of electricity on clouds or on spicules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due merely to the passage of electricity through rarefied air itself . Humboldt considered the matter settled in yet another way when Faraday showed , in 1831 , that magnetism may produce luminous effects . But perhaps the prevailing theory of to-day assumes that the aurora is due to a current of electricity generated at the equator , and passing through upper regions of space , to enter the earth at the magnetic poles ? simply reversing the course which Franklin assumed . The similarity of the auroral light to that generated in a vacuum bulb by the passage of electricity lends support to the long-standing supposition that the aurora is of electrical origin , but the subject still awaits complete elucidation . For once even that mystery-solver // the spectroscope has been baffled , for the line it sifts from the aurora is not matched by that of any recognized substance . A like line is found in the zodiacal light , it is true , but this is of little aid , for the zodiacal light , though thought by some astronomers to be due to meteor swarms about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , as mysterious as the aurora itself . Whatever the exact nature of the aurora , it has long been known to be intimately associated with the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism . Whenever a brilliant aurora is visible , the world is sure to be visited with what Humboldt called a , magnetic storm ? a " storm " which manifests itself to human senses in no way whatsoever except by deflecting the magnetic needle and // conjuring with the electric wire . Such magnetic storms are curiously associated also with spots on the ? un  --  just how no one has explained , though the fact itself is unquestioned . Sun-spots , too , seem directly linked with auroras , each of these phenomena passing through periods of greatest and least frequency in corresponding cycles of about eleven years ' duration . It was suspected a full century ago by Herschel that the variations in the number of sun-spots had a direct effect upon terrestrial weather , and he attempted to demonstrate it by using the price of wheat as a criterion of climatic conditions , meantime making careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his efforts in this direction , the subject being far too complex to be determined without long periods of observation . Latterly , however , meteorologists , particularly in the tropics , are disposed to think they find evidence of some such connection between sun-spots and the weather as Herschel suspected . Indeed , Mr. Meldrum declares that there is a positive coincidence between periods of numerous sun-spots and seasons of excessive rain in India . That some such connection does exist seems intrinsically probable . But the modern meteorologist , learning wisdom of the past , is extremely cautious about ascribing casual effects to astronomical phenomena . IIe finds it hard to forget that until recently all manner of climatic conditions were associated with phases of the moon ; that not so very long ago showers of falling-stars were considered " prognostic " of certain kinds of weather ; and that the " equinoctial storm " had been accepted as a verity by every one , until the unfeeling hand of statistics banished it from the earth . Yet , on the other hand , it is easily within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal associations between the weather and sun-spots , auroras , and terrestrial magnetism that as yet are hardly dreamed of . Until such time , however , these phenomena must feel themselves very grudgingly admitted to the inner circle of meteorology . More and more this science concerns itself , in our age of concentration and specialization , with weather and climate . Its votaries no longer concern themselves with stars or planets or comets or shooting-stars ? once thought the very essence of guides to weather wisdom ; and they are even looking askance at the moon , and asking her to show cause why she also should not be excluded from their domain . Equally little do they care for the interior of the earth , since they have learned that the central emanations of heat which Mairan imagined as a main source of aerial warmth can claim no such distinction . Even such problems as why the magnetic pole does not coincide with the geographical , and why the force of terrestrial magnetism decreases from the magnetic poles to the magnetic equator , as Humboldt first discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for magnetism , they say , is not known to have any connection whatever with climate or weather . III There is at least one form of meteor , however , of those that interested our forebears , whose meteorological importance they did not overestimate . This is the vapor of water . Irow great was the interest in this familiar meteor at the beginning of the century is attested by the number of theories then extant regarding it ; and these conflicting theories bear witness also to the difficulty // with which the familiar phenomenon of the evaporation of water was explained . Franklin had suggested that air dissolves water much as water dissolves salt , and this theory was still popular , though Deluc had disproved it by showing that water evaporates even more rapidly in a vacuum than in air . Deluc 's own theory , borrowed from earlier chemists , was that evaporation is the chemical union of particles of water with particles of the supposititious element heat . Erasmus Darwin combined the two theories , suggesting that the air might hold a variable quantity of vapor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chemical combination with caloric . Undisturbed by these conflicting views , that strangely original genius , John Dalton , afterwards to be known as 16$ TAE CENTURY 'S PROGRESS IN METEOROLOGY perhaps the greatest of theoretical chemists , took the question in hand , and solved it by showing that water exists in the air as an utterly independent gas . He reached a partial insight into the matter in 1793 , when his first volume of meteorological essays was published ; but the full elucidation of the problem came to him in 1801 . The merit of his studies was at once recognized , but the tenability of his hypothesis was long and ardently disputed . While the nature of evaporation was in dispute , as a matter of course the question of precipitation must be equally undetermined . The most famous theory of the period was that formulated by Dr. Hutton in a paper read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh , and published in the volume of transactions which contained also the same author 's epoch-making paper on geology . This " theory of rain " explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saturated air by contact with a colder current , the assumption being that the surplusage of moisture was precipitated in a chemical sense , just as the excess of salt dissolved in hot water is precipitated when the water cools . The idea that the cooling of the saturated air causes the precipitation of its moisture is the germ of truth that renders this paper of Hutton 's important . All correct later theories build on this foundation . The next ambitious attempt to explain the phenomena of aqueous meteors was made by Luke Howard , in his remarkable paper on clouds , published in the Philosophical Magazine in 1803 ? the paper in which the names cirrus , cumulus , stratus , etc. , afterwards so universally adopted , were first proposed . In this paper Howard acknowledges his indebtedness to Dalton for the theory // of evaporation , yet he still clings to the idea that the vapor , though independent of the air , is combined with particles of caloric . He holds that clouds are composed of vapor that has previously risen from the earth , combating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the union of hydrogen and oxygen existing independently in the air ; though he agrees with these theorists that electricity has entered largely into the wiodas operandi of cloud formation . IIe opposes the opinion of Deluc and de Saussure that clouds are composed of particles of water in the form of hollow vesicles ( miniature balloons , in short , perhaps filled with hydrogen ) , which untenable opinion was a revival of the theory as to the formation of all vapor which Dr. Halley had advocated early in the eighteenth century . Of particular interest are Howard 's views as to the formation of dew , which lie explains as caused by the particles of caloric forsaking the vapor to enter the cool body , leaving the water on the surface . This comes as near the truth perhaps as could be expected while the old idea as to the materiality of heat held sway . Howard believed , however , that dew is usually formed in the air at some height , and that it settles to the surface , opposing the opinion , which had gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster prominently advocated it ) , that dew ascends from the earth . The complete solution of the problem of dew formation ? which really involved also the entire question of precipitation of watery vapor in any form ? was made by Dr. C. W. Wells , a man of American birth , whose life , however , after boyhood , was spent in Scotland ( where as a young man he enjoyed the friendship of David Hume ) and in London . Inspired no doubt by the re- // searches of Black , Hutton , and their confreres of that Edinburgh school , Wells made observations on evaporation and precipitation as early as 1784 , but other things claimed his attention ; and though he asserts that the subject was often in his mind , he did not take it up again in earnest until about 1812 . Meantime the observations on heat of Rumford and Davy and Leslie had cleared the way for a proper interpretation of the facts about the facts themselves there had long been practical unanimity of opinion . Dr. Black , with his latent-heat observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subject of precipitation of vapor ; and from his time on it had been known that heat is taken up when water evaporates , and given out again when it condenses . Dr. Darwin had shown in 1788 , in a paper before the Royal Society , that air gives off heat on contracting , and takes it up on expanding ; and Dalton in his essay of 1793 had explained this phenomenon as due to the condensation and vaporization of the water contained in the air . But some curious and puzzling observations which Professor Patrick Wilson , Professor of Astronomy in the University of Glasgow , had communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1784 , and some similar ones made by Mr. Six of Canterbury a few years later , had remained unexplained . Both these gentlemen observed that the air is cooler where dew is forming than the air a few feet higher , and they inferred that the dew in forming had taken up heat , in apparent violation of established physical principles . It remained for Wells , in his memorable paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten the cart before the horse . IIe made it clear that the // air is not cooler because the dew is formed , but that the dew is formed because the air is cooler ? having become so through radiation of heat from the solids on which the dew forms . The dew itself , in forming , gives out its latent heat , and so tends to equalize the temperature . This explanation made it plain why dew forms on a clear night , when there are no clouds to reflect the radiant heat . Combined with Dalton 's theory that vapor is an independent gas , limited in quantity in any given space by the temperature of that space , it solved the problem of the formation of clouds , rain , snow , and hoar-frost . Thus this paper of Wells 's closed the epoch of speculation regarding this field of meteorology , as Mutton 's paper of 1781 had opened it . The fact that the volume containing Mutton 's paper contained also his epoch-making paper on Geology , finds curiously a duplication in the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the doctrine of natural selection was for the first time formulated , as Charles Darwin freely admitted after his own efforts had made the doctrine famous . Iv The very next year after Dr. Wells 's paper was published , there appeared in France the third volume of the lllemoires de Physique et de Chimie de la Societe d'Arcueil , and a new epoch in meteorology was inaugurated . The society in question was numerically an inconsequential band , listing only a dozen members . But every name was a famous one : Arago , Berard , Berthollet , Blot , Chaptal , de Candolle , Dulong , Gay-Lussac , Humboldt , Laplace , Poisson , and Thenard ? rare spirits every 1.72 THE CENTURY 'S PROGRESS IN METEOROLOGY one . Little danger that the memoirs of such a band would be relegated to the dusty shelves where most proceedings of societies belong ? no milk-for-babes fare would be served to such a company . The particular paper which here interests us closes this third and last volume of memoirs . It is entitled Des lignes isothermas et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The author is Alexander Humboldt . Needless to say , the topic is handled in a masterly manner . The distribution of heat on the surface of the globe , on the mountain-sides , in the interior of the earth ; the causes that regulate such distribution ; the climatic results ? these are the topics discussed . But what gives epochal character to the paper is the introduction of those isothermal lines , circling the earth in irregular course , joining together places having the same mean annual temperature , and thus laying the foundation for a science of comparative climatology . It is true the attempt to study climates comparatively was not new . Mairan had attempted it in those papers in which he developed his bizarre ideas as to central emanations of heat . Euler had brought his profound mathematical genius to bear on the topic , evolving the " extraordinary conclusion that under the equator at midnight the cold ought to be more rigorous than at the poles in winter . " And in particular Richard Kirwan , the English chemist , had combined the mathematical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Humboldt differs from all these predecessors in that he grasps the idea that the basis of all such computations should be not theory , but fact . IIe drew his isothermal lines not where some occult calculation would locate them on an ideal globe , .175 THE STORY OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY SCIENCE but where practical tests with the thermometer locate them on our globe as it is . London , for example , lies in the same latitude as the southern extremity of Hudson L'ay ; but the isotherm of London , as Humboldt outlines it , passes through Cincinnati . Of course such deviations of climatic conditions between places in the same latitude had long been known . As Humboldt himself observes , the earliest settlers of America were astonished to find themselves subjected to rigors of climate for which their European experience had not at all prepared them . Moreover , sagacious travellers , in particular Cook 's companion on his second voyage , young George Forster , had noted as a general principle that the western borders of continents in temperate regions are always warmer than corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general truth of temperatures being milder in the vicinity of the sea than in the interior of continents had long been familiar . But IIumboldt 's isotherrnal lines for the first time gave tangibility to these ideas , and made practicable a truly scientific study of comparative climatology . In studying these lines , particularly as elaborated by further observations , it became clear that they are by no means haphazard in arrangement , but are dependent upon geographical conditions which in most cases are not difficult to determine . Humboldt himself pointed out very clearly the main causes that tend to produce deviations from the average ? or , as Dove later on called it , the normal ? temperature of any given latitude . For example , the mean annual temperature of a region ( referring mainly to the northern hemisphere ) is raised by the proximity of a western coast ; by a divided config- // urationof the continent into peninsulas ; by the existence of open seas to the north or of radiating continental surfaces to the south ; by mountain ranges to shield from cold winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the absence of woods in a dry , sandy soil ; and by the serenity of sky in the summer months , and the vicinity of an ocean current bringing water which is of a higher temperature than that of the surrounding sea . Conditions opposite to these tend , of course , corre spondingly to lower the temperature . In a word , Hum boldt says the climatic distribution of heat depends on the relative distribution of land and sea , and on the " hypsometrical configuration of the continents " ; and he urges that " great meteorological phenomena can not be comprehended when considered independently of geognostic relations " ? a truth which , like most other general principles , seems simple enough once it is pointed out . With that broad sweep of imagination which charac terized him , Humboldt speaks of the atmosphere as the " aerial ocean , in the lower strata and on the shoals of which we live , " and he studies the atmospheric phe nomena always in relation to those of that other ocean of water . In each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in determinate direc tions , which enormously modify the climatic conditions of every zone . The ocean of air is a vast maelstrom , boiling up always under the influence of the sun 's heat at the equator , and flowing as an upper current towards either pole , while an under current from the poles , which becomes the trade-winds , flows towards the equator to supply its place . // But the superheated equatorial air , becoming chilled , descends to the surface in temperate latitudes , and continues its poleward journey as the anti-trade-winds . The trade-winds are deflected towards the west , because in approaching the equator they constantly pass over surfaces of the earth having a greater and greater velocity of rotation , and so , as it were , tend to lag behind ? an explanation which Hadley pointed out in 1735 , but which was not accepted until Dalton independently worked it out and promulgated it in 1793 . For the opposite reason , the anti-trades are deflected towards the east ; hence it is that the western borders of continents in temperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders lack this cold-dispelling influence . In the ocean of water the main currents run as more sharply circumscribed streams ? veritable rivers in the sea . Of these the best known and most sharply circumscribed is the familiar Gulf Stream , which has its origin in an equatorial current , impelled westward by trade-winds , which is deflected northward in the main at Cape St. Roque , entering the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico , to emerge finally through the Strait of Florida , and journey off across the Atlantic to warm the shores of Europe . Such , at least , is the Gulf Stream as Humboldt understood it . Since his time , however , ocean currents in general , and this one in particular , have been the subject of no end of controversy , it being hotly disputed whether either causes or effects of the Gulf Stream are just what Humboldt , in common with others of his time , conceived them to be . About the middle of the century , Lieutenant M. F. Maury , the distinguished American // hydrographer and meteorologist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currents , claiming that difference in density , due to difference in temperature and saltness , would sufficiently account for the oceanic circulation . This theory gained great popularity through the wide circulation of Maury 's Physical Geography of the Sea , which is said to have passed through more editions than any other scientific book of the // period ; but it was ably and vigorously combated by Dr. James Croll , the Scottish geologist , in his Climate and Time , and latterly the old theory that ocean currents are due to the trade-winds has again come into favor . Indeed , very recently a model has been constructed , with the aid of which it is said to have been demonstrated that prevailing winds in the direction of the actual tradewinds would produce such a current as the Gulf Stream . Meantime , however , it is by no means sure that gravitation does not enter into the case to the extent of producing an insensible general oceanic circulation , independent of the Gulf Stream and similar marked currents , and similar in its larger outlines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such oceanic circulation was first suggested in detail by Professor Lenz of St. Petersburg , in 1845 , but it was not generally recognized until Dr. Carpenter independently hit upon the idea more than twenty years later . The plausibility of the conception is obvious ; yet the alleged fact of such circulation has been hotly disputed , and the question is still sub judice . But whether or not such general circulation of ocean water takes place , it is beyond dispute that the recognized currents carry an enormous quantity of heat from the tropics towards the poles . Dr. Croll , who has perhaps given more attention to the physics of the subject than almost any other person , computes that the Gulf Stream conveys to the North Atlantic one-fourth as much heat as that body receives directly from the sun , and he argues that were it not for the transportation of heat by this and.similar Pacific currents , only a narrow tropical region of the globe would be warm enough for habitation by the existing faunas . Dr. Croll argues that // a slight change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believes has taken place at various periods in the past ) would suffice to so alter the equatorial current which now feeds the Gulf Stream that its main bulk would be deflected southward instead of northward , by the angle of Cape St. Roque . Thus the Gulf Stream would be nipped in the bud , and , according to Dr. Croll 's estimates , the results would be disastrous for the northern hemisphere . The anti-trades , which now are warmed by the Gulf Stream , would then blow as cold winds across the shores of western Europe , and in all probability a glacial epoch would supervene throughout the northern hemisphere . The same consequences , so far as Europe is concerned at least , would apparently ensue were the Isthmus of Panama , to settle into the sea , allowing the Caribbean current to pass into the Pacific . But the geologist tells us that this isthmus rose at a comparatively recent geological period , though it is hinted that there had been some time previously a temporary land connection between the two continents . Are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unions and disunions have juggled with the climate of the other hemisphere ? Apparently so , if the estimates made of the influence of the Gulf Stream be tenable . It is a far cry from Panama to Russia . Yet it seems within the possibilities that the meteorologist may learn from the geologist of Central America something that will enable him to explain to the paleontologist of Europe how it chanced that at one time the mammoth and rhinoceros roamed across northern Siberia , while at another time the reindeer and musk-ox browsed along the shores of the Mediterranean . // Possibilities , I said , not probabilities . Yet even the faint glimmer of so alluring a possibility brings home to one with vividness the truth of IIumboldt 's perspicuous observation that meteorology can be properly comprehended only when studied in connection with the companion sciences . There are no isolated phenomena in nature . v Yet , after all , it is not to be denied that the chief concern of the meteorologist must be with that other medium , the " ocean of air , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be accomplished by water currents in the way of conveying heat , it is the wind currents that effect the final distribution of that heat . As Dr. Croll has ' urged , the waters of the Gulf Stream do not warm the shores of Europe by direct contact , but by warming the anti-trade-winds , which subsequently blow across the continent . And everywhere the heat accumulated by water becomes effectual in modifying climate , not so much by direct radiation as by diffusion through the medium of the air . This very obvious importance of aerial currents led to their practical study long before meteorology had any title to the rank of science , and Dalton 's explanation of the trade-winds had laid the foundation for a science of wind dynamics before our century began . But no substantial further advance in this direction was effected until about 1827 , when Heinrich W. Dove , of Konigsberg , afterwards to be known as perhaps the foremost meteorologist of his generation , included the winds among the subjects of his elaborate statistical studies in climatology. // Dove classified the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great discovery was that all winds , of whatever character , and not merely the permanent winds , come under the influence of the earth 's rotation in such a way as to be deflected from their course , and hence to take on a gyratory motion ? that , in short , all local winds are minor eddies in the great polar-equatorial whirl , and tend to reproduce in miniature the character of that vast maelstrom . For the first time , then , temporary or variable winds were seen to lie within the province of law . A generation later , Professor William Ferrel , the // American meteorologist , who had been led to take up the subject by a perusal of Maury 's discourse on ocean winds , formulated a general mathematical law , to the effect that any body moving in a right line along the surface of the earth in any direction tends to have its course deflected , owing to the earth 's rotation , to the right hand in the northern and to the left hand in the southern hemispheres . This law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French physicist Poisson , but no one then thought of it as other than a mathematical curiosity ; its true significance was only understood after Professor Ferrel h ad independently rediscovered it ( just as Dalton rediscovered HIadley 's forgotten law of the tradewinds ) and applied it to the motion of wind currents . Then it became clear that here is a key to the phenomena of atmospheric circulation , from the great polarequatorial maelstrom which manifests itself in the tradewinds , to the most circumscribed riffle which is announced as a local storm . And the more the phenomena were studied , the more striking seemed the parallel between the greater maelstrom and these lesser eddies . Just as the entire atmospheric mass of each hemisphere is seen , when viewed as a whole , to be carried in a great whirl about the pole of that hemisphere , so the local disturbances within this great ' tide are found always to take the form of whirls about a local storm-centrewhich storm-centre , meantime , is carried along in the major current , as one often sees a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stream . Sometimes , indeed , the local eddy , caught as it were in an ancillary current of the great polar stream , is deflected from its normal course and may seem to travel against the stream ; but such deviations are departures // from the rule . In the great majority of cases , for ex. ample , in the north-temperate zone , a storm-centre ( with its attendant local whirl ) travels to the northeast , along the main current of the anti-trade-wind , of which it is a // part ; and though exceptionally its course may be to the southeast instead , it almost never departs so widely from the main channel as to progress to the westward . Thus it is that storms sweeping over the United States can be announced , as a rule , at the seaboard in advance of their coming by telegraphic communication from the interior , while similar storms come to Europe off the ocean unannounced . Hence the more practical availability of the forecasts of weather bureaus in the former country . But these local whirls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very general sense of the word , inasmuch as a single one may be more than a thousand miles in diameter , and a small one is two or three hundred miles across . But quite without regard to the size of the whirl , the air composing it conducts itself always in one of two ways . It never whirls in concentric circles ; it always either rushes in towards the centre in a descending spiral , in which case it is called a cyclone , or it spread 's out from the centre in a widening spiral , in which case it is called an anti-cyclone . The word cyclone is associated in popular phraseology with a terrific storm , but it has no such restriction in technical usage . A gentle zephyr flowing towards a " stormcentre " is just as much a cyclone to the meteorologist as is the whirl constituting a West- Indian hurricane . Indeed , it is not properly the wind itself that is called the cyclone in either case , but the entire system of whirls ? including the storm-centre itself , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , is this storm-centre ? Merely an area of low barometric pressure ? an area where the air has become lighter than the air of surrounding regions . Under // influence of gravitation the air seeks its level just as water does ; so the heavy air comes flowing in from all sides towards the low-pressure area , which thus becomes a " storm-centre . " But the inrushing currents never come straight to their mark . In accordance with Fer-rel 's law , they are deflected to the right , and the result , as will readily be seen , must be a vortex current , which whirls always in one direction ? namely , from left to right , or in the direction opposite to that of the hands of a watch held with its face upward . The velocity of the cyclonic currents will depend largely upon the dif-ference in barometric pressure between the storm-centre and the confines of the cyclone system . And the veloc-ity of the currents will determine to some extent the degree of deflection , and hence the exact path of the descending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every case and in every part of the cyclone system it is true , as Buys Ballot 's famous rule first pointed out , that a person standing with his back to the wind has the storm-centre at his left . The primary cause of the low barometric pressure which marks the storm-centre and establishes the cyclone is expansion of the air through excess of tem. perature . The heated air ; rising into cold upper regions , has a portion of its vapor condensed into clouds , and now a new dynamic factor is added , for each particle of vapor , in condensing , gives up its modicum of latent heat . Each pound of vapor thus liberates , according to Professor Tyndall 's estimate , enough heat to melt five pounds of cast iron ; so the amount given out where large masses of cloud are forming must enormously add to the convection currents of the air , and hence to the storm-developing power of the forming cyclone . In .. // deed , one school of meteorologists , of whom Professor Espy was the leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ augmenting the dynamic effects , no storm could long continue in violent action . And it is doubted whether any storm could ever attain , much less continue , the terrific force of that most dread-ed of winds of temperate zones , the tornado ? a storm which obeys all the laws of cyclones , but dffers from ordinary cyclones in having a vortex core only a few feet or yards in diameter ? without the aid of those great masses of condensing vapor which always accom-pany it in the form of storm-clouds . The anti-cyclone simply reverses the conditions of the cyclone . Its centre is an area of high pressure , and the air rushes out from it in all directions towards surround-ing regions of low pressure . As before , all parts of the current will be deflected towards the right , and the re-sult , clearly , is a whirl opposite in direction to that of the cyclone . But here there is a tendency to dissipa-tion rather than to concentration of energy , hence , con-sidered as a storm-generator , the anti-cyclone is of rela-tive insignificance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather bureau " ? as , for example , Sergeant Dunn , of the United States signal-service station in New York ? is so preoccupied with the observation of this phenomenon that cyclone-hunting might be said to be his chief pursuit . It is for this purpose , in the main , that government weather bureaus or signal-service de-partments have been established all over the world . Their chief work is to follow up cyclones , with the aid of telegraphic reports , mapping their course , and record-ing the attendant meteorological conditions . Their so- // called predictions or forecasts are essentially predications , gaining locally the effect of predictions because the telegraph outstrips the wind . At only one place on the globe has it been possible as yet for the meteorologist to make long-time forecasts meriting the title of predictions . This is in the middle Ganges Valley of northern India . In this country the climatic conditions are ' largely dependent upon the periodical winds called monsoons , which blow steadily landward from April to October , and seaward from October to April . The summer monsoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted in extent , there will be drought and consequent famine . And such restriction of the monsoon is likely to result when there has been an unusually deep or very Iate snowfall on the Himalayas , because of the lowering of spring temperature by the melting snow . Thus here it is possible , by observing the snowfall in the mountains , to predict with some measure of success the average rainfall of the following summer . The drought of 1896 , with the consequent famine and plague that devastated India last winter , was thus predicted some months in advance . This is the greatest present triumph of practical meteorology . Nothing like it is yet possible anywhere in temperate zones . But no one can say what may not be possible in times to come , when the data now being gathered all over the world shall at last be co-ordinated , classified , and made the basis of broad inductions . Meteorology is pre-eminently a science of the future . CHAPTER VI THE CENTURY 'S PROGRESS IN PHYSICS THE " IMPONDERABLES " I THERE were giants abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our century . Herschel , Lagrange , and Laplace ; Cuvier , Brongniart , and Lamarck ; Hum-boldt , Goethe , Priestley ? what need to extend the list ?  --  the names crowd upon us . But among them all there was no taller intellectual figure than that of a young Quaker who came to settle in London and practise the profession of medicine in the year 1801 . The name of this young aspirant to medical honors and emoluments was Thomas Young . He came fresh from professional studies at Edinburgh and on the Continent , and he had the theory of medicine at his tongue 's end ; yet his medical knowledge , compared with the mental treasures of his capacious intellect as a whole , was but as a drop of water in the ocean . For it chanced that this young Quaker physician was one of those prodigies who come but few times in a cen-tury , and the full list of whom in the records of history could be told on one 's thumbs and fingers . his biogra-phers tell us things about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere infant in arms he had // been able to read fluently . Before his fourth birthday came he had read the Bible twice through , as well as Watts 's h yrnns ? poor child ? ? and when seven or eight he had shown a propensity to absorb languages much as other children absorb nursery tattle and Mother Goose rhymes . When he was fourteen , a young lady visiting the household of his tutor patronized the pretty boy by asking to see a specimen of his penmanship . The pretty boy complied readily enough , and mildly rebuked his interrogator by rapidly writing some sentences for her in fourteen languages , including such as Arabian , Persian , and Ethiopic . Meantime languages had been but an incident in the education of the lad . IIe seems to have entered every available field of thought ? mathematics , physics , botany , literature , music , painting , Ianguages , philosophy , archmology , and so on to tiresome lengths ? and once he had entered any field he seldom turned aside until he had reached the confines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new from the recesses of his own genius . Ile was as versatile as Priestley , as profound as Newton himself . IIe had the range of a mere dilettante , but everywhere the full grasp of the master . He took early for his motto the saying that what one man has done , another man may do . Granting that the other man has the brain of a Thomas Young , it is a true motto . Such then was the young Quaker who came to London to follow out the humdrum life of a practitioner of medicine in the year 1801 . But incidentally the young physician was prevailed upon to occupy the interims of early practice by fulfilling the duties of the chair of Natural Philosophy at the Royal Institution , which Count Rumford // THE CENTURY 'S PROGRESS IN PHYSICS ity of insight which we call genius , he saw of a sudden that the phenomena could be explained by supposing that when rays of light fall on a thin glass , part of the rays being reflected from the upper surface , other rays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their course through the glass that the two sets would interfere with one another , the forward pulsation of one ray corresponding to the backward pulsation of another , thus quite neutralizing the effect . Some of the component pulsations of the light being thus effaced by mutual interference , the remaining rays would no longer give the optical effect of white light ; hence the puzzling colors . By following up this clew with mathematical precision , measuring the exact thickness of the plate and the space between the different rings of color , Young was able to show mathematically what must be the length of pulsation for each of the different colors of the spectrum . He estimated that the undulations of red light , at the extreme lower end of the visible spectrum , must number about 37,640 to the inch , and pass any given spot at a rate of 463 millions of millions of undulations in a second , while the extreme violet numbers 59,750 undulations to the inch , or 735 millions of millions to the second . Young similarly examined the colors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular testing the light from " Mr. Coventry 's exquisite micrometers , " which consist of lines scratched on glass at measured intervals . These microscopic tests brought the same results as the other experiments . The colors were produced at certain definite and measurable angles , and the theory of interference of undulations explained // them perfectly , while , as Young affirmed with confidence , no other theory hitherto advanced could explain them at all . Taking all the evidence together , Young declared that he considered the argument he had set forth in favor of the undulatory theory of light to be " sufficient and decisive . " This doctrine of interference of undulations was the absolutely novel part of Young 's theory . The allcompassing genius of Robert Hooke had , indeed , very nearly apprehended it more than a century before , as Young himself points out , but no one else had so much as vaguely conceived it ; and even with the sagacious Hooke it was only a happy guess , never distinctly outlined in his own mind , and utterly ignored by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he himself had fully formulated the theory , but he hastened then to give his predecessor all the credit that could possibly be adjudged his due by the most disinterested observer . To llooke 's contemporary , Iluyghens , who was the originator of the general doctrine of undulation as the explanation of light , Young renders full justice also . For himself he claims only the merit of having demonstrated the theory which these and a few others of his predecessors had advocated without full proof . The following year Dr. Young detailed before the Royal Society other experiments , which threw additional light on the doctrine of interference ; and in 1803 he cited still others , which , he affirmed , brought the doctrine to complete demonstration . In applying this demonstration to the general theory of light , he made the striking suggestion that " the luminiferous ether pervades the substance of all material bodies with little or no resistance , as freely , perhaps , as the wind passes // through a grove of trees . " IIe asserted his belief also that the chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visible spectrum are but still more rapid undulations of the same character as those which produce light . In his earlier lecture he had affirmed a like affinity between the light rays and the rays of radiant heat which Herschel detected below the red end of the spectrum , suggesting that " light differs from heat only in the frequency of its undulations or vibrations ? those undulations which are within certain limits with respect to frequency affecting the optic nerve and constituting light , and those which are slower and probably stronger constituting heat only . " From the very outset he had recognized the affinity between sound and light ; indeed , it had been this affinity that led him on to an appreciation of the undulatory theory of light . But while all these affinities seemed so clear to the great co-ordinating brain of Young , they made no such impression on the minds of his contemporaries . The immateriality of light had been substantially demonstrated , but practically no one save its author accepted the demonstration .

He occasionally wrote something touching on his theory , mostly papers contributed to the Quarterly Review and similar periodicals , anonymously or under a pseudonym , for he had conceived the notion that too great conspicuousness in fields outside of medicine would injure his practice as a physician .
