WHEN a man sets forth on an out-of-door pleasure trip , his prayer is for good weather . If he is going to the mountains , he may well double his urgency . In'the mountains , if nowhere else , weather is three fifths of life . My first run to New Hampshire the present season ( I say " first " by way of encouraging in myself the hope that this early visit may not prove to be the only one ) was made under smooth , high clouds , which left the distance clear , so that the mountains stood up grandly beyond the lake as we ran along its western shore . Not a drop of rain fell till I stepped off the car at Warren . At that moment the world grew suddenly dark , and before I could get into the open carriage the clouds burst , and with a rattling of thunderbolts a deluge of rain and hail fell upon us . There was no contending with such an enemy , though a good woman across the way , seeing our plight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I retreated to the station , while the driver hastened down the street to put his team under shelter . So a half hour passed . Then we tried again , and half frozen , in spite of a winter overcoat and everything that goes with it ( the date was May 17 ) , I reached my destination , five miles away , at the foot of Moosilauke . All this would hardly be worth recounting , perhaps ( the story of travelers ' discomforts being mostly matter for skipping ) , only that it was the beginning of a cold , rainy " spell " that hung upon us for four clays . Four sunless days out of seven seems an unrighteous proportion . The more I consider it , the truer seems the equation just now stated , that mountain weather is three fifths of life . For those four days I did not even see Mobsilanke , though I knew by hearsay that the summit house was visible from our back doorstep . My first brief walk before- supper should reasonably have been in the clearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and my feet ? which seem to feel that they are old enough by this time to know their master 's business ? took of their own motion an opposite course , straight toward the mountain forest , up through the cattle pasture , in which , under a pile of logs , the snow lay deep . The woods , from the inside , had the appearance of early March ; only the merest sprinkling of new life , ? dim tonia leaves especially , with here and there a round-leaved violet , both leaves and flowers , ? upon a ground still all defaced by the hand of Winter . Dead leaves make an agreeable carpet , as theyrustle cheerfully-sadly under one 's f eet in autumn ; but there was no rustle here ; the snow had pressed every leaf fiat and left it sodden . One thing was evident ; I had not arrived too late . The " bad-crowned spring " was yet to " go forth . " The next morning it was not enough to say that it was cloudy . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called , would have been quite inadequate . IVe were cloudy . In short , the cloud was literally around us and upon us . As I went out of doors , a rose-breasted grosbeak was singing in one direction . and a white-throated sparrow in another , both far away in the mist . It was strange that they should sing , thus wrapped in darkness , I was ready to say . But I he . thought myself that their case was no different from my own . It was comparatively clear just about MC , while the fog shut down like a curtain a rod or two away , leaving the rest of the world dark . So every bird stood in a ring of light , and sang to think himself so mach better off than all his fellows ! This time I took the downward road , turning to the left , and found myself at once in pleasant woods , with hospitable openings and bypaths ; a birdy spot , or I was no prophet , though just now but few voices were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood new-blown anemones , bellworts , and white violets , an early flock , with one painted trillion , lording it over them ; a small specimen of its kind , but big enough to be king ( or shepherd ) in such company . A brook , or perhaps two , with the few birds , sang about me , invisible . I knew not whither I was going , and the all-embracing cloud deepened the mystery . Soon the road took a sudden dip , and a louder noise filled my ears . I was coming to a river ? Yes , I was presently on the bridge , with a raging mountain torrent , eighty feet . perhaps , underneath , foaming against the boulders ; a bare , perpendicular cliff on one side , and perpendicular spruces and hemlocks draping a similar cliff on // the other side . It was Baker 's River , I was told afterward , ? the same that I had looked at here and there from the car window . It was good to see it so young and exuberant ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such haste , I thought . It would get to the sawmills soon enough , and by and by would learn , too late , that it is only a short course to the sea . Once over the bridge , the road climbed quickly out of the narrow gorge , and at the first turn brought me in sight of a small painted house , with a small orchard of thrifty-looking small trees behind it . here a venerable collie came running forth to bark at the stranger , but yielded readily to the usual blandishments , and after sniffing again and again at my heels , just to make sure of knowing me the next time , Went back , contented , to lie down in his old place before the windows . He was the only person that spoke to me ? the only one I met ? during the forenoon , though I spent the whole of it on the highway . Another patch of woods , where a distant Canadian nuthatch is calling ( strange how I love that nasal , penetrating voice , whose quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me another house , standing in broad acres of cleared land . This one is not painted , and , as I presently make out , is uninhabited , its old tenant gone , dead or discouraged , and no new one looked for ; an " abandoned farm , " such as one grows used to seeing in our northern country . It is beautiful for situation , one of those sightly places which the city-worn passer-by in a mountain wagon pitches upon at once as just the place he should like to buy and retire to ? some day ; in that autumn of golden leisure of which , now and then , " When all his active powers are still , " he has a pleasing vision . Oh yes , he means to do something of that kind ? some day ; and even while he talks of it he knows that " some day " is " next day after never . " A few happy barn swallows go skimming over the grass , and a pair of robins and a pair of bluebirds seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none the worse , we may be sure , ? the bluebirds , at least , ? because , along with the house and the barn , it is falling into decay . What are apple trees for , but to grow old and become usefully hollow ? Otherwise they would be no better than so many beeches or butternuts . It is impossible but that every creature should look at the world through its own eyes ; and no bluebird ever ate an apple . A purple finch crumbles ecstatically , a white-throated sparrow whistles in the distance , and now and then , from far down the slope , I catch the notes of a hermit thrush . A man grows thoughtful , not to say sentimental , in such a place , surrounded by fields on which so many years of human labor have been spent , so much ploughing and harrowing , planting and reaping , now given up again to nature . Here was the garden patch , its outlines still traceable . Here was the well . Long lines of stone wall still separate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields are heaps of boulders , thrown together thus to get them out of the grass 's way . About the edges of every pile , and sometimes through the midst of it , have sprung up a few shrubs , ? shadbushes , cherries , willows , and the like . Here they escape the scythe , as we are all trying to do . " Give us room that we may dwell ! " ? so these children of Zion cry . It is the great want of seeds , so many millions of which go to waste annually in every acre , ? a place in which to take root and ( harder yet ) to keep it . And the birds , too , find the boulder heaps a convenience . I watch a savanna sparrow as he flits from one to another , stopping to sing a strain or two from each . Even this humble , almost voiceless artist needs a stage or platform . The lowliest sparrow ever hatched has some rudiments of a histrionic faculty ; and it is hard to do one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these humble stone heaps may some I do not know ; no doubt they shelter many insects ; but it is encouraging to think how few things a farmer can do that will not be of benefit to others beside himself . Surely the man who piled these boulders for the advantage of his hay crop never expected them to serve as a text for preaching . The cloud drops again , and is at its old tricks of exaggeration . A bird that I take for a robin turns out to be a sparrow . Did it look larger because it seemed to be farther away ? Or is it seen now as it really is , my vision not being deceived , but rather corrected of an habitual error ? The fog makes for me a newer and stranger world , at any rate ; I am farther from home because of it ; another day 's travel would scarcely have done more for me . And for all that , I am not sorry when it rises again , and the hills come oat . How beautiful they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , when the June foliage replaces the square miles of bare boughs which now give them a blue-purple tint , interrupted here and there by patches of new yellow-green poplar leaves ? a veritable illumination , sun-bright even in this sunless weather ? o ? a few sombre evergreens . I am going nowhere , although I have discovered by this time that the road , if it were followed far enough , would take me over Mount Cushman to North Woodstock . Cumbered with wet-weather garments as I am , that would be too long a jaunt . I shall walk till I turn back , and am contented to have it so . As I get away from the farm , the mountain woods on either side of use seem to be filled with something like a chorus of rose-breasted grosbeaks . Except for a few days at Highlands , North Carolina , some years ago , I have never seen somany together . A grand migratory wave of them must have broken on the mountains within a night or two . As far as music is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grouse beats his drum at short intervals , and now and then a white-throat whistles . There is no bird 's voice to which a fog is more becoming , I say to myself , with a pleasing sense of having said smug-thing new . To my thinking , the white-throat should always be a good distance away ( perhaps because in the mountains one grows accustomed to hearing him so ) ; and the fog puts him there , with no damage to the fullness of his tone . Looking at the flowers along the wayside , ? a few yellow violets and a patch of spring-beauties , and little else , ? notice what seems to be a miniature forest of curious tiny plants growing in the gutter . At first I see only the upright , whitish stalks , an inch or two in height , each bearing at the top a globular brown knob . Afterward I discover that the stalks , which , examined ' more closely , have a crystalline , glassy appearance , spring from a leaf-like or lichen-like growth , lying prostrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or scale-moss , of some kind , I suppose ( but this is guesswork ) , and may be a Pellia , to judge from the plate in Gray 's Manual . Whatever it is , it is growing here by the mile . How few are the things we see ' . And of those we see , how few there are concerning which we have any real knowledge , ? enough , even , to use words about them ( When a man can do that concerning any class of natural objects , no matter what they are or what he says about them , he passes with the crowd for a scholar , or at the very least for a " close observer . " ) But to tell the shameful truth , my mood just now is not inquisitive . I should like to know ? Yes ; but I can get on without knowing . There are worse things than ignorance . Let this plant be what it will . I should be little the wiser for being able to name // it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new one ; and unrelated knowledge is almost the same as no knowledge at all . At best it is quickly forgotten . So my indolence excuses itself . The road begins to climb rather sharply . Unless I am going to the top and beyond , I have gone far enough . So I turn my back upon the mountain ; and behold , the cloud having lifted again , there , straight before me down the road and across the valley , is the house from which I set out , almost or quite the only one in sight . After all , I have gone but a little way , though I have been long about it ; for I have hardly begun my return before I find myself again approaching the abandoned farm . Downhill miles are short . Here a light shower comes on , and I raise my umbrella . Then follows a grand excitement among a flock of sheep , whose day , perhaps , needs enlivening as badly as my own . They gaze at the umbrella , - start away upon the gallop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking like one , " I say to myself , smiling at my propensity for quoting Wordsworth ) , and are again struck with panic . This time they scamper down the field out of sight . Another danger escaped l Shepherds , it is evident , are not so effeminate as to carry umbrellas . Probably they do not wear spectacles , ? happy men , ? and so are not in danger of being blinded by a few drops of moisture . Two heifers are of a more confiding disposition , coming close to look at the stranger as he sits on the doorsill of the old barn . Their curiosity concerning me is perhaps about as lively as mine was touching the supposed liverworts . Like ? me they stand and consider , but betray no unmannerly eagerness . " Who is he , I wonder ? " they might be saying . " I never saw miss before . " But their jaws still move mechanically , and their beautiful eyes are full of a peaceful satisfaction . A cud must be a great alleviation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one ever be fretted into nervous prostration ? As a matter of fact , I believe that cows never suffer from that most distressing malady . The secret of health and happiness is to be always employed , but never hurried . I have seen chewers of gum who seemed to have learned the cows ' lesson . While the heifers are still making up their minds about me I turn to examine a couple of white-crowned sparrows , male and female , ? I wonder if they really are a couple ? ? feeding before the house . I hope the species is to prove common here . Three birds were behind the hotel before breakfast , and one of them sang . The quaint little medley , sparrow song and warbler song in one , is still something of an event with me , I have heard it so seldom and like it so well ; and whether the birds sing or not , they are musical to look at . When I approach the painted house , on my way homeward , the fat old collie comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he takes but one sniff . He has made a mistake , and realizes it at once . " Oh , excuse me , " he says quite plainly . " I did n't recognize you . You ' re the same old codger . I might to have known . " And he is so confused and ashamed that he runs away without waiting to make up . It is a great mortification to a gentlemanly dog to find himself at fault in this way . I remember another collie , much younger than this one , with whom I once had a minute or two of friendly intercourse . Then , months afterward , I went again by the house where he lived , and lie came dashing out with all fierceness , as if he would rend me in pieces . I let him come ( there was nothing else to do , or nothing else worth doing ) , but the instant his nose struck me lie saw his error . Then , in a flash , he dropped flat on the ground , and literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to express the depth of his humiliation . And then , like the dog of this morning , he jumped up , and ran with all speed back to his doorstep . Another descent into the gorge of Baker 's River , and another stop on the bridge ( how gloriously the water comes down I ) , and I am again in the pretty , broken woods below the hotel . Here my attention is attracted by an almost prostrate but still vigorous yellow birch , like the one that stood for so many years by the road below the Profile House , in the Franconia Notch . Somehow the tree got a strong slant in its youth , and has always kept it , while the branches have all grown straight upward , at right angles with the parent trunk , as if each were trying to be a tree on its own account . The Franconia Notch specimen became a landmark , and was really of no small service ; a convenience to the hotel proprietors , and a means of health to idle boarders , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s walk down to the bent tree , " one would say to another . The average American can not stroll ; he has never learned ; if he puts his legs in motion , lie must go to some fixed point , though it be only a milestone or a huckleberry bush . The infirmity is most likely congenital , a taint in the blood . The fathers worked , ? all honor to them , ? having to earn their bread under hard conditions ; and the children , though they may dress like the descendants of princes , can not help turning even their amusements into a stint . And the sapient critic ? Well , instead of carrying a fishing rod or walking to heat tree , he had come out with an opera glass , and had made of his morning jaunt a bird-cataloguing expedition . Considered in that light , the trip had not been a brilliant success . In my whole forenoon I had seen and heard but twenty-eight species . If I had stayed in my low-country village , and walked half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I should not have enjoyed myself one quarter as well . The next day and the next were rainy , with Moosilauke still invisible . Then came a morning of sunshine and clear atmosphere . So far it was ideal mountain weather ; but the cold wind was so strong at our level that it was certain to be nothing less than a hurricane at the top . I waited , therefore , twenty . four hours longer . Then , at quarter before seven on the morning of May 23 , I set out . I am as careful of ray dates , it seems , as if I had been starting for the North Pole . And why not ? The importance of an expedition de . pends upon the spirit in which it is undertaken . Nothing is of serious consequence in this world except as subjective considerations make it so . Even the North Pole is only an imaginary point , the end of an imaginary - line , as old geographies used to inform us , pleonastically , ? as if " position without dimensions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could be other than imaginary . I started , then , at quarter before seven . Many years ago had been taken up the mountain road in a carriage ; now I would travel it on foot , spending at least an hour upon each of its five miles , and no see something of the mountain itself , as well as of the prospect from the summit . The miles , some longer , some shorter , as I thought ( a not unpleasant variety , though the fourth stage was excessively spun out , it seemed to me , perhaps to make it end at the spring ) , are marked off by guideboards , so that the newcomer need not fall into the usual disheartening mistake of supposing himself almost at the top before he has gone halfway . As for the first mile , which must ' measure near a mile and a half , and which ends just above the " second brook " ( every mountain path has its natural waymarks ) , I had been over it twice within the last few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hut , with one excuse and another , I managed racily enough to give it its full hour . Fur one thing , a hairy woodpecker detained me live or ten minutes , putting such tremendous vigor into his hammering that I was positively certain ( with a shade of uncertainty , nevertheless , such as all observers " will understand ; there is nothing so true as a paradox ) that he must be a pileutus , till at last he showed himself . " Well , well , " said I , " guessing is a poor business . " It was well I had stayed by . The forest was so nearly deserted , so little animated , that I felt under obligation to the fellow for every stroke of his mallet . Though a man goes to the wood for silence , his ear craves some natural noises , ? enough , at least , to make the stillness audible . The second mile is of steeper grade than the first , and toward the close brought me suddenly to a place unlike anything that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For an acre , or , more likely , for two or three acres , the ground ? a steep , sunny expsure ? was covered with plants in bloom : Dutchman's-breeches ( Dicentra cumllaria ) , ? bunches of heart-shaped , cream-white flowers with yellow facings , looking for all the world as if they had been planted there ; round-leaved violets in profusion ; white violets ( Maeda ) ; spring-beauties ; adder's-tongue ( dog's-tooth violet ) ; and painted trillium . A pretty show ; pretty in itself , and a thousand times prettier for being come upon thus unexpectedly , after two hours of woods that were almost as dead as winter . Only a little way above this point were the first beds of snow ; and henceforward till I came out upon the ridge , two miles above , the woods were mostly filled with it , though there was little in the road . About this time , also , I began to notice a deer 's track . He had descended the road within a few hours , as I judged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-legged , or even a one-legged animal , so far as his footsteps showed . I should rather have seen him , but the hoofprints were much better than nothing ; and undoubtedly I saw them much longer than I could possibly have seen the maker of them , and so got out of them more of companionship . They were with sue for two hours , ? clean up to the ridge , and part way across it . Somewhere between the third and fourth mileboards I stopped short with an exclamation . There , straight before me , over the long eastern shoulder of Moosilauke , beyond the big Jobildunk Ravine , loomed or floated a shining snow-white mountain top . Nothing could have been more beautiful . It was the crest of Mount Washington , I assumed , though even with the aid of a glass I could make out no sign of buildings , which must have been matted with new-fallen snow . I took its identity for granted , I say . The truth is , I became badly confused about it afterward , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfamiliar aspect ; but later still , on arriving at the summit , found that my first idea had been correct . That sudden , heavenly apparition gave me one of those minutes that are good as years . Once , indeed , in early October , I had seen Mount Washington when it ' was more resplendent : freshly snow-covered throughout , and then , as the sun went down , lighted up before my eyes with a rosy glow , brighter and brighter , till the mountain seemed all on fire within . But even that unforgettable spectacle had less of unearthly beauty , was less a work of pure enchantment , I thought , than this detached , fleecy-looking piece of aerial whiteness , cloud stuff or dream stuff , yet whiter than any cloud , lying at rest yonder , almost at my own level , against the deep blue of the forenoon sky . All this while , the birds , which had been few from the start , ? black-throated greens and blues , Blackburnians , ovenbirds , a bay-breast , blue yellow-backs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter wrens , rose-breasted grosbeaks , chickadees , grouse , and snowbirds , ? had grown fewer and fewer , till at last , among these stunted , low-branched spruces , with the snow under them , there was little else but an occasional myrtle warbler ( " The brave myrtle , " I kept saying to myself ) , with its musical , soft trill , so out of place , ? the voice of peaceful green valleys rather than of stormy mountain tops , ? yet so welcome . Once a gray-checked thrush called just above me . These impenetrable upper woods are the gray-cheeks ' summer home , ? a good one ; but I heard nothing of their wild music , and doubted whether they had yet arrived in full summer force . It was past eleven o'clock when I came out at the clearing by the woodpile , with half the world before me . From this point it was but a little way to the bare ridge connecting the South Peak ? up the shoulder of which I had been trudging all the forenoon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , which looked as if it were in danger of sliding off the mountain northward , was straight before me across the ravine , a. long but easy mile away . On the ridge I found myself all at once in something like a gale of ice-cold wind . Who could have believed it ? It was well I bad brought a sweater ; and my next move must be to put it on . A lucky clump of low evergreens not far ahead offered me shelter . There , squatting behind the trees , I took off my hat , my coat , and my spectacles ( the last with special precautions , having broken my only spare ones two days before ) , and wormed my way into the most comfortable of all garments for such a place , ? as good , at least , as two overcoats . Now let the wind whistle , especially as it was at my back , and was bearing me triumphantly up the slope . So I thought , bravely enough , till the trail took a sudden shift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sang out of the other corner of my mouth , as I used to hear country people say . I no longer boast . eel , but saved my breath for better use . Wind or no wind , it is an exhilaration to walk here above the world . Once a bird chirps to me timidly from the knee-wood close by . I answer him , and out peeps a white-throat . " You here ! " he says . " So early ! " At my feet is plenty of Greenland sandwort , ? faded , winter-worn , gray-green tufts , packed among the small boulders . Whatever lives here must sit low and hang on . And with it is the shiny-leaved mountain cranberry , ? Vaceinium Vitis - Ma ? .. Let me never omit that pretty name . Neither cranberry nor sandwort shows any sign of blossom or bud as yet ; but it is good to know that they will both be ready when the clock strikes . I can see them now , pink and white , just as they will look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand years hence . Again my course alters , and the wind lets me lean back upon it as it lifts me forward . Who says we are growing old ? The years , as they pass , may turn and look at us meaningly , as if to say , " You have lived long enough ; " yet even to us the climbing of a mountain road ( though by this time it must be a road , or something like it ) is still only the putting of one foot before the other . So I come at last to the top , and make haste to get into the lee of the house , which is-tightly barred , of course , just as its owners left it seven or eight months ago . The wind chases me round the corners , one after another ; but by searching I discover a nook where it can hit me no more than half the time . Here I sit and look at the mountains , ? a glorious company : Mount Washington and its fellows , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twins on this side of them ; and , nearer still , the long , sharp , purple crest of dear old Lafayette and his southern neighbors . So many I can name . The rest are moan- tains only ; a wilderness of heaped-up , feast-covered land ; a prospect to dilate the soul . My expectation has been to stay here for two hours or more ; but the wind is merciless , and after going out over the broad , bare , boulder - sprinkled summit till l can see down into Franconia ( which looks pretty low and pretty far off , though I make out certain of the buildings clearly enough ) , I begin to feel that I shall enjoy the sight of my eyes better from some sheltered position on the upper part of the road . Even on the ridge , however , I take advantage of every tuft of spruces to stand still for a bit , looking especially at the mountain itself , so big , so bare , and so solid : East Peak , South Peak , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is in the slightest degree peaked , with the great gulf of Jobildunk ? in which Baker 's River rises ? wedged between them . If the word Moosilauke means a " bald place , " as it is said to do , then we have here another proof of the North American Indian 's genius for fitting words to things . ' Even to-day , windy and cold as it is , a butterfly passes over now and then ( mostly roil admirals ) , and smaller insects flit carelessly about . Insects are capable mountaineers , as I have often noticed . The only time I was ever on the sharp point of Mount Adams , where my companion and I had barely room to stand together , the air about our heads was black with insects of all sorts and sires , a veritable cloud ; and when we unscrewed the Appalachian Club 's brass bottle to sign the roll of visitors , we found that the signers before us , after putting down a date and their names , had added , " Plenty of bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black flies than once , years ago , on this very summit of Moosilauke . All the hours of a long , breath less , tropical July And if New Hampshire people will call the mountain " Moose Hillock , " as , alas , they will , then we have here another proof of the degen day they made life miserable for me . Better a thousand times such a frosty , man-compelling wind as I am now fleeing from . Once off the ridge , I can loosen my hat and sit down in comfort . The sun is good . flow incredible it seems that the air is so furiously in motion only fifty rods back ! Here it is like Elysium . And almost 1 believe that this limited prospect is better than the grander sweep from the summit itself , ? less distracting and more restful . So half a loaf may be better than a whole one , if a man can not be contented without trying to eat the whole one . A white-throat and a myrtle warbler sing to me as I nibble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems . I take off my hat to them . Already I am down far enough to hear the sound of running water ; and every rod brings a new mountain into view from behind the long East Peak . One of the best of them all is cone-shaped Kearsarge , topped with its house . Now the white crest of Washington rises upon me , ? snow with the sun on it ; and here , by the fourth mileboard , are a few pale-bright spring-beauties , ? five or six blossoms only . They have found a bit of earth from which the snow melted early , and here they are , true to their name , with the world about them all a wintry desolation . If it is time for myrtle warblers , why not for them ? Now I see not only Washington , but the mountains with it , all strangely foreshortened , so as to give the highest peak a most surprising preeminence . No wonder I was in doubt what to call it . In ( lays past I have walked that whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am to remember it . A inan should do such things while he can , letting his heart cheer him . A turn in the road , and straight below eracy which follows the white man 's addiction to the punning habit . me lies my deserted farmhouse . Another turn , and I lose it . In ascending a mountain we face the path ; in descending we face the world . I say this because at this moment I am looking down a charming vista , ? forest-covered mountains , row beyond row . But for the gravel under my feet I might be a thousand miles from any human habitation . Presently a Swainson thrush whistles . By that token I am getting away from the summit , though the world is still all wintry , with no sign of bud or blossom . And look ! What is that far below me , facing up the road ? A four-footed animal of some kind . A bear ? No ; I raise my glass , and see a porcupine . He has his mobile , sensitive nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps to feed , as I draw nearer and nearer . By and by , being very near , and still unworthy of the creature 's notice , I roll a stone toward him . At this he shows a gleans of interest . He site up , folds his hands , ? or puts his fore paws together over his breast , ? looks at me , and then waddles a few steps toward the upper side of the road . " I most be getting out of this , " he seems to think . But he reconsiders his purpose , conies back , sits on end again and folds his hands ; and then , the reconnoissance being satisfactory , falls to smelling the ground as before . I can see the tips of his nostrils twitching . There must be something good under them . Meantime , with my glass up , I come closer and closer , till I ant right upon him . If porcupines can shoot , I must be in danger of a quill . Another step or two , and he waddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacillating body , however ; and once more lie turns to sit up and fold his hands . This time I hear him rattling his teeth , but not very fiercely , ? nothing to compare with the sound of an angry woodchuck ; and at last , when I cluck to him , he hastens his steps a little , as much , perhaps , as a porcupine can , and disappears in the brush , dragging his ridiculous , sloping , straw . thatched hinder parts ? a combination of lean-to and L ? after him . He has never cultivated speed or decision of character , having a better defense . So far as appearances go , he is certainly an odd one . There are no blossoms yet , nor any promise of any , but once in a while a bright Atalanta ( red admiral ) butterfly flits before me . I wonder if I could cap . turn one by the old schoolboy method I am moved to try ; but my best effort ? not very determined , it must be confessed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though she drops no golden apples . At last I come to a few adder's-tongues , the first flowers since the live or six spring-beauties a mile stud a half back . I ant approaching the Flower Garden , it appears . Here is a most lovely bank of yellow violets , a hundred or two together , a real bed of them . Nobody ever saw anything prettier . Hose , also , is the showy purple trillium , not so badly overgrown as it sometimes is , in addition to all the flowers that I noticed on the ascent . A garden indeed . I pull up a root of Dutchman's-breeches , and sit down to examine the cluster of rice-like pink kernels at the base of the stem . Excellent fodder they must make for animals of some kind . " Squirrel-corn " is an apt name , I think , though I believe it is applied , not to this species , but to its relative , Dicentra Canadensis . The whole plant is uncommonly clean-looking and pretty , with its pale , finely cut leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and then at a bank of rotund-leaved violets opposite , I say cure more , " Those are my flowers . " Something in the shade of color is most exactly to my taste . The very sight of them gladdens me like sunshine . But before I get out of the garden , as I am in no haste to do ( if it was attractive this morning , it is doubly so now , after those miles of snow banks ) , I am near to // changing my mind ; for suddenly , as my eye follows the border of the road , it falls upon a small blue violet , the first one of that color that I have seen since my arrival at Moosilauke . It must be my long-desired Selleirkii , I say to myself , and down I go to look at it . Yes , it is not leafy-stemmed , the petals are not bearded , and the leaves are unlike any I have ever seen . I take it up , root and all , and search carefully till I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel sure it is , ' then I am happy . This is the one species of our eastern North American violets that I have never picked . It completes my set . And it is especially good to find it here , where I was not in the least expecting it . With the two specimens in my pocket I trudge the remaining two miles in high spirits . The violets are no newer to me than the liverwort specimens on Mount Cush-men were , but they have the incompacable advantage of things long looked for , ? things for the lack of which , so to speak , a pigeonhole in the mind has stood vacant . Blessed are they who want something , for when they get it they will be glad . The weather below had been warm and still , a touch of real summer . So said the people at the hotel ; and I knew it already ; for , as I came through the cattle pasture , I saw below use a new , strange - looking , brightly illuminated grove of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Ithouglt . A single day had covered them witls sunny , yellow-green leaves , till the change was like a miracle . Indeed , it was a miracle . May the spring never come when I shall fail to feel it so . Then I looked back at the summit . Was it there , no farther away than that , that so icy a wind chased me about ? ? or had I been in Greenland ?
