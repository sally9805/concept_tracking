JOHNSON Oh , I 'm a widow , and we have our rules ; besides we always play the game fair . MRS . FRANK MORLEY I 'm tired of being left alone by Frank , I like to be amused , and I like to be admired . MRS . JOHNSON Of course you do !

FRANK MORLEY Yes , I do , though everyone does n't think so . MRS . JOHNSON Never mind that now . Your Frank is a man worth loving . MRS . FRANK MORLEY You did n't love your husband . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was too young to know real love when I came across it ! You know what sort of a man Charlie Johnson turned out . Ran away in twelve months with a woman who had trained birds at a music hall ! I supposed she tried her methods on my bird , for he came back to me shortly with hardly a feather left and died . That 's my cynical history . And it 's left me without a heart . MRS . FRANK MORLEY You 're lucky . MRS . JOHNSON Nonsense ! Listen ! I 've tried to be a good sister to you . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Dear Nellie . You 've been the best sister in the world ; and father and mother beside . p. 11 MRS . JOHNSON I promised myself to do my best that day years ago , you and I came home from the little church yard at Canton so awfully alone . ( Choking up . ) ( GRACE goes beside her chair and kisses her . ) Throw over this Heathcote Grace , it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him . MRS . JOHNSON How can you , he 's absurd ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY He amuses me  --  he entertains me . Other women have devoted admirers  --  you have twenty , why should n't I have one . MRS . JOHNSON Other women do n't count  --  most of ' em have n't anything to lose , you have . MRS . FRANK MORLEY He loves me . MRS . JOHNSON Grace , do you honestly believe that when a man tells you . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Lord Heathcote is a gentleman . ( She passes behind MRS . J. Table . ) MRS . JOHNSON He is evidently willing to compromise you . I 'm afraid we do n't agree on the definition of the word  --  gentleman . MRS . FRANK MORLEY ( Timidly . ) You did n't know perhaps he 's descended from Cardinal Wolsey . p. 12 MRS . JOHNSON What an awful tumble from Cardinal Wolsey to that ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY ( Coming down to C. ) I resent your speaking of my friend as you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can resent all you like . I 'm going to save a scandal if I can and I 'm not the only one capable of getting on to things in this house . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Do you mean that Frank  --  ( Takes her hand . ) MRS . JOHNSON Morley &amp; Co. ? O dear No . He would n't be likely to see you fall unless you were on the stock market ! But  --  there 's another pair of eyes in the house now  --   --  ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY My brother-in-law ? MRS . JOHNSON Exactly , the Globe Trotter , he 's very wide awake . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Nell ! You do n't think  --   --  ? MRS . JOHNSON Not yet , but he 's looking for trouble , I believe . Can you face a scandal Grace dear ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY No ! No ! MRS . JOHNSON Good . Then brace up . Throw Cardinal Wolsey 's little grand nephew down . ( Sits on chair F. ) p. 13 MRS . FRANK MORLEY It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully kind , and I 've  --  Nell , I 've been very foolish . No , no , I ca n't , I dare n't . MRS . JOHNSON Are there any letters ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY Yes . MRS . JOHNSON That Frank must n't see ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY I 'd rather die than he saw them . ( Moving away to table I. ) MRS . JOHNSON ( Rising . ) You little fool ! ( Going to GRACE . ) Oh , it takes these young married women to make real exhibitions of themselves ! You do n't catch us widows writing letters . Why , even a " no sig " telegram is n't safe any more . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Nell , I wanted to make Frank jealous , so he 'd stay home with me more , and go out with me . But he never even noticed . That made me angry , somehow , and I  --  I went on like a fool ! Bertie Heathcote did seem to adore me , and I liked to be adored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out of this  --  get me out of it without a scandal , for God 's sake . ( A pause . ) ( Left of stage . ) MRS . JOHNSON I 'll do my best dear . I 'm not a life preserver by birth , but I 'll do my best . ( MRS . J. moves above GRACE . ) ( BOLES enters door R. and announces LORD HEATHCOTE . ) ( On this MRS . J. makes a slight movement as of departure. ) p. 14 BOLES Lord Heathcote . MRS . FRANK MORLEY ( To MRS . J. ) Do n't go . ( GRACE holds MRS . J. by the hand and crosses her to R. C. to meet BERTIE . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( Enters door R. , saying . ) Ah ! ( Very gaily . ) ( Sees MRS . J. and adds . ) Oh ! ! ( In a disappointed tone . ) ( BERTIE moves down between the two tables B. and E and shakes GRACE 'S hand . ) ( MRS . J. has crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Good morning . MRS . JOHNSON Good morning , good morning , Bertie . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Now really , Bertie , I 've never given you the right , I do n't like your taking that liberty with me . MRS . JOHNSON O very well ! I beg ten thousand pardons Lord Albert Edward Heathcote . Good morning ( shakes hands ) . You little lord . I 'll call you Bertie if I want to . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Stop quarrelling and sit down . ( BERTIE moves R. seeking his armchair , then goes up between wall and table B. , down again between the two tables B. and E. and seats himself in armchair D. right of the centre table . MRS . J. has moved down above the table beside GRACE. ) p. 15 LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I say , where 's my armchair ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY ( Laughing . ) Oh , it 's on the balcony , at the corner window with other chairs . We shall have to install ourselves there presently to see the procession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do for the present . ( Sits D. ) MRS . JOHNSON You are a spoiled darling . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( Rather pleased . ) Nonsense ! You 're joking again . ( To GRACE . ) Make her stop ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY I ca n't ! ( Sitting on C. ) She treats me the same way . It was good of you to come early . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE The early bird ; Quack ! ( Lifting his elbows up and down . ) MRS . JOHNSON ( Smiling . ) What a pretty compliment . I believe worm that you have something to say to Lord Heathcote . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Mrs. Morley and I are never at a loss for agreeable topics of conversation . MRS . JOHNSON Then this is where I make myself scarce . p. 16 LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Tact ! ( He rises and moves a little R. ) ( GRACE rises . ) MRS . JOHNSON ( To him . ) Good-bye ! ( She moves towards door L. , followed by GRACE to whom she speaks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of an hour to break it off , and mind you do it . Good-bye Bertie . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Good-bye Nellie . ( Exits MRS . J. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I thought she did n't like me ! But here she is playing right in our hands . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Bertie . ( She goes to L. side of table E. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE What 's up ? ( HE returns and moves armchair D. ) MRS . FRANK MORLEY Something very serious . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE O , Little Tots is ill . ( Sits . ) MRS . FRANK MORLEY No , the dog is all right thanks . ( Sits chair F. ) The serious thing is that our  --  that we  --  well it 's got to stop , here , now . p. 17 LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I say , you 're joking . MRS . FRANK MORLEY It 's nothing to joke about . It 's very simple , but I 'm in earnest . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Do n't you like me any more ? MRS . FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  Do n't be silly ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY You do n't realize do you how serious all this is ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Well rather ! I love you Grace . MRS . FRANK MORLEY No you do n't and I do n't love you  --  but we 've played a wicked game with fire , and  --   --  Why , Nell , thinking it only a flirtation is angry . If she knew the truth ! LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( Interrupting . ) O , what 's the matter ? Has Morley been putting his nose into our business ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY Let 's not speak of my husband please . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Look here Grace , you do n't know what you 're talking about . I may be all sorts of a fool , but a fool has a heart if he has n't brains , and any way I love you ; yes I do really love you a heap . I do n't know why I love you , but I do ! I say Grace old girl , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden like this . ( Rising and going to fireplace before GRACE , his hands in his pockets . ) Why I 've given up all my bad habits for you ! I have really . Ask the girls . ( Quickly. )  --  er  --  I mean ask the boys . I 've made great sacrifices , I have really ! I never devoted myself to only one woman before . It 's meant giving up a great deal to me and it  --  you  --  well  --  I must own I feel it very hard lines . p. 18 MRS . FRANK MORLEY But it was all wrong . We were drifting in a false direction . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Still , it was jolly nice drifting . ( HE turns and moves toward her , moving over to her touches her . ) MRS . FRANK MORLEY Sit down , besides someone is watching us . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Who 's the silly ass ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY Jim  --  my brother-in-law , who arrived on the scene last week . Suppose he suspected something  --  suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind table E. ) It would kill me ! You do n't know how true and strong a man my husband  --   --  LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes , I do , because I am the same , too , and that 's why I 've protected you so . ( He comes down to table E. ) I love you Grace , I do really , and yet you must confess I 've been most circumspect , have n't I ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY Yes  --   --  LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE And now for my climax . ( Sits on table E. ) I 've taken a little flat ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY Have you ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE So you could come and have afternoon tea with me there . p. 19 MRS . FRANK MORLEY And do you think I 'll ever put my foot in your little flat ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE You must now , I 've taken it for a month and paid in advance . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Ask some other foolish friend to tea . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE No Grace  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand me . I love you really . I associated you now with this little home . I could never dream of loving another woman  --  not in that same flat ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY ( Laughing . ) Sub-let ! ( Rises and goes to table I. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Do n't . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Where is this little flat ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE 36 rue de Preeoy . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Hah ! really ! You 've chosen next door to my sister , Mrs. Johnson 's . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I say ; that 's one on me ! But why do you change like this ? You did care for me , I know you did . MRS . FRANK MORLEY I was lonely , you amused me ! I wanted attention  --  you gave it to me . I wanted to make my husband jealous , you were useful . Do you call that love Bertie ? p. 20 LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes , sort of . Better than nothing  --  go on , keep it up . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEATHCOTE Do n't say that  --  you make me suffer , you do really . MRS . FRANK MORLEY I 'm sorry  --  ( Sit . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Well , you do n't show it . You propose breaking off with me after having made me your abject slave . It will ruin my life , it will really Grace , it will ruin it for weeks . MRS . FRANK MORLEY But if I must . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE You must n't . ( Encircle chair F. ) Your reason wo n't hold water  --  ( Encircle again . ) I have n't compromised you , and I wo n't and so I refuse to accept your dismissal . ( Encircle a third time . ) You know you 'd miss me , you know you would awfully . MRS . FRANK MORLEY And suppose I did . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE If you insist on our separating , I 'll suffer a great deal more than I 'd show . I wo n't show you because I 'd look silly  --  but I 'll feel a jolly lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. GRACE draws near him. ) p. 21 MRS . FRANK MORLEY REALLY ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE REALLY . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Bertie , that 's sincere , is it ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE GRACE ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY I 'm sorry  --  I 'm doing wrong to everyone . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I say . The conversation we 've just had has n't taken place ! eh ? All that rot is done for ! completely done for . ( He moves up to door R.  --  and moves down again continuing . ) I 've just arrived ; I 'm entering your drawing-room . Good afternoon , charmer , how are you ? He kisses her hand and repeats the business of his entrance . ) ( MRS . JOHNSON enters L. , and surveys them with astonishment . ) ( BERTIE C.  --  GRACE  --  R. C.  --  MRS . J. , L. C. ) MRS . JOHNSON Well , I never ! ( Comes down between table I. and chair F. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( Moves up to her . ) Ah , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just been proposing to me . ( He meets MRS . J. ) p. 22 MRS . JOHNSON It looked as if you were doing the proposing . But I can guess . She 's been suggesting you break off this ridiculous affair of yours . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE " Ridiculous " ! MRS . JOHNSON I can use a much worse word if you want it . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( Cries out . ) O ! A light breaks through me . MRS . JOHNSON Mercy ! Your brain must be having regular fireworks ! LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( Choking . ) You put her up to it . MRS . JOHNSON Yes . I thought it was high time . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I object . MRS . JOHNSON Do you ? So do I , and so will Grace 's husband if you both do n't look out , and he 'll object the strongest of the lot . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I have n't compromised your sister . MRS . JOHNSON Of course you have n't ! That 's not your fault so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . J. ) No you must n't throw all the blame on him . Lord Heathcote cares sincerely for me Nell , and I 've encouraged him and I 'm as much to blame as he . p. 23 MRS . JOHNSON Oh , that 's how the land lies is it ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE My love for your sister is real and deep , it is really ! MRS . JOHNSON Not a bit like it . ( She Xes. before GRACE and comes to corner of table E. ) How can your love be real and deep when three times a week you turn up dressed to kill at No. 82 Rue Buonaparte ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I have a French aunt who lives there . MRS . JOHNSON You story teller ! it 's Mademoiselle Jennie Durot , Chorus damsel at the Olympia . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes I believe she does live there too . Auntie 's on the first floor , Jennie on the second . MRS . JOHNSON Excuse me , No. 82 Rue Buonaparte is not let out in floors , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you know the whole blooming place as well as the postman . ( Left of table . ) MRS . FRANK MORLEY ( Going to upper corner of table E. ) Why did n't you tell me ? MRS . JOHNSON I hoped it would n't be necessary to go into such a detail . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE It 's very simple . I 've composed a little musical play and I 've been attending some rehearsals . We are going to play it at the Volney Club next week . p. 24 MRS . JOHNSON What do you call the Operetta ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Susie Rot . MRS . JOHNSON O ! Charming name ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY Bertie  --   --  LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Really , anyway , supposing there is something going on between Mrs. Morley and me , we 're only following her sister 's example . MRS . JOHNSON No , that wo n't work . I play with my own stakes , but Grace is playing with her husband 's honour and happiness . ( Turning to GRACE who joins them . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we choose to gamble , after all I do n't want to be rude , but where do you come in ? MRS . JOHNSON Where do I come in ? At " the finish " . I hope ; in fact I 've made up my mind to that ! ( She Xes. in front of GRACE and moves towards BERTIE . ) ( He backs round to back of table between it and chair . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE O , much obliged ! ( Goes behind table around to C. opposite GRACE . ) Then it 's settled is it ? ( To GRACE . ) I 'm to be off ? p. 25 MRS . FRANK MORLEY Yes , please . MRS . JOHNSON For goodness sake leave out the " please " ! ( Moves to table B. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE It bores me awfully , it does really to find you so weak . MRS . JOHNSON Well , it 's all come to a happy end now , and tomorrow he 's going to  --  Italy . ( She moves up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BERTIE HEATHCOTE Wait a minute , do . ( Above table E. ) You insist on Italy ? MRS . JOHNSON No  --   --  LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE That 's a good thing . I went to Italy the last time . MRS . FRANK MORLEY O really ! It 's not a new experience for you then ! ( Crossing to beside table I. and facing BERTIE . ) MRS . JOHNSON New ! for that young man . Bertie confess how many times you got left in affairs of the heart ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I refuse to answer  --  you do n't understand me , I am very sensitive and this is the real thing . ( Goes up to C. ) p. 26 MRS . JOHNSON Well good-bye and a pleasant journey . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( Entreatingly . ) Oh , but I say , the Carnival and the procession . ( Moves up . ) I want to see it . MRS . JOHNSON Possibly it passes the street where Mlle. Durot lives . ( She moves up a little crossing to BERTIE . ) Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEATHCOTE Oh , come , I 'm off . ( He does not stir ; he repeats the phrase after having made a movement of departure , then says again to GRACE " I 'm off . " ) This is a lame sort of smash up ! No excitement , no row . Nice sort of  --  ( During the moves down to screen . ) After all I love you Grace , I do really ! And I do n't care who hears it ! ( Over screen . ) ( MRS . J. follows his movement and arrives at the table B. BERTIE has left his gloves on the table . She takes and hides them behind her back . ) MRS . JOHNSON Grace and I both promise to miss you . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Grace good-bye . ( He moves to her . ) MRS . FRANK MORLEY Good-bye Bertie. p. 27 LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Good-bye . ( He crosses to MRS . J. and notices the gloves which she holds extended towards him . ) MRS . JOHNSON Your gloves . ( She hands them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Are they ? O yes  --  thank you so much . MRS . JOHNSON ( Getting his cane . ) If you had left them you 'd have had to come back again for them , would n't you ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes  --  rather a good idea , was n't it ! MRS . JOHNSON And so novel ! ( Give cane . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Do n't trouble . MRS . JOHNSON ( Smiling . ) O no trouble . It 's a pleasure ! ( Giving him his hat . ) ( MRS . J. up R. BERTIE down R. ) ( JIM comes in R. and shakes MRS . JOHNSON 'S hand then moves down right , crosses to GRACE  --  He holds a half smoked cigarette . ) . JIM MORLEY Good-morning Nell . ( Turns to BERTIE . ) Hello Lord Bertie .

LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE No , I must be going  --  I only happened in by  --  mistake ! ( Bows to the ladies . ) JIM MORLEY ( To BERTIE . ) Too bad , you wo n't see the procession with us . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes . I have a subsequent engagement for some other windows . ( Exit BERTIE R. JIM accompanying him to thethreshold . ) Good-bye . MRS . JOHNSON ( Crossing to GRACE . ) There Grace it is all over . You see it was n't so very bad after all . MRS . FRANK MORLEY O you dear old Nell .

JIM MORLEY O , I do n't know only the less you see him the better you like him ! MRS . JOHNSON Oh , you do n't like anybody . JIM MORLEY Oh I do n't know  --   --  ( Joking . ) I like myself . MRS .

( She moves chair F. beside table E. with its back to the table and leans against the back of the chair . ) Dear Jim , you are n't well ! What 's the matter ? p. 30 JIM MORLEY No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) When you behave yourself ! ( She laughs . ) However , the trouble with me is I feel lost , I 've been travelling so long I 'm not at ease yet keeping still . MRS . JOHNSON How I should like to travel like you . JIM MORLEY You can , you 're free , and you have my permission . MRS . JOHNSON It 's no fun for a woman trotting around by herself . JIM MORLEY Take along your string of young men . MRS . JOHNSON No , I have enough excess baggage . Have you been far away this time ? JIM MORLEY To Ceylon . MRS . JOHNSON Is it amusing there ? JIM MORLEY You can get tea there . MRS . JOHNSON Only tea ? And besides Ceylon ? JIM MORLEY O , I visited Singapore . MRS . JOHNSON Interesting ? JIM MORLEY There was rice . MRS . JOHNSON Apparently you find my questions very stupid .

JIM takes a seat in armchair G. back to audience . ) JIM MORLEY Let 's chatter . MRS . JOHNSON Why are you such an idler ? Why do n't you do something ? JIM MORLEY O , my brother does so much . MRS . JOHNSON Why have n't you ever married ? JIM MORLEY Would you ? I mean , would you if you were I ? MRS . JOHNSON Oh , I 'm prejudiced ! I fizzled ! But that 's no reason why you should n't have a go at it . JIM MORLEY I should want my wife to love me and only me for ever , but when I try to imagine myself the hero of such a continuous performance , I confess I am stumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JIM MORLEY No , no ! ( Sits on sofa beside her . She R. He L. ) No ! The whole thing is based on collossal vanity . A man says to himself I marry a woman and from to-day on no other man save myself is to exist for her . I am all ; the others nothing . I will render temptation impossible for her . She has me that 's enough . I am handsome , generous , I am it . Well , when I try to say all that the very first word sticks in my throat . MRS . JOHNSON Do n't be an idiot . Men do n't say that  --  a good many think it , but none of ' em acknowledge it . JIM MORLEY And the women ! They marry any old thing they like  --  and change their minds and their husbands as often as they like . No thank you !

Marriage is like the street to-day . Each one wears a mask and tries to deceive the other . MRS . JOHNSON What a beastly cynic you are . JIM MORLEY Not a bit . How many happy marriages do you know ? How many honest ? ( He comes down to angle of table E. centre above it . ) Look at your friends who are coming to-night . The Chardleys , she 's bored with her old husband and flirting behind his back with anything that comes along , even crumbs that fall from your table ! MRS . JOHNSON Thanks . ( Smiling . ) JIM MORLEY And the Bowlers . Nice people !  --  Have to live over here ,  --  cut dead in their own country , because she forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes now she 'd been careful and not married her second .

JOHNSON I hope you exclude them from your bitting remarks . JIM MORLEY I exclude no one . I am looking at the passersby and I 'm amused at the masks . Thank God there are none in our family . MRS . JOHNSON Why so serious about it ? JIM MORLEY I feel so ! If I were to find a mask in my own house , no matter how dear a face it covered  --  I would tear it off . MRS . JOHNSON At any cost ? JIM MORLEY At any cost . MRS . JOHNSON But Mr. Jim you seem to have a rather bad opinion of women . JIM MORLEY Not all . MRS . JOHNSON Then there are some whom you really condescend to place above the others ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORLEY Yes . Those to whom I give my confidence .

JIM MORLEY ( Going up to balcony . ) Are we going to throw confetti ? How gay ! ( He moves up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serpents . Did you bring the serpertine ! Oh ; do n't tell me you 've forgotten the serpents . MONSIEUR MAX DINDEAU You have never demanded for some that . MRS . JOHNSON Why I even chose the colors . MONSIEUR MAX DINDEAU You did ? MRS . JOHNSON You forgot them did n't you ? MONSIEUR MAX DINDEAU Oh yes , it was a forgetfulness . MRS . JOHNSON You must go right back after them . MONSIEUR MAX DINDEAU Oh , yes , I will go me again . ( Go up. ) p. 36 MRS . JOHNSON That 's a good boy and be quick , very quick . ( Goes to L. of table E. ) MONSIEUR MAX DINDEAU ( to JIM . ) She have never say one single word about serpents . But she is so  --   --  ( He exits R.  --  JIM moves down between table E. and sofa H. ) JIM MORLEY Do you answer that description ? MRS . JOHNSON Poor boy , so good-hearted  --  and no brains . JIM MORLEY You 're a wonder ! MRS . JOHNSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salary ? ( By table I. ) MRS . JOHNSON ( Goes nearer him . ) Yes , every month I say " no " to him .

Mr. Chardly need n't go , Lal , I 'll persuade him he 's too tired  --  and then propose that you can take me  --  or , no  --  it 'll be better for you to propose it yourself , as if you did n't want to , but I 'll take you up . Do you see ? Of course , dear boy , I 'm awfully stupid at this sort of thing . LAL BIRKENREAD I think you 're great ! It 's a go ! What ? MRS . CHARDLY Are you pleased ? LAL BIRKENREAD ( Smiling blandly. )  --  Yes .

CHARDLY ( Fearfully. )  --  You 're going it entirely too much for me , especially in a room practically full of people ; I think Mr. Chardly had better go to the Vernets ' with me after all . LAL BIRKENREAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . CHARDLY It 's true . I want to go with a man , not with a baby . LAL BIRKENREAD ( In great grief . ) ( Sits on table C. )  --  Oh , I say , I have no luck .

FRANK MORLEY I wish it was another woman . JIM MORLEY I do n't . ( Sits on corner of table E. ) FRANK MORLEY ( going to table E. )  --  Let 's talk this out straight from the shoulder ! JIM MORLEY I 'd rather talk straight from the heart . FRANK MORLEY Understand , I am delighted with the idea of your getting married . ( Sits chair D. ) JIM MORLEY Yes , but you must understand , too , that I have n't fallen in love with Nellie Johnson because I want to get married  --  not a bit . I want to get married only because I 'm head over heels in love with your " frisky " sister-in-law . p. 89 FRANK MORLEY " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( angry )  --  What !

BOTH MEN stand before it with their backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ! p. 90 JIM MORLEY Why not ? FRANK MORLEY I leave that for her to tell you . JIM MORLEY What do you mean ? FRANK MORLEY Ask Nellie . JIM MORLEY I will  --  by George , I 'll ask her to-night to be my wife  --  I do n't like your attitude , and I do n't understand it ! Where is she ? FRANK MORLEY She 's gone out . But I think she 's coming back . JIM MORLEY Gone out ? At nine o'clock ! What for ? FRANK MORLEY Why ask me ? JIM MORLEY You seem to know a good deal about her , or pretend to . Look here , are you going to stay on sulky like this if she accepts me , Frank ? FRANK MORLEY She ca n't accept you . JIM MORLEY But if she does ? FRANK MORLEY No , if she accepts you , then I 'll tell you why you ca n't marry her . JIM MORLEY Frank , is she is love with someone ? FRANK MORLEY Perhaps , or some thing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be like that . ( FRANK moves up back . BERTIE enters door R. ) p. 91 LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE O ! Do you happen to have seen Mrs. Johnson ? She 's dining with you , is n't she ? ( By table E. ) FRANK MORLEY Oh , it 's you , is it ? JIM MORLEY ( aside )  --  Humph !

I was n't noticing , it 's most interesting  --   --  ( Exits back while speaking . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I say , really now , have n't you seen Mrs. Johnson really ? FRANK MORLEY ( coming towards him )  --  Bertie , it 's not my custom to meddle in my sister-in-law 's affairs , but I want to tell you that you 're compromising Mrs. Johnson .

BERTIE follows his movement  --  then moves down C. and goes to fireplace . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( looking at and talking to himself in the glass )  --  Mrs. Johnson evidently thinks this is the first of April . She makes me break off with Grace , she writes me that she 's gone on me ; she keeps me four hours stuck in the Rue de Pruoy ; and when I arrive here , I 'm told I 've jolly compromised her . It 's a joke , you know . I do n't see just where the laugh comes in , but a joke it is and we will laugh at it ! ( Turns and sees coffee , liquors , etc. , on table B. ) Ha ! Ha ! I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAR B. beside stool C. Pours out some Chartreuse into a liqueur glass and takes a sandwich . ) Of course , I 've no time to dine .

A thimble 's no good when one 's thirsty . ( He puts his luquer glass to one side , fills up a whiskey glass and drinks . ) I never encouraged her , but I believe  --  it 's the only explanation ! She 's got it bad !

CHARDLY follows him up , carrying the cue L. between table E and arm-chair G. ) PROFESSOR CHARDLY Mrs. Bowler just put me on . I understand you now lead the procession in the frisky widow 's train ; my compliments on that ! LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Oh rot ! ( GRACE enters L. and comes to back centre . ) MRS . FRANK MORLEY Is Lord Heathcote  --   --  ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( moving to her )  --  Yes , good evening . ( Goes over to table I. ) p. 96 PROFESSOR CHARDLY ( moving to her up between B. and E. )  --  Do they want me in the billiard room ? MRS .

Rot ! ( Exit CHARDLY , L. ) MRS . FRANK MORLEY Oh , have you seen Nellie ? ( She moves down between tables E and B  --  BERTIE moving down , comes to L. corner of E. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE No . MRS . FRANK MORLEY She 's at your house . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE What a nuisance  --  why ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY Did n't you get her letter ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Do you know about that letter ? p. 97 MRS . FRANK MORLEY Of course , did you understand ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE All Greek to me ! it was really ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY The page boy you were so foolish to send here met my husband . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE No ! What ! Not really ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it . ( Slight movement to R. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Oh , I say ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY But Nellie was there and saved us . ( Sits in chair D. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Good old Nellie , I 'll forgive her everything ! How ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY She said the letter was meant for her . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I say ! of course  --  I 'd put no name on the envelope ! ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY Luckily not ! LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE But what 's the point of " Keep the kisses , Nellie " ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY Because in order to completely avert my husband 's suspicions she answered the letter under his eyes . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I say ! awfully clever . p. 98 MRS . FRANK MORLEY It was wonderful . ( Rises L. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Still I think of all of us you know , it 's little Bertie who takes the cake ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY Indeed ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE It is n't every Johnny who can write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , and have it fit every old girl that comes along ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY Yes , but Nellie is sacrificing herself to protect me ; we ca n't accept that , people are talking about you and her already ! LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( crosses to I. )  --  I know that from your brother-in-law 's behaviour . MRS . FRANK MORLEY Jim ? ( Turning quickly . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes , he must be in love with The Frisky , for he 's growing deuced jealous of me . MRS . FRANK MORLEY And if Nell cares for him  --   --  LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Then she 'd better not let Mr. Jim hear her side of our story , that 's all . ( He approaches her and on his last words , passes his arm discreetly about her waist. ) p. 99 MRS . FRANK MORLEY No , do n't  --  do n't  --   --  ( moving away ) Bertie , if Nell does care for Jim we ca n't accept this sacrifice . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE It 's her own fault . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapid fire way she did , I could have got a word in edge-ways with you , and would n't have had to send the note at all ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY I do n't think I 'd blame her . ( Sits on sofa . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE ( besides table I. and sofa )  --  But I do for killing your  --   --  MRS . FRANK MORLEY Was it love , Bertie ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I say ! really ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY I was lonely and dissatisfied , I wanted to be amused and made love to , you came along at just the psychological moment when I had persuaded myself I was an ill-used woman . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE And are n't you ? MRS . FRANK MORLEY No . I believe I deserve now  --  all I am getting . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes , but I 'm getting it , too , and I do n't feel I deserve any of it . I love you , you know , I do really ! p. 100 MRS . FRANK MORLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have it . Here we all three are in a dreadful position . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes  --  yes . I tell you what , the only thing to do is to forget it and think of something else ! MRS . FRANK MORLEY Oh ! You  --  I and I thought I loved you . ( Rises and turns to face him . ) ( She moves away from him . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I say , quick , look natural and pleasant , some one 's coming ! ( Comes to below table B. ) ( Enter FRANK , followed by JIM , BOWLER and CHARDLY , LAL and MRS . CHARDLY . ALL talking . GRACE moves up back . ) ( LAL and MRS . CHARDLY go to table B. ) MRS . FRANK MORLEY Your game finished ? MRS . CHARDLY Are n't some of you men thirsty  --  Mr. Jim ? ( JIM moves down between table E. and table B. crosses stage to rejoin FRANK .

I 've arranged to take Mrs. Chardly on , and it 's only a coupe  --  a club coupe . There 's no extra seat . ( Moving down quickly in front of chair F. ) JIM MORLEY Ah , that 's a bore !

LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE O please not like this , before everybody ; you 've already compromised me with these people ! You have really .

JOHNSON You do look so awfully upset ! LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Your nature is gay . MRS . JOHNSON Do n't you think our adventure awfully funny ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I do not see where the laugh comes in ? MRS . JOHNSON At any rate , my sister is saved from a scandal , and one for me , more or less , does n't count . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes , but how about me ! I 'm getting into awful hot wataer . MRS . JOHNSON O , you 'll be all right . ( SHE puts down her glass and moves to table E. centre . BERTIE follows . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes , but I 'm not the only one in a mess over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm an awful ass . MRS . JOHNSON Not , an awful one . p. 108 LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Well , I am a good deal of an ass , but even an ass has ears , as you know , and he has eyes , too , and sometimes he can see with them . MRS . JOHNSON Mercy ! You 're going to talk seriously ! ( Seats herself L. corner of sofa H. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE I 'm going to try to . ( BERTIE moves chair F. to table I. and sits down . ) In the first place I 've had lots of flirtations in my life , but none that caused such a sensation apparently as this one I have n't had with you ! MRS . JOHNSON People are talking ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE People are screaming ! It 's a hit ! But I advise you to let up on it for your own sake . MRS . JOHNSON Thank you , I 'm sure . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Suppose somebody fell in love with you whom you loved in return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ! You must n't think me interfering . But you know love happens to the most unexpected people . MRS . JOHNSON Thank you . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE You need n't think because you 're a widow  --  once bit twice  --  you know because it does n't work that way . It 's a sort of nice little pink microbe , and you never know when you wo n't get it in the heart  --  love is. p. 109 MRS . JOHNSON Well , grant that I should fall in love one day . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE And then this story crops up ! People say and believe the worst . MRS . JOHNSON Then I 'd ask you to tell the truth to the man in the case . That is all that would be necessary to save me my happiness . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Very good , but suppose , do n't you see , that the man who won your difficult affections should be a near relation of Mr. Frank Morley 's , it would n't be easy then to tell him the truth , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean you 're hinting at Jim Morley ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Why not ? MRS . JOHNSON Because he does n't care a rap about me ! LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Does n't he ? That 's where you 're very much mistaken ! Everybody 's on to him except you . Since this ridiculous gossip about us he glares at me every time I enter the room . Like a  --  like a fox watching a rat  --  he does really . MRS . JOHNSON I do n't believe it ! Maxie loves me and several other nice little boys tag about after me  --  but  --   --  ( She hesitates. ) p. 110 LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE And much you care  --   --  ( Takes up a book from table E. ) MRS . JOHNSON Well ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE You will excuse me , but that 's only the first verse of my little song ; wait till you hear the chorus ! I think you 're so near falling in love with Mr. Jim Morley yourself . Heavens if he breathes you 're done for . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want me to repeat the chorus ? MRS . JOHNSON You are getting to be quite a mind reader , are n't you ? LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Yes , you know it 's come to me all of a sudden . I 'm rather stuck on myself , I am really ! ( HE rises , throws book down on to table , and passes a little right , leaning his back against table E. ) MRS . JOHNSON That 's nothing new . LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Rats , you 're angry because I see you 're in love ! ( HE picks up illustrated journal from table and returns to Mrs. J. , who takes the paper from him . ) Why should n't you be rather keen on Mr. Jim Morly ? After all he 's the real thing and most of us chaps that hang around Monte Carlo and Paris in the Winter  --  well . We take a walk on the Boulevard . Mr. Jim takes a run around the world . There 's something big and picturesque about him , a mixture of bananas , giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nice things like that . He makes Max and me and the rest of us look like a Punch and Judy show , he does , really ! ( He approaches Mrs. J. ) You know you do n't flirt with him , you talk , you talk , and when he 's talked about , you listen ! ( Takes an illustrated paper and turns over during the course of his monologue and looking at it abstractedly up and down ) With you that means a lot , you see , because listening is n't your strong point . ( A pause . ) You see , maybe you have been in a little too much of a hurry to sacrifice yourself . p. 111 MRS . JOHNSON That 's good , is n't it ? I had a lot of time to think it over . ( MRS . JOHNSON rises L. , passes in front of Bertie , crosses the stage to table B. ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Are you angry with me ? ( Following her . ) MRS . JOHNSON Hardly ! If what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE O , all right , all right , I only wanted to give you a friendly tip ; as for myself , I 've decided on my plan . I shall disappear  --  and I shall tell no one where I am going . To-morrow , if I may , I will bring you your sister 's letters . MRS . JOHNSON Ah , yes , please  --  the letters . ( SHE approaches BERTIE . ) LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE And my sympathy will be entirely with you . I see perfectly it is you who did for yourself in the little affair . ( Offers his hand . ) MRS . JOHNSON Do n't be stupid ! ( Shakes his hand . ) ( MRS . J. crosses BERTIE and moves down front beside arm-chair G. ) ( CHARDLY , FRANK and JIM come in from terrace . ) PROFESSOR CHARDLY It is eleven o'clock , Heathcote . Shall I take you off with me ? p. 112 LORD BERTIE HEATHCOTE Wish you would . ( JIM seeing BERTIE has moved down behind table B , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of JIM . ) JIM MORLEY Good evening .

FRANK shows out CHARDLY , returns after BERTIE is off , comes down a little towards JIM , remains at the corner of the table B. ) FRANK MORLEY ( goes up to JIM )  --  Here is your chance . Take it . JIM MORLEY Start things going for me . FRANK MORLEY ( He takes a step or two towards MRS . J. above table E. ) My brother just now has tkaen me into his confidence and I have advised him to lose no time in speaking to you . MRS . JOHNSON You 're very solemn .

JOHNSON ( moving nearer JIM )  --  So , Mr. Jim , are you going to take me seriously ? That 's very extraordinary . JIM MORLEY ( come up to MRS . J. till they are separated by table E. )  --  I have taken you seriously for a long time , and to tell you the straight truth my flippancies were only to hide the fact that I 'm so a  --  I 'm so timid . MRS . JOHNSON Really ! I should never have thought it . JIM MORLEY But you 'll acknowledge a man is apt to appear an awful fool when he is sincere or serious ! MRS . JOHNSON No , I wo n't acknowledge that , not all men . JIM MORLEY I know I 'm right . There are moments in your life when you feel so deeply you ca n't speak , the only words you know seem so cheap , they 've been worked to death , by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHNSON It depends on the one who speaks . JIM MORLEY I think it depends on the one who listens ! MRS .

The same old thing ? MRS . JOHNSON Yes , risk it . ( SHE seats herself chair F. ) ( JIM seats himself chair D. ) JIM MORLEY My dear Nellie , you are called the Frisky Mrs. Johnson  --  in your heart of hearts I do n't believe you 're frisky at all . MRS . JOHNSON We all have to wear our little masks . JIM MORLEY I say I do n't know how to go on ! My heart 's beating at such a breakneck pace that any doctor would give me up as doomed . I feel like a kid of a schoolboy  --  and think of our ages . MRS . JOHNSON O no , do n't let 's think of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's as plain as daylight I 'm dead in love with you . MRS . JOHNSON Jim . ( Rising . ) JIM MORLEY What ? ( Coming down below E. ) MRS . JOHNSON It 's true ? JIM MORLEY It 's the truest thing about me ! MRS . JOHNSON I never dared hope ! I would n't let myself even dream . ( Going into his arms , stops and draws away . ) O ! O ! Jim  --   --  ( Pause. ) p. 116 JIM MORLEY What , Nell ? ( SHE goes to C. ) ( Pause . ) MRS . JOHNSON Jim ! Are you in earnest ? JIM MORLEY I was never so earnest before in my life . So give me a straightforward answer . MRS . JOHNSON You told your brother just now you were going to do this . JIM MORLEY Yes , I felt sort of in need of a little bracing . MRS . JOHNSON I 'm afraid he did n't give it to you . JIM MORLEY Oh  --  he 's like a good many other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mask . MRS . JOHNSON Are you sure you do ? JIM MORLEY ( goes to her )  --  Yes . MRS . JOHNSON What did Frank say ? JIM MORLEY I 've forgotten . MRS . JOHNSON No , you have n't  --  and you must tell me . JIM MORLEY Well , he said , she ca n't marry you  --  and she 'll tell you why . MRS . JOHNSON And if I do n't tell you why , did he say he would ? p. 117 JIM MORLEY Yes . ( A pause . ) JIM MORLEY ( going to her )  --  It is n't " no , " is it Nell ? MRS . JOHNSON Listen , Jim . I ca n't tell you how what you 've said touches and flatters me , too . JIM MORLEY But  --   --  MRS . JOHNSON Since the first day we met  --  and quarrelled , I 've been more than half in love with you . You see you must acknowledge you 're different from the general run of young men we 're thrown with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look up to you tremendously . And that 's what I meant when I separated yo ufrom the dawdlers and called you my friend . JIM MORLEY But ? MRS . JOHNSON I 've even begun to wish I had n't acquired that title of mine  --  you know ? The Frisky  --  I realize now how much space it makes between you and me . You see I 've an ideal about you . JIM MORLEY But ? MRS . JOHNSON But  --  that 's just it  --  but , I can not be your wife . JIM MORLEY I know  --  I do n't need Frank to tell me , I can guess . ( JIM goes up stage and comes back ) You love someone else ? p. 118 MRS . JOHNSON I ? ( Goes to table E. ) JIM MORLEY I 've come too late  --  another man is ahead of me . MRS . JOHNSON No , no , that 's not it ! JIM MORLEY O yes . MRS . JOHNSON Well , I think I ought to know . JIM MORLEY I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word and I ought to take off my hat and leave . But I 've lost my good manners . I 'm hurt and I ca n't help crying out . Refuse me , of course , if you like , but do n't tell me there is n't anyone else , because I know even his name . MRS . JOHNSON Lord Heathcote ? JIM MORLEY Yes , Lord Heathcote , and I do n't say so because of any gossip that may be going about . I base what I say on facts . MRS . JOHNSON Really ! On facts ? JIM MORLEY Facts ! You 're so careless , you are very easy . After dinner Frank told me you 'd gone off on some errand , no one knew where . You had gone to Lord Heathcote 's room and you had n't found him ! that was clear . Well , all that 's your business , but what you had no right to do was lead me on , these last two weeks , when you knew that already your heart was engaged elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must have seen I was becoming deeply in love with you , along with those other idiot flirts with whom you enjoy passing most of your time . p. 119 MRS . JOHNSON ( has listened motionless , her eyes fixed upon him )  --  I do n't know why I allow you to speak to me like this . ( She moves down and goes to JIM , who has moved  --  at the end of his speech ) I ought to be furious with you . JIM MORLEY ( changing )  --  No . Because you know that I am not really reproaching you with anything . I am only suffering out aloud . MRS . JOHNSON I 'm doing a little suffering on my own account , Jim . I 'm telling a man I 'd rather do anything in the world than hurt , that I ca n't marry him . JIM MORLEY But say I observed wrongly just now ; I accused you , defend yourself . Tell me I was wrong . MRS . JOHNSON I ca n't . ( She moves slightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother Frank would tell you you were right . JIM MORLEY Right ? MRS . JOHNSON In believing the worst of me . JIM MORLEY No ! tell me you would contradict my brother , that you would defy him to prove we should n't marry . ( He goes up to her. ) p. 120 MRS . JOHNSON No . JIM MORLEY Why not ? MRS . JOHNSON I could n't . JIM MORLEY Then I 'm right after all ? MRS . JOHNSON Yes . JIM MORLEY You love  --  this Heathcote ? MRS . JOHNSON Ask your brother . ( JIM sits  --  chair . ) JIM MORLEY No . MRS . JOHNSON ( with agitation )  --  Well ? ( A long pause . MRS . J. moves up back passing between chair F. and stand I. ) MRS . JOHNSON After all you 've no right to probe me like this . I gave you my answer , that ought to have been enough . I stand alone . I have no account to render anyone . I have a perfect right to a romance if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. ) Suppose I do care for a little romance with Lord Heathcote as its hero , what affair is it of yours ! I never led you in any way to believe I cared for you . ( SHE moves up to corner left of table F. ) ( JIM rises and moves up back between chair F. and Stand I. ) I surprise you ! Well , you see , you do n't know me ! When you do it will be easy to forget me . I 'm so sorry to have hurt you ! You 've idealised me , Jim , that 's the trouble . Frank knows me better than you do ; forget me . I am worth exactly what everybody says of me . It ought n't to be hard to forget the Frisky Mrs. Johnson . p. 121 JIM MORLEY No , I do n't understand it all ! ( HE moves down to corner R. of the table E. ) MRS . JOHNSON What ? JIM MORLEY Somehow or other you do n't ring true when you talk like that . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost think you 've got a reason . MRS . JOHNSON Not at all , I 'm telling you the truth . ( She falls back a little before JIM , who moves down on her . ) JIM MORLEY NO . MRS . JOHNSON But you must believe me , why should I accuse myself ? JIM MORLEY Ah , that 's what I do n't know ! But there 's nothing a woman wo n't do ! I do n't understand , but I do know you 're not telling the truth ! And I mean to sift it out ! and to get at the truth before I finish ! ( MRS . J. , her back to public sees FRANK who re-enters from BALCONY . ) MRS . JOHNSON No ! Frank you ought to have told your brother and saved me the pain of having to tell him . ( While speaking to FRANK she reaches the armchair G. and FRANK takes centre . ) FRANK MORLEY I wanted to keep your secret if I could . p. 122 MRS . JOHNSON Well , now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must give up once and for all the idea of my being his  --   --  JIM MORLEY ( To FRANK. )  --  Nell ca n't be my wife ? FRANK MORLEY No . JIM MORLEY You know a sufficiently good reason , sufficiently good in my eyes ? FRANK MORLEY Yes . JIM MORLEY Can you prove it ? FRANK MORLEY Yes , an accident gave me the proof . JIM MORLEY ( looks from his brother to MRS . J. and back )  --  All right , all right . MRS . JOHNSON And now I can go , ca n't I ? There is nothing further for me to do here ? ( JIM has moved up moodily , seats himself corner L. of table B. and plays with the ash tray that he finds there . MRS . J. goes up to him . ) You will never believe , Jim , how grieved I am to have unconsciously awakened in you this love that hurts you now so much . But what 's done 's done . Perhaps I did lead you on ! They say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay ! Perhaps I am  --  and it will make it all the easier to forget me  --  O , you 'll forget me very soon  --  you 'll see  --  once I 'm out of the way , Jim , you 'll  --   --  ( JIM makes a movement. ) realize what a mistake you 've made . p. 123 JIM MORLEY You 're leaving Paris ? MRS . JOHNSON Yes , I am going to travel . Just made up my mind ! It will be great fun ! Good-bye , Jim . ( Without raising his eyes , JIM mechanically presses the hand that MRS . J. extends . ) MRS . JOHNSON And now I 've only one favor to ask of you two men . If you 've any feeling at all left for me , please do n't say anything about this to Grace , will you ? You know Frank , she 'd be awfully broken up over Jim 's disappointment and  --  and even over my having to clear out  --  and the whole thing ! She 'd feel it terribly . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I can explain things to her so much better myself . Good-bye , good-bye , Jim . ( She has moved up a little towards FRANK above table E. Now on her last good-bye , with tears in her eyes and her voice stifled , she goes off hastily . ) FRANK MORLEY Good-bye . ( FRANK accompanies MRS . JOHNSON off , then after a long pause , steadily regarding his brother , he comes to him and passes his arm about his shoulder . ) Come , old man . JIM MORLEY Does n't she seem different to you ? ( JIM speaks very much moved . ) FRANK MORLEY No . I 'm sorry for her . p. 124 JIM MORLEY I say , Frank . ( HE rises . ) She 's in love with Heathcote , is n't she ? FRANK MORLEY She 's in the habit of going to his rooms alone , she 's ( interrupted . ) JIM MORLEY Never mind all that  --  but how in the devil did you know all this ? FRANK MORLEY Merest chance . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened by mistake . JIM MORLEY Why did he send a letter to her here , why not to her own house ? FRANK MORLEY Because he knew that she was with us this evening . JIM MORLEY O ! Have you read the letter ? FRANK MORLEY Yes . JIM MORLEY It was conclusive ? FRANK MORLEY Quite . JIM MORLEY I ca n't believe it ! ( He Xes . FRANK and moves to fireplace very thoughtfully . ) FRANK MORLEY You are like all men in love , ca n't believe what you do n't want to . I read the letter and I read , too , the answer Nellie wrote and sent under my very eyes . It was more conclusive still . ( JIM turns quickly and returns to FRANK PAUSE. ) p. 125 JIM MORLEY She wrote her answer  --  under your eyes ? FRANK MORLEY Yes . JIM MORLEY But why did she do that ? FRANK MORLEY Oh , because  --  because I was stupid . You see an envelope came here without any address , and for a minute , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I came in , so Nellie wanted to completely reassure me that the letter was written to her and made me read the answer . JIM MORLEY ( After a long silence )  --  O ! O ! Yes . ( FRANK moves up above table E. down again in No. 1 between stool I. and chair F. ) JIM MORLEY Of course there 's no longer any doubt possible . If you 've read the letter and if she insisted on your reading her reply , it 's quite certain . FRANK MORLEY Oh , quite . ( Pause . ) JIM MORLEY Yes  --  yes  --   --  ( BOLLES enters R. ) BOLES Will I put the lights out , Sir ? FRANK MORLEY Yes , yes ; leave one ; has Mrs. Morley gone to her room ? BOLES Yes , sir .

JIM MORLEY Nor Lal ? Nor none of the others ? MRS . JOHNSON No . It 's funny , but I want to be alone . ( She leans upon table F. ) I 'm going to nature  --  I want to get away from asphalt and electric light , from the shops and the crowds , from everybody ! JIM MORLEY A voyage of pleasure . ( He moves away to R. corner of table C. ) p. 151 MRS . JOHNSON You know you do n't mean that ! It is n't a journey of pleasure because I take with me the regret of having awakened in such a man as you , a love of which I wish I were worthy . JIM MORLEY ( Moves to MRS . J. )  --  No , Nell , no , it wo n't do . I respect your motive , but I am not taken in by it . MRS . JOHNSON I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me a minute . The more you accuse yourself , the more something in me asserts your innocence , and let me tell you , too , this something is n't my love , it is my reason . Your attitude just now with that fellow who has gone out ; the way you speak to him , and have spoken of him  --  I know  --  you are not  --  he has never meant anything to you . I look into your eyes , and I know you have never been and will never be the mistress of any man , except the man you marry . No , you are sacrificing yourself for someone else , and for whom ? It must be someone you love dearer than yourself , someone so close to you  --   --  ( GRACE sets ajar door R. , pauses and listens without being seen by speakers . ) MRS . JOHNSON No , no ! Do n't say it ! JIM MORLEY And who are the two people in whose eyes you are trying to appear guilty ?

J. accompanies GRACE a step or two , then returns . ) ( JIM has crossed to table C. ) p. 154 JIM MORLEY ( Opening his arms. )  --  Nell , you ca n't say no to me now , you ca n't . MRS .
