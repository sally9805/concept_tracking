Early this morning scores of detectives and policemen in plain clothes were hunting the lower east side and the Bowery in search of a man of whom they have only the meagre description furnished by a fourteen-year-old boy . This man was the last person , with the exception of the police , the small boy , and a second man who could have had no connection with the crime , known to have in his possession two large packages done up in black oilcloth and brown paper , In which was found the dismembered body of a man , the torso with head missing in one ptcltage , and the severed legs and:arms in the other . A fact which the police consider significant as showing rather that the murder was not committed by an Italian than by one of that - race , was the discovery upon Aach of the bundles of the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were written in red , apparently with chalk of that color . On the other they were in blue . In both instances the marking was on the outside of the packages , and might have been seen by anyone , but for the fact that the writing was rather dim . As it was . the words were not discovered until some time after the packages had been opened in the Oak Street Police Station . Joseph ' Tokaro. a young Italian boy living at 31 Hamilton Street , was the first to receive the parcels from the man , whose description he gave later to the police . Boy Gets Gruesome Bundle . Tokaro , according to the story which he told to the police later , was standing in Catharine Street , near Monroe Street , soon before 6 o'clock last night when a stranger , carrying one of the parcels over each shJulder , stopped opposite him and asked : " Do you want to earn 5 cents : " Tokarild - that he anu the man asked him to carry one of the parcels . The lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then come with me a short distance , " said the stranger . " I want to leave these for a minute or two while I go somewhere else , and if you will watch them I 'll pay you the money . " Young Tokaro accompanied the stranger while he walked up Catharine Street to Madison , down this to Oliver , and along that street until he came in front of Public School 1 , about 50 feet from Henry Street . There he stopped , and , telling the boy to await 11 ' , return , started off in the direction of Chatham Square . That was the last seen of him . It was some few minutes later that John Tobin , who lives at 67 Madison Street . passed bit the school house while taking a dog belonging to his sister-inlaw for a short run . The dog , running along some yards ahead of Tobin , saw the packages and went over and sniffed around them . Then he barked loudly and hegan running about the parcels , darting toward them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rend them . Young Tokaro tried to drive him off , but the dog paid no attention to him . Then Tobin came up , but the dog would not leave the packages at his command , and at last Tobin inquired what the youngster had in the parcels . " I do n't know , " confessed young Tokaro , and be told how he had come by them . Police Discover the Crime . Policeman George Hoffman of the Oak Street Station approached then and Tobin called to him . The policeman poked at the parcels with his night stick , tried to lift them , and , finding them heavy , decided at last to investigate . He sent for the patrol wagon and had the parcels carried to the station , taking the boy and Tobin along with him . It was in the rear room of the Oak Street Station that the parcels were opened . The first and largest one proved to contain the torso . It was clad in a soft shirt of white material with a light black stripe running through it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upper part of a pair of trousers , apparently made of blue or black serge . The head bad been cut off , apparently lust below the ears . In the right side of the neck was a single stab wound . The second package contained the legs and arms . About the latter were the sleeves of the shirt the victim had been wearing , while the legs of the trousers still surrounded the dismembered limbs . There were no shoes upon the feet , which were covered with blue socks having light black stripe . The underwear was blue like the undershirt . The limbs had been cut off close to the Jeints , the bones having been sawed through . The Oak Street police notified Headquarters of the murder , and Capt . Carey , with Detectives Miller , Gloster , , Lagrua , Berroa. and Bastangio hurried to the station house . Capt . Carey questioned young Tokaro and Tobin , while the other men examined the body . A physician was summoned from the Hudson Street Hospital , and he gave it as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four hours . The detectives measured the torso and the length of the limbs , and concluded that the victim must have been a man of little moils than five feet in height . He had been slight , too . The skin was fair , and the hands were soft and white , with the peculiar look , however . which comes from constant contact with water , this fact led the police to decide that the man had probably been a bartender . Reserves Search for Suspect . The majority of the reserves were ordered inter plain clothes as soon as the detectives decided that no more could be learned from an examination of the body . and they were sent out into the Bowery find the east side to search for a. man answering the description furnished by young Tokaro . The boy said that the stranger who had first had the parcels had loOke4 to be about thirty-five years old , was of medium height , although heavily built , and wore a brown suit of clothes and a black derby , the latter having a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark mustache . This was all that he could remember of him . The police were not prepared to offer any theory of the murder last night , but it is known that they are of the opinion that the murdered man had been the victim of some gang fight , or had been picked out for punishment by some gang of which he mfght have been a member . The neighborhood in which the stranger turned over his bundles to young Tokaro is that in which the " Humpty Jacksons , " the " Yakey Yakes , " the " Monk Bastmans , " and other notorious gangs once held forth , and the murder of " Kid " Twist at Coney $sland a year ago showed that although such gangs are not as open in their vendettas as they were a few years ago , nevertheless they still exist , and the feuds between them and among their own numbers are as fierce as ever .

Describing the appearance of the body the Inspector said : " It bore no distinctive marks . The nails looked like those of a man who gave them no especial care , but they were not those of a laborer . The skin was light in color and smooth . I should say that the man had been of fairly light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veins to show medium or advanced age , and I should say that the man was young . The ' leg below the knee was well developed and shapely , as though the man had been energetic and somewhat of a walker . The arm was muscular but not overdeveloped , and did not look like that of a man accustomed to very hard manual labor . " The Inspector admitted that at present he had no clue . " It is like so many other cases , " he said , " which seem insolvable at first . I 'll bat $100 we get the murderer , though . " Malcomson Estate to Relatives . The will of Alfred S.
