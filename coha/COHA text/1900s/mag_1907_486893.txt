One of the topics treated in the President 's message is the pitiful state of the American merchant marine . He advocates an extension of the ocean mail act of 1891 . He laments , with the rest ot us , that we have not to-day upon the sea a merchant fleet " worthy of the traditions of our past . " What that glorious past was , and why the American sailor was famous have never been set forth more convincingly than by De Tocqueville in " Democracy in America . " In his chapter on " The Commercial Prosperity of the United States , " he discussed the superiority of Americans at sea . That this was due to " physical advantages which nature gives them " he denied ; and in a passage which is absolutely relevant to our present-day debates , he said : The American vessels cost almost as much to build as our own ; they are not better built , and they generally last a shorter time . The pay of the American sailor is more considerable than the pay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of Europeans who are to be found in the merchant vessels of the United States How happens it , then , that the Americans sail their vessels at a cheaper rate than we can ours9 I am of opinion that the true cause of their superiority must not be sought for in physical advantages , but that it is wholly attributable to moral and intellectual qualities . Tocqueville went on to explain his meaning by saying that the Americans of that day displayed " a sort of heroism in their manner of trading " across the seas . We quote further : The European sailor navigates with prudence ; he sets sail only when the weather is favorable , if an unforeseen accident befalls him , he puts into port ; at night , he furls a portion of his canvas ; and when the whitening billows intimate the vicinity of land , he checks his course , and takes an observation of the sun The American neglects these precautions and braves these dangers . He weighs anchor before the tempest is over , by night and by day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes along such damage as his vessel may have sustained from the storm . . . . The Americans are often shipwrecked , but no trader crosses the seas so rapidly . And , as they perform the same distance in a shorter time , they can perform it at a cheaper rate . The European navigator touches at different ports in the course of a long voyage ; he loses precious time in making the harbor , or in waiting for a favorable wind to leave it ; and he pays daily dues to be allowed to remain there . The American starts from Boston to purchase tea in China ; he arrives at Canton , stays there a few days , and then returns In less than two years , he has sailed as far as the entire circumference of the globe , and has seen land but once . It is true that during a voyage of eight or ten months he has drunk brackish water and lived upon salt meat , that he has been in a continual contest with the sea , with disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can sell a pound of his tea for a half-penny less than the English merchant , and his purpose is accomplished . Now , what has happened to change all that ? What has deadened American initiative and eaten out the heart ot American daring on the high seas ? It is beside the point to talk of disadvantages having overtaken us in the evolution of ship-building , or to say that competition in modern methods of foreign commerce is hard to meet . We labored under the disadvantages , as Tocqueville points out , in 1830-40 , and for a decade later , but in those years there was an indomitable er ergy in the American character which enabled us to surmount them . We had then to encounter cornetition from long-established rivals , but we shrank not from the contest , and emerged from it triumphant . There seemed to be no end to American resource and skill and invention and intrepidity in building and sailing ships. , If the chief causes of our success were thus , as Tocqueville maintained , " moral and intellectual , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least due to a decay in the mental and moral qualities which won for us our former success . Allowing all that may be necessary for changed physical conditions , the deeper reasons for our loss of prestige on the seas must be sought in a new mental attitude of the American people . It is often said that our country has not thought it worth while to pursue commercial conquests beyond the ocean ; that we had our own vast empire to develop , and that our minds have been given to the work in which the greater immediate profit lay . In this statement there is doubtless some force ; but our interior development was going on apace from 1830 to 1860 , at the very time when our supremacy on the ocean was at its pitch . Something has happened since to account for the fact that we now lag so far behind other nations in marine enterprise and inventiveness , that the old courage and determination to succeed at all hazards , and in spite of all obstacles , seem so largely to have departed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of the turbine engine , in making automobiles , in wireless telegraphy , for example , a blight seems to have fallen on the once famed Yankee inventor . A powerful case can be made out by those who argue that it is the general governmental policies of the past forty years which have so transformed our bold self-reliance into limp dependence . During all that period we have exalted the doctrines of paternal care over those of self-help We have fixed the habit ot running to Washington for aid . Above all , we have , by our vicious system of protection , spread wide the notion that Americans are not able to stand on their own feet ; that they must have ar tificial advantages , and law-made handicaps , or they will perish in the struggle of brains . That is the reason why our shipping problem has so long been attacked from the wrong end . Everybody has been whining for a subsidy or discriminating duties or a grant in aid ; nobody has been going out to fight the battle in the old spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we somehow win back those qualities of mind and soul which once gave us the chief place among the mercantile marines of the world , we shall never recover it . Subsidies can never prop up a man who confesses he is beaten in advance . Let all the laws which hamper our ship-builders and ship-owners be repealed ; let them be given a fair field and no favors , and then let the appeal be to the old American boldness and ingenuity and proud trust that we can do business and make a profit where Englishman or German can , and we shall be taking the true way to restore American shipping . THE CAUSES OF REVOLUTION . The rapid growth of Russia 's population is accepted as supplying one great impulse towards revolution The misfortunes of the war with Japan may have served to precipitate the crisis , the development of industries , accompanied by an increase in the number of factory workers , may have helped to prepare the field for radical ideas ; but the agrarian problem is the key of the present difficulty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an instrument for obtaining land . European Russia is overcrowded . The allotments assigned to the peasant communities at their emancipation In 1861 were barely sufficient , if that , at a time when the population numbered 75,000,000 ; these allotments are inadequate to support a peasant population of 120,000,000 in 1905 out of a total population of nearly 150,000,000 . Hence . increasing poverty , famine , plague , and discontent . The argument of increasing population is recognized as valid by both parties to the Russian dispute . The progressive elements cite it as proof of the need of change . The government quotes it as a justification for existing evils . " The peasants will bleed " is a formula which shifts responsibility from the shoulders of Nicholas II . and M. Stolypin to those of Providence . A second force that drives to discontent and revolution is the spread of education , and particularly of higher education . A poverty-stricken peasantry , an unhappy city pi oletariat , will not stir of itself . There must be mind to work on brute matter , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian universities and technological institutions . If the population of the Empire has doubled since 1860 , the university enrolment has quadrupled since 1873 . There were 6,145 students in that year , 12,939 in 1885 , 13,944 in 1894 ( under the repressive rule of Alexander III . the growth was almost checked ) , and 19,394 in 1904 The number is not large when compared with the total population of the Empire , but it is large in proportion to the comparatively limited constituencies : rem which the universities draw . Given even a compact body ( as the Russian " intelligence " undoubtedly is ) of even a score of thousands of physicians , lawyers , schoolmasters , and technicians working for a common cause , however various the motives , and the required leadership for stirring the heavy mass of the productive classes into revolt has been supplied . A low standard of living and a high standard of education , an excess of population and an abundance of ideas , famine and enlightenment  --  such are the two main causes of popular discontent . Which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation is naturally to lay stress on the material agency , on population . We may test the point by referring to India . There discontent has been rife for two years , though there are now signs of an appeasement of popular feeling . The authorities have agreed in alleging famine and higher education to account for the unrest . An enormous population and swelling college lists  --  that for instance , was the burden of Mr. Morley 's exhaustive speech on the Indian budget , delivered in the House of Commons on June 6 If European Russia can not escape famine with a population of fifty to the square mile , what shall be said of India , with a population of 211 to the square mile ? And for Russia 's 20,000 university students , India can show 45,000 graduates from the five great Anglo-Indian universities of Calcutta , Madras , Bombay , Allaliabad , and Punjab ( Lahore ) Nearly 41,000 of this number , as Mr. Morley is careful to point out , are graduates from the academic and legal faculties , and i+ is among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morley 's own words : All graduates , or almost all , hope for employment in the public service ; and many , very many , are permanently disappointed . Facile with the pen and unfit for any but sedentary occupation , these and the still larger number of undergraduates who have failed to take a degree form a large body of men , mainly discontented and ready to advocate any - change , as no change can in their view make their condition worse Their ranks are increased by those who have been dismissed for misconduct from public or private employ , and it is from these sources that the anti-British editor and agitator is not unfrequently recruited . - The mass of British opinion is in agreement with the implied vague regret that Great Britain should have been so ready to bestow the gift of the higher learning on her Indian subjects . In so far as concerns India 's population , one striking fact must be taken into consideration . Whereas in Russia the increase for the eight years from 1897 to 1905 is officially estimated at 14 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decade 1891-1901 was only 2 4 per cent , and half of this was accounted far by the enumeration of new areas In the British provinces alone the rate of growth for the ten years was 4 8 per cent , the lower figures for all India being accounted for by a decrease of 5 4 per cent . in the native states . In India , therefore , the British administrator can not assert that his measure . of relief are swamped by the unchecked upheaval of hordes of additional subjects . One great factor in his problem is nearly constant , and if dissatisfaction does come , he is right in ascribing it chiefly to education . The question Great Britain must ask is whether she will continue to encourage education at the risk of fomenting discontent That England will do what the Czar has done and attempt to stifle university life , is incredible After all , it is the idea that counts . Franca , with a population almost at a standstill , is more distracted with political and social agitation than any other European country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A Mecklenburger Jazacer , who admirably conceals under the manners of the man of the world the insolence common to his rank ; whose ambition does not go beyond the desire to remain at the wheel ; whose political talents extend only to the solution of momentary embarrassments ; who does not seek to do great things , and therefore will not make any serious fight for his principles . This is Theodor Barth 's characterization of Chancellor von Bulow in the current issue of the Nene Rundschau It smacks of prophecy , in view of the cabled rumor that the Chancellor threatened to resign last week because Dr Paasche , the National Liberal vice-president of the Reichstag , severely criticised him and his policies ; and its accuracy is further illustrated by the solution of that " momentary embarrassment . " By calling the leaders of the " block " together , Bulow apparently got them to forswear any independence of action and to promise to support him loyally hereafter . Of course , all this is no sign of strength on the part either of the Chancellor ar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberals . No thought of such a combination appears to have entered his head until the unexpected defeat of the Socialists in the last general election necessitated some new working majority , or a healing of that breach with the Clericals which was the ostensible cause of the dissolution of the Reichstag . It is a ciscouraging example of the readiness with which Liberal parties will compromise with thei. natural enemies for the sake of a few legislative crumbs , that the German Left now presents . Von Bulow 's assurance that he would " do something " for the Liberals was enough to bring them to his feet , fawning , and quite ready to strike hands with the Conservatives , who represent the opposite of their political principles as nearly as does the Clerical Centre . The Conservatives oppose the democratization of the half-absolute kingdom of Prussia , and of the German Empire . Their sympathies are with the Prussian Junker , the-Agrarians , and the protectionists , not-with those who would establish a genuine manhood suffrage . For a statesman to attempt to carry on a government by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage , but hardly principle or far-seeing wisdom . Indeed , many Radicals see in the " block " nothing less than a cleverly contrived plan to delay the liberalizing of the country 's institutions , for which the Left stands above all else . These Radicals are not to be caught by such chaff as the bill mod tying the law as to public meetings , which , true to his prom-Ise , Von Bulow has already had introduced . On its face , this seems like a genuine concession to the Liberals The Conservatives , too , will be pleased , because they have vigorous organizations , particularly their landlords ' league , which are always agitating and campaigning . But the Junkers in the eastern provinces of Prussia control the police so wholly that people in that section will net mike too free use of their new privileges And at best the bill does not remcve from meetings that symbol of Imperial authority , the helmeted policeman , who listens to every speech , and decides with such intellect as he possesses whether a given utterance is or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , under cover of this " more liberal " law , Von Bulow will try to have passed a brief statute forbidding political speeches in Polish on the pretext that enough policemen who understand Polish can not be found to sit on the speakers ' stands ? ? fine measure of the Chancellor 's Liberalism ! Indeed , this Polish question may be precisely the rock upon which the Liberal-Conservative coalition will split . An anti-Polish measure just introduced in the Prussian Diet provides for forcible expulsion of Polish landowners from their estates , for the German colonization and land-purchase schemes for which the governmeny has paid so many millions have wholly failed in their purpose of weakening the Polish hold upon the eastern provinces . A Liberal party which would sanction so indefensible a measure would obviously forfeit public respect and all right to its name The Liberals , in short , are being tempted in Porder to prevent their attacking the tar=iff and other evils . It is inconceivable that the Prussian aristocracy will make the slightest concession of value . Sooner than that , they would gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always ready to support the mrotective policy and the colonial and naaval programmes . Meanwhile the Chancellor is " spar-'ring for time , " and is , as Dr. Barth has aptly put it , going on with his " sham feeding " of the Liberal groups , so that he may get past the approaching elections for the Prussian Landtag without having to declare his real intentions as ' to the reform of the Prussian suffrage . Quite aside froth . the difficulty of keeping his majority intact , he has plenty of other hard problems . Germany is Suffering somewhat from financial depression ; the people are groaning under heavier and heavier loads , while the price of the necessities of lite rises . Bread costs more than at any time during the last fifteen years , and coal is so expensive as to hamper industry as well as burden the householder Bebel stated in the Reichstag recently that there are now in Berlin 4,481 school children who never get any dinner , and over 40,000 unemployed adults . Nevertheless , the new navy programme calls for an expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the army outlay is as heavy as ever . Naturally , therefore , there is talk of new taxes , higher duties , and of a government monopoly ' of all alcoholic liquors . That a Liberal party can long remain in league with a government that Pursues a policy of this kind , and that it has actually promised to forego the right of criticism , seems at this distance quite incredible . MALARIA AND POLITIC &; One of the early writers on political science justly remarked that political theory , as a rule , attains its fullest development just about the time when the institutions on which it is based are passing out of existence . Now that malaria has been banished from scientific speech by resolution of the International Sanitary Congress at Mexico llity , and its place taken by " mosquito fever , " it is something of a coincidence to come across a little volume entitled " Malaria , " which would bind up that name with a far-reaching theory of historic evolution . The book is no less daring than suggestive . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A neglected factor in. the history of Greece and Rome , " and is summed up in a single sentence from the introductory chapter : The suggestion is that the conqueror of Greece was not so much the Macedonian or the Roman as that great tyrant which now holds half the world  --  malaria . The little volume of 108 pages acknowledges three authors ? Major Ronald Ross , whose epoch-making research into the nature of malaria brought him the Nobel prize 111 medicine in 1902 ; W. 11 . S. Jones of Cambridge , England , who contributes the main contents of the vol ume in the form of a study of malarial fever in ancient Greece and Rome ; and G. S Ellett , who has a concluding chapter on the effects of malaria on morals To make the point that the decline of Greece was due to the sapping of the national strength by insidious fever , it is necessary to show , of course , that malaria was not widely prevalent when Greece was in a flourishing condition . The authors find in Homer only one example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homer such terms do not occur again before Aristophanes , that is , towards the end of the Sfth century B. C. To follow the argument in detail is naturally impossible , but we may quote the " conclusion " : Malaria was certainly prevalent in many parts of Greece , including Attica , during the fourth century B c. , though Greece was not " highly infected " in the technical sense of the words , as used by Sir Patrick Manson The evidence of language and the fact that older people were frequently attacked , suggest that the disease had been but recently introduced by the armies returning from Asia . The Greeks themselves noticed the effect of malaria upon character . The change which gradually came over the Greek character from 400 B. - C. onward was one which would certainly have been aided , and was , in all probability , at least partially caused , by the same disease . It may be mentioned here that , according to the findings of Major Ross , in present-day Greece nearly one million people , out of a population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with malaria . The theory we have outlined is advanced by the authors only in the most tentative way . Their object is not so much to reconstruct history as " to show how important it is to stamp out malaria as soon as possible Most other diseases , however distressing to individuals , brace a peopleby weeding out the unfit ; malaria plays no such useful part in the economy of nature . " To the average reader , however , the historical implications of the question are fascinating . The modern historian , despite his efforts to write history so as to embody every- phase of a people 's life , rarely does weave the many subtle threads into his story ; most often we have detached disquisitions on the Roman family , literature , art , morals , with a perfunctory attempt at bringing these into connection with the main narrative which still remains one of ships and kings and the sealing-wax on treaties and capitulations . The present volume swings far in the opposite , direction . That it goes too far , however , is apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " historians , when dealing with the rise and fall of nations , do not generally view the phenomena from a sufficiently high biological standpoint , " without accepting in its entirety his statement that he sees no reason " to suppose that the Roman and the Megathersum were not struck down by similar causes . " But whatever influence malaria may have exercised on the course of history in the past , its present and future political importance , in common with other - diseases more peculiarly tropical , can scarcely be questioned , This factor of disease enters intimately into what is accepted as one of the great problems of the future  --  the establishment of white dominion over tropical and sub-tropical Africa and Asia , and , more broadly still , of the dominance of the temperate zones over the tropics If yellow fever and malaria , as Major Ross would be inclined to argue , are instrumental in rendering the Cubans unfit to govern themselves or the people of Colombia to build the Panama Canal , it is only a question of time before such diseases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same level of incapacity Great Britain 's difficulties in India arise in large measure from the fact that the peninsula as a permanent home for the European has been found impossible . The effects of equatorial disease and heat on the white man are often so disastrous as to have given rise to the new disease , " tropical wrath , " a condition whose symptoms are intemperance , lassitude , spasmodic violence , and appalhng cruelty . The tendency to base national greatness and national decay on physical rather than moral conditions  --  or , better , to identify moral with physical growth and decay  --  is apparent in the movement now so actively under way in Great Britain for checking the physical deterioration of the people Francis Galton , the founder of the new science of eugenics ; Prof. Ka-r1 Pearson , Sidney Webb , with G. Bernard Shaw as press agent , have been the leaders of a movement which , in more or less modified form , really constitutes one of the main functions of government in every civilized community  --  the conquest of dis-ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are not malaria , but tuberculosis , cancer , and all other diseases that thrive on overcrowding and uncleanliness ; but the principle involved is the same . The sentiment of humanitarianism is being increasingly- reinforced by the desire to augment national efficiency . THE VISION OF THE UNSEEN . The death of Francis Thompson , an event noticed briefly in these columns , has attracted much attention in his native England , where his following , though small , seems to have been larger than here A poet " of celestial vision " is the epithet by-which Wilfrid Meynell describes him in the London Atlbenceum . He was , however , beset with bodily ail-ments : Like De Quincey , whose writings he took into his blood , Thompson had a nervous illness in Manchester ; like De Quincey , he went to London and knew Oxford Street for a stony-hearted stepmother , his wealth like De Quincey 's once , lay in two volumes , for he carried ZEschylus in one pocket , Blake in the other ; and the parallel might have further extension , were it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " doctored himself disastrously with laudanum . " These physical and intellectual affinities were shared by still another poet , James Thomson , who died in 1882 , wrecked by drink James Thomson , too , had taken both De Quincey and Blake into his blood . Thomsen 's " To Our Ladies of Death " was directly inspired by the sisterhood of Our Ladies of Sorrow in De Quincey 's " Suspiria de Profundis , " and Thomson 's lines on Blake in London are a cry from his own solitary soul : He came to the desert of London town , Gray miles long ; Re wandered up and lie wandered down , Singing a quiet song He came to the desert of London town Mirk miles broad : He wandered up and he wandered down , Ever alone with God . There were thousands and thousands of human kind In this desert of brick and stone ; But some were deaf and some were blind , And be was there alone . The last line of the first stanza is a clear echo from the brook in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brook That to the sleeping woods all night Singeth a quiet tune To this group we may add one more notable name , that of our American disciple of Coleridge , Poe . Blake , who was perhaps half-insane , needed neither al . cohol nor drug to open his eyes to the world of strange shapes and terrors ; but all the others ? Coleridge , De Quincey , Poe , James Thomson , and Francis ' Thompson  --  may have owed in part either to stimulant or narcotic their clairvoyant powers , their penetrant in- , sight into the infinite mystery of the night that encompasses our common daylight life . In this peculiar quality they stand by themselves We might call them poets of delirium or of phantasmagoria , but that these words carry too strong a connotation of brutishness or sheer irrationality . They are poets rather of thedream that unlocks the gates of heaven and hell . To Blake The Land of Dreams is better far , Above the light of the Morning Star . And so it must have been to the author of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Kubla Khan " ; and to Be Quincey , with those prose passages from the " Confessions " and the " Suspiria , " , ed " upon the bosom of darkness , out of the fantastic imagery of the brain , cities and temples beyond the art of Phidias and Praxiteles , and beyond the splendor of Babylon and Hekatompylos " ; to De Quincey who at the bedside of his dead sister heard a solemn wind begin to blow , " the saddest that ear ever heard It was a wind that might have swept the fields-of mortality for a thousand centuries , . . . the one great audible symbol of eternity . " And Poe belongs among them , too , with his sombre imaginings of " The Raven " and of " Dreamland , " a limbo of Bottomless vales and boundless floods , And chasms and caves and Titan woods , With forms that no man can discover . James Thomson is perhaps less known , but no one who has read " The City of Dreadful Night " can deny his membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus it was , As I came through the desert Eyes of fire Glared at me throbbing with a starved desire ; The hoarse and heavy and carnivorous breath Was hot upon me from deep laws of death ; Sharp claws , swift talons , fleshless fingers cold Plucked at me from the bushes , tried to hold : But I strode on austere , No hope could have no fear . Francis Thompson 's lines are often : obscure , but that obscurity is broken , as in " The Hound of Heaven , " by such flashes as this vision of the Eternal : I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds ; Yet ever and anon a trumpet sounds From the had battlements of Eternity ; Those shaken mists a space unsettle , then Round the half-glimpsed turrets slowly wash again ; - But not ere ham who summoneth I fist have seen , enwound With gloaming robes purpureal , cypress crowned ; His name I know , and what his trumpet saith . Accident can hardly account for the one striking trait that runs through all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product of poppy or , vine . Far more likely is it that in their original bent these poets have burned , with the passion of the mystic and the , seer  --  coupled with physical infirmity that has made them slaves of a stimulant ; and this stimulant has in turn heightened for a time their powers of expression and clad the phantoms of their imagination with richer colors and more dazzling light . Again and again we note the symptoms of disease , the fits of fever and despair , the flagging strength , the fluttering pulse , and now and then falling across the page the black shadow of death itself And again and again we detect the working of the stimulant in phrases of almost superhuman vividness and-grace , " and intellect miraculously bright " But neither in their tears nor their laughter has the essence of their genius been displayed ; rather in their mystical trances . For them our towers and gorgeous palaces , our solemn temples , and the great globe itself have been the insubstantial pageant , while the realities have lain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall never pierce . In this they show a kinship with the prophets and mystics of all races and climes , and , above all , with those Hebrew seers who beheld the holy city of Jerusalem coming down from above , the river of water of life clear as crystal , and the Ancient of Days , with raiment white as snow and throne of fiery flames . James Thomson in his rapture of despair saw the pit moved from beneath to meet him at his coming . Francis Thompson in his ecstasy saw on Jacob 's Ladder To and fro In ascension and demission The star-flecked feet of Paradise . But with visions as far asunder as hell and heaven , all these poets have clung to the one certainty that we are such stuff as dreams are made of . GENIUS ' IN HARNESS . Among recently published letters of Guy de Maupassant are several to his " cher maitre , " Gustave Flaubert , which Illustrate many aspects of the literary temperament . There is , for example , its self-sufficiency , or persuasion that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maupassant 's plaint , when regretting Flaubert 's absence , that he got nothing out of friends of his own age , since " they had not an idea of what is really going on . " Sly digs at other writers , and other pretensions , occur in the usual manner of such correspondence . What most strikes one , however , is Maupassant 's revolt at the need of work to earn his daily bread , when he would be wreaking himself upon his art . He tried his hand at book-reviewing , but found the task of literary chromequeur repulsive . Then he got public employment First , he was a clerk in the Ministry of Marine . Next , hoping for pleasanter colleagues and easier hours , be got himself transferred to the Ministry of Public Instruction . But he was disappointed . He was treated with great deference , consulted and praised , but he had no real " liberty , " and that was what his artist soul craved . He dreaded that his talent was being stifled . The work was enzbetant . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . At one time , he mourned to Flaubert : My routine work uses me up I can not write anything My spirit is wearied and sterile I am oppressed by the uselessness of all I do , by the emptiness of the future ( whatever it may bring ) , and I feel stealing over me a dejected indifference to everything . What I want is to stay quietly in a corner , without aspirations and without stupidities . It is an old grief . Charles Lamb at the India Office , Hawthorne in the Salem Custom House , Matthew Arnold reading endless school-examination papers , Poe penny-a-lining  --  the world has long been familiar with the spectacle of genius in the treadmill . How to get it out , there have been endless sugges tions . Let there be special provision for geniuses : schools , endowments , support , encouragement , state patronage , so that no immortal works shall die in coming to the birth . Haas ! no practicable method has been found An occasional father is wise enough and happy enough to put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifted ; but in general the old rule still obtains The bantling genius has to be cast upon the rock in order to determine whether it have the stuff of life in it . There is , we know , a comfortable but callous doctrine that you ca n't keep genius , any more than a good man , down . It has been gravely affirmed that no creative work was ever really aborted by poverty or by bread-winning work which exhausts and deadens But this is a good deal like some of the circuitous reasoning about the survival of the fit . Because they survive they are fit . And similarly because , in the nature of the case , you can not confidently single out great works which an artist or a writer might have produced if he had had money , and therefore time and energy , it is argued that no such works ever would have been wrought , even in happier circumstances But the logic is as poor as the comfort . People will go on lamenting the misfits of genius , whereby a delicate fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the reason is because they can not help feeling that a nice division of the labor of the world would give freer play to creative natures , and so minister not only to the content and full development of genius , but to the general joy and well-being . Failing hope of any such beneficent arrangement , the chief consolation we have to fall back upon is that the system of making genius work in harness has come to be accepted , and that it is a part of genius to make terms with it . In America , at any rate , the art work as the avocation , even the by-product , is the rule How many of our painters live by their art alone , with no teaching to do , no lecturing , no snapping up in every way of the unconsidered trifles of money without which the pot will not boil ? How many American writers live , even oatmeal-fashion , by the literature which they cultivate ? We suspect that the fingers of one hand would almost suffice to count them . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talent seems to be able , in one way or another , to keep itself from being made distraught by the noise and the demands of the day  --  something as Senators and Representatives manage to write letters and , we hope , think great thoughts , while the President 's message is being read . Absolute genius finds such detachment harder , no doubt , but , then , absolute genius is rarer
