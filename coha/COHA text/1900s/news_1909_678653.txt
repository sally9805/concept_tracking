txt A meeting addressed by the Republican candidates , Otto T. Bannard and John Purroy Mitchel , in the classroom of the Manhattan Congregationalist Church last night , was brought swiftly to a close by the protest of a Tammany man against using a place of worship for political purposes . The protest caused a lot of excitement in the congregation for a few minutes . The Rev. Henry A. Stimson , the pastor , hastened to exulain that he and his congregation believed that the ends of practical Christianity were best attained by just such meetings . Just prior to this the questioning process had elicited from Mr. Bannard a repetition of the statement that be would not retire from the ticket in favor of Mr. Hearst . John B. A. Mullally , Tammany candidate for Assembly in the Fifteenth District , made the protest . Mr. Bannard and Mr. Mitchel had just finished replying to a long list of questions , many of them exceedingly personal , when Mr. Mullally , in frock coat and carrying his silk hat , forced his way to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign over the church door announcing that Mr. Bannard was to speak on " The Needs of New York , " and that a discussion was to follow .

" I am the son of a Presbyterian clergyman and the grandson of one , " continued the protest bearer . " I am also a lawyer and am hero at I the request of some of the younger members of this ' congregation to protest against the holding of a political meetI ing in this church . I do not come here as a lawyer , however , but as a citizen and a Christian . I came as a follower of Him who said there should be no petty squabbling in a place dedicated to His worship . " A buzz ran through the room . Memhers of the congregation looked at each other uneasily .

" i am not here to make a political speech . " " Mr. Bannard has set you an example here in teh house of God by smiling at every serious question you have asked him , " continued Mr. Mullally . " Yes , here in the house of God ? " Mr. Stimson , who had been standing uncertainly , waving his hand now and then at the speaker , who had paid no ted , interrupted at this point . " Now , I think ? . " He began taking a step toward Mr , - Mullally . But the latter went on . " I protest against the holding of a political meeting in the house of God , " he repeated .

There was a buzz of comment in one room till Mr. Stimson held up his hand for silence . " We believe that the best Christianity is practical Christianity , " he said . " And we I ) elieve that the way to make the community better is to improve the condition , of the community , both mentally ancl physically , if possible through the Church . We thank you for coming . The meeting is ' over till next Sunday night . " Strange Et.nestionern on Hand . ? In the questioning which preceded Mr. Mullally 's appearance the congregation had much to keep it excited , for a dozen or more men who had never before been seen in the Manhattan Congregationalist Church , and looked more like members of a Cooper Union audience , were on hand , primed with all sorts of questions for Mr. Bannard and Mr. Mitchel . Several times these questions were so personal that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the pastor 's intervention . The whole proceeding was evidently a surprise for Mr. Bannard . He had been invited to address the congregation and to listen to a discussion which would follow . His address was delivered from the pulpit in the church itself , but after this the congregation adjourned to the classroom at the side of the church , there the pastor explained that the right of free speech would be observed , and they could , as he expressed it , " get closer to the candidates " than they could In the church itself . The church had not been quite filled at the short service which preceded Mr. Bannard 's address , but as soon as he began to speak the men already referred to , who had been waiting outside , entered and sat do*n near the door . They occupied front seats in the classroom when the congregation adjourned there , and the discussion began . Wo n't Withdraw , Bannard Says . " Is the prospective Mayor in favor of new subways to be built with the city 's money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the ticket will you withdraw in favor of Mr , Hearst ? " asked one young man near the front , explaining that he meant no offense . " Our subways Must- come from the city 's money , replied ' Mr. Bonnard . " But they should not be operated by the city . until the city government is more honest , and ? I 'm not going to withdraw . " A storm of handclapping greeted this . " I want to know what Mr , Bannard regards as the difference between himself and Mr. Hearst ? " was another question . " That is a personal question , " declared Mr. Stimson . Mr. Bannard 's answer was : " I have n't begun to attack , the other candidates **42;727;TOOLONG yet. - Later , when another questioner , , wanted to know why Mr. Bannard thought he was better than Mr. Hearst , the candidate replied : For me to say why I think I am bet ' ter than Mr. Hearst is a little embarras , - ing , at this time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked one man . " t have never read the new charter , " I said Mr. Bannard , but he explained later that he meant he had not read all of it . " Is n't it foolish to try to beat Tammany in a three-cornered fight ? " was another question from the front rows . " If Boss Murphy were here to-night he would smile . Why not centre on one candidate and leave little petty things aside ? " " Well , centre on me , " said Mr. Bannard smiling . A young man near the door wanted to know : " How does Mr. Mitchel account for the fact that the Fusionists take up Prendergast. a tool or , Tim Woodruff 's , I and why , if Mr. Metz proved , himself so efficient . did n't they give him a chance on the ticket ? Also , how do you account for the presence of Shea for Sheriff ? " Mr. Mitchel. who until then had been sitting quietly at Mc . Bannard 's side , got up . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began . " But if I had , so far as I know Ma , Prendergast , I 'd have put him on . , Mr. Prendergast never stood behind the snow removal contractors . I do n't know Mr. Shea . ' If there is anything against him bring it out and let him be defeated . But I do n't believe it . " A man who-had entered with Mr. Mullally here shouted : " There are some Tammany men on the level , too . There 's one ' in this very district  --  Hogan . He 's on the level . " " Why did you ask for an increase in salary from 45,000 to ti.1,500 ? " was another question to Mr. Mitchel . " I asked it because I believe that the character of work in the office of Commissioner of Accounts demands a man who , in private business . is worth that muell , " was the reply . Justice Gaynor 's name was then brought into the discussion . " I have been a nonpartisan man for many years , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaynor typifies all we need in our City Government . I will vote for him . What I want to know from the candidates here is what objection there is td Gaynor ! " " tip to this year , " replied Mr. Mitchel , " Justice Gaynor gave cause . to believe that he was all that could be desired . But this year he has seen fit to place himself at the head of the most disreputable organization of ' men in New York . He goes before the city asking , not for votes for himself alone , but for votes for all the other members of the Board of Estimate . He knows that all his protestations will not serve him , with the Board of Estimate against.iiim . " Could not ' a forceful- man dominate that situation ? " asked a voice . There was no answer to this . Just before Mr. Mullally broke into the talk Mr. Stimson said that he personally was glad that Hearst had entered the fight for the Mayoralty . ?
