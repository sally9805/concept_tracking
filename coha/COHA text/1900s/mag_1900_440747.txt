A NEW biography of Horace Bushnell has been wanted for two reasons . The appreciative and affectionate memoir given to the public , not long after his death , by his daughter , Mrs. Mary Bushnell Cheney , with the cooperation of her sister , Miss Frances Louisa Bushnell , and loving friends of Dr. Bushnell , is out of print . Its publication , we are told , is discontinued . Moreover , the time has come for a biography which attempts , as that did not , a compendious presentation of the man in his office of preacher and theologian . Of such an estimate perspective is an essential condition , ? emphatically essential in the case of one who died while the disturbing controversy he provoked , although less turbulent than formerly , was still seething over unquenched fagots of misunderstanding , pride , and bitterness . The interval has favored cooling , precipitation , analysis , and measurements . The withdrawal of the earlier book is regrettable . After reading Dr. Munger 's volume we turned to the Life and Letters for more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , in a way , complementary . Together they afford a nearly complete and satisfying view of the man and his work . Still there is something wanting . Neither sets forth adequately the robust patriotism and large civic usefulness of Dr. Bushnell . He filled his office of religious teacher and shepherd with copious , overflowing energy , keeping steady outlook upon the world 's social and political life , ? the neighbor life as well as the national and universal life , ? and not infrequently he sent forth messages that commanded serious attention . A biography that shall portray his amplitude of power , his variety of service , in juster proportion and completeness may never be written . Yet this career had a quality of distinction , a unique productiveness , an exemplary virtue and loveliness , that may conspire to give it life beyond life in the affection of humanity . Such immortality is not unknown , although it can not be foretold . Each generation culls for itself from the world 's past the heroes and saints of whom it has need . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's theological work with a biography that shall take the place of the Life and Letters . The difficulty is obvious ; and the organic difficulty is intensified by attempting to accomplish the double purpose within the compass of a duodecimo volume of four hundred pages . Presumably , this limitation was prescribed for reasons that were controlling . Consciousness of inadequacy in one partis suggested by the modest , almost apologetic phrase of the preface , ? " a biographical sketch . " Dr. Munger is a literary artist with a nice sense of proportion . The hard task undertaken is as well performed , probably , as it could have been done by anybody . It is , indeed , admirably done . Conceding that the thing most needed was an exhibition of the preacher and theologian , his book affords large satisfaction . Necessarily , the motive dominates the treatment and flavors the tone of composition . The result is that it seems to he a book written especially for the profession . It should not be inconceivable that persons may have great admiration for Horace Bushnell who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His character had a guiding , nourishing , energizing force , potential for uplifting the community of souls . It happened that he was called to vindicate God 's revelations of himself from prevalent misconceptions , to liberate human hearts from thralldom to a hard and oppressive dogmatic theology , and he delivered his message from , or as from , the pulpit . No blame to the theologians for claiming him and exalting him . He was enrolled in their order ; his vocation was in their vineyard ; their cults engaged his chief attention , whether protesting or proposing : but they need not appropriate him too exclusively . He was so broad , so human , so spiritual , so practical , it is not meet that he should be laid away finally on the shelf of a divinity school library . That he was great in his vocation will hardly be gainsaid ; but he was great in his avocations , also , and above all he was great in the sum of qualities and accomplishments , the character . Hence , for example and inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his achievement . This man would have been a discoverer of new truth and a liberator in whatever station he was set . By instinct he was a pioneer , adventurous , 416 Horace Bushnell . fearless , requiring no leader , content to stand alone and to advance alone if deserted by followers . It is not proposed to pursue specifically the development of Bushnell 's theological opinions . That they were not common opinions when promulgated , nor set forth in feebleness , is proved by the prodigious ferment caused by their proclamation , and the long , intense , uncharitable antagonism he endured . What is pertinent here is to show the essentials of Dr. Bushnell 's achievement in the domain of theology as Dr. Munger estimates it . Whether his estimate be correct and final in all respects is a matter that we shall not presume to discuss . As the judgment of one peculiarly qualified to form a just opinion , it must command general respect , if not complete assent . Early in the book , ? chapter iii. , ? . within the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the points of controversy in the orthodox church of New England from the day of the elder Edwards to that of Professor Taylor , of the Yale Seminary , who was Bushnell 's instructor , although Bushnell was not his disciple . It is a swift summary of disputations that gave to the first Jonathan Edwards and his son , to Bellamy , Hopkins , Emmons , Dwight , and Taylor , their distinction as definers of doctrine . Dr. Munger , however he may respect their religious character , is pungently critical of their opinions and methods . What he says of the method of Edwards discloses , by inference , his own radically different motive , which was Bushnell 's habit as well : " The general criticism to be made upon Edwards ' work as a whole is that his avowed purpose was the overthrow of an alleged heresy . He thus incurred the inevitable weakness of the negative method . He assumed that if Arminian-ism were overthrown Calvinism would hold the ground . The mistake was a fatal one , because it substituted contro versy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the error of the enemy , who , in almost any theological controversy , holds enough truth to embarrass the other side . " Bushnell 's search was for higher truth , larger truth , the whole truth . He tested pro-positions by their inclusive rather than their exclusive force . He cultivated what in a fine phrase he called " a vein of comprehensiveness . " He aspired to rise above the incidents of antagonism , and to embrace the saving good of conflicting partial statements in some superlative expansive suggestion that would uplift the understanding , and deliver souls from confinement to low prospects bounded by artificial hills . Taylor 's assertion of the self - determining power of the will startled the orthodox camp like a midnight alarm , and was the provocation of " as intense a theological war as the nineteenth century is capable of . " This war was young when Bushnell began his theological studies ( 1831 ) , and was in full fury when he was settled over the North Church in Hartford . The church contained partisans of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dint of Christian love and shrewd tactfulness during the critical period of installing their shepherd . The later conflict followed hard upon a revolt from Calvinism and the Edwardsian modification of it that rived the New England church in twain , and established the Unitarians as a distinct sect . Of this defection Dr. Munger says : " On theological grounds it was more than half justifiable ; on ecclesiastical grounds it was schismatic , and had the weakness of schism . " Dr. Bushnell 's work was for these as well as for the unseparated disputants of his own communion . " With no antecedents or environment to account for him , he stood out between the two parties under the impulse of his own thought , but having a common message for both . . . . It is not yet easy to realize the importance // of the position maintained by Bushnell . Less and less will hip theological opinions be quoted , though they will not soon be forgotten ; but his stand and method will more and more take on the form of a deliverance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stifling and oppressive dogmas so at war with human nature , awakened to truer conceptions of itself by the potency of new knowledge , that earnest men and women , especially the young , were abandoning the ecclesiastical house of their fathers , in search of vital air and freedom to live hopefully . " Relief was needed at four points : first , from a revivalism that ignored the law of Christian growth ; second , from a conception of the Trinity bordering on tritheism ; third , from a view of miracles that implied a suspension of natural law ; and fourth , from a theory of the Atonement that had grown almost shadowy under ' improvements , ' yet still failed to declare the law of human life . The time had also come when a rational , scientific , cause-and-effect habit of thought was imperatively required , not only on these four points , but in the whole realm of theology . But the doctrines , even as they were held , were not to be cast out and trodden underfoot . They sprang out of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within them . Bushnell undertook to reinterpret these doctrines , and to restate them in the terms of life itself ; to find their ground in nature and revelation , and in the processes of the human spirit . " As a substitute for ? or better , a correction of ? the too great dependence of the churches , for their replenishment , upon so - called " revivals of religion , " Bushnell asserted the possibility and duty of so educating the souls of children that they will develop characters in harmony with the divine character , cheerfully obedient to the Christian law of life , and gravitating to acceptance of the responsibility of church membership // in due season , without awful paroxysms of conscience or cataclysmal drenchings by the Holy Spirit . He denied that the change of heart , theologically termed eon ? : version , must be " the product of sem rate and absolutely independent choice . " The scope of his thought on this theme was concentrated in a volume entitled Christian Nurture , which received its final form in 1861 . Earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused an odium theologicune which pursued him to the end of life , finding new motives in his several publications of unfamiliar doctrine . The opposition never daunted his will to speak the truth as he apprehended it , nor induced him to indulge in covert or surreptitious expression . When the rage and the growling were fiercest over any last utterance , he was apt to distract his critics by flinging down a new theme of contention . Only once or twice did he condescend to take any defensive part in the controversies aroused . Those who would know the full significance of this teacher 's opinions , and why they were so disturbing , must go to Dr. Munger 's book , or to the books in which Bushnell has set them forth . Concerning the Trinity , the Atonement , the Incarnation , the books to be read are God in Christ , Christ in Theology , and The Vicarious Atonement , which in its final form comprises Forgiveness and Law , first published separately . Regarding the miracles and all cognate themes , Nature and the Supernatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God 's various ways of revelation . In his own words , his purpose was " to find a legitimate place for the supernatural in the system of God , and show it as a necessary part of the divine system itself . " Dr. Munger calls this " Bushnell 's most thorough and complete treatise . " His explanatory and critical treatment of it , both in chapter xiii. , which is devoted 418 Horace Bushnell . to it , and in the concluding chapter , while appreciative , is discriminating . Since this is Bushnell 's most original and ambitious contribution to theology , it is fitting to indicate its character by quoting from Dr. Munger somewhat generously , premising that his full thought and felicity are necessarily mutilated by excisions : " The doctrine of miracles has been held in two leading forms : first , that they are to be accepted on the strength of the evidences as stated in Scripture ; second , that the character and teaching of Christ are internal proofs of the reality of his miraculous works , ? Christ carries the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to be felt that the laws of nature could not be regarded as set aside , as in the first view , or ignored , as under the second view . Bushnell saw the difficulty with each , though recognizing a certain force in them . . . . He saw that nature and the supernatural could not be put in essential antithesis , but must form one system . ' His method , however , was , not to bring the supernatural down into what is called the natural , but to lift the natural into the supernatural . The point of contact was anthropological : man is supernatural by virtue of his will ; his consciousness of free agency delivers him from the grasp of endless causation , and makes him one with God in freedom and creative energy . . . . This view of man as a supernatural being , and of ' one system , ' seems to have come to stay , at least in its main features . . . . It is true that there still prevail conceptions of miracle as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the supernatural as a superstition , but the best thought of the day links them together and leaves them by the wayside . This thought , of which Bushnell saw the early gleam , and was the tint among us clearly to herald , stands before nature , the revelations of science , and the unfolding nature of man , in wonder and silence , con fessing that God is behind and in all , and that his laws , like himself , are one . " Turning now from the supreme phase of Bushnell 's life work , we may attempt a more general survey of his personality and achievements . He was born in Litchfield , Connecticut , April 14 , 1802 , of ancestry that had long habitation in the state . When he was three years old the family removed to Preston , not far away , where there was a factory for making woolen cloth , in which the father found occupation at the trade that his own father had followed before him . In this factory the youth Horace was early employed . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry they enjoyed an humble prosperity , not far removed from poverty , never releasing the members from the necessity of toil . Service was the duty of each . Idleness was esteemed not only unprofitable , but sinful . Father and mother were persons of strong character , and of exacting fidelity in every relation . None the less was it a home of cheerfulness , of robust affection , of gentle influences , and of noble aspirations . The religious conditions were adapted to inculcation of toleration and charity . The father had imbibed from his mother Arminian predilections ; the mother was reared in the Protestant Episcopal Church . Nevertheless , both joined and supported the one institution of religion in the town , a Congregational church , where hard doctrines were stoutly preached . The home was a nursery of sincere piety , free from bigotry and arrogance . Mental independence was respected . Individualism had a fair chance . Here was germinated the seed which later blossomed in Christian Nurture , and that noble address The Age of Homespun . He was always proud of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had done a man 's full daily work . Nor had the intellectual part been stunted . He was a lover of books and men , of all life , and of grand // action . He found in the beautiful nature of the region inspirations of joy and thoughtfulness . Between his healthy soul and the spirits of the hills , the fields , the woods , and the streams there was rare facility of communication . The deep sources of his power were already acquired and stored before he determined to go to college . The privilege of a liberal education was open to him early , but was rejected then because his mind , which had a native bent to mechanics and structural work , was well satisfied with the opportunities afforded in the mill . And modesty had something to do with the decision ; " for how , " he later explained , " could an awkward country boy think of going in among the great folk of a college ? " Nevertheless , he continued school work as he had opportunity , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen he united with the village church . From that time a desire for education grew in him . Five years after he had refused it he asked for it . But the homespun manufactured in the mill was going out of use , and the family fortunes were on an ebbing tide . His mother , however , would not relinquish her yearning . She called , as he has gratefully narrated , a family council , " where we drew the calculation close and made up our bill : I to wear homespun to the end , use only secondhand books , and pay the bills of my last year myself ; the family to institute a closer economy for my sake . " He was in his twenty-second year when he began his course at Yale , with scant preparation in scholarship , but in physical hardiness , in mental discipline and judgment , a man among boys . He soon came to the front in the classroom , and was leader also in the athletic sports of the time . All reports represent him to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respected in the college life , though debarred , of course , from the festive so- ciality that requires money for its indulgence , and a stranger to the domestic society of the town . He had some proficiency in music , and founded , for the benefit of the chapel choir , the Beethoven Society , which has maintained a useful existence ever since . His religious life was shadowed by a partial eclipse of faith . The questionings of Christian facts and doctrine then rife made an appeal to his reason that was not overcome for many years , although he engaged in no offensive revolt , and kept the path of righteousness of life . Making it his first duty as a graduate to pay his debts , he began teaching in Norwich . He was not unsuccessful , but he disliked the work , and soon left it to go to New York as assistant editor of the Journal of Commerce . There he labored zealously for ten months , being practically in charge of the newspaper most of the time , owing to the illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great ability that , in a reorganization of the property , he was offered a proprietary interest to remain as editor in chief . The flattering offer did not win him . He said it was " a terrible life , " and having paid his debts , and saved somewhat besides , he returned to New Haven to begin the study of law . In the following summer he decided to go West , work into a law practice , and ultimately into politics . While making his preparations at home he was offered a tutorship in the college . He promptly declined it ; but later , yielding to his mother 's suggestion , he reconsidered , and accepted . But for this , another biographer ? for presumably he would have had one ? might have entitled his volume Horace Bushnell , Jurist and Statesman . Whether there has been gain or loss , what mortal can demonstrate ? His own maturer judgment was , " No other calling but the ministry of Christ , I am obliged to feel , could have anywise filled my inspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bar . He was still in spiritual darkness . Dr. Munger says his state might be described as " sound in ethics , but skeptical in religion . . . . His doubts grew into positive unbelief , which was held in check by his conscience . " In the winter of 1831 the college was solemnized by a revival . The life of the place was aglow with the fervor of consecration . Bushnell gave no sign of sympathy ; nor any sign of opposition , except silence and aloofness . He was no mocker of the faith precious to others . His own pupils copied his attitude . The band of tutors held religious meetings daily , but without him . All feared to interfere with the strong man 's self-striving . He knew their hearts , and filially said to one of them : " I must get out of this woe . Here am I what I am , and these young men hanging to me in their indifference amidst this universal earnestness . " He invited his pupils to meet him , laid bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the one they should make . He joined his fellow tutors in the meeting , confessing the power of the doubts he had nourished , adding : " But I am glad I have a heart as well as a head . My heart wants the Father ; my heart wants the Son ; my heart wants the Holy Ghost ; ? and one just as much as the other . My heart says the Bible has a Trinity for me , and I mean to hold by my heart . . . . But that is all I can do yet . " Long afterward , referring to the period of his aberration , he said : " My very difficulty was that I was too thoughtful , substituting thought for everything else , and expecting so intently to dig out a religion by my head that I was pushing it all the while practically away . " He entered the theological seminary , completing his course there , not by any means accepting all that was taught as very truth . Nevertheless , he was licensed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Church in Hartford . He was married in the same year to Miss Mary Apthorp , of New Haven , a descendant of John Davenport , the colony 's first minister , ? a happy and helpful union that fitly nourished the strength and tenderness of his character . When ordained he was thirty-one years old , a broadly , sanely , maturely developed man , with an exceptionally various and liberal training , versed in labor , self-denial , and suffering , all his wisdom of knowledge and experience resting on basic talents that in happy combination constituted a power akin to genius , if not genius itself . His definition of genius was , " The power of mental application . " This he surely had . Was lie a great preacher ? Not by every standard . He preached great sermons . The contents of his published volumes , even those not specifically called sermons , are in large part the thoughts that he had first broached to his Hartford congregation , and in much the same language ; but he did not attract the multitude in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason were not spellbound by his utterance . They might be conscious that high thoughts , sentences of weighty import , surcharged with conviction , grandly phrased , were sounding in their ears ; but it must have required an eager and sympathetic intelligence to apprehend the height and the depth of the deliverance , to compass its broad significance and mark the flight of his swift suggestions . Dr. Munger cites a remark , in colloquia of Professor George Adam Smith , that " Bushnell is the preacher 's preacher , as Spenser is the poet 's poet . His sermons are on the shelves of every manse in Scotland . " The Scotch ministers are no mean judges of the intellectual quality of sermons . He was not altogether and only this kind of a preacher . He fed his flock , holding his church and congregation in loving confidence and support through twenty-six years , much of the time amidst such storms of outer hostility and distrust as few churches // have fared through without disruption or exhaustion . No man could have made this record in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend so much upon the pulpit service , unless he was a great preacher to his own . Of his early pulpit manner Mrs. Cheney says : " His preaching had in those days a fiery quality , an urgency and willful force , which in his later style is still felt in the more subdued glow of poetic imagery . There was a nervous insistence about his person , and a peculiar emphasizing swing of his right arm from the shoulder , which no one who has ever heard him is likely to forget . It seemed as if , with this gesture , he swung himself into his subject , and would fain carry others along with him . His sermons were always written out in full ; never extemporized , never memorized . " Donald G. Mitchell , in American Lands and Letters , characterizes him as " a vital preacher . " Describing the impression made by him in later life , preaching in the Yale chapel , Ile says : " A. spare man , ? as I remember him , ? of fair height , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , ? almost the hollow cheeks of an anchorite , and with a voice that bore one into celestial altitudes . We upon the oaken benches were not great lovers of sermons in those clays , or of preachers ; but here was a man whose voice and manner held us . . . . In his sermon there was pith ; he stuck to the core of things . He was outside and remote from conventionalities , ? so remote that you would hardly expect him to say a ' good-morning ' as other men did , but to put casual greeting into such fashion as would strike deeper and last longer ; a seer looking into the depths that hem us in , with uttered warnings , expostulations , tender encouragements , all wrapped in words that tingled with new meanings , or beguiled one with their resonant euphuisms . " Dr. Munger 's testimony is : " He can be fully appreciated only by those who heard him preach . Sermon and delivery fitted each other like die and image . The sincerity of the word was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poetry of his diction was sustained by the music of his voice , which always fell into a rhythmic cadence . The flights of his imagination were not rhetorical strivings , but the simple rehearsals of what he saw . His effective . ness was peculiar . If he gained any hearing at all , he won the consent of the whole man , ? not agreement always , but intellectual and moral sympathy . He was the most democratic and most human of preachers , and at the same time one of the loftiest and most spiritual . He spoke to men as on equal terms and in a direct way , taking them into his confidence and putting himself in their place , feeling their needs , sharing their doubts , and reasoning the questions out as one of them . He never berates , and if he exhorts , it is in the same spirit of comradeship over the matter in hand . Still he is dominated by the subject and its demands , following where it goes ; and if any of his hearers falter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest on to the final solution , or up to the last look into the mystery . " His published sermons live . Wanting the interpretation of his voice and glance and gesture , they are still vital , inspiring , grand , testifying to his primacy among contemporaries and his enduring sway . However familiar his speculative opinions , once novel , may become , or whether they become obsolete , the message of his best sermons will not grow dull nor trite . It addresses the verities of being , temporal and eternal . And literature will be apt to treasure some of these sermons , with many of his essays and addresses , as choice trophies of achievement in the art of English expression . During the whole term of his pastorate , and until the end of his life , he was the public-spirited citizen , actively pro- 422 Horace Bushnell . moting the prosperity of his city and state , and giving to the affairs of the nation earnest attention . He kept abreast of the current social and political movements of a history-making epoch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . His first published sermon ( 1835 ) was entitled The Crisis of the Church . In it he arraigned slavery as an impending peril . " It has its seat in the will rather than the conscience ; and all its moral affinities from the first have accordingly been adverse , and have operated to depress that noble virtue that gave birth to our institutions . . . . The whole material of slavery , all the moral elements which it supplies to our institutions , are inflammable and violent . At almost any hour it may explode the foundations of the republic . " From that time onward to the outbreak of the slaveholders ' rebellion , and through the agony of the war to the final overthrow of the " dire evil , " ? final in respect of its concrete organism , ? he kept his influence steadily useful to the party of freedom , crowning this devotion by the majestic solemn oration on Our Obligations to the Dead , at the commemoration by Yale College of her sons who had fallen in the war for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered ( 1865 ) before reconstruction measures were enacted , he proposed an amendment to the Constitution , providing that " the basis of representation in Congress shall be the number , in all the states alike , of the free male voters therein . " He divined that , under such an amendment , political interest , without other enforcement , would establish impartial suffrage securely . Something like this has been proposed lately as a remedy for the evasions that have been accomplished in defeat of the purpose of the amendment that our lawyer statesmen produced with so much travail . In 1840 , sixty years ago , he uttered a denunciation of the immoral spoils sys tem of party government that has not been bettered in the long interval since : " Let me take you to the scene where your Lord is crucified ; and after the work is done , I will point you then to four men , not the most worthy , sitting down to parcel out the garments of the crucified Saviour , and casting their lots for the seamless robe lie wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the doctrine of the spoils is to be the universal doctrine of politics , " then we shall have a scene in this land never before exhibited on earth ; one which would destroy the integrity and sink the morality of a nation of angels . It will be as if so many offices , worth so much , together with the seamless robe of our glorious Constitution , were held up to be the price of victory . . . . Only conceive such a lure held out to this great people , and all the little offices of the government thus set up for the price of victory , ? without regard to merit or anything but party services , and you have a spectacle of baseness and rapacity such as was never seen before . No preaching of the gospel in our land , no parental discipline , no schools , not all the machinery of virtue together , can long be a match for the corrupting power of our political strifes actuated by such a law as this . It would make us a nation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earnest ally of public education in its lower and its higher realms . At a time when the Hartford schools were in a low state he was active in stimulating public opinion to lift them up , and his effort produced great and permanent effects . No one has more clearly perceived the high public uses of common schools for all classes of the people . During a year spent in California , sieli man that he was , he devoted himself with ardor to forwarding the project of a university , giving impulse to a nascent public sentiment which has blossomed gloriously . This is only one of the ways in which he exerted a beneficent influ- ence in moulding the young commonwealth , whose promise he measured with a statesman 's prescience. - Rev. J. H. Twichell , of Hartford , has said , " Bushnell lies back of all that is best in the city . " Another says , " Hartford is largely what he has made it .

By a labor begun almost alone , and continued through years as tactfully as persistently , he prevailed in reclaiming an unsightly and nauseous region in the heart of the city and transforming it into a park , which , while he lay dying , was by vote of the city government named Bushnell Park . All these things , and many more that can not be enumerated , were accomplished by sheer ability to impress his better judgment on the conviction of men of affairs . What has been said herein of his active concern in civic affairs and in the moral aspect of political issues , which is the aspect sound statesmanship must perforce consider , hardly suggests the resources for fuller treatment available to an unhampered biographer .

It had a racy Litchfield County strength and sweetness for the soil of it , upon which the culture of the scholar and the imagination of the poet , spontaneously springing and flowering , wrought some noble developments of grace and splendor . He was a trained logician , but he made little use of dialectic , being persuaded that religious truth is not so demonstrated to the soul . Late in life , to one who inquired whether certain traits of his style were the results of any peculiar method of training , he wrote that , after a " strong lift in religious experience , " he found he had no language to serve him in his higher thoughts .

He speaks of this symbolism as his own discovery , and so undoubtedly it NI ; but it had been discovered also by others . Emerson definitely formulated it in the fourth part of Nature . It is a corollary of Swedenborg 's doctrine of correspondences , and in Emerson 's essay on Swedenborg the root idea is tracked back to Plato . Bushnell affirms that " the whole universe of nature is the perfect analogon of the whole world of thought or spirit . " This differs only in form from Emerson 's statement , " Nature is the symbol of the spirit . " Of Dr. Bushnell 's personal traits there is little space to speak . That he was a man of uncommon affection and tenderness appears in the tributes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family letters , of which many are given in the earlier memoir . He began his ministry and the establishment of a home on a salary of twelve hundred dollars a year , with a resolution , which he kept , never to incur a debt which he did not know how he was to pay . His domestic life , of which one of his daughters gives report , was of the sweetest type , simple , familiar , cheerful , and consider ate . He was punctual in business and in duties . His conversation with friends was cordial , meaty , entertaining , often brilliant . Neither health nor inclination , to say nothing of his constant serious occupation , permitted much participation in social festivity . He had innate dignity and courtesy , although sometimes abrupt to the point of brusqueness , and when the provocation was great he could be sternly severe . He bore affliction with resignation , and crosses with patience . His favorite recreations were gardening and fishing . One may surmise that his scholarship was excursive and liberal rather than exact or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weakness of Bushnell , if regarded as a professional theologian , that he " not only wrote , but published first , and read later , with the result of a real or apparent modification of his opinions . " While he was glad of approbation , he was not dependent upon it , nor was he deflected by it . He consulted with himself . He leaned on conscience . Feeling God at his back , he encountered hu ? loan favor and blame with an equal mind . Except in some of his theological works , he seldom felt a need of reinforcing his opinions or illustrating them , much less of adorning them , by quotation . If he sometimes made his argument overstrenuous , it was through urgency of zeal rather than in pride of power , and never in malice of temper . He cherished no animosities , and courted peace rather than strife , but not at the price of suppressing the message he was charged to deliver .

For thirty years he was in broken health that interrupted // his loved labor , and kept him for long periods from home . This , too , was patiently borne , in a way that wrought mellowness and spirituality of character . It is pleasant to know that he lived down in large degree the personal hostility provoked by his bold divergence from accepted standards . In later life he was invited to pulpits that had long been shut against him , and his last days were comforted by evidences of generous appreciation and affection . In part , the changed conditions were due to the growth of liberal opinions ; still more to a life which exemplified the Master 's instruction . His theology was a lift forward , a contribution to progress , not a finality . One who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science re- vealing its universal laws , the true universe of thought and spirit can not sooner be conceived , " could not have hoped to speak the final word . Already his work in this department , important as it was in his day , is being overwhelmed by an influx of new knowledge and light . Its fame must be intrusted to the historians of religion . A longer life in common remembrance will be the fate of his strong , spiritual , rejoicing sermons ; and the contents of such books as Work and Play , Moral Uses of Dark Things , and Building Eras have perennial worth and ministration . All in all , he must be accounted a man of noble stature , whose work promoted that conception of God as love which
