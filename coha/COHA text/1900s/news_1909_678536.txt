txt After an afternoon Spent in bitter wrangling , over the parliamentary status of the corporation tax amendment Senator Aldrich finally smoothed the " way for a vote just before the /min for adjournment . The corporation tax ' vas adopted . as a substitute for the BalleyuCummins Mcrae levy by a vote of 45 to 31 ? seven Republicans and all the Democrats opposing the substitution . Then the final vote incorporating the tax amendment into the Tariff Bill was carried by a vote of 60 to 11 . Three Democrats and eight Republicans voted against the final acceptance of the President 's compromise . In the smooth working of the Senate lifter'things got started the hand of Senator Aldrich could be seen . He returned from his trip in time to be in . his seat today , and at once began Work heading Off speeches from Senators Heyburn , Bulkley , and others . In the . end , however , after he tried in vain to secure an agreement for a vote on the tax to-morrow at 1 o'clock Senator Aldrich admitted that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Senator Cummins was Holding put for the right to debate subsequent amendments that might b3 introduced when Mr. Aldrich quietly asked that the Vice President put the question . A roll call had already been ordered against the time a vote might be reached and the reading clerk hurriedly called Mr. Aldrich 's name . He answered , ' and under the rule that shut off all debate . But Mr. Bailey asserted that he was on his feet before the roll negan , and announced that though he had nothing more to say , he would speak until " a sick Senator , " Mr. Frazer of Tennessee , could reach the chamber . Mr. Frazer came Mirriedly in an auto from - his hotel , where he was suffering from malaria , and the vote then proceeded . The amendment as adopted is unchanged from . in which it was reported by Mr. Aldrich - last Friday , A number of amendments were offered to the committee proposition , but under Mr . Aldrich 's , delicate . ha.ndling of the .. situa. tion most of them were . tuled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ' either voted down without difficulty or with the con -- sent of their author-simply referred tothe committee for subsequent considers= tion . Mr. Aldrich announced , however , that ' if any changes are made at all they will be technical in character . On the first two roll calls one incorporating . the corporation tax into the countervailing clause offered by Mr. Lodge as a substitute for the income tax and the other substituting directly the corporation . for the income levy , the vote was 45 to 31 . The seven Republicans who voted with the straight Democratic membership against the substitution were Borah , , ) Bristow , Bulkeiey , . Clapp , Cummins , Dolliver ; and La Follette . Only six of these are of the recognized insurgent camp , Mr. Bulkeley casting his vote against the measure on account of local insurance interests in his State . On the final vote , against the adoption of the tax as a part of the bill the same seven ' Republicans voted against . the measure , and in addition Mr. Heyburn . He announced two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means of relieving the " parliamentary situation " In regard , to the income tax amendment . After that he voted against the corporation measure az .. a blow against the protective system and because , as he said , he believed the Tariff bill would raise sufficient revenue . The only Democrats to vote against the final adoption of the tax after the Bailey-Cummins plan had been definitely defeated were Senators Shively , Hughes , and Chamberlain . Other Democrats , like Overman and Newlands , sat In their places and did not answer to their names . A few Senators on both sides , like Beveridge of Indiana , avoided the issue by absenting- themselves without pairing . When the possibility or fixing a time for a vote was raised by Mr. Aldrich the insurgents and Democrats held out for the right to debate all amendments offered after the disposal of the pending tax proposition , Though their insistence finally prevented any agreement being reached when the voting actually began without any limitation , it was found that Mr. Aldrich had so a:rrahged It that after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order , and nearly all debate was shut off by the simple motion to table . This ruling cut off several amendments intended to exempt beneficiary corporations'and craterrial organizations , and one by Mr. Bacon including bonds In the provisions of the tax . Senator Bacon was finally driven to offer his amendments as additions to the whole ' corporations tax , ' and .. n motion of Mr. Aldrich the were tabled by votes of 42 to 32 and 41 to 34 . The Republicans did not insist upon votes on their amendments . Mr. Aldrich 's attitude led to a sharp ' clash with Mr. Bacon . ' The debate brought ' out several new objections to the measure . Mr. Elkins , who finally voted for the measure , throughout , asked if a tax of 1 per cent . would . not do . just as well as the 2 per cent . levy , and the only answer he got from Mr. Aldrich was that as the Senator from Rhode Island did not believe any tax was necessary it was hard for him to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax ' would raise at leasti $50 , -1 000,000 , while he did not believe that next year 's deficit would exceed $40.000,000 . ! " If we enter oh anew era of extravagance , " said Mr. Aldrich , " there Is norevenue in sight that will prove sufficient . But if , as I hope , we return to a wise , and reasonable administration of the Gov- , ernment I think the bill as it stands will raise ample revenue . " Mr. Cummins In his closing speech again attacked the plan ; asserting that ' its serves the purposes of the mighty corporations . " Senator Hughes of Colorado insinuated that the pending measure was drawn Intentionally wrong to provoke its Immediate repeal . The maximum and minimum provisions will be taken up to-morrow , and the administrative clauses will be taken , up ? in turn . It- is expected that a drawback clause be reported by the , committee early in the week , ' while the constitutional ' amendment in regard to the income tax will , probably be disposed of , lo-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early adjournment . ' Mr. Aldrich - declared he did . not ? see how the bill could remain in- the Senate longer than next week . ? : ? - The Republican members of the Finance Committee of the Senate have ' agreed upon an increase in the ? tax on cut and plug tobacco and cigars and cigarettes , amounting to about ' 20 percent . over the House rates .
