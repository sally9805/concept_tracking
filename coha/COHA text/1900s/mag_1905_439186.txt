I avoid myself . How could I be alone in the Roman emperor 's chamber of mirrors ? I seek a garret . The spiders must not be disturbed , nor the floor swept , nor the lumber arranged . November 5 , 1837 . Truth . Truth strikes us from behind , and in the dark , as well as from before and in broad daylight . February 9 , 1838 . Fear .

The Indian must have possessed no small share of vital energy to have rubbed industriously stone upon stone for long months till at length he had rubbed out an axe or pestle , ? as though he had said in the face of the constant flux of things , I at least will live an enduring life . April 15 , 1838 . Conversation .

April 24 , 1838 . Steamships . Men have been contriving new means and modes of motion . Steamships have been westering during these late days and nights on the Atlantic waves , ? the fuglers of a new evolution to this generation . Meanwhile plants spring silently by the brooksides , and the grim woods wave indifferent ; the earth emits no howl , pot on fire simmers and seethes , and men go about their business . August 5 , 1838 . Divine Service in the Academy Hall . In dark places and dungeons these words might perhaps strike root and grow , but utter them in the daylight and their dusky hues are apparent .

Barns and out-buildings , which in the nearness mar by their presence the loveliness of nature , are not only endurable , but , observed where they lie by some waving field of grain or patch of woodland , prove a very cynosure to the pensive eye . Let man after infinite hammering and din of crows uprear a deformity on the plain , yet will nature have her revenge on the hilltop . Retire a stone 's throw and she will have changed his base metal into gold . September 15 , 1838 . Flow of Spirits in Youth . How unaccountable the flow of spirits in youth !

I sit here this fourth of June , looking out on men and nature from this that I call my perspective window , through which all things are seen in their true relations . This is my upper empire , bounded by four walls , viz. , three of boards yellow-washed , facing the north , west , and south , respectively , and the fourth of plaster , likewise yellow-washed , fronting the sunrise , ? to say nothing of the purlieus and out-lying provinces , unexplored as yet but by rats .

They are like air bubbles on water , hastening to flow together . History tells of Orestes and Pylades , Damon and Pythias , but why should we not put to shame those old reserved Worthies by a community of such ? This conjunction of souls , like waves which meet and break , subsides also backward over things , and gives all a fresh aspect . I would live henceforth with sonic gentle soul such a life as may be conceived , double for variety , single for harmony , tiro , only that we might admire at our oneness , ? one , because indivisible .

Mardi 21 , 1810 . The world is a fit theatre to-day in which any part may be acted . There is this moment proposed to me every kind of life that fliers lead anywhere , or that imagination can paint . By another spring I may be a mail-carrier in Peru , or a South African planter , or a Siberian exile , or a Greenland whaler , or a settler on the Columbia River , or a Canton merchant , or a soldier in Florida , or a mackerel fisher off Cape Sable , or a Robinson Crusoe in the Pacific , or a silent navigator of any sea . So wide is the choice of parts , what a pity if the part of Hamlet be left out ! I am freer than any planet ; no complaint reaches round the world . I can move away from public opinion , from government , from religion , from education , from society . Shall I be reckoned a rateable poll in the county of Middlesex , or be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

For my Brobdingnag I may sail to Patagonia ; for my Lilliput , to Lapland . In Arabia and Persia my day 's adventures may surpass the Arabian Nights ' Entertainments . I may be a logger on the head waters of the Penobscot , to be treated in fable hereafter as an amphibious river god by as sounding a name as Triton or Proteus ; carry furs from Nootka to China , and so be more renowned than Jason and his golden fleece ; or go on a South Sea exploring expedition to be hereafter recounted along with the periplus of Hamm . I may repeat the adventures of Marco Polo or Mandeville . These are but few of my chances , and how mass more things may I do with which there are none to be com-pared ! June 18 , 1840 .

I have a deep sympathy with war , it so apes the gait and bearing of the soul . July 16 , 1840 . We are as much refreshed by sounds as by sights , or scents , or flavors , ? as the barking of a dog heard in the woods at midnight , or the tinklings which attend the dawn . As 1 picked blackberries this morning , by starlight , the distant yelping of a dog fell on my inward ear , as the cool breeze on my cheek . July 10 , 1840 .

She seems not to have provided for , but by a thousand contrivances against , it . She has bevelled the margins of the eyelids that the tears may not overflow on the cheek . Saturday , January 30 , 1841 . Sometimes I come out suddenly upon a high plain which seems to be the upper level and true surface of the earth and by its very baldness aspires and lies up nearer to the stars , ? a place where a deealogue might be let down or a saint translated . There is all the romance of my youth-f ullest moment in music . Heaven lies about us , as in our infancy . There is nothing so wild and extravagant that it does not make true . It makes a dream my only real experience , and prompts faith to such elasticity that only the incredible can satisfy it .

When one gets up to address briefly a strange audience , in that little he may have opportunity to say , he will not quite do himself injustice . For he will instantly and instinctively average himself to his audience , and , while he is true to his own character still , be will in a few moments make that impression which a series of months and years would but expand . Before he answers , his thought like lightning runs round the whole compass of his experiences , and he is scrupulous to speak from that which he is , and with a more entire truthfulness than usual .

" My diet is so little stimulating , and my body in consequence so little heated , as to excite no antagonism in nature , but flourishes like a tree which finds even the winter genial to its expansion and the secretion of sap . May not the body defend itself against cold by its very nakedness , and its elements be so simple and single that they can not congeal ? Frost does not affect one but several .

If man always conformed to Nature , he would not have to defend himself against her , but find her his constant nurse and friend , as do plants and quadrupeds . February 8 , 1841 . My Journal . I find it everywhere as free as the leaves which troop along the lanes in autumn . The crow , the goose , the eagle , carry my quill , and the wind blows the leaves as far as I go . Or if my imagination does not soar , but gropes in slime and mud , then I write with a reed . Wednesday , February 10 , 1841 .

I am confined to the house by bronchitis , and so seek to content myself with that quiet and serene life there is in a warm corner by the fireside , and see the sky through the chimney top . Sickness should not be allowed to e stend further than the body . We need only to retreat further within us , to preserve uninterrupted the continuity of serene hours to the end of our lives . As soon as I find my chest is not of tempered steel , and heart of adamant , I bid good bye to these and look out a new nature . I will be liable to no accidents . ' Thursdoy , February 18 , 1841 .

The care of the body is the highest exercise of prudence . If I have brought this weakness 011 my lungs , I will consider calmly and disinterestedly how the thing came about , that I may find out the truth and render justice . Then , after patience , I shall be a wiser man than before . Thursday , April 15 , 1841 . The gods are of no sect ; they side with no man .

Any simple , unquestioned mode of life is alluring to men . The man who picks peas steadily for a living is more than respectable . He is to be envied by his neighbors . Sunday , April 18 , 1841 . We take little steps , and venture small stakes , as if our actions were very fatal and irretrievable . There is no swing to our deeds . But our life is only a retired valley where we rest on our packs awhile . Between us and our end there is room for any delay .

There are two classes of authors : the one write the history of their times , the other their biography . Friday , April 23 , 1841 . Any greatness is not to be mistaken . Who shall cavil at it ? It stands once for all on a level with the heroes of history . It is not to be patronized . It goes alone .

The charm of the Indian to me is that he stands free and unconstrained in nature , is her inhabitant and not her guest , and wears her easily and gracefully . But the civilized man has the habits of the house . His house is a prison , in which he finds himself oppressed and confined , not sheltered and protected . He walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms as if the walls would fall in and crush him , and his feet remember the cellar beneath . His muscles are never relaxed . It is rare that lie overcomes the house , and learns to sit at home in it , and roof and floor and walls support themselves , as the sky and trees and earth . It is a great art to saunter . Wednesday , April 28 , 1841 . We falsely attribute to men a determined character ; putting together all their yesterdays and averaging them , we presume we know them . Pity the man who has a character to support . It is worse than a large family . He is silent poor indeed . But in fact character is never explored , nor does it get developed in time , but eternity is its development . time its envelope . In view of this distinction , a sort of divine politeness and heavenly good breeding suggests itself , to address always the enveloped character of a man . I approach a great nature with infinite expectation and uncertainty , not knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexplored before me as a scraggy hillside or pasture .

Much more does a character show newly and variedly , if directly seen . It is the highest compliment to suppose that in the intervals of conversation your companion has expanded and grown . It may be a deference which he will not understand , but the nature which underlies him will understand it , and your influence will lie shed as finely on him as the dust in the sun settles on our clothes .

Better a monosyllabic life than a ragged and muttered one ; let its report he short and round like a rifle , so that it may hear its own echo in the surrounding silence . Monday , May 1 , 1841 . We are all pilots of the most intricate Bahama channels . Beauty may he the sky overhead , but Duty is the water underneath .

Sunday , May 9 , 1841 . The pine stands in the woods like an Indian , untamed , with a fantastic wildness about it even in the clearings . If an Indian warrior were well painted , with pines in the background , lie would seem to blend with the trees , and make a harmonious expression . The pitch pines are the ghosts of Philip and Massasoit . The white pine has the smoother features of the squaw . Sunday , May 23 , 1841 . Barn . The distant woods are but the tassels of my eye .

The pines are unrelenting sifters of thought ; nothing petty leaks through them . Let me put my ear close and hear the sough of this book , that I may know if any inspiration yet haunts it . There is always a later edition of every book than the printer wots of , no matter how recently it was published . All nature is a new impression every instant . Thursday , May 27 , 1841 .

I seem to see the ribs of the creature . This is the aspect of their day , its outside , ? their heaven above their heads , towards which they breathe their prayers . So much is between me and them . It is noon there , perchance , and ships are at anchor in the havens or sailing on the seas , and there is a din in the streets , and in this light or that shade - one leisurely soul contemplates .

Of those noble deeds which have rise for their object I am only the most fortunate spectator , and would rather be the abettor of their nobleness than stay their tide with the obstructions of impatient gratitude . As true as action and reaction are equal , that nobleness which was as wide as the universe will rebound not on him the individual , but on the world .

Wednesday , December 29 , 1841 . One does not soon learn the trade of life . That one may work out a true life requires more art and delicate skill than any other work . There is need of the nice fingers of the girl as well as the tough hand of the farmer . The daily work is too often toughening the pericarp of the heart as well as the hand . Great familiarity with the world must be nicely managed , lest it win away and bereave us of some susceptibility . Experience bereaves us of our innocence ; wisdom bereaves us of our ignorance .

It is redolent of sweet-scented orchards , of innocent , teeming harvests . I realize the existence of a goddess Pomona , and that the gods have really intended that men should feed divinely , like themselves , on their own nectar and ambrosia . They have so painted this fruit , and freighted it with such a fragrance , that it satisfies much more than an animal appetite . Grapes , peaches , berries , nuts , etc. , are likewise provided for those who will sit at their sideboard . I have felt , when partaking of this inspiring diet , that my appetite was an indifferent consideration ; that eating became a sacrament , a method of communion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sitting at the communion table of the world . And so have not only quenched my thirst at the spring , but the health of the universe . The indecent haste and grossness with which our food is swallowed have cast a disgrace on the very net of eating itself . But I do believe that if this process were rightly conducted , its aspects and effects would be wholly changed , and we should receive our daily life and health Antaiitslike , with an ecstatic delight , and , with upright front , an innocent and graceful behavior , take our strength from day to day . This fragrance of the apple in my pocket has , I confess , deterred me from eating of it ; I am more effectually fed by it another way . A man most find his own occasion in himself . The natural day is very calm and will hardly reprove our indolence . If there is no elevation in our spirits , the pond will not seem elevated like a ; noun- lain tarn , but a low pool , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All nature is classic and akin to art ; the sumach and pine and hickory which surround my house remind me of the most eraceful sculpture . Sometimes their tops , or a single limb or leaf , seem to have grown to a distinct expression , as if it were a symbol for me to interpret . Poetry , Painting , and Sculpture claim at once and associate with themselves those perfect specimens of the art of nature ,  --  leaves , vines , acorns , pine cones , The critic must at last stand as mute ! tonight contented before a true poem as before an acorn or a vine leaf . The perfect work of art is received again into the bosom of nature , whence its material proceeded , and that criticism which can only ! feted its unnaturalness has no longer any office to fulfill . The choicest maxims that have color down to us are more beautiful or integrally wise than they are wise to our understandings .

Most men are so taken up with the cares and rude practice of life that its finer fruits can not be plucked by them . Literally the laboring man has not leisure for a strict and lofty integrity day by day . Ile can not afford to sustain the fairest and noblest relations . His labor will depreciate in the market . Most men have forgotten that it was ever morning ; but a few serene memories , healthy and wakeful natures , there are , who assure us that the sun rose clear , heralded by the singing of birds , ? this very day 's sun , which rose before Mem- 120 live to a good old age such as the ancients reached , serene and contented , dignifying the life of man , leading a simple , epic , country life in these lays of confusion and turmoil , ? that is what Wordsworth has done , retaining the tastes and innocence of his youth . There is more wonderful talent , but nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man would seem to be going all to wrack and pieces and no instance of permanence and the ancient natural health , notwithstanding Burns , and Coleridge , and Carlyle . It will not do for men to die young . The greatest genius does not die young . Whom the gods love most do , indeed , die young , but not until their life is matured ; and their years are Else those of the oak , for they are the products half of nature and half of God . What should nature do without old men , ? not children , but men ? The life of men , not to become a mockery and a jest , should last a respectable terns of years . We can not spare the age of those old Greek Philosophers . They live long who do not live for a near end , who still forever look to the immeasurable future for their manhood . What seems so fair and poetic in antiquity ? almost fabulous ? is realized , too , in Concord life . As poets and historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestled there as well as strength of body , so have we seen works of kindred genius read at our Concord games , by their author , in their own Concord amphitheatre . It is virttually repeated by all ages and nations . The way to compare men is to compare their respective ideals . The actual man is too complex to deal with .
