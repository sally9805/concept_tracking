 |p563  WE are accustomed to regard the great American fortunes as peculiarly the product of American genius and enterprise . We have an unbounded admiration for the aggressive leaders who have built our railroads , laid our telegraph and cable lines , and organized our manufacturing plants ? an admiration based largely on the conviction that , in piling up riches for themselves , they unconsciously created the nation 's wealth . Activity is so much the national watchword that we can hardly conceive of a great fortune accumulated by slow and easy stages , with no undue display of energy by its possessors . One of the largest American estates , however , is not an over-night growth ; not'the creation of dazzling enterprise or the green baize of Wall Street . It is the result of a century 's savings , the product of the old-stocking school of finance . Its beneficiaries can lay claim to no great genius , except the genius , perhaps the rarest of all , of profiting by others ' labor . They have contributed practically nothing to upbuilding the Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . The headquarters of the Astor estate is a two-story red brick building on Twentysixth Street , just west of Broadway . Its heavily barred windows are expressive of the policy of exclusiveness and silence which reign within . It is divided by a heavy par tition , the eastern half utilized by what may be called the Foreign , or English Department , the western by the American branch . Day after day files in a procession in every way typical of New York . At one time it is an unkempt Russian Jew from the East Side ; at another a paragon of fashion from Fifth Avenue ; at another a dapper business man from downtown . They come to lease fashionable residences or great business buildings , in many cases to pay over the counter their monthly tribute . Every morning arrives a mass of mail , from which the clerks collect a huge bulk of checks ? the rent money for the thousands of Astor tenements , residences , hotels , office buildings , docks , and leased lands . Periodically a certain portion of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Mr. John Jacob Astor , fourth of that name , lives in state . How much it is few men except the recipient know , the Astors , above all , never talking of their wealth . According to the closest observers , however , it can not be less than $3,000,000 a year . Twice , if not three times that amount , is sent to Clieveden , Taplow , Bucks , England , where lives the greatest absentee landlord in the world , the present head of the Astor family . His one connecting link with his abjured country , and the one touch of sentiment in the Astor office , is a little back room , formerly the business headquarters of William Waldorf 's father , the  |p564  third John Jacob . The desk is precisely as he left it when he died in 1890 , and every morning , by the orders of his now British son , a cluster of fresh roses is placed upon it . Most of the income obtained from their holdings , both John Jacob and William Waldorf reinvest in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , charity hospitals , people 's institutes , or library chains for them . They have learned the lesson of the unearned increment too well . Here , then , in the most democratic city of democratic America , is a great family , established on purely aristocratic lines . It has many branches ? the Delanos , the Chanlers , the Careys , the Van Alens , the Wendels , and the rest ? whose collective fortune can not be far from $450,000,000 . The story of how this immense store was heaped up , and the forces contributing to it , should be one of the most suggestive chapters in American economic history . Ultimately it is based upon the foresight of one man ? the first in a long line of American prophets who , unlike the seers of old , have translated their vision into substantial dollars and cents . This man , the ragged son of an idle German butcher , landed from the steerage at New York one hundred and twenty years ago . According to his great-grandson , William Waldorf , Johann Jakob Astor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandee of the twelfth century . Soon after his arrival in New York , however , he was a delivery boy for a German baker . " Yacob was nodding but a little paker poy , " once remarked his sister , a Mrs. Ehringer , " und soldt pread and cake . " With the main facts of his life most of us are familiar : how he made solitary trips through the unfrequented forests of New York State ; how he bartered gold , beads and firearms with the Indians for furs ; how he sent these to China in his own ships , bringing back cargoes of tea , for which the Americans of those days had a famous appetite . That he made a snug fortune is evident from the fact that , by 1800 , he was living on the Broadway block where the Astor House now stands , with such neighbors as Rufus King , David Lydig , and John Rutherford ; but Astor 's ambitions reached far beyond this . About this time he made the discovery which has proved so profitable ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that New York was to be its capital . How best could he turn this sufficiently obvious fact to his own advantage ? Astor looked north from the City Common ? now City Hall Park ? and found his answer in the sweeping fields and forests and swamps of the Knickerbocker yeomanry . Not many years hence , he said , these neglected farms will be occupied by the houses and business buildings of a hard-working , rent-paying people . At present their owners , year after year , plant their corn and wheat and potatoes , altogether oblivious of the golden crop the future is to yield . Many of them are pinched for money ; their great estates are heavily mortgaged ; anyone so foolish as to buy would be a welcome deliverer . And after I have purchased them , what then ? Simply sit down and wait . No anxiety , no sleepless nights , no work . Year after year the city will grow northward and gradually envelop these farms . It can make no progress without first coming to terms with those who then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would not even take the trouble to make my own improvements or put up my own buildings . A sharp-witted man could so manage matters that , in most cases he could even escape taxation . In ten , twenty , and thirty years the people will need the land badly enough to do these things themselves . Never was man given so splendid an opportunity to reap where others have sown . And thus began the extended land purchases which have continued uninterruptedly to this day . Perhaps Astor received his earliest hint from his brother Henry , who antedated him in this country several years . According to tradition , Henry came over during the Revolution as a sutler in the Hessian army . Heinrich Astor was a rotund , rollicking butcher , whose keenness for money-getting was tempered by good-humor . Every day he jovially pushed his merchandise in a wheelbarrow from the Bull 's Head market in the Bowery to his stall in Hanover Square . To that daily exercise the great Astor fortune owes its beginning . Henry Astor bought several acres on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother Jacob . In the neighborhood of Hester Street , in a district now densely populated by Italians , " Jacob Astor , furr merchant , " purchased largely . The prices paid seem ludicrous today . Thus the Bayards , whose hayricks stood on a great stretch of land now covered by the sky-scrapers of lower Broadway , gladly sold dozens of lots at $zoo and $300 , which  |p566  are now worth $300,000 and $400,000 . Thus one John Samler and his wife Catharine ? who signed the deed with " her mark " ? parted with their East Side farm and ropewalk for $20,000 . Had they held on , their descendants would now have a fortune of at least $8,000,000 . Astor 's transactions were the sensation of the day . Much of the property he bought was marsh and rock , and the sellers signed it away with tongue in cheek . There was , indeed , little less than a stampede to " unload " . Astor 's best friends begged him not to fritter away the fortune so industriously acquired in legitimate trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . Astor purchased nothing that seemed really worth while . Well-rented dwellinghouses and business buildings had no attractions . He was daft on farms . Such paying property as he had he sold . He thus disposed of a Wall Street house for $8,000 . The purchaser , after the deed was signed , chuckled over his bargain . " Mit dis eight tousand tollar , " replied Astor , " I vill puy me eighty lots up der Broadway , near Canal Street . In ten years dey vill be worth $I , 000 each , and dis Vail Street house vill be worth just vat it is now . " So the event proved . And in this one episode we find the secret of the Astor wealth . William Waldorf Astor. in an article published some years ago in his Pall Mall Magatine , almost indecently exults over the fact that few of the great landholders a century ago are landlords to-day . The estates of nearly all have passed into the hands of foreigners . More interesting still are the circumstances under which they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is constantly crossed by embarrassed families , prodigal sons , mortgages , and foreclosure sales . Many of the victims of his foresight were those highest in church and state . He thus acquired for $75,000 one-half of Govenor George Clinton 's splendid Greenwich  |p567  country place . With this , however , Astor was not content . After the Governor 's death he kept persistently at the heirs , lent them money , and acquired additional slices of the family property . Clinton 's most distinguished son-in-law was Edmond Charles Genet ? Citizen Genet , who , after his troubles with Washington , became an American citizen , married Clinton 's daughter , and settled in New York . From Astor he occasionally borrowed money , pledging real estate which the former ultimately acquired . Nearly twothirds of the Clinton farm is now held by Astor 's descendants , and is covered by scores of wholesale business buildings , from which is derived an annual income estimated at about $500,000 . Frequently these farms got into the chancery courts , and Astor was always then on hand . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tract extending on Broadway from Fifty-third to Fifty-seventh Street , westward to the Hudson River . Astor slowly wormed his way into this property . For eight years its history is a miserable tangle of judgments , mortgages , foreclosure sales , and trusteeships . From the whole unsavory affair Astor finally emerges , foreclosing a mortgage and securing at about $23,000 a property now worth $6,000,000 . Thus , in 1797 , one Medcef Eden inherited a princely farm on Broadway , from Forty-second to Forty-sixth Streets extending northwesterly to the Hudson . Medcef appears to have frittered it away . While it is being pledged for loans and attached for debt , Astor acquires a third interest in an outstanding mortgage , forecloses , and obtains for $25,000 a property now worth at least twenty millions . Associated with him is one William Cutting . On the division , poor Cutting is no match for Astor . The latter gets all the Broadway blocks and Cutting is forced , for his share , toward the water-front . Astor , however , is not permitted to enjoy the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York , and appeal to the courts , where the matter drags twenty years . Astor finally buys them off for $9,000 . It is too bad that John Eden , of Yorkshire , England , who surrendered his well-grounded claim at this figure , can not visit this property to-day . He would find the place where his brother gathered his modest crops now ablaze with the electric lights of the city 's great office buildings , theaters , restaurants and hotels . He would see two enormous Astor hotels , valued at $7,000,000 , on the borders of his old Bloomingdale Road , and westward from this some three hundred dwellings , all erected on the Eden farm , now paying tribute to the descendants of his old enemy . Again , the little fur merchant got more than one-third the whole estate of Trinity Church . In Astor 's time , Trinity was afflicted with the prevailing financial malady ? it was land-poor . Originally , it owned nearly all the land on the West Side , reaching from Chambers to Christopher Street . Much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rentals . Other portions it sold to pay current expenses . One of the earliest to profit by this ecclesiastical poverty was John Jacob Astor . Was the church back on its pastor 's salary ? Mr. Astor would kindly advance the amount , taking in payment several useless lots on the church farm . Was money needed for the support of the parish poor , to start a parish school , to assist some orthodox congregation in extremis ? Mr. Astor always had a few hundred or a few thousand dollars for this charitable purpose ? provided he could have a block or so of land in exchange . It so happened that one of the Trinity leases , covering a third of the whole farm , was held by Aaron Burr . Under Burr and his brilliant daughter , Theodosia , Richmond Hill became the most famous place of hospitality in New York . Talleyrand , Jerome Bonaparte , and Louis Philippe were entertained there . Astor , however , was not charmed by its literary and political associations , or its natural beauty . But he did see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it would soon be needed for building lots . Meanwhile , Burr lived recklessly and extravagantly and , even while vice-president of the United States , was threatened with imprisonment for debt . Richmond Hill , too , was heavily mortgaged ? the mortgage payable in July , 1804 . About this time Burr became involved in his quarrel with Hamilton . His letters to Theodosia show that the sale of Richmond Hill was the only possible way of forestalling ruin . So , as his mortgage came due , and just a month before the Hamilton duel , Astor bought the place for $160,000 . Unquestionably this money facilitated Burr 's flight ; perhaps it was used , who knows , in his wild Southwestern scheme ? Burr returned to New York after his miserable wanderings in Europe , but never succeeded in rehabilitating himself . His old law clients shunned him ; his former friends ignored him ; the only faithful ones were his creditors . Among these was Astor , who acquired , piece by piece , all that was left of Richmond Hill . Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York we can trace the wretchedness of Aaron Burr . All Astor purchased was Burr 's leasehold , which had sixty-two years to run . Astor paid Trinity $269 a year . For half a century the land had been worth little more . Almost as soon as Astor obtained possession , however , it became very valuable . Astor , himself was not responsible for this . Trinity Church laid out the present streets , built St. John 's Park just south of Richmond Hill , and in other ways tempted fashion and wealth from lower Broadway and Franklin Square . Soon Astor obtained about $25,000 yearly from this part of the church farm . From this he deducted every year $26g , which he paid as rent to Trinity . As late as 1856 , when the Astor family drew a great income from the Trinity Farm , that church itself had a standing debt and an annual deficit which it met by selling more land . In 1866 the lease expired and Trinity came again into her own . Almost immediately , however , the residential popularity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were almost coincident with cycles of public misfortune . When his adopted country was engaged in the second war with Great Britain , and New York was daily expecting a bombardment ? that was Astor 's harvesting time . He was a large money-lender on real estate security , and , in the war of 1812 , did not hesitate to foreclose . In the panic of 1837 , however , he was especially active . New York has never known such suffering . Philip Hone , exMayor and inimitable annalist , writes in his diary : " Here , in the city of New York , trade is stagnant . Local stocks are lower than ever ; real estate is unsalable at any price ; rents have fallen and are not punctually  |p570  paid , and taxes have increased most ruinously . The pressure is severe enough upon the owners of houses and stores who are out of debt , but if the property is mortgaged , and the seven per cent interest must be regularly paid , God help the owners ! " No one profited so much from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready cash . " Going , going , gone ? to John Jacob Astor ! " was the familiar cry in the auction-room . Astor 's last real estate transaction , put through a month before his death , was a foreclosure on one of the tenants of the Burr estate . In all , he appeared as the complainant in some sixty different proceedings during this trying time , the properties in all cases going to himself at absurd figures . Thus he obtained , at $2,000 , a block in Harlem now worth $i , 000,000 . His foreclosures aroused the greatest indignation . In one instance , after Astor had bid in lots for $5,600 , now worth $600,000 , the court compelled him to pay a bonus . Thus , by fifty years ' incessant labor , buying vacant property , which rapidly became available for building , and reinvesting the income in more farms , Astor became the richest man in America . And what was the nature of the man himself , outside of these sordid details ? He was not popular in his generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no pity for backward tenants . James Parton tells how Astor was tossed in a blanket for exercise in his last days , and between throws anxiously inquired whether certain backsliders had paid up . The picture , however , is not unrelieved by an occasional human touch . Here and there are stray tributes to Astor 's honesty . Philip Hone testifies that he always found him fair and just . His life was made unhappy by a great domestic sorrow . His oldest son and namesake was an imbecile from birth . In his famous will he sets apart a plot in the Clinton farm for " my unfortunate son John , " and provided $Io , 000 a year for his maintenance . Here a large house , surrounded by a high stone-wall , was constructed , and in this , with a few attendants , the solitary idiot lived for many years . an object of superstitious awe to the neighbors . Astor found consolation in his second son , William Backhouse , from his earliest years his heir apparent . William B. Astor seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , person . He established his social position by marrying the daughter of General Armstrong , Madison 's unfortunate Secretary of War , and lived in considerable state . He was hard-fisted , but not so stingy as his father . When the latter died without remembering any of his faithful lifelong servants , William B. pensioned them himself . He was educated at Gottingen , affected the society of literary men , and even took a shy at authorship himself . He early became a partner with his father in the fur business , and dealt largely in real estate . His uncle Henry , the original American Astor , left him a large amount of choice property . He was thus rich in his own right , and had several millions when his father died . In some ways he was even a better judge of real estate . The greatest family possession , the Thompson farm , on which the WaldorfAstoria now stands , was his acquisition . Father and son rigidly attended to business in the same office ? a little one-story building in Prince Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzgreene  |p571  Halleck ? Marco Bozzaris Halleck . Hal ! eck became a clerk for Astor in 1832 , and worked seventeen years . The employment , he himself said , was not " profitable , but permanent . " Astor warned him when he began not to talk to anyone of his wealth . The two men became great friends . Halleck spent months with his patron at his country seat , and became one of the trustees of the Astor Library . The poet frequently rallied the old man on his wealth , " Why , Mr. Astor , " he would say , " if I had $200 a year and was sure of it I would be content . " The great land-owner took him at his word , and in his will , much to the amusement of Bohemian New York , left Halleck an annuity of 8200 . The Astor House is a monument to the affection between father and son . This building was the outcome of a vow made by John Jacob early in life . When a young man , Astor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion . " " Some day I 'll build a better house on this very street , " he said . Years afterward , in fulfilling this pledge , he selected a great preserve of fashion ? the block between Vesey and Barclay Streets . One of the houses he owned himself , the rest he bought , paying about $30,000 each . He struck a tartar in John G. Coster , the last to move ? one of the few men who squeezed Astor in a real estate deal . For two years and more they fenced over the price , Astor finally being compelled to pay Coster $6o,000 , or just twice what the others had received . The Astor House cost about $600,000 . It was commonly described as a Palais Royal . It was , indeed , a noble pile , as much a marvel with Europeans as Americans . A few days after it was finished , old Mr. Astor and his son , William B. , stood admiring it from City Hall Park . " Well , William , what do you think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed his admiration in appropriate terms . " William , it 's yours , " replied the old man . And , indeed , a few days later John Jacob conveyed the property to William Backhouse Astor , the consideration being " one Spanish milled dollar and love and affection . " Bold as was the experiment , the Astor House was a good revenue producer . In 1850 , William B. Astor obtained an annual income of $30,000 from it . To his children , indeed , Astor was always kind . Each of his daughters on her marriage received a liberal , though not extravagant , dot . He himself always lived , not lavishly , but dignifiedly . He had a handsome town house on the west side of Broadway , between Prince and Houston Streets , a country place at Hoboken , another at Hell Gate . In the latter , then far out in the country ? the house stood in the middle of what is now Eightyeighth Street , east of Avenue A ? he spent his last years . Here he frequently entertained Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious , for example , that his Astoria enterprise be written up , and importuned Irving to undertake it , offering handsome compensation . The work was written at Astor 's Hell Gate home . " For upward of a month , " wrote Irving in 1835 , " I have been quartered at Hell Gate with Mr. Astor , and I have not had so quiet and delightful a rest since I have been in America . He has a spacious and well-built house , with a lawn in front of it and a garden in the rear . The lawn sweeps to the water 's edge , and full  |p573  in front of the house is the little strait of Hell Gate , which forms a constantly moving picture . Here the old gentleman keeps a kind of bachelor 's hall . Halleck , the poet , lives with him . The only other member of his family is his grandson , a fine boy of fourteen years of age ( Charles Astor Bristed ) . I can not tell you how sweet and delightful I have found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a " strong-minded man , and one from whose conversation much curious information is to be derived . " In spite of this , other pictures of Astor 's last days are not agreeable . His health was poor , his faculties somewhat impaired . He was affected by that millionaire 's malady ? a disordered stomach ? and in his last days was nourished at a woman 's breast . Philip Hone dined at Hell Gate in 1844 . " Mr. Astor , " he records , " presented a painful spectacle of the insufficiency of wealth to prolong the life of man . " In the letters of Joseph Green Coggswell , Astor 's " companion " and first librarian of the Astor Library , we have a rather pathetic picture of his last years . About 1835 he began to form plans for his one public benefaction ? the Astor Library -- but constantly hesitated . The library was wrenched from him by main strength . Coggswell was at him day and night . " Had I not foreseen , " he writes , in 1838 , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at the old gentleman 's elbow , to push him on , I should have left New York long since . " Astor was so fond of Coggswell that he paid him $1,500 a year to live in his house and talk German with him . To this personal attachment we owe the library . In 1840 Coggswell reports that everything was all settled ; then , a month later , that the " whole form is knocked into pi . " His patron " keeps shrinking from a decision . " Finally , in March , 1842 , Irving offered Coggs= well the post of secretary to the Legation at Madrid . Astor begged him with tears not to leave . Coggswell finally consented to stay on one condition ? that his patron definitely settle the library question . Then again Astor consented . Yet , a month later , Coggswell writes : " Immediately after the first of April I began with him about the building , when he got together architects , masons , contractors , etc. , and just as all seemed to be going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as yet I have not been able to bring him back to the work again . " Astor , in fact , never began the building , but did provide $450,000 for it in his will . He died in March , 1848 , aged eighty-four . Astor had invested about $2,000,000 in New York real estate . At his death its value was $20,000,000 . When William B. Astor died , in 1876 , it had increased to $100,000,000 . By 189o , competent authorities estimated it at more than $250,000,000 . The total Astor holdings now , distributed among several branches of the family , amount to at least $450,000,000 . Here , evidently , we have a most notable instance of the unearned increment . When John Jacob died , the New York Herald , in an editorial article , gravely suggested that his property be divided in two parts , one-half to go to his heirs , the other to the City of New York . For it was not Astor 's energy or genius , said the Herald , which had made him so rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its men of progress and enlightenment , which had converted his goat-farms and swamps into the richest rent-bearing soil . The owner of great railroads or steel corporations must constantly nurse his fortune , must join in the competition for improved methods and the indispensable men . Under these conditions , a great fortune is a great burden , maintained only by constant vigilance . The whole Astor family , however , could sleep for a hundred years , and at the end find that their riches had grown a hundredfold . All the economic and social forces which have made New York the American metropolis have , entirely without their instigation , also made their wealth . John Jacob was a capitalist of the leisurely school . He was in no great hurry to benefit by his land operations . The Astor empire could always wait . It is not quite true that he never sold any land , but , in general , he held tenaciously to what he bought . Hardly was he securely interested in the city 's most strategic points , however , before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , its growth almost invariably tended along the line of Astor 's purchases . Astor himself did nothing to encourage this . The city fathers ran streets through his farms , laid out parks , and otherwise embellished the neighborhoods ? usually , however , against Astor 's will . He was not fond of paying assessments , even when he gained enormously thereby . Nor did he tempt the population to settle upon his lands . In fact , his business policy in every way discouraged it . As his plots became available for building ,  |p574  naturally he had many offers to sell , frequently made by people who would put up ornate buildings that would greatly improve the value of the remaining property . Astor turned them off scornfully . Well , then , would Mr. Astor himself erect the building and rent it on fair terms ? Then again Astor withdrew into his shell . The people became urgent . Here were hundreds of acres ; the city was rapidly growing around them . Why did not Mr. Astor erect dwelling-houses , from which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held back . To every inquiry he gave the same ultimatum : " I will not sell my land . I will not put up buildings on it . One thing , and one thing only , will I do . " That is , he would lease the ground . Any citizen attracted by one of Astor 's lots could obtain the use of it for twenty-one years . He must erect his dwelling at his own expense and , when the ground lease expired , this dwelling became the absolute property of Astor . The tenant , meanwhile , in addition to paying rent on the basis of five or six per cent of the value of the land , paid all taxes , made all repairs , and became responsible for all charges . Thus year after year Astor compelled his fellow-citizens to improve his property , pay his taxes , and a yearly tribute besides . Astor imported the idea , of course , from Europe , which became accustomed to it centuries ago ; but it was never popular in New York . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For years many of his great holdings stood vacant , oases surrounded by the buildings of more progressive men , Not all of it is built upon even now . Great blocks of land , purchased by John Jacob Astor a hundred years ago , still stand unused in what are to-day thriving locations . Property worth millions of dollars is utilized for coal-sheds , blacksmith-shops , and lumber-yards . At first it seemed as though no greater blight could fall upon a section than to have Astor buy near it . Every 1 ; ' vely operator knew that the Astor land would lie neglected , and naturally would not purchase or build within gunshot of it . John Jacob , however , was never worried nor annoyed . He knew that he had selected the inevitable sites of business or residence , and that ultimately the public would he forced to accept his terms . So gradually the larger part of his real estate was leased and improved . As the leases fell in , Astor became the owner of scores of tenements , dwellings , and business buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impeded progress is graphically shown by that section of Broadway between Thirty-fourth and Forty-second Streets , where several blocks are owned by collateral Astor descendants . They are covered by one and two-story buildings , in the heart of a great hotel , theater , and shopping district . The owners will not sell and will not build ; and up to date no business men have seen their way clear to accepting their terms . Astor himself might sleep , but the great city inevitably marched on . While he held back , that he might eat his cake and have it too , the busy brains and sinews of progressive Americans worked day and night making New York great , and , unconsciously , making John Jacob Astor the richest man of his time . When DeWitt Clinton projected the Erie Canal , he became the leading promoter of the Astor fortune . This diverted the great trade of the West to New York , and increased its population by hundreds of thousands . In whatever direction these new citizens turned , they were obliged to seek their dwelling-places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamship lines terminating at New York were equally the builders of the Astor estate . Immigration has doubled and tripled it . From 184o to 1850 came a wretched mass of Germans and Irish , settling mainly on the lower east side . At first the Astors were alarmed . Their p 575 great holdings there were tenanted by the respectability and wealth of New York , which tied before the unsavory influx . The Astor lands thus seemed in danger of depreciation . On the contrary , they grew in value . The little dwellings which had previously sheltered one family , now housed three and four and five . Consequently they yielded a greater revenue . About 1880 began an invasion of Russian and Polish Jews , who gradually forced out the Irish and Germans . More recently the Jews have been displaced in part by Italians . The more wretched the immigrants , the more valuable the land becomes . For with immigration has grown the tenement system . The three-story gabled houses built in John Jacob 's day are replaced by five , six , and seven story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same amount of land that fifty years ago furnished room for five and six . The soil is thus cultivated intensively . William Waldorf Astor makes twenty blades of grass grow where John Jacob planted one . On the East Side to-day is the greatest Jewish community in the world , containing some 700,000 souls . In the Eleventh Ward there are more people to the acre than in the slums of Calcutta and Bombay . For three or four unventilated rooms in an Astor tenement the wretched Pole or Russian pays more than a cozy , threestory dwelling cost in John Jacob 's time . Great public improvements , for which the Astors can claim no credit , and which , indeed , they sometimes opposed , have helped to make them rich . The very city plan , adopted by a commission appointed in 1807 , most unsatisfactory from the standpoint of beauty and convenience , has been highly profitable to them . When Broadway was run through from the City Hall to Fourteenth Street , it bisected several large plots purchased by John Jacob , and gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Bloomingdale Road , now Broadway , was the only great Manhattan thoroughfare retained . Had this , like the other country roads , been cut out , the Astors would be several millions poorer . Its elimination , for example , would have largely destroyed the value of the Eden farm , already described . Again , the great thoroughfares , Fourth , Fifth , and Sixth Avenues , ran directly through great Astor tracts , now used for the most profitable retail trade . The influence of all transit changes has been important . The Elevated Road converted Sixth Avenue into HENDRICK 575 a popular shopping section . The owners of several of the largest department stores ? Altman ; Simpson , Crawford ; Siegel , Cooper ; et al ? were obliged to lease land here from the Astors . In spite of this , William B. Astor fought the enterprise . The Subway makes available for apartment houses large blocks of Astor land now vacant . The several inventors of the elevator and the steel system of construction are the greatest contributors to Astor wealth . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Knickerbocker farms , never dreamed . His imagination could picture thousands of business buildings and dwellings , all tributary to his descendants , but he could not see that some day his little leafy town would cease growing laterally , and suddenly start into the air . One morning the Astors woke up and found that they had acre after acre of land , previously useful for four or five-story structu-es , upon which twenty and twenty-five story office buildings and hotels could be built . The humble inventor of the elevator had thus doubled and tripled their wealth . The old Astor House plot , which previously was worth $2,000,000 , suddenly acquired a valuation of $5,000,000 . Let us see how , in one specific case , the forces upbuilding New York have contributed  |p576  to the Astor wealth . Take the Thompson farm ? a tract extending east and west of Fifth Avenue from Thirty-second up to Thirty-sixth Street . William Backhouse Astor purchased one-half of this in 1826 for $25,000 ; it was then mostly marsh and rock . In 1841 a single lot sold at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was knocked down , " a universal titter went through the room " ? the price was so ludicrously large ! A few weeks ago this very lot sold for $400,000 . The mere cutting of Fifth and Madison Avenues through this estate was worth millions to the Astors . Fashion pressed up from Washington Square until , about 1860 , it reached the Thompson swamp . Where the Waldorf-Astoria now stands , William B. 's two sons , John Jacob III and William , built the two famous Astor houses . Alexander T. Stewart located at Thirty-fourth street , in the splendid palace recently torn down . It is only with the last wave of prosperity , however , and the consequent utilization of Fifth Avenue for business , that its full possibilities have been realized . About three years ago R. H. Macy located just beyond the western border of the Thompson farm . The Rapid Transit Subway skirts its eastern edge . Within a stone 's throw is now building the new $50,000,000 Pennsylvania Railroad terminal . Its tunnel will bisect the old Thompson estate . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of increasing the Astor wealth , but that has been the effect . Thus , at present , there is a stampede among the most expensive retail establishments for a building on Astor land . It is now the recognized headquarters of the " carriage trade . " Banks are settling on Thirty-fourth Street . Tiffany is building a twelve-story store at Fifth Avenue and Thirty-seventh Street ; Gorham Mfg.Co. , at Fifth Avenue and Thirtysixth Street . The latter concern will annually pay William Waldorf Astor $36,000 for the privilege of erecting its own building on fifty feet of land . The greatest change of all , however , is the new Altman store , which will occupy all the block from Fifth to Madison Avenue , Thirty-fourth and Thirty-fifth Streets . When Benjamin Altman built on Sixth Avenue , in 1878 , he found that the Astor family owned precisely the land he needed , and has been paying them handsomely ever since . Almost a year ago he selected the above Fifth Avenue location as suited to his needs . And the larger part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue handing over a considerable percentage of his receipts . Thirty-fourth Street , from Fifth to Sixth Avenue , according to conservative investors , will be a greater shopping street than Twenty-third . Lots on the south side and the north side of Thirtythird Street now average in value about $200,000 . The Astors own forty-two . Thus the drift of population and great public improvements have increased the Astor investment in this district from $25,000 to about $35,000,000 . If the present rate of increase goes on twenty years more , this $35,000,000 will swell to $100,000,000 . How values grow ? as well as the profits derivable from an Astor connection ? is shown in an episode in the life of George Boldt , lessee of the Waldorf-Astoria . Mr. Boldt was really a poor man when he was engaged by William Waldorf Astor , in 1893 , to manage the new hotel . In 1900 , however , after six years , he had accumulated enough to buy the southeast corner of Thirty-seventh Street and Fifth Avenue for $1,200,000 . A year ago he sold the plot for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest speculative profit ever made on one parcel of New York real estate . That was merely a crumb that dropped from the Astor table . Indeed , the Astor properties now increase as never before . Land values , in the last five years , have jumped fifty and one hundred per cent . The forces already described have been especially marked since 1900 . The city 's population grows at the rate of 100,000 a year . In many sections New York has been largely reconstructed ; new headquarters of retail trade and business have developed ; public improvements initiated since then ? tunnels , bridges , subways , railroad terminals ? aggregate in cost not far from $300,000,000 . There has been a general movement of corporations toward New York ; practically all the newly organized combinations , for example , have located there . When John Jacob died , in 1890 , his estate , inherited by William Waldorf , was estimated at $150,000,000 . If it were worth that then , it is worth $300,000,000 now . The estate of William Astor , who died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generally placed at about $65,000,000 . If that were an accurate figure , it must now aggregate at least $100,000,000 . The combined Astor fortune thus increases with accelerated momentum . In fifteen or twenty years , at  |p577  the present rate of progress , it will have reached the billion mark . And then it will go on even faster , until the ordinary mind is appalled at the portentous figures . We have seen that the $2,000,000 invested by John Jacob has multiplied at least two hundred times in one hundred years . If the same rate be maintained for another century , the Astor fortune will attain the unimaginable total of eighty billions . We stand aghast at such a possibility ; but not more so than would have John Jacob 's contemporaries had they foreseen the present reality . In 183o John Jacob Astor was the only man in New York who was worth a million dollars . The Astors of to-day are preparing for this stupendous future . Their great incomes , as already said , are not spent in charity or general benevolence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do not appeal to them . They are wedded to the soil . The spirit of old John Jacob still inspires his descendants . William Waldorf and John Jacob have profited enormously from the foresight of their great-grandfather , and likewise intend that future generations of Astors shall profit from theirs . We have seen how John Jacob sold his Wall Street house and reinvested the money in outlying sections . William Waldorf and John Jacob do the same . In the last ten years they have sold whole blocks of East Side income-producing land . This was all leased to tenants who had erected tenements , their sole source of income , and who naturally created a disturbance when their holdings were about to be turned over to outsiders . The Astors have adopted the fixed policy , now , in selling their East Side lots , to offer them first , at reasonable prices , to those who own the buildings . With the money thus obtained , William Waldorf and John Jacob have gone far up into the Bronx , where the land is partly wood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the Thompson farm , when William B. Astor bought it , these great tracts are all but worthless ; but sometime , perhaps ten , perhaps twenty , fifty or a hundred years hence , they will be used for residences , office buildings , and hotels . The Astors are in no hurry . They will be content to wait until the enterprise of others has made these Bronx farms profitable ; then they will let them out on the old leasehold plan . That they have selected wisely , is already evident . Only the other day the city authorities solemnly voted to extend the Rapid HENDRICK 577 Transit Subway through the heart of the Astor properties in the Bronx ! The Astor policy of inaction , however , is most expensive to themselves . This is strikingly shown by the difference in the fortunes of William Waldorf and John Jacob . The former , as already noted , owns at least three times as much property as his cousin . Their respective fathers , however , started even . In 1876 William Backhouse Astor 's $100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob III , the father of William Waldorf , was the best of the Astors . He enlisted in the Civil War and joined General McClellan 's staff . He was something of a scholar , giving up much time to the Astor Library . With his wife , a woman of exceptionally beautiful character , he was unobtrusively charitable . He worked hard ; could invariably be found at certain hours at his office , and invested his income with good judgment . Above all , he somewhat relaxed the prevailing Astor conservatism ; made more liberal leases , encouraged the improvement of his properties , even put up a few important buildings himself . William , on the other hand , lived in the penumbra of his brother 's popularity ; spent little time in New York ; cared more for his horses and yachts than for business or " society " ; and left the management of his property to agents . It was a great neglected estate . The income , while absolutely very large , bore little relation to the capital value . In a lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Waldorf , in spite of his absurdities , is a man of brains and character , and his property , according to the opinion of the best observers , is far more capably managed than his cousin 's , and grows in value much faster . The William Waldorf office seldom errs , runs like clockwork , and is noted for its fair dealings . Perhaps the scheme of organization is somewhat responsible for this . William Waldorf owns absolutely in fee simple all his properties . John Jacob , however , owns outright only a small part . He simply has the income ; his estate is managed by three trustees , of whom he himself is one . William Astor recognized William Waldorf 's ability , and in his original will also made him a trustee . After the two cousins quarreled , however , this nomination was withdrawn . Though now upon bad terms personally , William Waldorf and John Jacob frequently have to work together in business . Each owns , for example , half the Waldorf-Astoria , managed as one hotel ,  |p578  and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatters William Waldorf by imitation . The latter can hardly make a move not obediently followed by his cousin . He builds the Waldorf , and demonstrates its success ; John Jacob follows with the Astoria . He goes up to Longacre Square and builds the Hotel Astor ; John Jacob takes the hint and puts up the Knickerbocker . The William Waldorf office is much more businesslike than John Jacob 's . His great estate is managed by a force of seven clerks , while John Jacob , who has only one-third the property , struggles along with twenty . William Waldorf now spends a certain part of his income in new buildings . He has sensibly recognized that conditions have changed ; that the great cost of modern buildings is a reason why they can not be erected in great numbers on leased land . Old Jacob would stand aghast at the millions now put by William Waldorf and , in fewer instances , by John Jacob , into great hotels , commercial buildings , and apartment houses . In the main , however , all the Astors adhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in persuading many investors to put up great office buildings and stores on their properties . Probably the Astors derive less , proportionately , from their properties than other holders . Not infrequently more wide-awake people profit at their expense . One lively real estate operator had advance information , a few years ago , that Siegel &; Cooper were to build a Now , of my threescore years and ten , Twenty will not come again , And take from seventy springs a score , It only leaves me fifty more . great store on Sixth Avenue , just north of an Astor block . So he went up to the Astor estate and blandly leased the latter property at the prevailing valuation . As soon as the Siegel-Cooper store was up , he easily sublet at a greatly increased rental . The disadvantage of their leasehold system is that leased property , by increasing suddenly in value , may enormously profit the holders . The Astors were badly caught by the great property increase dating from 1899 . They had let out hundreds of lots on the old valuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their tenants , by subletting , have profited greatly . The trick turned against Trinity Church by old John Jacob has been revived to plague his descendants . However , the Astors will not starve . Their fortune rests upon an absolutely secure basis . There is no accident , except confiscation , which can make them poor . The discovery of some new illuminant might make useless the present source of the Rockefeller wealth . The collapse of the steel industry would endanger the Carnegie fortune . A successful airship might depreciate enormously the riches founded upon railroads . But whatever industrial revolutions there may be , the land itself will be perennially useful . It is one of the necessities of life , like light and air and food . Thus did John Jacob Astor build better than the really great creators of wealth . He took out a first mortgage on Fate itself . @#
