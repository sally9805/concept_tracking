I threw another . line . which was caught by three of the survivors , wile clung to it while the crew and I hauled them in .

PLEASURESEEKERS DROWNED , Eight Persons Lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the eleven persons lost in the capsizing of the Roxana off Quarantine yesterday afternoon , there were eight other drowning accidents and many narrow escapes in and about the city yesterday as a result of the usual Sunday outings . Bathing , boating , and fishing were responsible for the loss of the eight lives . Several fishing parties came to grief . One of the most sensational of these accidents occurred in full view of the Summer colony at Sea Gate , and resulted in the beaching and probable destruction of a police launch and a large fishing sloop which went to the rescue of two men in an overturned boat . Most of the bathing fatalities were caused by carelessness or unfamiliarity with the water . One of the earliest drownings of the day was that of Giant ) Rizzo , an Italian laborer , in the Harlem River , near ' the University Heights Bridge . He lived at 2,474 Arthur Avenue , the Bronx . The young man was swimming in the river with a friend , Wallace Keating , of 2,712 Marion Avenue . Rizzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water only a short time when he was swept out into the current . He shouted to Keating for aid , but before the latter , who is a good swimmer , could get to him , the young Italian sank . He did  --  not come to the surface again , and after swimming about for a time Keating went ashore . and reported the matter to Policeman Gibbon of the Eighbridge Station . A short time later William Jaeger of 123 Seventh Street was pulled out of the North Riper near 190th Street , and died a few hours later in the Washington Heights Hospital . The boy and a companion , whose name was not learned , undressed in the woods on Ate tip of Fort Washington Point , and were on their way down the bank to some shallow water when Jaeger slipped on a rock and fell into the river . The water here was over the boy 's head . Neither he nor his companion could swim . The cries of the two finally attracted the attention of William Burns , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , and Policeman Queron of the Madison Street Station , who was swimming near by with William Cornu , a real estate dealer , who lives in West 164th Street . They jumped into a boat and hastened to the rescue of the boy . He had succeeded some way in keeping himself afloat , but by the time they reached him he had gone down several times . They pulled him into the boat unconscious and quickly rowed to the shore . Stephen Ernest , 38 years old , of 203 Willoughby Avenue , Brooklyn , was drowned aff West Twenty-second Street on the Gravesend Bay side of Coney Island early in the afternoon . There is no bathing beach there as the bottom is very treacherous and uneven . There are always several drownings at this point every Summer , people going there who can not swim because there is no toll . Ernest was accompanied by his wife , Margaret . who with several other persons saw him drown . He undressed on the bank , and jumped into the water in his underclothing . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few feet from shore , he waded out further , and suddenly disappeared . Mrs. Ernest ran up and down the bank , wringing her hands and shouting for help , but no one went to her husband 's assistance , and after waiting around for a time sherreported the drowntu the Coney Island police . A squad of men were sent in boats to drag for the body , but up to a late hour it had not been . recovered . Charles Hendrickson of 17 Sumpter Street , Brooklyn . and Walter Johnson of 09 McDougall Street Brooklyn , were fishing from a rowboat a few rods off the foot of Norton Place , Sea Gate , in the afternoon . when a sudden wave upset them . The accident was seen by many on shore and in the various craft in the vicinity , and in a moment a number of boats headed in their direction Capt . Klieberg of the Atlantic Yacht Club put out in a motor boat , and quickly had Johnson , who - was the better swimmer of the two men , aboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yacht R. Esterbrook , Jr. , Capt . Phillips , returning from the fishing banks with a party of eighteen , had shifted its course with the first cries of the men , and veered with such haste that before its sails could be reefed it ran ashore and stuck fast . The party clambered off to the bank through several feet of mud and water . Launch 5 of the Police Department attached to the Coney Island Station , which was in the vicinity , went to the rescue of the two men and fared a similar fate . Hendrickson 's body was finally recovered and removed to the Coney Island Morgue . Late in the afternoon the sea increased before the two boats could be hauled off , and it was believed that they would go to pieces . The body of Edward Wall of East Orange , N. J. , was found floating in the Morris Canal near Wickliff and Colden Streets . Newark , early yesterday . His clothing was later ' discovered on the bank , and in the day a friend reported to the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to take a swim in the canal .
