As the Panama case stands to-day , nobody is satisfied . The canal itself is indefinitely halted . If a new face is not soon put upon the project , the Administration will have to confront endless delays as well as a long and bitterly partisan struggle , with alienated supporters . Colombia , of course , is vastly discontented with the situation Her latest proposals show that she is more than ready to accept any reasonable and honorable cdmpromise . She wants the canal . So do the people of Panama . So do we . Yet the whole thing seems deadlocked . Is there no way out at once agreeable to all concerned , and in harmony with law and good morals ? We believe there is . A promising point of departure may be found in the pending treaty with Panama . The second clause of Article xxiv. reads : " If the Republic of Panama shall hereafter enter as a constituent into any other Government , or into any union or confederation of States , so as to merge her sovereignty or independence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this convention shall not be in any respect lessened or impaired " On that pivot , we think , a fresh negotiation could be made to turn . The canal could be secured and even hastened . Colombia 's honor could be salved . The good name of the United States could be left beyond reproach . What would be necessary ? Simply that the people of Panama , with their full consent , should be merged again in the sovereignty of Colombia ; and ' that the latter , of her own motion , should validate all the acts of Panama during her brief existence as an independent republic , including the ratification of the canal treaty . Then the net result would be a treaty before the United States Senate to which there would be no legal or moral objection , and of which the speedy acceptance would start the dredges on the Isthmus more quickly than persistence along present lines possibly could . That is what all parties profess to want . Yet front it they are all debarred , as matters are . Why should there not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could surely find a way . There are some signs that a new move is possible or even ' contemplated . Gen. Reyes would not have stayed in Washington so long , we imagine , nor have striven So successfully to induce the Colombians to be patient and keep quiet , if he were merely preparing a formal protest or planning to put in a pitiful ' bill for damages . Larger aims must have been in ' his mind ; and ' what they are the Evening Post 's Washington correspondent has hinted in his report of the new Colombian proposals . These are , in effect , not only to let bygones be bygones , but to make new and highly ad vantageous offers which would result in our getting the canal more speedily and more honorably than by the side wind of a dubious Panama republic . All that Colombia asks is a restoration of her territorial integrity . That this could be accomplished with the consent of the people of Panama , ' provided that they saw their greatly desired canal furthered thereby , there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have already confessed that they are afraid of ' their own army ; they ' betray no ' symptom of real nationality . - By themselves , they - would give endless trouble , and would soon clamor for annexation . Every sensible American would prefer to see Colombia take them again . President Roosevelt has more than once shown that he is not above acting on a second thought . He can not be satisfied with the present posture of the affair . We do not mean politically  --  the effect of the whole thing on his renomination and election we put one side ; but no man of his breeding and temper can be happy in the knowledge that an ill-considered step of his has affronted the best sentiment of his party . A college man himself , it can not be a matter of indifference to him that academic judgment is so strongly against his Panama policy . He turned his back on Addicks ' when ' lie found what a shock his dallying with that corruptionist had given to his - warmest admirers ; and ' why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond to a moral appeal ? Besides , his favorite doctrine of efficiency and promptitude could be best exemplified in such a rearrangement as has been ' suggested . We heartily ' desire an Isthmian canal . We favored the Panama route at a time when nearly the ' whole press was caught in the snare of Nicaragua . It was , accordingly , a great disappointment to us that improper and illegal methods employed to expedite the canal compelled us to oppose the Administration 's plan . If the President , hOwever , will now adopt measures to do away with the legal and moral difficulties which ' we have felt so deeply , it ds needless to ' say that we should hail so auspicious an event . MR SCHURZ ON THE NEGRO PROB --  LEM McClure 's Magazine for January contains a paper of great historical value , and also of deep present-day significance , from the pen of Carl Schurz . It begins by recalling and explaining the report on conditions in the Southern States which Mr. Schurz submitted to President Johnson in 1865 . This had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide inquiries with the utmost impartiality and patience and open-mindedness , Mr. Schurz was compelled to come to ' the conclusion that there was grave ' danger of practical re enslavement of the negroes . His able report on the subject had much to do at the time with shaping Northern sentiment and , later , leading to legislation by Congress . We have at hand , and are permitted to print , an unpublished letter written by the late John M. Forbes of Boston , which is strong contemporary testimony on this point : " Itosym , Feb. 12 , 1866 . " E L GODKIN , Esq . " My DEAR . SIR " The Hatton has again begun to reach me , as did a note from you some days since about the Jamaica warning " Thanks to the President 's policy , which has encouraged the enemy to show the cloven foot , we need no old precedent to train us The South are already bettering the example set them by the planters , and they are doubtless ready any day to repeat the atrocities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to missing some numbers , I do not know how far you have used Carl Schurz 's report . If not already done , would not a review of it with liberal extracts be useful , in keeping before the public mind the dangers of re-enslavement under the various forms which the slave drivers are so very ingenious in inventing ' , If they can contrive any way by which each poor white can own , or control for insufficient wages , the labor of one or two negroes , I really do n't see but the original paradise sof the Southerners may be realized without reopening the African slave trade ; and if so , the condition of the negro will be ten times worse than if owned in a more patriarchal fashion by richer masters , who had less temptation to grind him than the poor whites would have . " Very truly yours , " J. M. FonsEs . " When on his tour of inspection in 1865 , Mr. Schurz encountered again and again that mixture of condescension and impatience with which we are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northerner ; therefore ' he could not possibly understand . They smiled at him in a pitying way when he maintained that free negroes would work . " The negro can never be got to work except under physical compulsion . " That was the fundamental truth which Southerners laid clown at the close of the war . They knew . They had lived with the negro for generations Northerners might think they knew negro nature , but they were falling into a huge mistake . It was of no use to protest against the new statutes and cunning ' devices - which aimed at making the negro a slave again , for the South had a vast amount of work to be done , and " physical compulsion " was the only way to make the negroes do it . How forty years of great crops with free labor have given the lie to that confident assumption , The result ought to diminish a little that patronizing certainty of knowing it all with which Southerners to-day forbid us of the North to discuss matters of which we must be , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing which Mr. Schurz 's report , and his comments on it , make perfectly clear is that Congress felt itself absolute-ly compelled to grant the suffrage to the negro . This was no rash measure of vengeance ; nothing in the nature of a penalty . It was a necessity  --  disagreeable , but a necessity . In no other way could a weapon of self-defence be placed in the hands of the ex-slaves . Freed by the nation , they were in peril of being made serfs again by the several States . Hence the duty , plain and urgent , as it seemed at the time , of pressing on and giving the freedman the freeman 's buckler against oppression  --  the right to vote . In bringing out as he does the facts and motives operative at the time , Mr. Schurz goes far towards disposing of current misconceptions and unfounded oharges . His analysis of existing conditions and tendencies in the South is one to which the South itself and the entire nation should give heed Mr. Schurz clearly perceives a dangerous drift Pro-slavery ideas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's political rights is unconcealed . By craftily devised and inequitable laws the suffrage is taken from him With all this go naturally the desire and purpose to keep him forever " alongside the mule " Negro education is looked upon with increasing hostility Every door of hope opening into the professions is slammed in the face of black men merely because they are black . The South works itself up into hysterics over the President 's spontaneous recognition of manhood under a black - skin . While philanthropists and teachers are laboring to raise the negro to the full level of citizenship , an open and determined effort is making at the South to thrust him hack into serfdom As Mr. Schurz says , the issue is upon the country , for one tendency or the other must prevail . It is his view of the great urgency of the juncture Which leads him to address a moving appeal to the South 's best He implores its leading men to bestir themselves to prevent the lamentable injustice which is threatened and partly executed By withstanding the mob , by upholding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " social equality " , by contending for negro education of the broadest sort ; by every step upward which the black men may take ; by insisting upon the equality of all men before the law , they can , Mr. Schurz argues forcibly , do much to save the South and the country from the disgrace and calamity of a new slavery . To this plea every humane patriot will add his voice We , for our part , have never failed to second such appeals to the better South , and shall note every response with delight . But , indirectly , Mr Schurz 's paper is also a challenge to the mind and conscience of the North . Unless they , too , respond , the cause of the negrowhich to-day is the cause of simple justice  --  will languish and die , TAPAN AND RUSSIA . The present extreme tension in the Ear East is directly traceable to the brilliant Japanese successes of 1894-5 . When the fleet of China had been destroyed and her troops swept irresistibly out of the Mantchurian seaboard , the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstition and a mystery had measurably protected China Now it appeared as easy to win an empire in the north as it had been for France to take Tonkin by default in the south . But the Japanese , having made this useful demonstration , were not allowed to profit by it . Formosa was the only actual conquest left to them by the Concert of Europe , though the recognition of the independence of Korea left the Japanese free to establish there a sphere of influence if they could . Japan was not only checked , but humiliated . She saw the period of leaseholds begin . Russia established herself in Port Arthur , to capture which Japan had spent blood and treasure ; England claimed the " second - rate watering place , " Wei-hai-wei ; across the gulf in Shantung , German trading stations became virtually colonies . Japan had shown the way to the partition of China , but had not been allowed ? to benefit by her dear-bought discovery . She still suffers under that war debt and under the expense of administering Formosa . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throne to the people , and makes the entire nation most sensitive to the suspicion of new aggression . And such aggression has not been lacking . At several points the Russians have set up trading posts beyond the Yalu , secret overtures have been made to win the court at Seul , while , latterly , Russia has asserted an equal influence with Japan in Korea On that issue the Japanese seem bound to fight , and they would the more hopefully enter upon a war for their preponderance in Korea since the relief expedition of July , 1900 , left the comparison between the Japanese and Russian contingents decidedly in favor of the Japanese . The hope of a peaceful solution , then , lies chiefly in some whittling down of the Russian demands . Japan might be willing to give Russia full recognition in Mantchuria . That territory is Russian beyond dispute ; but she will oppose Russian pretensions in Korea to the last cartridge and the last ditch . The certainty that Great Britain has made representations favorable to Japan at St. Petersburg , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most benevolent kind , show that a war in the Far East might have very serious European complications . But this is , of course , a reason for the war not coming off It ought to be , and perhaps it will be , as possible for the Powers of Europe to keep Russia out of Korea as it was in 1895 to force Japan back from Mantchuria . Something , then , is to be hoped from the friendly offices of the European Powers and more , perhaps , from the fact that Russia would now fight at a relative disadvantage . Time is making her hold on Mantchuria secure . Colonization is reinforcing military occupation . Troops are being crowded into the Chinese leaseholds . In fine , Russia will for many years improve her military position in the Far East , whereas the fighting force of Japan is probably very near its maximum to-day . So if it were merely a matter of meeting Russia , Japan would be forced to fight now or to surrender abjectly all her continental ambitions whenever the sacrifice should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis it will be in view of remote eventualities , such as the internal disintegration of the Russian Empire , or some possible rehabilitation of China . These are rather vaticinations , perhaps , than serious motives for diplomacy ; but it is obvious that if Japan could maintain a foothold in Korea , she might become the residuary legatee of all Mongolian possessions of a crumbling Russia , while the development of military strength in China might force Russia to be content with things as they are . Here is a very interesting subject of speculation . It may not be generally known that ever since the Chinese war a Japanese propaganda has been conducted in Northern China  --  in part military , in. part commercial . There is to-day a nucleus of about three brigades of Chinese soldiers trained by Japanese officers , which would be by no means a negligible quantity in case of war , for it is a real army , not a mandarin 's escort cr a Boxer horde . The military potentiality of China is , Indeed , far greater than that of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of hastening the actuality than are generally realized . But we regard it as unlikely that these incommensurable considerations will weigh heavily in the present balance . The alternative ris plain : Russia must choose between fighting now , or withdrawing , for the moment , at least , all claims to Korea . Japan seems anxious to avoid war , understanding perfectly that Russia is virtually invulnerable ; but if she accepts terms of any kind to-day it must he understood as meaning that she has satisfactory assurance of future support from China and probably from Great Britain . The conflict itself seems inevitable . The Russian advance is an instinctive racial movement which no Emperor and no bureaucracy can arrest . It may be the great misfortune of Japan to oppose this advance single-handed . But it is also an opportunity for heroism . Nobody knows better than the enlightened statesmen at Tokio that to defend Korea against Russia is to provide , at best , a Marathon in the interest of all the rivals of the Slay . ' Most people have not sufficiently concidered what war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a matter of the gravest economic importance . The contingencies would be such that almost every civilized nation would realize that it had much at stake . Upon international finance , for example , the effect would be watched with anxiety by the industrial inter-ests of two hemispheres . The smallest manufacturing town in the United States might be greatly affected by changing monetary conditions . The possible dislocation of markets for commodities would be another serious question . Would the rise in the price of wheat offset the decline in cotton ? While the hostilities lasted , would the exports of our cotton mill products , like those of Lancashire , continue to decrease ? And there might be cause for concern regarding Our large oil exports to the East , Then there is the question of our new treaty with China , whose enforcement might be made much more difficult by war . But above and beyond all questions affecting the immediate future is that of the permanent destiny of China . Certainly , a partition of the Empire would be likely to have lasting economic cbnsequences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergo radical transformation . On the other hand , if China should emerge from the war with a determination to modernize herself , the effect would be equally striking . SOME COLLEGE SALARIES . College salaries are discussed by a writer in ' the December issue of the Harvard Graduates ' Magazine . He reviews the treasurer 's statement ? of 1856-57 , when the president received $2,500 . Some of the professors , among them Benjamin Peirce , C. C. Felton , Joseph Lovering , Francis James Child , H. W. Torrey , Francis Bowen , and G. M. Lane , had $2,200 ; James Russell Lowell , Smith professor of the French and Spanish languages and literatures , and professor of belles-lettres , $1,200 ; and Charles William Eliot , tutor in mathematics , $645 . Passing from the past to the present , the writer roundly asserts that salaries to-day are relatively smaller ; for " the best paid professors receive only $5,000 a year at the culmination of their career , while some of them have $3,500 , and the majority range from $4,000 to $4,500 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Purchasing power to the $2,200 which the leading professors of 1856 found all too little . " The question is then raised whether , in a time of rapid increase of wealth , it is not ominous that the professor should " be singled out to receive no proportionate share in the general gain " ; whether the fact that he is " presumably doing what he prefers " should entail on him such a pecuniary sacrifice ; whether in dream of Harvard professors a salary of $25,000 , " but he considerable increase in pay necessary unless the first-rate men in professors ' chairs are to be replaced by " second-rate men of routine , who are sometimes cheap at any price . " The cry which goes up from Harvard will be echoed from every college in the United States . Our professors are as a class underpaid . In some of the institutions of the South and West the maximum of $1,200 to $1,500 is so ridiculously small that often second or third-rate men will not accept it . The only salvation of these colleges is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their inertia to hold them . In New England , however , the conditions are not yet actually painful . Yale pays as high as $3,750 , Brown $3,000 , and Dartmouth , Williams , and Amherst , situated in. country towns , range somewhat lower . As Brown is in a city of 175,000 , where rents are fairly high , the pay there is perhaps relatively less than in the three country colleges . But in all these places reasonably frugal families manage to lead a tolerable existence It is true that successful doctors , lawyers , and engineers in Boston , Providence , and New Haven are earning more than twice as much as the professors ; but it is not true , therefore , that professors ' salaries should , as some maintain , be forthwith doubled . An addition of $1,000 to $1,500 in every college from Harvard down would provide a suitable livelihood , and would probably attract the ablest men . For the best college professor is he who is willing to renounce money prizes for the larger returns of his calling if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has compensations which the income of a railway president can not buy . He is removed from the ordinary risks of business and the worry that attends them ; he has the long vacation , during which he can follow his writing or his researches , unvexed by the daily routine of classes ; or he can often quicken his mind by travel . These obvious and immediate advantages are the reward of no other profession , unless it be that of independent author or scientist , whose pay surely does not average much higher than that of the college teacher . Besides , if he be in love with his work , he gets out of it a pleasure that-makes anything above living expenses a secondary . consideration . - There are two other rewards that are moral rather than intellectual . In our leading colleges the teachers are not the slaves of sect or party . They can think what they please , and , within the bounds of sanity , say what they think . If they have outgrown their early creeds in politics or religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to declare that the obvious meaning of their utterances is not the real meaning ; or to persuade themselves that they believe what they know in their hearts is a lie . These privileges , even to men whose moral senses are not keen , are worth much money . And , as we all live for the next generation , professors can rear their children in the choic -- est society in America , where there is a wholesome atmosphere of simplicity of life , reverence for the lessons of the past , and intellectual honesty . This is no mean bequest to posterity , There may be some risk of isolation and dry scholasticism , but there is less danger of surrender in la guerre iminorte/le centre le Want et le provincial than in the outside struggle against those who declare  --  like the Irish priestthat they are well enough without learning ; that without it the fish are caught and the potatoes grow , and men can do all that man wants  --  eat , drink , and sleep .

Here is a new method for teaching the principles of arbitration A young French professor has just discovered it Instead of writing articles or delivering speeches on the absurdities and the horrors of war , expatiating on commonplaces which meet with little or no contradiction among sane adults , he has written a text-book of general history for children , ' Histoire de la France et de l'Europe , ' with the sub-title , ' The Teaching of Peace through History . ' This professor is not unknown to those who have followed recent events in France His name is Gustave Hervd He hails from Brittany , intellectually the most backward province of France Two years ago he was teaching history in the lycee at Sens , near Paris . He was a successful teacher , beloved by his pupils and favorably looked upon by his chiefs Suddenly his name became associated in the public prints with the most unpopular political doctrine  --  internationalism . H. Hervd has a strong dislike for all the follies of a boisterous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day , apropos of the celebration by a local regiment of the anniversary of the battle of Wagram , he wrote in a little Socialist paper of Sens an article that aroused violent indignation throughout France . In order to strike the imagination of the peasants of Champagne , he recited some of the horrors of that most barbarous and useless slaughter at Wagram , as related in the memoirs of Marbot , and concluded by saying that " a fitting commemoration for such a deed could be celebrated only by planting the Rag of the regiment in a heap of manure in front of the barracks . " This expression , M. Herve - willingly admitted , was not in the best of taste . It was carefully picked out of the article , published in all the papers , and its author branded as a criminal . Two courts in succession tried M Herve : the Court of Assizes of Yonne acquitted him , but the Superior Council of Public Instruction , by a vote of 38 to 13 , dismissed him temporarily from the service of the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue his propaganda The other day he was prosecuted again for attacking the army , and again acquitted . And now here is his text-book . It is not written in the style of the article on the battle of Wagram . There is throughout the book , in spite of the strong anti-Catholic , anti-militarist , and even . Socialistic spirit , a serious attempt at impartiality The main object of the author has been , through his presentation of facts , to teach children not merely to detest all wars of conquest , whoever may wage them , but to understand the real soh-dainty that binds together men of all races and all nationalities Moreover , he has given preference to facts that are most interesting to a twentieth-century reader above the useless chronicle of obscure and tedious events The contemporary period claims almost half the book , while only 80 pages out of nearly 500 are given to the Middle Ages . All the wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , of Francis I , Henry IV. , Louis XIII , and Louis XIV. , are summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings is rather severe . " Except Henry IV. , who was an intelligent and well-meaning sovereign , they were very ordinary men either intellectually or morally , morally , some of them were much below the average . " Their wars , which have been studied in minute detail by generations of schoolboys , are ascribed merely to a desire for aggrandizement and for military glory , a legacy of barbarous ages when " brute force was universally admired . " The author dwells on the most cruel and odious sides of these wars , pointing out their disastrous effects on the people , who had to pay the expense whether victorious or defeated , and who suffered meanwhile by the devastation of their fields . But they had still - worse results . After - enumerating all the evils that followed Louis XIV . ' s passion for conquest , including several invasions of the country by foreign armies , he concludes : " Our account of these wars would be incomplete if we did not recall that they kept up in our country and in neighboring countries a hatred of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus caused many other wars even after the passing away of the old regime . " The Napoleonic wars were a good field for an historian desiring to teach the necessity of peace . M Herve has made the best of his opportunity . A short chapter of thirteen pages covers the whole ground Never in any text-book did the Napoleonic legend receive a harder blow . A reproduc tion of Verestchagm 's famous painting  --  a heap of skulls over which fly vultures , with the inscription " Vive l'Etopereur " ? opens the chapter . When it comes to the recital of these wars , no time is wasted in- admiring the tactics of the generals or the bravery of the soldiers . The author dwells mainly on the many scenes of savagery which dishonored those campaigns . At Genoa , in 1800 , Austrian prisoners were left without food and had to eat the leather of their shoes and belts . During the war of 1805 in Austria some of the wounded soldiers sought refuge in a little town that caught fire . Marbot tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burning buildings , they had to crawl out of the houses , and could lie seen lying half-burnt in the streets , some of them still breathing . Such scenes detract somewhat from the romance of war , and M. Herve does not fail to make use of them At the same time the resistance to the rule of Napoleon on the part of the nations of Europe , the patriotic upheavals , receive from NI Have the same praise as the patriotism of the French volunteers of 1792 Last year M. Urbain Gohier , another pamphleteer of the anti-militarist school , travelling through the United States , was surprised at the many signs of what appeared to he Napoleon 's popularity in this country ; and in his interesting book , Le Peuple du XXme Si  --  cle , ' he expresses his amazement that so many Americans should worship a man who , besides " being the greatest bandit in history , " " had not even the merit of being an athlete . " M Herve would doubtless attribute this to a bad choice of text-books in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any doubt as to the opinion the reader ought to have of the ' , Corsican adventurer . " ' While relating without hesitation the reasons why so many Frenchmen still admire Napoleon , both as the soldier of the Revolution and the great general who added glory to the French name , he sums up in a few lines the reasons of those who curse " his bloody and deadly work " : " Four million men killed on the battlefield , national hatreds that were to perpetuate themselves and bring about fresh hostilities ; the Declaration of the Rights of man hated , and justly hated , by all humanity . " Most eloquent of all is the chapter in which the author figures up the tremendous losses to the industry and commerce of European nations caused by the regime of armed peace ; England paying 50 per cent of her whole budget , France 59 per cent. , Italy 64 per cent. , and Spain 70 per cent . to those unproductive expenses . To this he adds four million young men taken away from peaceful pursuits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idleness of the barracks , where they contract habits of drunkenness and debauchery that spoil the good qualities they bring from their shops and farms . These evils , which fall mainly upon the poor people , will in time bring about a new era , when arbitration will settle the disputes of nations as it has come to settle the disputes of individuals . M. Herve enumerates for his young readers all the signs that point to this new order of things . The motto is no longer " Si vis pacem , para bellum , " but , " If you want peace , prepare for peace . " M. Herve has found a good way to prepare for peace .
