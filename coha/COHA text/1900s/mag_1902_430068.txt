 | At this time when there are unmistakable signs of an awakening in the Southern States , it is well for us to seek for all the light possible from all sources . Especially profitable should it be to study those periods of history when people have passed through similar stages of awakening , those epochs of expansion when forgetting the things that are behind , in so far as they hinder their progress , men have pressed forward to the mark of their high calling . I have thought it might prove profitable to the readers of the QUARTERLY to study with some detail the period of awakening in the New England States ? the years from 1830 to 1875 , when those States , and especially Massachusetts , reached what is perhaps their highest point in wealth , in culture , in literature , and in moral and spiritual life . . Certainly Massachusetts will never again hold the same pre-eminent position as compared with other sections of the country as in those years , for even the literary center of the country is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more the history of that section during those years I believe we shall feel that there is much for us to learn , many characteristics that we would do well to imitate , some mistakes that we should avoid . If we adopt the results of New England 's experience in the manufacture of cotton goods , why should we be provincial enough to exclude its ideas ? We have thought of New England too often from the standpoint of its weakest and most objectionable characteristics , its beginnings instead of its flowering time . I would call your attention to the New England of Phillips Brooks rather than that of Jonathan Edwards , to the New England of Lowell rather than that of Cotton Mather , to Daniel Webster rather than Judge Samuel Sewall , asypical public men . I would have you judge the people of that section by the Harvard of President Eliot rather than by the Harvard of the earlier days . In a word let us have in mind instead of the bleak Plymouth Rock in the winter of 1620 , Copley Square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and beautiful Public Library with nearly a million  | volumes ; the Museum of Fine Arts , containing the productions not only of famous Boston artists , but those of foreign countries as well ; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , the leading scientific school of the East ; and best known of all , Trinity Church , the beautiful house of God , built by Richardson , decorated by LaFarge , consecrated and beloved by Phillips Brooks . Copley Square , typifying as it does the highest achievements in industry , education , literature , art , and religion , is symbolic of the Renaissance of which I propose to write . The question is , How did these people who started at Plymouth Rock reach that high stage of civilization typified in Harvard University and Copley Square ? I do not intend to answer this question in so far as it may call for a complete survey of New England history , but shall rather confine myself to the year 1830 as indicating approximately the beginning of a great development in industry , in education , in literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Revolution there was comparatively little development . Mr. Charles Francis Adams , himself a descendant of a typical New England family , insists on calling the period from 1637 to 1760 , " the ice age , sterile , forbidding , unproductive ; a monotonous period of slow , provincial growth . " On account of the persecuting spirit and the lack of freedom to think , there was but little progress in intellectual matters . One can not but contrast the provincialism , the narrowness , the comparative poverty of ideas seen in the statesmen of New England with the progressiveness and wisdom of the well known group of public men of Virginia . Charleston at the beginning of the nineteenth century was a more cultured , a more prosperous place than Boston , more open to the influences of the continent . The University of Virginia projected as it was in 1819 showed more of the modern spirit than did the Harvard of that time . George Ticknor and Noah Webster both complained of the isolation and provincialism of New England as well as the dearth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the verge of a rapid decline in industry , the manufacturers suffering greatly in comparison with the owners of Southern cotton , tobacco , and rice fields . Her intense federalism and lack of national spirit alienated from her the sympathies of the country while her priest-ridden people showed few signs of the adoption of modern ideas .  | Almost suddenly , however , in the twenties and thirties a change comes . As if by magic the people take on a new life ; they hear the voice of modern progress and with an alertness , a vigor , a spirit of perseverance in all good things they enter upon their great career as a people . It is the day of emancipation of thought , of unparalleled industrial prosperity , of a desire for culture that seeks in all countries and in all times for the best that has been thought and said , a love of the beautiful that is satisfied with nothing less than the best in music , art , and nature , a strong moral sense that wages war on every form of oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips Brooks . This is the progress , here briefly outlined , to which I wish to call your attention . And first let me say that this awakening has as its basis a strong industrial life . All along through their history the New England Puritans had been characterized by a shrewdness and energy that became proverbial . While the clergy had monopolized most of the culture and had pre-eminently the learned profession , the trader and the merchant had been constituent members of the commonwealth . Dr. Holmes , in his charming sketch of the typical gentleman , provides for a rich merchant as one of his ancestors ? " the great merchant-uncle by Copley , full length , sitting in his arm-chair , in a velvet cap and flowered robe , with a globe by him , to show the range of his commercial transactions . " Just such an ancestor you may find in tracing the genealogy of the leading men of the Renaissance . The Puritans were men of facts and figures no less than of religious earnestness , As Lowell says , " They built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tugged hard at the cod-lines on the seas . " It is a significant fact that Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston ; for although he left there early to find in Philadelphia a freer and more congenial atmosphere , yet there is much of New England in the proverbs of Poor Richard 's Almanac . " The soul aspiring to closer communion with God planted its earthly feet on the firm ground of Poor Richard 's common sense . " In fisheries , in agriculture , and in shipbuilding , no less than in the dogged fight with natural obstacles , Yankee pluck had attracted the attention of the world , calling forth among other tributes that monumental piece of eloquence in Edmund Burke 's  | speech on Conciliation with America . In the period that we are studying , however , this energy and business sense expressed itself in manufacturing enterprises . As the result of the inventive genius of Watt , Stephenson , Robert Fulton , and Eli Whitney men had been put in possession of forces that were destined to revolutionize modern life . New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the Embargo Acts , seemed to decline . There was a prejudice among some against manufacturing as may be seen in the rather sentimental words of an early speech of Daniel Webster . " I am not anxious " he says , to accelerate the approach of the period when the great mass of American labor shall not find its employment in the field ; when the young men of the country shall be obliged to shut their eyes upon external nature , upon the heavens and the earth , and immerse themselves in close and unwholesome workshops ; when thay shall be obliged to shut their ears to the bleatings of their own flocks upon their own hills , and to the voice of the lark that cheers them at the plough , that they may open them in dust and smoke and steam to the perpetual whirl of spools and spindles , and the grating of rasps and saws . .... I am not in haste to see Sheffield 's and Birmingham 's in America . " Thomas Jefferson urged the same objection against factories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If by the necessity of things manufactures should once be established and take root among us , they will pave the way still more for the future grandeur and glory of America . " And New England wisely followed the spirit of these words . With a fine system of good roads throughout the country , with extensive railroad facilities , Boston readily attained a commercial prosperitv that made her the rival of New York . The Lowell family sent men to England to find out the secret of manufacturing cotton goods , thus laying the basis for one of the strongest sources of wealth . The development of that industry led to the manufacturing center , Lowell , and many other cities about Boston : In 1860 $115,681,774 worth of cotton goods were manufactured in America ; $79,359,990 worth of cotton goods were manufactured in New England ; $26,000,000 worth of cotton goods were manufactured in the Middle States . In 1866 all manufac- tures in New York were $379,000,000 ; in Massachusetts , $225 , - 000,000 ; in Virginia , $50,000,000 . Are these so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ; it brings with it those comforts and necessary luxuries that are after all no little part of a man 's life . Furthermore , wealth when used by public spirited citizens becomes the ally of scholarship as it seeks for new opportunities of knowing the truth , the friend of musician and artists and of those who would enjoy music and art ; wealth properly used will lead to public parks ; finally it contributes to the fashioning of houses of worship where the holiness of beauty as well as the beauty of holiness may be realized . There is a striking saying of some one about Peter Chardon Brooks , a great-uncle of Phillips Brooks , at one time the richest man in Boston ? " a merchant coining money as he had opportunity , buying land , making investments , sending out cargos , negotiating bonds , pursuing a just course , yet he did his full share of public good . " And there were many men of his type in and about Boston . As one reads the story of Boston philanthropy , he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale was there . I have spoken of the Lowell family . A cousin of James Russell endowed Lowell Institute , the popular University of Boston , where lectures by distinguished men are given every year . No one can estimate the influence of series of lectures by such men as Emerson , Lowell , Holmes , Agassiz , Presidents Eliot and Hadley , Lyman Abbott , and Henry Drummond . As long as Boston is a city this man 's work goes on . Or take a family like that of the Appletons , rich merchants of Boston . One of them left $200,000 to Harvard College and his heirs $00,000 for the erection of Appleton Chapel , where so many distinguished divines have ministered to the students of that university . One of the daughters was the wife of Longfellow ; through the generosity of her l father they lived in Craigie House which with its historic associations , its delightful study , its ample yards and its magnificent trees was an ideal home for America 's most beloved poet . One of the greatest wits of Boston was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boston , patron of art , friend of learning . Through such men and families as the Appletons and Lowells , men of culture as well as of affairs , came all those manifestations  | of public spirit that we find perpetuated in buildings and endowments . The striking thing about it all is that there were so many men of this type . It became a recognized standard that every Boston man who died without leaving something to Harvard College was disgraced forevermore . It is this that distinguishes Harvard from the recently endowed institutions of the country . Harvard 's grounds , buildings , endowments , are the gifts of an innumerable host of alumni and friends whose acquisition of wealth was an incentive " to do some perpetual good on the earth . " I have already spoken of the Appleton Chapel . More interesting is the establishment of the Smith Chair of Modern Languages at Harvard . In 1815 Abiel Smith , Esq. , of Boston , left a bequest of $20,000 to found a Chair of Modern Languages , the first in this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who went abroad to study for three years and came back with a scholarly ambition that led to the writing of the standard history of Spanish literature , in addition to his excellent work as an organizer of a department and as an educational reformer . His successor in 1835 was no other than Longfellow , who also had spent three years abroad ? in France , Italy , Spain and Germany ? and came to Harvard with a consuming zeal for the study of modern literature . When after teaching for twenty years he resigned his position , he was succeeded by James Russell Lowell , the ablest critic and altogether the most representative man of letters that this country has had . This position he held until he was appointed minister to Spain in 1877 . Through the beneficence of one man culture influences were thus set in motion that no one can estimate at this time , for the study of modern languages may be said to date from the founding of this chair . I have just said that in 1820 the University of Virginia was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparison in every respect was in Harvard 's favor , and one explanation of it was that in the meantime New England had become rich and besides had given birth to a remarkable number of public spirited men . The same difference is seen in the comparative development of Boston and Charleston . What is the explanation of this public spirit ? The answer to that question would call for an examination of the whole struct- ure of New England society . I can only very briefly indicate it here . John Adams once met Major Langhorn , of Virginia , in Paris . Adams says in his diary , " I offered to give him a receipt for making a New England in Virginia . He desired it ; and I recommend to him town meetings , training days , town schools and ministers , giving him a short explanation of each article . The meeting house and school house and training field are where New England men are formed . " The remark illustrates the difference between Massachusetts and Virginia . New England was settled by communities or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land ; the land was granted to a body of freemen . They decided all questions of religion , of politics , of social life , in the town meeting . In town meeting they gave out the land and levied taxes for good roads , schools , and for libraries . Thomas Jefferson realized the strength of such a strong local government when he said , " I felt the foundations of the government shaken under my feet by the New England townships . What would the unwieldy counties of the Middle , the South and the West do ? Call a county meeting , and the drunken loungers at and about the court house would have collected , the distances being too great for the good people and the industrious generally to attend . As Cato , then , concluded every speech with the words , Carthago delenda est , so do I every opinion with the injunction , divide the counties into wards . " Undoubtedly this strong local government and this strong local spirit kept New England from getting the national spirit for many years , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet one can not but admire the strong community spirit that resulted in the public spirit of which I have spoken . We in the South have sometimes cared more for national policies than for municipal policies ; we have thought more of people whom we have never seen than of our neighbors and friends . These New England towns fully realized the meanings of Burke 's words when he defined a community as a partnership . " The liberty of the individual man , " says Weeden , " was enshrined in the homestead , but the dependence of the enlightened citizen was incorporated in a body of duties and privileges . The duty of the citizen weighed upon these men The social tendency , deeper than their policies and deeper than their religion , this inevitable  | necessity binding the settlers together issued , in a better regulated community than the world had even seen . " I can illustrate my point by citing another extract from the diary of John Adams . In 1761 he was just beginning the practice of law in Quincy , Mass. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Accordingly , " he says , " I went to ploughing and ditching and blowing rocks and building an entirely new bridge of stone below Dr. Miller 's . The best workmen in town were employed in laying the foundation and placing the bridge . " Under the law brought in by him and adopted in the town meeting the roads are repaired to this day . John Adams served his apprenticeship as a stateman by doing some permanent work for his neighbors . One of the best towns in New England is Concord , thirty miles from Boston , a town that Dr. Holmes said might sit for the portrait of a typical New England town . One is interested in it as the home of Emerson , Hawthorn , the Thoreaus and the Alcotts . One sees it and feels that it is still more interesting as the best expression of the community life of which we have heard so much . As one drives up the streets he is struck with the comely appearance of everything , the orderliness , the beautiful yards , the good streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town is the old meeting house where for many years the citizens have met to determine their community affairs . I was told that Emerson always attended these meetings and was frequently appointed to do public duties . Here were delivered the lyceum lectures from year to year , Emerson himself delivering 100 during his life time . Near the meeting-house is the old cemetery where one reads the inscriptions on tombstones 200 years old , setting forth the deeds of the founders of the town and their descendants for several generations . One is struck with the fact that families have remained so nearly the same , the names on the tombstones of the seventeenth century still perpetuated in the sturdy and prosperous families of to-day ? the Hosmers , Barretts , Emersons . They have taken pains to let men know the history of their town , believing with Lowell that " words pass as wind , but where great deeds are done , a power abides transfused from sire to son . " Everywhere on the streets are memorial tablets , monuments , inscriptions , that preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Massachusetts and Cambridge the most distinguished of all the academic towns of America , and Lowell the most representative of the new manufacturing centers , Boston is of course the city that is the center of New England . Space does not allow me to notice its history and its development from the time when it was not unlike Charleston in point of wealth and culture to the time when it became one of the great industrial centers of the country . The Bostonians have a very just cause to he proud of their record and I share Dr. Holmes 's enthusiastic description of the old state house as " the hub of the universe . " I have already referred to the great public buildings , the parks and the churches of the city . After all , however , we must judge her by the men who lived there ? the general average of manhood and the great leaders of men . I doubt if there has been any city since the days of Athens where the general average of culture was so high . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great names as those who were all living at one time in the city of Boston : such statesmen as Daniel Webster , Charles Sumner , Edward Everett , Wendell Phillips ; such preachers as Channing , James Freeman Clarke , Theodore Parker , Edward Everett Hale , and Phillips Brooks ; such historians as Bancroft , Prescott , Motley , Parkman ; such publishers as Fields and Scudder ; such artists as Story , Hunt , Allston , Vedder , and imported men who decorated Trinity church a ; =d the Public Library : and if we may come to a climax with men of letters there lived in Boston or within thirty miles of Boston at one time Emerson , Longfellow , Hawthorne , Lowell , Holmes , Whittier , and the significant thing about all these men was that they realized their relation to the public . Just as the rich men of whom I have already spoken gave that the public might enjoy the privileges of the rich , so these statesmen , preachers , musicians , artists , poets , publishers realized the ties that bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through magazines like the North American Review and the Atlantic Monthly , through school and college they exercised a commanding influence on the life of the whole country . In giving Boston 's roll of fame , I omitted two whose influence has been as far reaching as any of these : Horace Mann , who was the leader in the greatest movement in the direr . Lion of universal  | education that we have yet had , and President Eliot , who more than any other American , has had most influence in determining the ideals of higher education in this country . In front of the statehouse in Boston are two statues , Horace Mann and Daniel Webster , the educator and the orator . In 1837 Mann , a promising lawyer and statesman , was elected secretary of the new Board of Education of Massachusetts . In point of salary and seemingly in point of influence it was a decided sacrifice , to go into a work that was anything but inviting . With rare energy , unmatched wisdom , and consuming zeal he set about his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be sure his work was not that of initiating schools , for Massachusetts had always believed in education . From the beginning the New England towns had established schools for all the people . The prayer of the Apostle Eliot was answered , " Lord , for schools everywhere among us ; that our schools may flourish ; that before we die we may be so happy as to see a good school encouraged in every plantation of the colony . " In the constitution of 1647 it was declared that it is the right and duty of government to provide for the support of free schools ; that every man should be taxed therefor , whether he have children or not ? the first law ever passed by which a self-governing community was authorized to offer the elements of knowledge to all children and youth . We must not think , however , that these schools were all that they might have been . In course of time they became inadequate to the needs of a growing State . When Horace Mann took charge of the work he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-prepared teachers working on meagre salaries , miserable text-books , wrong ideals of training ? a state of affairs similar to that about which we hear so much in the South to-day . As a result the richer and more influential classes were withdrawing their support from the schools and establishing academies , while the masses of the people were being neglected . There had been comparatively little change in the character of the schools since the days of the seventeenth century . Horace Mann was pre-eminently equipped for the situation here outlined . A poor boy in one of the smaller towns he had suffered from the meagre schooling offered . The only schools he knew were a perpetual grind of memorizing school-books that were  | often " written to conceal rather than to reveal the secrets of the elementary three r 's . " A correct verbatim recitation from a dry and dusty school-book was expected from him . " It needed a mighty intensity of purpose behind a native longing for knowledge to carry such a sensitive , ambitious , and conscientious boy unharmed through the perilous years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to come to the rescue of the children of his native State , he brought to the task profound study of all the facts in the case , a willingness to get the best light from all parts of this country and Europe , and an unusual combination of high statesmanship , overpowering enthusiasm , and magnetic power and wisdom in handling men . Through a series of masterly reports , through ceaseless agitation by himself and other speakers , through teachers ' institutes , and above all through personal contact with men he aroused public sentiment , inspired teachers with a new sense of the dignity and sacredness of their work and made himself the personal friend of his 80,000 children , as he called them . " Never , " says his biographer , " was a commonwealth in Christendom more thoroughly besieged , bombarded , overwhelmed as by a cyclone of agitation than Massachusetts during the twelve years of the administration of Horace Mann For twelve years he was virtually superintendent of schools in every town and city in the State . " A writer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlining the work of Horace Mann here indicated , says : " Would that Horace Mann could now revisit the scene of his labors and be lead from one beautiful and convenient schoolhouse to another till he felt that coining back to his own dear commonwealth was like a welcome to one of the many mansions reserved for the faithful in the life eternal . " Not only better school houses , but better text-books , a greater uniformity in the common school system , better teachers , thousands of libraries , tell the story of the work he inaugurated . He realized to some extent his desire " to discover by what means a non-thinking , non-reflecting , non-speaking child can most surely be trained into a noble citizen , ready to contend for the right and to do for the right . " And in addition to all these local achievements he became the herald of a new day in all the country ? the father of our common schools . He contributed to the making for the nation of two  | sayings of enduring wisdom : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonwealth ; " " The property of the commonwealth is pledged for the education of all its youth up to such a point as will save them from poverty and vice and prepare them for adequate performance of their social and civil duties . " Scarcely less inspiring is the history of the achievements of President Eliot . I do not speak of him as the greatest force in the higher education of this country for the past generation because he is at the head of America 's greatest university . I might have said that Harvard is to-day the greatest university because she has had at her head since 1869 Charles W. Eliot . He has not only re-created and reorganized Harvard in every department , but he has done more than any ten other men to harmonize the various parts of our educational system . It is worth while to know some of the definite facts about his life and work . In 4 1853 , soon after graduating from Harvard , he was offered the position of treasurer of a cotton mill in Lowell , Mass . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutor , but he declined the offer because he had already formulated certain definite educational ideals . From 1863 to 1865 he studied science in Europe and incidentally made an investigation of educational conditions in France and Germany , thus laying the foundation of his wide outlook on modern educational institutions . In 1869 he was elected president of Harvard College against the bitter protest of alumni and friends of the college , who preferred a clergyman or a politician . Taking up his work with this opposition he soon showed himself master of the situation . Harvard had a president , and the country a " prime minister of education . " During the past twenty-five years he has in the Law , Medical , and Biblical departments , raised the standards of admission so high that a college diploma from some reputable college is required for entrance ; by adding chairs of instruction and facilities for instruction he has brought them into line with the most progressive professional schools of the country . By bringing all of them into vital relation with the academic department he has unified the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reorganize the academic department by thorough-going reforms in the way of elective courses , thus breaking up the dead  | level of uniformity that had left little room for individual preference or talent . By introducing new schools and providing new facilities in the way of libraries and laboratories he added to the efficiency of the institution . More far-reaching still was his creation and differentiation of the graduate school for the making of specialists . Six years after his inauguration as president , Johns Hopkins University began the first real graduate school in this country . Too much can not be said by way of commendation of that university for its pioneer work in behalf of university training . But President Eliot , quick to profit by the experience of Hopkins and better acquainted with German universities than President Gilman , began to develop graduate work ; by reason of her constantly increasing wealth Harvard forged far to the front of all sister institutions and stands there to-day . Before all this work was accomplished President Eliot had seen , that he must take up the whole question of secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academy and the public high school . A notable address at the National Education Association in 1592 resulted in the appointment of the famous Committee of Ten whose report is the working basis of every school in this country to-day . With the comprehensive grasp of a great statesman he has seemed in these later days to have his eye on our whole educational system . He is not a popular speaker like Mann but by his appeals to good sense and reason and by the admirable poise of his personality he has had an unprecedented influence over the thoughful men of the country . As President Hadley said in 1900 , " I wish to propose the health of President Eliot , who , by his work , his example , his thought , and his fearlessness , has given every institution the right to claim him . " Recent celebrations at Yale , John Hopkins , and Columbia have been noteworthy evidences of his unquestioned leadership . If I have spoken somewhat at length of Dr. Eliot , it is because I have desired to represent through him one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For many a year to come the institutions of this country will follow in the lines marked out by Eliot . Not the least of all his services is that he has nationalized and democratized provincial and conservative Harvard . In address after address he has expressed the need of connecting all university  | progress with the needs of a democracy . If his most significant book from an educational point of view is Educational Reform , his most notable book from a political standpoint is America 's Contribution to Civilization , in which he states with remarkable lucidity his views of some of the problems of the nation . Like President Hadley 's recently published book , it is a recognition of the fact that the university must be of the nation . In Dr. Eliot 's inaugural address in 1869 after outlining his policy as president he concluded by saying , " And what will the university do for the community ? First , it will make a rich return of learning , poetry and piety . Secondly , it will foster the sense of public duty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been doubts , in times yet recent , whether culture were not selfish : whether men of refined tastes and manners could really love liberty , and be ready to endure hardness for her sake . In yonder old playground , fit spot whereon to commemorate the manliness which there was nurtured , shall soon rise a noble movement which for generations will give convincing answer to such shallow doubts ; for over its gates will be written , In memory of the sons of Harvard who died for their country . ' The future of the university will not be unworthy of its past . "
