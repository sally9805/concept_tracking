 |p636  YES , I suppose in a fashion all capitals are alike . But the people in Washington are a little apt to suppose that their capital is more like London or Berlin or Paris than it is . Napoleon used to say that there were men in cellars in Paris who had never heard of his name , who had never heard of Louis XVI . ' s name , and who knew practically almost nothing of the years between Louis XVI . and what Carlyle called the " whiff of grape-shot . " I suppose something like this is true now . This could not be true in Washington . Yet in Washington there are thousands of people who are hard at work and do the Lord 's business who are very indifferent to the names of the figureheads or the steersmen of the day . I have asked Cambridge undergraduates to tell me with whom they were xeading their Latin or their political history , and they have not known the name of their teacher . I do not think I could ask any official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States and find him ignorant . But I do think there is many an official in Washington whom I might ask to-day who would be President Roosevelt 's successor if he died , and the man should not be able to tell me . In every department , and this is fortunate for the country , there are some men quite too useful to be turned out on a change of administration . Whoever else goes , Mr. A. B. must remain , or Mr. X. Y. , to keep the machine running . ' Copyright , 1905 , the Outlook Company , New York . They told me in Paris when I was firs : there that when Louis Philippe became King , in 1830 , there were clerks in the public offices who had served there since Louis XVI . was on the throne . That was more than forty years . Directoire . First Consulate , Empire , Bourbon , was all one to them ; the King 's work the Republic 's work went on with even step , equo pede . Any change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . I remember I once had a letter from Washington to ask me if I could tell them where Kohl 's maps were a collection of considerable value which Mr. J. G. Kohl had made for them . I said I would show them the first time I was in Washington , and then I took one of the gentlemen of the Department which wanted to know ? took him in a cab to a house which the Department had occupied in the war . and went up into a particular hallway where was the original chest in which Kohl 's maps were to be found . There have to be certain permanent people who remember the traditions of the Department . Sometimes such people drop into the habits of all chancelleries and adopt that infamous rule of feudal governments that it is better not to do a thing than to do it . I love to tell the stories on the other side which show that with us the Sovereign is the People , that the Sovereign is in the saddle , and that the Sovereign pokes about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commodore Green told me that , coming home from the West Indies when he was a youngster , he said in the office of the chief of his Bureau that he thought it was time that the longitudes should be readjusted by electric telegraph . If you will think of it , this gives you absolute precision , far greater than stellar observations give . The chief of the Bureau spoke of this to the Secretary of the Navy . The Secretary of the Navy sent the next morning for the young Lieutenant , and at once asked him how he would take the longitudes , and , seeing that he had a head on his shoulders , gave him a small vessel for voyages in the Gulf of Mexico and all the men he wanted . From this beginning began the system of telegraphic longitudes , which has gone so far that now every hydrographic bureau in the world uses the longitudes which Uncle Sam has calculated from our own observations in every ocean . Green was at work in his little tent on an island far away , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers came in , introduced themselves , and were interested in seeing the processes . Green said , " Why do n't you get some of this to do ? The whole world is to be done , and you would like the work . " To which one of them replied , " Get some of it to do ! How should we get it ? " Why , " said Green , " you would go to the Admiralty , tell them about it , and ask them to commission you . " At which the Englishman replied , " Dear Mr. Green , if we spent half as much time in the Admiralty as you have spent in talking to us , we should be kicked down-stairs , " There is the difference between working in a country where the People is the fountain of honor and the Sovereign of the nation and another country where you have got to tell Quogga to tell Mingo to ask Sambo to ask Cxsar to send up your card to Mr. Smith to ask him to consult Mr. Jones as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can receive you . Two friends of mine , botanists , were coming up a few months ago from a botanical expedition in the South . They missed their connection in Washington , so that they had five or six hours to stay there . Without any introduction , they went at once to the Agricultural Department . There they were cordially welcomed by people who did not know their names , I suppose . They told of their interest in forests , they told just what they wanted to see and to know , and before they were five minutes older one of them was sitting by one cabinet in one room and another by the right cabinet in another room ; and they had every facility for studying in the best collections of the world precisely the things which interested them and which they wanted to know . Compare this with an experience of mine in London in 1859 . I arrived in London early in October . Mr. Bancroft , the historian , had asked me to make some copies for him in the State Paper office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at once on the American Minister , Mr. Dallas . Mr. Dallas will not mind it now if I say that he thought of himself quite as highly as he ought to think . He had a great respect for the letters of introduction which I brought him , and the whole interview was a fine illustration of etiquette , diplomacy , and red tape in which , dear reader , I assure you I could and can do as well as another if there is occasion . So I told him what Mr. Bancroft wanted and I. He said that if I would write him a note which he could send to the Foreign Secretary , the Foreign Secretary would send that note to the Home Secretary , and the Home Secretary would confer with the Keeper of the Records , and that he , Mr. Dallas , had no doubt that the Keeper of the Records would give me the permission I wanted . Here I , barbarian that I was , thanked him , but said if I might sit a moment at his desk I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio of American papers , very limited as I need not say , of 1584 . Mr. Dallas 's hair turned gray as I spoke of sitting at his desk . He said he thought I had better give more thought to the letter and had better go to my lodgings and write him a note which , as before , he could send to , etc. , etc. , etc . I accepted the snub , went to my " lodgings , " wrote the note , and have never  |p638  seen Mr. Dallas from that day to this . What happened was this ? that that evening I met at a little party Mr. Gardiner , the diligent and celebrated historian of that time , that the next morning he introduced me to Sir Francis Palgrave , the Keeper of the Records , that he gave me a line which opened the whole history of England for a thousand years to me . I made my copies and sent them to Mr. Bancroft , I suppose the next day , and then went off for ninety days on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first week of the next January , as I shook hands with the Captain of the Europa in Queenstown Harbor , he said to me that I should find a note from the Foreign Office in my stateroom . I wondered what the Foreign Office had to do with me , and I ran downstairs to find a permit from the Record Office , countersigned by the Home Office , countersigned again by the Foreign Office , permitting me to examine the letters of the year 1584 . Now , I do not say but there is more or less of this fuss and feathers in Washington , but I do say that when the People is Sovereign and the Sovereign is in the saddle , there is much less of it than there is where they are trying to maintain the forms of the Middle Ages and to use the machinery of Egbert or Alfred or William the Conqueror . This sometimes ends in putting Wamba the son of Witless , son of an alderman the son of a fool , into the cab of a modern locomotive to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old saw , concocted a generation ago , which said that when a Boston man is introduced to a newcomer , he asks , " What does he know ? " That in New York the Knickerbocker asks , " How much is he worth ? " In Philadelphia the people ask , Who was his grandfather ? " In which joke there is an element of truth . The Washington people say that they ask , " What can he do ? " I think that to a very perceptible extent this epigram is true . The interesting thing about social life here is that you meet so many different sorts of people . You would not be surprised much if one of them had three arms , or if another had wings , or if another had some sort of ears or eyes which represented a seventh or an eighth sense . By this I mean that the habits of one man have been so unlike those of another that you are somewhat surprised that you find yourself talking English with them all . They do not know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in his own world . I said above that in the old days everybody in Washington kept the run of the proceedings in Congress . but now the people keep the run of the proceedings in Congress whose business it is to know what the proceedings in Congress are . But you shake hands with a press reporter and go up into the office of the " How To Do It Bureau , " to find a gentleman who has not thought of Congress for a week . He probably knows that Mr. Cannon is the Speaker of the House , he is quite sure that he has heard of Mr. Gorman and Mr. Lodge in the Senate . But he dismisses them because they are doing their business : he is doing his . Well , it is a little as I once had in the same week a letter from James Haverstock in Burnside 's Army to ask me if I could tell him where his brother John was ; and I had another note from John Haverstock to ask me if I could tell him where James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother was in the same brigade in North Carolina that he was in himself , and that if he would get a pass from the Colonel he could go over and see him . James and John were both in their duty : they were serving God , as the PrayerBook puts it , in the condition of life where he had appointed them . And it is a little in the same way that the gentleman in the " How To Do It Bureau " knows that the leaders of the Senate and the House understand their business better than he does , and does not bother his head about them at all . On the other hand , Mr. Lodge and Mr. Cannon had things of certain importance to do . They have gained that certain experience which no newspaper reporter has . and so they really think that the men in the " How to Do It Bureau " know more than they do about the handling of yellow fever and the irrigation of Arizona . And this is to say that they have arisen to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are given to the Thessalonians . As I have intimated , there is another element in the Washington of to-day in which the city differs entirely from what I call irreverently the Virginia " mudhole " of 1844 . By exactly the same law which sends the geese and ducks from beyond the equator to Bird Rock in the Gulf of the St. Lawrence and then sends them back again , a flock quite as large of New Englanders and New Yorkers pass south every winter to Florida and Georgia and perhaps Mexico and then pass north again as the spring opens ; earlier or later , as the counsels of men or women happen to prevail in the separate families of the migrators . Well , exactly as the geese and ducks and rice-birds have to stop sometimes to rest themselves in their flight , nine-tenths of the people from the North have to stop at Washington to give two or three days to inquiries as to the government of the country and how it is administered . They do not stop at Chester or Perryville or Baltimore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington they stop and spend what Miss Ferrier calls the rest day , the dress day , and the press day . Then they go on . Those same birds do not stop when they come back , but the tenth part which did not stop when they went on stop when they return . This constant renewal of life , all belonging , as you observe , to the immediate family of the Sovereign of the Nation , gives a curious element , or bright spots of gold , if you please , to each day , such as I have never observed in any other place in which I have lived . It is a very interesting element . It does Washington a great deal of good and it does this people a great deal of good . In proportion as they make a longer or shorter stay , for the rest of their lives they believe the newspapers less or more when they read about Washington , and are better or worse informed as to the real government of the Nation . To meet such featherless birds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who like that sort of thing , you will look in at the Arlington or the New Willard or the Driscoll or the Normandie or all of them every day and shake hands with Mrs. Vanderlip , to whom you gave her degree at Chautauqua in 1893 , or with Mr. Champernoon , whose father was at school with you at the Latin School in 1833 . They will tell you the last news from New Padua or Fort Fairfield , and you will tell them whether the Cabinet changes mean a quarrel or have been foreordained from centuries . If , while you are talking with one or two of them in the great common hall which is now a part of every hotel , there turns up a very bright and intelligent-looking fellow whom they do not know but whom you do know , and the conversation suddenly changes to Nansen 's book or to the temperature of Wilkes 's Land in the Antarctic , that is because this gentleman is a press correspondent . I like these gentlemen , and they have been promoted step by step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metropolitan journals . At the same time , I can not but observe that their presence in any circle is apt to throw a restraint upon the conversation there . If it happens sometimes , occasionally let us grant , but still sometimes , that the metropolitan journal or the metropolitan correspondent does not voice the latest whisper of the Washington circles , it is because of a certain reticence which is natural enough when they are present . Now , let us contrast all this with the old Washington . I was walking down town one morning in 1844 and I met Moses Grinnell , who was a member of Congress from New Bedford . I joined him , and he told me the morning 's news . Samuel Hoar had arrived from Charleston with his daughter , having been turned out of that city by a mob of gentlemen , who waited upon him and told him that if he did not leave Charleston with his daughter a mob of blackguards would compel him to do so . Samuel Hoar would have been as willing to die from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured the position , and with his daughter took the steamboat for Wilmington and came up to Washington . It was seventeen years before Sumter , but Grinnell knew that it was the beginning of the Civil War . Before the morning had passed I had written to the " Daily Advertiser " in Boston the news  |p640  of this crisis , and in two or three days the letter arrived in Boston . It was printed in the next morning 's " Advertiser , " and in a day more it was in New York . It was copied in the New York journals , and was the first news which those journals printed of a transaction which we now know was critical in the affairs of men . I do not think there was a professional newspaper correspondent in Washington in the year 1844 . I do know of our correspondents in the " Advertiser " office , that the letters were from Mr. Winthrop and Mr. Grinnell and Mr. Choate , who had no idea that the " Advertiser " would need other information than they could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found there by careful historians are from Edward Everett , Rufus Choate , Robert Winthrop , Daniel Webster , Joseph Story , and one or other New England Representatives . The earliest letter from my brother is of the date of 1843 . The gentlemen of the press will excuse me and will agree with me when I say that the physical necessity which now compels so many square inches of news a day , whether there be any news or not , has not improved the quality of the daily letters which , naturally enough , the local press of every city has to print every morning or evening . There was no better sign of the times in those early days than one could see in any issue of the Charleston dailies . Observe that not one of them printed more than five hundred copies . How they lived Heaven knows . But they did have an impudent habit of omitting National news , as if it were only by accident that they had any concern with it . Exactly as the " Tribune " has no separate heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the Charleston " Courier " did not recognize what was going on at Washington , except as it would an incident of general information . If it were proposed to inspect steamboats on Southern rivers , they would copy the information as theywould have copied a motion in the British Parliament on the importing of cotton . This single illustration suggests that it may be well to put in words the central distinction between the Washington of 1844 and that of 1905 . The motto of the " Madisonian , " I think the paper was named , which pretended to be the special organ of the General Government in those early days , was in the words attributed to Jefferson , " The best government is that which governs least . " I can not fix the quotation , and the fact that the " Madisonian " said it was from Jefferson is no evidence that it was so . But when you remember that in John Adams 's time , when the yellow fever was in Philadelphia , Adams went to Braintree and the other members of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say there was no General Government practically for many months tit the Philadelphia fright was over , y understand what happened before the people were really wonted to the idea d a Nation . You get traces of the same thing when you find that Jefferson never alludes to cotton-gins or steamboats , and that as far down as Jackson 's time there were plenty of men to say that Congress could not appropriate money for a National road to the West . Now you remember , by contrast , quite enough instances of such coy indifference to National duties in your visits at different departments to-day . Here is the Department of Agriculture ; it sends its agents over the world . A man in Guatemala finds ants which will destroy the cotton weevil in Texas , a man in northern China collects and brings home peach-stones of a variety invaluable to America . But if you had proposed a Department of Agriculture in John Tyler 's time , you would have been told that the Constitution gave no power for any such thing . Or you go to Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence with all the States and all the Territories right and left ; he is sending or receiving information for the whole Nation . As a little side amusement and play the Department of Education has changed the whole interior life of Alaska by introducing reindeer from Siberia . Now , to have proposed a Board of Education in 1840 would have been madness . The Civil War changed all that . As I am fond of saying , the United-States is a Nation , while our Southern masters were then saying all the time the United  |p641  States are a Confederacy . They pretended , when the President made an official pronouncement , that he held just the same relation to the United States as the Queen of Holland now holds to the forty States which have consented to the Hague Conventions . But nobody says this now . Sam Adams and Patrick Henry from their seats in any other world look with amazement though with satisfaction on a capital of a Nation which extends from sea to sea . It is a Nation which understands home rule as nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Nation which is not afraid to pick up a pin or to launch a navy if the needs of the Nation require . At this moment the Department of Agriculture is engaged in the irrigation of a million square miles , be the same more or less . If you ask them , as the British commander asked Ethan Allen , by what authority they are acting , the Department of Agriculture would say , as he said , that they are at work " in the name of God and the Continental Congress . " They would not talk about State sovereignty or State supremacy . They would say , I hope , that a good many million people in the world are asking God for their daily bread , and it is the business , as He orders , of the Department of Agriculture to enlarge the world 's produce of daily bread . Time works with us , " they will say , " and in a few years we will give you farms which produce a hundred bushels to an acre where the tus or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the agonies of the four years between the fifteenth of April , 1861 , and the third of April , 1865 , can never be fully told . but this is certain , that the God of history has already given us the compensation for such agonies , as in the forty years which have passed since he has made it certain to the eighty million people between the Atlantic and the Pacific that the United States is a Nation . In the second year of the Civil War , a distinguished English traveler said to me that it was all very well to keep on fighting , " but , of course , you know , there can not be , you know , a nation extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific . There never has been such a nation and there never will be . You will have to arrange for four different nations to cover that territory . " To whom I replied , with rage hardly concealed , " There never has been such a nation , but it is the will of God that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we are fighting for . " Now , precisely as Jerusalem was a city guided by the priesthood , even if the technical rule was in the hands of soldiers , as Lowell is a city of weavers and spinners , as New York is a city of tradesmen buying and selling , as Princeton is a city of students and teachers , so is Washington a city of men and women who are fed by the Nation , who work for the Nation , who live for the Nation , and as the Nation chooses . Granting that half of them have ties and memories which bind them , say , to Georgia or Minnesota or the State of Maine , or to other States ; granting that some of them even go to vote in those States as a sort of gallant symbol of their birth and education , all this is but a trifle , because their life is a National life . Twenty-five thousand people is a large number when you remember that the population of the white , which is the ruling race in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and thirty thousand . When we were school-boys , we used to say with James Otis , " One-fifth are fighting men . " I suppose we could say of Washington now that one-fifth of its white residents are in the direct service of Uncle Sam ? of the Government of the United States . Now , for the loyal love which these people bear to the Union , to the Nation of which they are , by whom they were nursed , there was really nothing to compare in the Washington of 1844 , if you left out perhaps the members of the Cabinet . This man was a Virginian , that man was a Carolinian , and , sandwiched in with them , one in a dozen , was some Northern man with Southern principles , but who would have called himself a New Yorker or a Michigan man , ' while his own successors in office to-day would say gladly and proudly that they are Americans .                    @
