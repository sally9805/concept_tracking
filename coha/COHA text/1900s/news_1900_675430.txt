txt It is not easy to associate literature with after-dinner oratory . Neither the audience , the physical environment , nor the usual motive of the gathering can be regarded as inspiring to the literary method or mood . But it is true , nevertheless , that some of the Americans whose names are most intimately connected with our literature have fully sustained their reputatio'n and have even added to it by their after-dinner speaking . Mr. Lowell is an example that will occur to every one , and Mr. Curtis is anOther . Oddly enough , oeer the cigar , and liqueurs these gentlemen sometimes seemed to exchange qualities ; Mr , Curtis became incisively witty and Mr. Lowell was capable of passages of impressive eloquence . But perhaps The most ? intereating instance of the man of -- letters pure and simple -- neither Lowell nor Curtis was this ? shining with great though passing splendor at the banqueting table , was Mr. Emerson some sixty years ago at Manchester , - England . It was a curious occasion for an address from the **28;112;TOOLONG of Concord . Alison , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest . The company was one of merchants mostly , and the merchants of England in that year were wrestling with one of the most devastating panics of their history . Mr. Emerson was more than equal to the occasion ; he created it . With a few words of graceful appreciation of the distinguished guests he passed directly and simply to the expression of his feeling toward England . He summed up the characteristics of the race in trenchant phrase , not sparing their limitations . " I mast tell you ; " be said , " I was given to understand in my childhood that the British island from which my forefathers came was no lotus garden , no paradise of serene sky , and roses , and music , and merriment all the year round , no , but a cold , foggy , mournful country , where nothing grew well in the open air but robust men and virtuous women , and these of a wonderful fibre and endurance ; that their best Parts were slowly revealed ; their virtues did not come out until they quarreled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good lovers , good haters , and you could know little about them till you had seen them long , and little good of them till you had seen them in action ; that lb prosperity they were moody and dumpish , but in adversity they were grand . " The closing words of the speech , width was short , might have been addressed to an audience in England last month with equal ft-me and pertinence : " Is it not true , Sir , that the wise ancients ' did not praise the ship parting with flying colors from the port , but only that brave sailer which came back With torn sheets and battered side , stripped of her banners , but having ridden out the storm ? And so . gentlemen , I feel in regard to this aged England , with the possessions , honors , and trophies , and also with the infirmities , of a thousand years gathering around her , irretrievably committed as she now is to many old customs that can not be suddenly changed , pressed upon by the transitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arts . machines , and competing populations ? I see her not dispirited , not weak , but well remdmbering that she has seen dark days before  --  indeed , with a kind of Instinct that she sees a little better in a cloudy day and that in storm of battle and calamity she has a secret vigor and a pulse like a cannon . I see her in her old age , not decrepit , but young , and still daring to believe in her power of endurance and expansion . Sceing this , I say , All hail ! mother of nations , mother of heroes , with strength still equal to the time ; still wise to entertain and swift to execute the policy which the mind and heart of mankind require in the present hour , and , thus only , hospitable to the foreigner , and truly a home to the thoughtful and generous who are born in the soil .
