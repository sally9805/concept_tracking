FOR tho first time the whole history of one of the great national sites of Egypt has been opened before us ; dating from the beginning of the kingdom , and ending with almost the lest of its native kings , ? from Mena , about 4700 B.C. , to Nekht-hor-heb , 370 B.C. History is here laid out before us in strata , from which the past can be read as we lift them away one from another . In order to read , however , one must know the alphabet of the subject ; and that has only lately been learnt , from the pottery , the flints , the beads , which show , each , the age to which they belong . Excavation on a site with a long history is mere destruction if each stratum is not read and interpreted intelligibly as it is opened : unfortunately , this has never been donebefore on any such site . On the earliest sacred site of Abydos , the first capital of Egypt , temples had been piled one on the ruins of another until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet depth of ruins . Each temple had become partly ruined after a few centuries , and then at last was pulled down , leaving a foot or two of the walls and foundations ; and a new temple of a different plan was then erected on the ground . America is not old enough for this to be done even once ; but London stands on a mound of over twenty feet of ruins , from which its past will sonic day be read as we now read that of Egypt . The earlier temples were all of mud brick , Stone first appears for the doorways of the fourth temple , that of the sixth dynasty , about 3400 D.C. Sculptured stone walls are found of the eleventh dynasty ; and walls were wholly of stone in the twelfth dynasty , about 2700 B.C. , and in the later temples . These buildings of the well-known historic times are , however , of much less importance to us than the earlier temples , which yield us fresh views of the civilization to which they belong . About the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearance of the temple offerings was made , and hundreds of small objects more or less injured were thrown into a disused chamber , which served as a rubbish-hole and was later buried under fifteen feet of ruins . The contents of this chamber were old and disregarded at that time ; and as the vase of Mena ( Fig. 1 ) , the first king , has been found close by at the same level , it seems that we should refer the contents of this limbo to the first dynasty . Groping in the thick brown organic mud of this rubbish-hole , I lifted out one by one the priceless examples of glazed work and ivory of this earliest age of great art ? an art of which we had never understood the excellence from the traces hitherto known . The ivory was sadly rotted , and could scarcely be lifted without dropping asunder in flakes . So when I found that I had touched a piece it was left alone , and other parts were cleaned , until at last a patch of ground was left where several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , I detached the whole block of sixty or eighty pounds of earth , and had it re-moved on a tray to my storeroom . There it dried gradually for two or three weeks ; and then with a camel's-hair paint-brush I began to gently dissect it and to trace the ivory figures . Not a single piece was broken or spoilt by thus work-ing it out , and noble figures of lions , a bear , a large ape , and sev-eral boys came gradually to light . Suddenly a patterned robe and then a marvellous face appeared in the dust , and there came forth from his six - thousand - year sleep one of the finest portrait figures that have ever been seen ( Fig. 2 ) . A single photograph can give but little idea of the subtlety of the face and the expression , which changes with every fresh light in which it is seen . Wearing the crown of Upper Egypt , and clad in his thick embroidered robe , this old king , wily yet feeble with the weight of years , stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we know . No later artist of Egypt , no Roman portrait-maker , no Renaissance Italian , has outdone the truth and expression of this oldest royal portrait , coming from the first dynasty of Egypt . The simplicity and lack of pretension are almost baffling ; it does not claim any idealism or beauty , it scarcely seems to intend to be so fine or powerful , and yet it appeals equally to the first artists and to the ordinary man . No other object has so generally compelled the admiration of visitors in any of our annual exhibitions . That this did not stand alone as a stray phenomenon is seen by the group of other ivories , of which we may instance a very small one of a woman ( Fig. 3 ) , which shows the same character of work in simplicity and directness , and in the perfectly natural expression of the statuette . Among other figures discovered , those of boys , standing , walking , and seated , are all true and unconventional in form , and show firm and accurate modelling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lions , and a mastiff show that animals were studied and understood as well as men . We must now grant in future that a complete art had arisen nearly seven thousand years ago , and that it has seldom been equalled and hardly ever surpassed in the five fresh births of art which have occupied the course of human history . Nor was the skill of technical work neglected . The abundance of vases and bowls , cut from the hardest and most refractory materials , granite , syenite , porphyry , rock - crystal , and obsidian , which we found in the Royal Tombs of this age , show a taste and ability for fine material and work which was never equalled in later times . And the mastery of glazing provided large vases with the royal name inlaid , as we see by the piece pictured on the preceding page ( Fig. 1 ) . This was part of a globular vase , eight inches wide , of green glaze , with the royal hawk-name inlaid with purple glaze . Here we have the property of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history ? Mena , the first king of the first dynasty of Egypt . This vase must have been handled by this figurehead of all monarchy , and almost certainly was dedicated by him in the primitive temple of the capital . Strange indeed it is to look on so personal a link , and to think that the whole sum of what we know as human experience has come and gone since this was last worthily handled ; the pyramids , Thothmes , Rameses , the Greek , the Roman , the Northman , all were unthought of when this last saw The light . The use of colored glazes was also carried out on a great scale for wall decoration . Thick tiles , a foot high and half as wide , were made , fully glazed in green on both sides , and provided with a deep keying on the back , and grooves to hold thick copper wires to thread them together , so that no one could be lifted without moving those on either side . The surface was ribbed to represent papyrus stems ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the stem tiles . This glazed tiling was also made in a great variety of sizes and patterns ? some ribbed , some fluted , some plain , some inlaid with inscription , and others copied from mat-work design . Another light on the architecture is given by the glazed vases copied from the lotus capitals , showing that such a form was already in use ( Fig. 4 ) . The complete capital is of green glaze with purple spots , the same polychrome as the Mena vase , and probably from the same factory . The form of the top , with a slightly raised disk , is evidently copied from the architectural detail of a capital . The other work in glazed pottery is of great variety . Figures of men , women , and children , captives and servants ; figures of baboons innumerable , of various quadrupeds and birds ; model vases and shrines ; toggles for fastening the dress , and beads of many forms ? all subjects came alike to the ready band of this early potter . He modelled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hard coat of glaze which binds the material firmly together , and which has in many pieces even kept its color after thousands of years in wet ground . An entirely new class of glaze-work is the tile with relief designs and inscriptions . One whole tile I picked out of the mud which has a figure of an aboriginal negro chief , and his name and locality . This proves of particular interest , as he cvn. ? No. 642. -1 0 5 belonged to the " fortress of the Ann , " a people with whom the early Egyptians were continually at war , and the day of whose destruction was a yearly festival down to late times . From this tile we now know that the Anu were the negro races of the southern border , which the Egyptians had such difficulty in holding back . The Sudan question is as old as the beginning of history . In another chamber we found a large number of sacred figures , which had been carefully put away when thought too rude for the devotions of more civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in style as those which I had taken out of the mud in the great rubbish - pit ; and judging from that , and their re-semblance to figures found some years ago at Hiera-konpolis , it is prob-able that these are as early as or ear-lier than the age of Mena , and so touch the close of the pre-historic time . The most curious , and probably the oldest , objects here were some very elementary figures of baboons , and other purely natural stories . The figures of baboons are very slightly worked . Rude lumps of limestone had been picked up , having a slight resemblance to the form of the animal ; and then a little pound-ing away of the surface had improved them into an unmistakable connection , helped out in some cases by a few scores scraped with a flint . The first of these is only pounded , like an Easter Island idol ; the second is the most im-proved , by scratching a mouth and eyes ; the third and fifth have only a broad groove hammered to divide the head from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fourth a natural flint selected for its resemblance to the ba-boon , and slightly improved by knock-ing off a few awkward projections ; there can be no question as to the intention of . placing this flint with the other element-ary figures : they were all alike kept in honor of the sacred cynocephalus baboon . But with these figures , which are seven or eight inches high , there were two much larger flints two or three feet high . They were set upright in the chamber , and had evidently been selected ? out on the desert , a mile or more away , ? and brought into the temple , associated with the very primitive baboon figures , and placed on end with them . AU this attention to them is only explained by looking at their resemblance to animal forms . In the first one we see a quadruped on its hind legs , the head having been lost at the break on the top . In the second stone there is the baboon form tolerably evident . We can not but see here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now collect and reverence . Thus we touch the Egyptian behind all art and civilization , back in the time when the stray resemblances of nature caught the attention of the mind as yet untrained to disentangle the connections of things . That mind is by no means now extinct : the coats of arms of cardinals are quoted in telegrams as forecasts of their probable papacy , in accord with a supposed prophecy , and the name of a ship is supposed to link its fate with that of its namesake . Most men pick up their fetish stones by the wayside in life , and imagine connections which strike their fancy . But these stones , found far below the polished statues of an Egyptian temple , open our eyes to the source of sculpture . We see here that man did not first sit down with a block of stone and determine to carve some figure , but he picked up some strange weird form that seemed as if it must be something else than all the rest of the stones around ; he treasured it , venerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and little by little be became bolder , until the finished statue did not even need the least resemblance of the block to start with . I envy the glow of discovery of the first man who saw that any stone would do , and that he need not he the servant of nature and only adopt what was indicated to him . Such are the glimpses of the rise of art which these stones give us ; but these were by no means the earliest examples of such notions , as prehistoric man in Egypt hadlong existed , though here we touch a survival of the primitive ideas in these rude untouched fetish stones set up in the first temple of Abydos . In the same chamber with these early sculptures we found also a modelled pottery head of a camel ( Fig. 5 ) . So far this animal was unknown in early times in Egypt . Not a single figure of or allusion to the camel is found there before Greek times , although familiar in Syria from the days of Abraham . Here we find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Egyptians . A similar throw-hack in history occurs when we find a piece of iron in a bundle of copper tools of the sixth dynasty , or about 3400 B.C. Hitherto not a scrap of iron had been found which could be certainly dated before 1000 B.c. in Egypt , and it was not in familiar use till Greek times . But we see now that in some way the Egyptians got a bit of iron , apparently only worked into a wedge , two or three thousand years earlier . It is not only the history of Egypt that we recover deep down in its ruins , but also that of Europe . Some years ago I found foreign pottery in the prehistoric time , and the earliest stage of painted Greek pottery in the Royal Tombs of the first dynasty . Now , of that same age , we find in the temple a whole class of black pottery which is not Egyptian and is clearly Greek in its forms . I took a piece of it in my pocket to Crete ; and there , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I picked up the exact parallel to it , indistinguishable in color , material , and polish . Unfortunately the Cretan pieces are much broken , and the forms have not been yet restored for comparison with the amphora and bottle which I found ; but more than a dozen black bowls from the temple are like those of Crete . As to the age , this pottery belongs to the late neolithic period in Crete , which must be of 4000 13 , c. or earlier , in goad accord with the Egyptian date of about 4500 B.C. for this class of pottery . It is only by thus connecting the early dawn of Europe with the more complete history of Egypt that we can recover more of our own past and trace surely the various steps by which our present civilization has been built up . To understand the action of the present time , to grasp the meaning of the tendencies of its religion , its politics , and its life , without knowing the stages by which it has grown , is as ineffective as to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which still controls it . Just as the strata below preserve the geography of the past , and have formed and will yet regulate in future the surroundings of mankind , so the past civilizations have formed the social present and will yet control the future of man . We come down now from this beginning of the high civilization , which is only now brought before us , and some eight centuries later we next meet , at 4000 B.C. , name which has never fallen into oblivion , but has kept its place as that of one of the leading figures of history . By the pen of Herodotus the personality of Cheops has passed over from the wreck of Egyptian literature , safe and sound into the Greek world , and so to our days . The character of the great and masterful ruler is the oldest that has been handed down in the memory of every generation since his time . In all ages to offend a priesthood is a sure title to infamy ; and whether it be Cheops or Manasseh , Leo the Iconoclast or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this light must we read the history of Cheops , who is said to have " abandoned himself to every kind of depravity . He closed all the temples , forbade the Egyptians to offer sacrifices , and ordered them all to work for himself , " as Herodotus records . Manetho likewise says that " he was supercilious to the gods , " but adds strangely that he " wrote the sacred book which is greatly valued by the Egyptians . " This apparent contradiction shows how we are to read the abuse which precedes it . Of the depravity there is no evidence beyond a confiscation of religious endowments ; of his real religion there is the proof that he edited or wrote a work which was valued in ages afterwards , and the temples of Bubastis , of Koptos , and of Denderah all show him as a religious founder . Hitherto we have had no portrait to enable us to judge the man as an acquaintance , to estimate his abilities , his ideas , and his nature : and he has remained an enigma which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his character face to face . In one of the storerooms of the temple of Abydos many figures had been thrown aside , probably in the sixth dynasty . Those of wood had entirely decayed , and mere films of painted stucco were left in the earth ; but one little figure of ivory about three inches high had preserved its original polish almost complete . The workman in digging had broken the head off , and brought me the figure headless . When I had cleaned it , and found the Horus name of Cheops ( Khufu ) upon the throne , it was evident that no trouble was too great to recover the head the only portrait of one of the greatest kings . I anxiously inquired of all the boys where they had thrown the earth , and marked out the possible limits of our search ; and then began a sifting of every morsel , in order to find a piece no bigger than the tip of the little finger . A whole day the boys sifted , and day after day they went on sifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then another ; but at the end of the third week of incessant sifting the precious face was found in perfect state , and the next day the back of the head completed the figure , and Khufu once more sat in all his dignity before us ( Fig. 6 ) . We can now study the nature of this great monarch . The first thing that strikes us is the enormous driving-power of the man , the ruling nature which it seems impossible to resist , the determination which is above all constraint and all opposition . As far as force of will goes , the strongest characters in history would look pliable in this presence . When we analyze it we see the idealily of the upper part of the face ? the far look in the eyes , and the high cheek-bone ; the expression of conception and construction and the attaining of great ends . And when we look below , to the mouth and jaw , we feel the terrific force which carried forward his ideals , the all-compelling power to which no man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in all the portraits that we know , Egyptian , Greek , Roman , or modern . Face to face with Khufu we can better understand the record that we have of his acts . No doubt such a man , with great ideals and unlimited strength of will , did many unpleasant - things ; but the sight of such a face wipes away any notion of personal baseness or evil nature . And this reform and economic revolution was the step toward the resnmption of the wealth of the country by the state . The king was all in all to the Egyptian ? lawgiver , administrator , organizer , general , high priest ; and after putting an end to the wasteful service of the religion " he made them all work for himself . " The name of Khufu still remains at some of the great temples , at a vast quarry of alabaster , on the rocks of Sinai , and above all at the Great Pyramid of Gizeh , which is the greatest mass of masonry and contains some of the most accurate work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triumphant results of this ruling will , of which we now see the living expression set before us . ? The accounts of the reign of Khufu have been slighted by some writers as improbable . But this year an entire confirmation was found in excavating the temples at Abydos . At the bottom of all was a temple of the first dynasty ; above that another temple of the second and third dynasty ; and then at the fourth dynasty there was a blank in the ruins , with no great walls or building , but only a hearth of vegetable ashes , among which were hundreds of little pottery offerings , without a single bone of a sacrifice . Here we actually saw before us the abolition of the temple and the sacrifices , and the substitution of the clay models of no value in place of the costly offerings which had sustained the priesthood . After that the system of temples revived and increased in cost and grandeur to the end of the history . But the political economy of Khufu stood revealed , and Herodotus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article ) will give some idea of the clearing of such a site . Rows of pits are sunk , and the earth thrown out , until buildings arc reached , and then each wall is followed and traced , and one structure below another is cleared , till all the past history of the series of temples is exposed , and every fragment has been transferred to the plans which permanently secure the facts . More than four thousand measurements and a thousand levels were taken to unravel the history of - these temples of Abydos ; and every day I was cutting sections of the earth with trowel and knife to trace in the mud soil the course- of the mud-brick walls . The pillager merely in search of antiquities would find only two or three dozen inscribed stones and much worthless pottery ; but for the historian and arehreologist there was the history of the land for four thousand years in that twenty feet of ruins . I have to thank England and America equally for enabling these discoveries to be carried on by means of the Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results are given .
