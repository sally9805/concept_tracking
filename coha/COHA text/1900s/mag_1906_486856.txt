No one calls this an era of good feeling , politically speaking , yet it has proved nearly or quite the best year in this country 's history for those who appeal for votes on the ground that there is nothing to choose between Democrats and Republicans The minor parties , which do not learn their standing and successes until the curiosity of every one else is satisfied , are only now celebrating their triumphs in the recent election . We have heard but little from the Populists , to be sure , but the publications of Socialists and Prohibitionists are full of cheering news ' Such phrases as " 100 per cent . gain , " " 200 per cent gain , " " 300 per cent . gain , " are scattered liberally through their organs . Instead of a dispersed vote , of no importance anywhere , the minor parties now seem able , by vigorous campaigning with good candidates , to cut pretty deep into the solid party votes . The same growth of independent sentiment which made the voters discriminate between Hughes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his in Minnesota , has weakened greatly the torce of blind partisan loyalty against which the independent or third-party candidate always had to contend . The immediate result is that our legislatures are ceasing to represent only two parties Out of all the legislatures chosen in 1904 , the Populists had 2 members in Alabama , the -Prohibitionists 2 in Illinois , and the Socialists 5 in Wisconsin . The Socialists have increased their legislative - membership in Wisconsin , and elected for the first time members in Illinois , Florida , and virtually in Pennsylvania , where two candidates of the Federation of Miners have been sent to Harrisburg . The Prohibitionists have gained three members in Minnesota , one in West Virginia , and at least one additional in Illinois ( where the cumulative system of voting improves the chances of third candidates ) . A Prohibition nominee with Republican endorsement was elected in New York , and one with Democratic endorsement in Massachusetts . Thus , however slight the influence such scattered fighters may be able to wield , the reforms for which they stand will at least cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country the standard example of Government ownership and operation . On the one side , its low rates are contrasted with the high rates of the express companies ; on the other , its reearring annual deficit is pointed to as conclusive evidence that a private cor -- poratiou could do the work better . Last week , a group of Chicago capitalists actually made the formal offer before the Congressional commission to take over the Post Office bodily . The private firm professes- itself willing to cut first and second-class rates in half , giving penny letter-postage , yet at these figures to wipe out the deficit , make 7 per cent . profit for the company itself , and turn all receipts above that rate into the Treasury . What has the Department itself to offer by way of alternative ? Well , the most concrete proposal at present seems to be that of Third Assistant Postmaster-General Madden , to the effect that the rate on periodicals be raised from one to fOur cents a pound Beyond the quadrupling of this single rate , against which convincing arguments can certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably a well-managed corporation could bring about an eqUilibrium between receipts and expenses , with the present extent of the service . But the publicly managed Post Office attained this equilibrium in the eighties , before rural free delivery was invented If it , had not been for that innovation , there would have been no deficit , as careful computations show , for three years past . Neither rural delivery nor the low second-class rate was originally adopted as a pure business proposition . Congress regarded both as measures of general public good . We do not suppose for an instant that Congress will give such a stupendous contract to any private interest . But the incident ought to have a wholesome effect notwithstanding This year 's deficit it four million dollars less than last year 's There are ten millions more to he saved What would happen if the railway contracts were scrutinized as microscopically as the second-class list ? Rear-Admiral G. A. Converse 's proposal to remove the marines from our nlen-of-war will renew an old and bitter controversy . For years before the war with Spain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retention of the marines on ships , and those who wished them removed . The leaders of the latter faction were the then younger officers , headed by Lieutenant ( now Commander ) Bradley A. Fiske The war in Cuba and the Philippines , resulting as it did in the enlargement of the Marine Corps , and in the increased activity of the navy , ended the controversy temporarily The marines are an exceptionally fine and an ably-officered body of men . Their presence on warships is , however , a survival of the days when the sailors were the scum of the earth , impressed men , ex-convicts , and gutter-snipes generally . A strong and well-disciplined guard was then necessary to prevent mutiny and disorder . The modern sailor resents having a guard over him , and this part of the marine 's work is now of so little importance that he is used to man a gun , just like the bluejacket . For landing parties and quick service like that in Cuba recently , the marines are still of great value , as they are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad nbisencordiam , is comic , bathetic , or exasperating  --  according as one takes it . That this overgrown corporation should fall a-whimpering when it is spanked , speaks more for the power of public opinion than for the power of reason in its managers What they say about the extent and importance of their export ade , and of the competition they have to meet abroad , is perfectly true ; but if they imagole that considerations of that kind will make people overlook what they have done at home , they evidently have not the faintest notion of the popular odium under which they lest , or of the public with which they have to deal To beg for support as a great patriotic institution , is not only impudent , even for the Standard Oil , but wholly aside from the real point at issue . That is merely whether these supDlicating gentlemen are or are not lawbreakers Detailed charges that they have repeatedly and knowingly violated the statutes have been officially made against them , and suits are now pending in the courts to determine whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think their confidences had better be confined to their lawyers , and that their begging for mercy should be reserved for the judge , and not wasted upon a distinctly cold public . " It is a murder trial solely and simply , " says Gov . Gooding of Idaho regarding the approaching trial of certain officers of the Western Federation of Miners , for complicity ' in the murder of er-Gov . Steunenberg Now that the Supreme Court has disposed of the allegation that the extradition of the men was illegal , there is no excuse for making it appear anything but a trial of individuals for a definite crime . A few months ago in this city some thousands of Socialists were marching under red flags and transparencies to protest against the " railroading " and attempted " murder " of Moyer , Haywood , and Pettibone . The highest court of the land has now held that the method by which the accused men were brought from Colorado to Idaho was legitimate It remains for the authorities of the latter State to carry out their admirable determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-Gov . Steunenberg should have a fair and impartial trial before the best and squarest jury that Idaho could produce ; that they should be completely cleared if innocent , and hanged by the neck until dead if guilty . " There undoubtedly exists in the mining States a hostile sentiment quite as unreasoning and as little entitled to respect as that of the agitators who cried " judicial murder " half a year before the trial was set . But Idaho has such a chance as seldom comes to any commonwealth for impressing the lesson that the law is above any special interest , whether of capital or labor . The trial of Cornelius P. Shea , the head of the Chicago Teamsters ' Union , who was able to paralyze the business of that city last winter and fill its streets with rioters , should be overlooked by no student of labor unions . The Garment Workers ' Union , having a little strike of its own on hand , wanted aid . According to the testimony of Albert Young , who has turned State 's evidence , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of the teamsters , for the purpose of " buying a strike " of their men. , Young was not very enthusiastic over this , because the teamsters were getting on well with their employers , had no complaints , and " ought not to get into trouble " But the $1,500 did its work . Out of " sympathy " for ' the down-trodden garment workers , the teamsters struck  --  with what consequences for the city our readers may remember . Hundreds of thousands of dollars were lost to employers who could not move their goods , and to employees thrown out of work  --  merely in order that Shea and his followers might each put less than $300 into his pocket . This sordid story could be duplicated in many sections of the country . Such crookedness damages the cause of labor unions more than all the machinations of capital . Richard Olney has an article in the Inter-Nation welcoming the advent of organized labor in politics What is plainly in the mind of this old-fashioned Democrat , is an acute realization of the peril lest our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be harmfully modified . He dreads the gradual disappearance of equality before the law . The mounting arrogance of special privilege is as alarming to him as it is hateful , ' and he looks about for some political force which may be powerful enough to stay these evil tendencies . Mr Olney enumerates the ends for which organized labor ought to strive in politics They are worthy ends ? equal opportunity for all men ; no taxes laid to enrich particular classes ; opposition to graft and extravagance , however disguised ; the abolition of- paternalism in government . It is unde4aiably true that labor unions , like all other associations of citizens , ought to contend mightily for these political principles . But can Mr. Olney open his eyes and look full at organized labor as we know it and still say that he perceives any such motives operative ? He has only to read the official programme of the Federation of Labor to discover that what we have in trades unions in politics is only another class seeking special privileges . Nothing that the beneficiaries of protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in control of government , ever greedily sought , is more grossly selfish , or discriminates more sharply against outsiders , than the avowed aims of trades unions . Labor leaders are not so much concerned to do away with the oppression by the tariff , as to win the legal power to do some oppressing on their own account . This is not strange . The protective system is bound to bring forth its perfect work in thus drugging the public conscience .. When men are long accustomed to seeing a certain class empowered to tax their fellows , under the guise of protection , it is not surprising that they prick up their ears and set about getting their share of the plunder . Instead of correcting the abuses of special legislation , labor unions , taking to vote Solidly , would only extend and heighten them. , " They do not know men , " said Burke of certain political philosophers of his day . We fear that it must be said of Mr. Olney that his idealistic article shows that he does not know labor leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a " Christian League " for preventing further mob outbreaks and aiding in the solution of the race ' problem . It is being organized by the At lanta Business Men 's Gospel Union of which ex-Gov . W. J. Northen is president , in cooperation with the ministers of the city ; and it is noteworthy that members of both races are asked to join . Its members are expected to " constitute themselves a sort of Southern legion of honor , hoping to be more powerful in preserving patriotism and high morality than all laws or law officers . " If this sounds somewhat extravagant , the fundamental idea is one that can not be too highly commended . Why there should not be a " steering committee " in each town and city , composed of the best and broadest of both races , has long puzzled the outside observer Such committees could accomplish much in preserving the peace and in uplifting ' the negroes The white members would find the colored ones ever ready to respond to wise leadership and anxious to control and punish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these indicate what a business Harvard athletics have become . Football is , of course , the great money-maker , the receipts from that sport being $85 , - 353.66 , " breaking all records " by $17,000 . Significantly , the expenses of training the team also increased from $10,000 to nearly $30,000 ? the latter sum being required to train forty or fifty men for a period of eight weeks , and pay salaries to trainers during the rest of the year . It must not be forgotten , however , that both this season and last the graduates Were called upon to contribute to the salary and expenses of the head coach , whose dismal failure at New Haven is now a matter of record Plainly , the itemizing of the $30,000 expenses is something to be studied with care . The net football earnings last year were $55,000 , and of this sum $27,000 was utilized to make good the deficits in other branches of athletics . Obviously , the English and the West Point custom of taking no gate-money for amateur matches , if introduced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods . Yet we believe that the more publicity is given to the annual financial statements of our colleges ? the more people will favor the adoption of the English system . The anomaly of a football team earning $55,000 , when the public and graduates are being urged to give money to meet legitimate university expenses , affords ground for thought  --  and action . The new director of the German Colonial Department has- found a novel use for African dependencies . The following is from the report of Herr Dernburg 's maiden speech in. the Reichstag : " Rebellious natives , though he regretted to have to make the assertion , had one advantage ; namely , that of developing firmness of character in the colonists . " In other words , if German Southwest Africa is a bit too arid to produce any- , thing worth exporting , and a bit too hot to support a European farming population worth speaking of , it is nevertheless inhabited by a number of sturdy , fighting tribes , whose activities serve to make the colony an admirable field for nurturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace in Europe may have tended to weaken . It is a pity that this pedagogical theory of colonization was not explained to the Herero insurgents about a year ago . If they had been made aware that continued resistance on their part only served to emphasize the qualities of courage , initiative , and swiftness of action in one of the Kultur nations of Europe , they would - not have interrupted the good work- by surrendering inconsiderately after losing only 55,000 out of 60,000 souls News of the strife in Prussian Poland over the enforced use of German in the public schools , points to a growing restlessness among the minor Slav peoples of central and southern Europe , who have apparently succumbed to the violent epidemic of political megalomania now sweeping the globe . Pan -- Americanism , Pan-Germanism , Pan-Islamism , Pan-Ethiopianism  --  we ' seem to be on the verge of Pan-everythingism . Greater Britain , Greater Scandinavia , and Italia Irredenta , face almost their burlesque in the demand for a Greater Servia or a Greater Croatia . It is true that the Weak peoples are herein acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the advance of the giant races that threaten to engulf them . The movement for a Greater Moravia is essentially a reply to Pan-Gerpianism , as the movement for a Greater Illyria is the reply to wide schemes of Magyar ambition . To compass these programmes would only result in a patchwork map as crazy as that of the ancient Germanic empire . The influences that have encouraged the present striving among the minor races of Austria-Hungary and elsewhere have come primarily from Russia The great lesson of the Russian revolution for the inferior races of Europe is that constant struggle for the preservation of national identity , no matter how seemingly hopeless , is justified because of the possibility of a political cataclysm taat may make the dominant sovereign of to-day helpless to-morrow .

France and Germany , jealous and opposed in so many respects , are in unison at least in the matter of due protection of literary property The agreement of 1883 between them has now been amended , extending the period during which an author may control the right of translation . Formerly , it was only ten years ; hereafter , it is to run as long as the copyright . The new rule is to go into farce with the meeting of the Berne Convention , two years from now . To that Convention nearly all - civilized countries now subscribe , except the United States . aur Government would Iike to do so , but a higher power  --  namely , the Typographical Union  --  prevents it . Rumania is also ' a nation that has not yet adhered to the Berne Convention for the international protection of literary and artistic property But she appears to be preparing to align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the American isolation in literary barbarism the more protwunced .

Norway is soon to rank with Belgium and Switzerland as a neutralized state , with its independence and integrity guaranteed by the Powers While the tendency , nowadays , is to regard the neutrality of such states , in case of a great European war , with a good deal of skepticism , they nevertheless have a certain demonstrable value in times of peace as virtual little museums or laboratories of statecraft , where new political ideas may be tried out and exhibited under special circumstances , on the chance that they may prove acceptable to the more powerful governments Switzerland , of course , is the classic home of the referendum , and Belgium has demonstrated the fairness and prat= ticability of proportional representation so successfully as to make the adoption of the system in the new Transvaal Constitution a possibility So , too , the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , as examples of prosperity and content without the drawback of militarism . , Faced by the possibility of a madman , cn the throne in the person of the present Crown Prince , Servian politicians and military leaders are reported to be planning the overthrow of the Karageorgevitch dynasty and the substitution of a member of some sovereign German house Palace murders , pretor.ian elections , and a royal blood tainted with madness , yield a startling parallel between Imperial Rome and the little Slav Kingdom The situation also emphasizes the swift pace of modern life even in so remote a corner of Europe . II took the Bavarian house of Wittelsbach a thousand years to spend itself in a succession of insane kings ; and the misfortunes of the Hapsburgs are accounted for by an equally long period of sovereign power and interbreeding .

News of the discovery of manuscripts in Central Asia , at least one in an unknown tongue , raises some hope of solving the great historical riddle of the Tartar Empire . We have reason to suppose that in high antiquity Central ' Asia was dominated by a Tartar race of ' considerable civilization . Sven Hedin* and other travellers have found great cities half-buried in the sands of Turkestan , relics , apparently , of the race that overran Russia and actually conquered China ; but so far we are quite without literary documents of these people , being dependent for their history on the testimony of their enemies . We seem to trace their influence in the designs on textiles and-ceramics in Central and Western Asia ; but such evidence is naturally of a slight and dubious kind , It has been hoped that the Pumpelly expedition would throw some light on these matters , but so far preliminary surveys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German scholar is indeed to bring us information on the early history of the Tartars , it will be a sort of ' compensation for the havoc that German aniline factories are working in the splendid rugs of the Turcoman region . Lovers of the picturesque should weir-come the news of the abandonment of St. Helena by its British garrison . The greater part of the inhabitants , numbering some 3,500 , will probably emigrate , since there are practically no industries on the island . This is as it should be . ' It was always an anomaly to think of St. Helena as an island like any other island in the gazetteer , with a popula- ; pon , and exports and imports , and savings banks , and possibly even a race-suicide problem .
