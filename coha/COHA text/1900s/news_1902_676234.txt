txt The fight between the Administration and the reorganizers of the Republican Party in the South , the so-called " Lily Whites . " is fairly on . Senator Pritchard of North Carolina . the leader of the movement , to-night made a statement which removes all doubt about his position . It indicates unmistakably that Mr. Pritchard will go on with his fight . The only doubt in the matter has been about the attitude of North Carolina . The administration is said to have had Senator Pritchard in mind for a Federal Judgeship , and it has been questioned whether North Carolina would not accept this peace offering and drop the agitation . ' dr . Pritchard has rejected this bait , if it was offered . In the course of his statement Senator Pritchard says : When our party met in convention at Greensborough it declared in its platform that , inasmuch as the recent Constitutional amendments which restricted suffrage in so far as the colored voter is concerned had been adopted , it was no longer a political question , and that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Democrats would abide by the pledges which they made in the campaign of 11100 , which were to the effect that if the Constitutional amendment should be adopted , all men would be permitted to exercise the right of intellectual freedom in dealing with political questions . There has been no disposition on the part of the Republican Party in North Carolina to prevent the colored man from participating as a delegate in any convention to which he may be elected by those who are duly qualified voters ; the Republican . in North Carolina simply refused to adopt any policy which has a tendency to create strife and contention among our people as a whole . Every wise colored man knows that anything approaching negro domination in the South would result in disaster for the Republican Party and lasting injury to the colored race . " There is a disposition on the part of the progressive people of North Carolina to break away from the Democratic Party , and thousands of them did so at the last election , but : he movement is not well under way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are marvelous , at the same time , if we adhere to the policy adopted at Greensborougli Convention for a sufficient length of time to convince the people that Republican rule will mean just and fair government for all , then North Carolina will be as reliably Republican as Pennsylvania or Ohio . In other words , if we can only fix the status of the Republican Party of North Carolina as being analagous to . that of Pennsylvania or Ohio  --  that is to say , that the natural leadership of the party , the Intelligence and character of the party , will control its affairs  --  then there will he no question about our State giving her Electoral vote to President Roosevelt In 1904 . " Out of a white vote of : 11-1-1.000. only 1 ; 15. - 000 white votes were cast at the last election , which leaves 1u5,000 white people who did not vote . and the question naturally arises as to what course this class of people will pursue in the future . It is reasonable to assume that all these who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote the Republican ticket at the next election . " The remainder of those who failed to rote at the last election constitute a very important element in our State . This class is made up of farmers , merchants , laborers , and business men who are unalterably opposed to the Democratic machine . hut : who were not thoroughly satisfied at the last election that the success of the Republican Party would not mean negro domination . By the next election there will be no question about the fact that the policy adopted at the Greensborough Convention , which is really the policy of fair and equal treatment to all men with regard purely to their merits as men , will become the permanent policy of the Republican Party in the State and the result will be that this class of people will take a stand in opposition to the Democracy . The Democrats lost 51. /8. , o white votes in the State at the last election , and these losses were sustained in almost every county in the State . and this , too . In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been made in North Carolina since the war . "
