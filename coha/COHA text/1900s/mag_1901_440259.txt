Ix the days before the coming of the Coqueeigrues , a phenomenon was apparent in the land which students of society knew as the " grand manner . " It was primarily an affectation of the bean monde , and he who adopted it considered himself bound to attain distinction in many paths . A man is above his profession , it was held , especially if he be a gentleman , and it is his duty to do much , but to do it with ease and the grand air . He must bear no traces of the struggle ; he must be ready at any hour to play a quite different part : if lie is a states- man , he must be also a scholar ; if a poet , a man of fashion ; if a wit , a man of affairs . He should come fresh from port and the classics to the bench or the council board , and do his work as to the manner born ; but , granted the presumption of competence , lie must wear his honors lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and full-blooded race of men arose , men like the Elizabethans , who were soldiers and poets : a Lord Herbert of Cherhury , who was philosopher , physicist , and bravo in one , or the Carterets and Foxes of the eighteenth century , who were statesmen by trade , and wits and scholars at their leisure . The manner , to be sure , found its critics , chiefly from the ranks of the incompetent . " It is with genius as with a fine fashion , " wrote Pope : " all those are displeased at it who are not able to follow it . " Learned serjeants " shook their heads at Murray as a wit , " and excellent persons looked askance at Fox . But for the connoisseur , who ranges history for what pleases him , there is much to attract in the florid personages who refuse to be classified by their professions ; for when their solid achievement is deducted , much fascinating human stuff remains to delight the biographer . The great Lord Mansfield ( such is the title on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race . In many ways he is the most imposing figure in the history of the English bench . He had a profound effect upon the development of law ; he held one or other of the great law offices for almost half a century ; and he dominated his colleagues as no other chief justice has ever done . But it is possible to disregard this technical side , and still find a wonderful figure of a man , a statesman , and a scholar . Lord Campbell devotes an unwilling chapter to the consideration of his decisions ; for , he says , to write of Mansfield and take no note of them would be like writing of Bacon with no hint of his philosophy , or of Marlborough without mention of hiswars . But there is much in Bacon besides philosophy , and the duke was more than a strategist , and the great lord chief justice may be profitably studied apart from his profession . Mansfield has been notoriously unfortunate in his biographers . The only professed Life is by the egregious Mr. Holliday , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent one of the most dull and inaccurate in the language . Lord Brougham has written a short sketch , and Lord Campbell has dealt with him , as with all the chief justices , in a spirit of warm and uncritical appreciation . But the materials for history are everywhere . No memoir-writer of the time neglects him , every anecdotist gives him his share , and his public life is written large in law reports and parliamentary journals . He was as bitterly hated as he was extravagantly admired , and Horace Walpole and Junius are careful to preserve this odium . He was the friend of Pope , and one of the few objects of Dr. Johnson 's respect . His long life extended from the days of Jacobitism to the French Revolution and the rise of Fox . He was Scots by birth and descent , and English by education , so the interest of two very different peoples has centred upon his career . In such an embarrassment of riches it is hard to pick and choose , and the proper biographer , when he arises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most notable figures at the eighteenth-century bar came from two classes : a Hardwicke and an Eldon from the English bourgeoisie ; a Mansfield , a Loughborough , and an Erskine from Scotch younger sons . In many ways the latter had the smaller chance of success . As a rule they were extremely poor , and they were without exception absurdly proud . In the end their perfervid genius and their northern wits carried them into power , but they had a hard path to travel . Of them all Mansfield had the easiest life . His was a nature born to success , // for his dinner , with a pair of brogues on his feet , posteriors exposed , and nothing on his legs . " But the family soon removed , for cheapness ' sake , to Comlongan , in Dumfriesshire , and Mr. William was boarded with a master at Perth . There exists an account of moneys expended on the boy , whereby it appears that a pair of boots for Mr. William cost ? 3 12s . Scots , and the cutting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of his profession . It was proposed to send him to St. Andrews ; again , the Scots bar was thought of ; but the advice of his elder brother prevailed , and he was put upon the foundation of Westminster School . This James Murray was in every way a remarkable man . Originally a Scots lawyer , he had en tered the House of Commons as member for the Elgin burghs , and immediately joined the High Tory party of Atterbury and Bolingbroke . At Queen Anne 's death he openly went over to the Stuarts , and lived for the rest of his long life as an outlaw , abroad . His master made him Earl of Dunbar , and he seems never to have wavered in his loyalty to the forlorn cause . He is said to have been at least as able as his younger brother , but in the petty intrigues of St. Germain and Avignon he found no field for his talents . His advice , so fortunate in its issue , had probably a pur , pose , for Westminster under Atterbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruit . At any rate , the boy gladly fell in with his plan . He did not take either of the orthodox routes to the south , by a smack from Leith or the weekly coach from the Black Bull in the Canongate to SL Martin 's he Grand , but set out for Perth on horseback , on the 15th of March , 1718 . At Queens-ferry the horse fell lame , and he had to walk into Edinburgh , where he bought his outfit . He visited his parents at Comlongan , and then , like Gil Blas , set off on his country-bred pony for the new world . It was a strange experience for the Perthshire boy , whose horizon had been bounded by the Edinburgh High Street and Mr. Martine 's Academy . The Bridge of Esk was his last sight of Scotland , for the lonely child who stared at the fortifications of Carlisle , and fancied London to be a compound of Rome and the New Jerusalem , was to make the strange country his own , and in a little time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old retainer of the Hurrays , and now a flourishing apothecary , received the ? traveler , sold his mount , bought him a sword , two wigs , and proper clothes , entered him with the head master of Westminster , and settled him at a dame 's in Dean Yard . Little is told of his schooldays . By dint of hot blood and a hard fist he fought his way to some standing among his schoolfellows . But he was always the industrious apprentice , working hard at his books , and excelling , we are told , in his declamations . Dr. Nicholl was his teacher , and Samuel Wesley , a brother of the great John , was an usher in the place . Atterbury , Bishop Smalridge , and Bentley used to examine the school at elections , and seem to have been taken with the young Murray . At any rate , in May , 1723 , his name appears first on the list of King 's scholars who were recommended for the foundation at Christ Church . Of his holidays we know little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invite him to her house , and doubtless there were other Scots families who showed kindness to the handsome boy . From Westminster he went to Oxford , the Oxford of the eighteenth century , a curious backwater of learning , where Robert Boyle was held a fine scholar and Bentley a charlatan , and the real business of life was port and prejudice in the common rooms , and , for undergraduates , high politics in the taverns . It would welcome gladly a young man of good Jacobite stock , the prot4g4 of Atterbury and the brother of Dunbar . But it is to Murray 's credit that he was wise enough to keep the place at arm 's length , for eighteenth-century Oxford was not a promising school for a strenuous man . He had the advantage of a clear aim , for about this time he filially chose the bar for his profession . Once he had thought of the Church ; but when he heard Talbot and Yorke in Westminster Hall , he felt , in ' the quaint Scots phrase , " called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich Lord Foley , he entered himself at Lincoln 's Inn , and began to keep his terms while still at Christ Church . For the rest , he lived like any other young man of quality , ? a little more studious , considerably poorer , but no recluse , and certainly no pedant . He professed liberal sentiments , like Lord Magnus Charters m Pendennis , and patronized the Dissenters in the most approved fashion of the High Tory , who hated parochial Whig-gory . His chief studies , we are told , were Aristotle and oratory , and the labors he went through to learn the theory of his future art fill a slack modern with despair . Not Demosthenes with his mouthful of pebbles was more painstaking than this boy , who translated Cicero into English , and back again into Latin , that he might get at the heart of his cadences . He wrote Latin prose with great ease and elegance , though his excursions in hexameters are as bad as may be . He won the prize for a poem on the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tribute to the wondrous worth , and Minerva and Phoebus to strew olive and laurel on the bier , of the cultured monarch whose simple creed was , " I hate all beets and bainters . " Pitt was his disappointed rival , and it is only fair to say that Pitt was , if possible , more absurd . Indeed , the only merit of the productions is that they have given occasion for some of Macaulay 's neatest sentences . " The Muses are earnestly entreated to weep over the urn of Caesar ; for Cesar , says the poet , loved the Muses . Caesar , who would not read a line of Pope , and who // loved nothing but punch and fat women ! " When he came to London , he took up his abode in a set of rooms in the Gatehouse Court of Lincoln 's Inn , which is now called Old Square . For three years he studied the law in his upper chamber , lighting his own fire of a morning ; but keeping his evenings for his friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great taverns , where busy men went for good talk and a good dinner : Button 's , where Addison dined , and sat late over his punch ; the Mitre , where Boswell met Johnson ; not to speak of Will 's and the . Grecian , the Covent Garden chop houses , the ordinaries in the city , and the superior clubs of St. James 's , The Temple was then the intellectual centre of London ; not , as now , a bare place , too far east for convenience , and hedged round and about with commerce . Great men had their rooms in the little streets off the Strand ; Lincoln 's Inn Fields was a superb and fashionable square , containing Betterton 's theatre and the Duke of Newcastle 's town house ; and , if the Embankment was a vile place , the Surrey shore was still unspoiled . The young Oxford scholar found himself in the thick of a very fascinating life . He had his severe hours of study , for Ire had the sense to revere his profession . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pupil rooms , and the common law was still imprisoned in a desert of black-letter learning . Murray planned out an elaborate course for himself in Roman law , international law , Scots law , real property ; but at the same time he was diligently at work on other things , as is shown by the extraordinary scheme of historical studies which he drew up for the young Duke of Portland . He took a short trip to the Continent , but he had no money to make the grand tour with which certain biographers have credited him . He could not afford to dispense with his industrious mornings , but must seek his pleasure in quieter paths . Through his kinsmen and friends , the Kinnoulls and 3Iarchmonts , he made his entry into polite society . Well-mannered , wellborn , with some Oxford reputation , and , as we are told , a very handsome and modest presence , Ire was welcomed by the little lords and great ladies who made up the fashion of the day . " Lord Mansfield , " Dr. Johnson once declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished at the university ; when he first came to town , he drank champagne with the wits ; he was the friend of Pope . " Pope , indeed , he had known at Westminster , and between the two a warm friendship sprang up . To Pope , the young Scot , with his good looks and " silver voice , " his talents and his frank hero worship , came as a relief from the oppressive smartness of the coffee houses . It was no one-sided attachment : if Murray went to Twickenham , Poise came to Lincoln 's Inn , and , as the story goes , used to coach his friend in the gestures of oratory . When Murray was called to the bar , in 1730 , he took chambers at No. 5 King 's Bench Walk , and there Pope was a constant visitor . The young barrister was no better off than others before and since . For two years he did nothing ; then he began to acquire seine practice in Scots appeals , but his name was " known and honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little seen in the Chancery and King 's Bench as , say , a minor parliamentniry junior of today . The ordinary myth is told of him as of every great lawyer , ? no practice , a chance brief , absence of his leader , a great opportunity , and then a boundless income ; and he is reported to have said , in his old age , that he " never knew the difference between poverty and ? 3000 a year . " The record of his practice , however , shows a slow and gradual advance ; there is no sudden dazzling leap , like Erskine 's , into fame ; and in three years , if he had a fair business , it was very re- 782 Lord Mansfield . stricted in kind . But those early years were full of varied activity . He worked hard at his profession ; he read widely ; he saw much society . He had the common Scots admiration for French writers , notably Voltaire , and to the end of his life he kept up a considerable scholarship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pleasing affection for his kinsfolk and his own land . His first earnings went to buy a tea service of silver and china for his sister-in-law , Lady Stormont , who had been in the habit of sending him Scotch marmalade ; and in his speech against the disfranchisement of Edinburgh , after the Porteous Riots , there is a ring of something more than vicarious forensic earnestness . Sometime in those years he committed the indiscretion of falling in love . Some have identified the lady with Lord Winchelsea 's daughter , Lady Elizabeth Finch , whom he afterwards married , and supposed that her family insisted only upon the postponement of the wedding till his fee book grew larger . I find it difficult to accept this view . Rather it seems to have been the one grand passion which Murray 's equable nature ever entertained , and it ended disastrously with the lady 's marriage to " lands in Kent and messuages in York , " and , for a time , the lover 's utter prostration . One summer was lost to him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Twickenham , to brood over the foppery of the world . It was not till the next Michaelmas term that he forgot his disappointment in his profession . One would give much to learn Chloe 's name , for no common charms could have overthrown so cold and placid a heart . Pope acted the part of the philosophic comforter , and , in imitation of Horace 's " Intermissa , Venus , diu , " implores the goddess to send her doves to No. 5 King 's Bench Walk , and bids the " smiling loves and young desires haunt the suburban cottage . Murray is " equal the injured to defend , To charm the mistress or to fin the friend . " I do not suppose that the mythological consolation went far , for the object had notably failed to charm one mistress ; but in an imitation of the famous " Nil admirari " Epistle there are some manly and comforting lines on his friend 's case . The poet discourses on the vanity of human wishes : ? " If not so pleased , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice ; From morn to night , at Senate , Rolls , and Ball , Plead much , read more , dine late or not at all . But wherefore all this labour , all this strife For fame , for riches , for a noble wife ? Shall one whom native learning , birth con-spired To form not to admire but be admired , Sigh while his Chloe , blind to wit and worth , Weds the rich dulness of some son of earth ! " It is the old consolation of philosophy , and the patient in time recovered . Still , we should like to know the truth of Murray 's one romance , and the name of the girl who conquered his austere heart . Did she become one of the hooped and powdered ladies of fashion , or was she learned like Lady Mary Wortley Montagu , or did she sink into a country shrew like Mrs. Hardcastle ? " Discord " and " a noble wife , " as in Addison 's case , were too often synonyms , and certainly there was no discord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his head , for he found himself in many notable cases , from some of which the scandal has scarcely yet departed . Such was the Cibber case , where a fashionable actress , wife of Colley Cibber 's son , and sister of Dr. Arne , the musician , paid the price of her gallantries . He was counsel for the English merchants in the famous affair of Captain Jenkins 's case , and he may have suggested to that perjured mariner the phrase which set England aflame , " I recommended my soul to God , and my cause to my country . " He declined silk , when Lord Hardwicke , at the Duke of Newcastle 's instance , made him the offer , and so he won the distinction of going direct from the junior bar to office . In all lie had a full and pleasing life : Chancery in the morning , the House of Lords in the afternoon ; and then running from the courts to routs and supper parties , and returning late to find some client like the Duchess Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said his clerk , " that she must be a lady of quality . " On the 20th of November , 1738 , he married his Lady Elizabeth , gaining the double benefit of an exemplary wife and a father - in - law in the Cabinet . They took a house in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , that fashionable neighborhood , and began to entertain . And with it all the busy counsel had leisure for common human courtesies . He would write long and kind epistles to his friends in Scotland , Grant of Pvestongrange and Lord Milton , and there is a very admirable letter of consolation to one Mr. Booth , an unsuccessful conveyancer . In 1742 , after resisting all unofficial invitations to politics , he was made solicitor-general , and soon afterward entered Parliament for Boroughbridge . At the same time , at a meeting of the council of Lincoln 's Inn , it was ordered that " the Hon. William Murray Esquire , His Majesty 's Solicitor-General , be invited to the Bench of this Society . " He was now thirty-seven years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is safe to say that the Mansfield we know was the Murray who became Mr. Solicitor . In a sense he came to perfection early ; for , if his fame rests on the work of his mature years , the conditions of fame had already been prepared to the full . So we may leave an awkward chronological narrative for a study of the man , the finished product , in his many aspects . But we may note , in passing , that the years of his elevation saw the last of that brilliant figure who had been the friend of his youth . Pope died in 1744 , having appointed Murray his executor , and leaving bins as remembrances two marble heads and a picture for his own trust . A few days before his death lie had been carried , at his own request , from Twickenham to Lincoln 's Inn Fields , and Bolingbroke and Warburton had been of the company . A curious dinner party indeed , ? a young lawyer with his life before him , a pragmatic doctor , a genius who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn-out poet ! The attorney-generalship was reached in 1754 , and two years later came the chief-justiceship of the King 's Bench and a peerage . He might have had the woolsack several times for the asking , and on at least one occasion a word would have made him Prime Minister . But he had the wisdom to gauge his powers well ; he knew himself born for a good judge , but as signally unfit for a great minister . Not that he did not take his full share of politics . Few lawyers have been so prominent as statesmen ; as solicitor , he virtually led the House of Commons for twelve years , he sat in many Cabinets , and he was pitted against Chatham in the Lords as the most formidable of the Tories . But Ile was never the professional statesman ; merely a great judge with a talent for statecraft , who came for relaxation from the bench to the senate house . We do not propose to attempt to do justice to his judicial work , in these pages ' . Sufficient that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke , once and for all , the old black-letter chain which Coke had riveted . It became the fashion among his successors , as it was certainly the fashion among his weaker rivals , to declare that , like necessity , he knew no law , and that he introduced an evil experimental habit into the profession ; and the great name of Lord Eldon has lent itself to the charge . We do not deny the habit . His advice to a colonial governor ? " Give no reason for your decisions , fur they are sure to be right , while your reasons are sure to be wrong " ? was an index to a consistent habit of mind . He strove to the best of his power to do away with the forms which hampered justice , and it is small wonder if the mild black beetles of the courts hated bite , when they found their occupation gone . We are told that he would lie back in his chair yawning , or write letters , or read the newspaper , when some confused serjeant prosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when policy or humanity demanded it , he could be formal and technical enough , as in his judgment in the Wilkes case , or in his curious direction to the jury in the case of a priest accused of celebrating mass . But generally he strove after simplicity and common sense , interpreting the letter of the law with a freedom and fairness uncommon among his contemporaries . A list of his decisions would be meaningless , but we are told that he so impressed his colleagues that there was rarely a dissenting voice . Two branches of his work deserve special mention . He took the principal part in the disposing of Scotch appeals in the Lords , and in the Duntreath case he " struck off the fetters of half the entailed estates in Scotland . " In commercial cases , again , he found a field awaiting the hand of the reformer , and by his judgments in the Guildhall sittings he created English commercial law , and conferi:ed an incalculable benefit on English trade . And all his work ? such is the report of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industrious lawyer 's chief reward . To have a branch of knowledge which in no way fills the whole of life or infringes upon pleasure , yet at the same time grows daily in bulk , till the law is no formless bludgeon , but a keen sword in a ready hand , is the final triumph of the profession . Of this Mansfield is a conspicuous instance , and what has been said of Weir of Hermiston may be written of him : " He tasted deeply of recondite pleasures . To be wholly devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded in life ; and perhaps only in law and the higher mathematics may this devotion be maintained , suffice to itself without reaction , and find continual rewards without excitement . " On the legal side we have the materials for judgment , but on his wit and scholarship we must take our opinions from others . Nothing is so tantalizing , and yet so permanent , as a reputation for esprit . Every one believes Charles Townshend a wit of the first order , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not suppose Mansfield to have been a classical scholar of the stamp of Carteret , but Its hail the respectable stock in trade of an industrious Oxford man ; and we are told that once , in his extreme old age , he defended the use of a Greek word in Burke by quoting offhand a long passage from Demosthenes . In history , on the other hand , and especially in the history of law , few of his contemporaries approached him . Burke had the same synoptic view , the same catholic breadth of knowledge , but Mansfield had the more exact and critical scholarship . Had the law treatises , memoirs , and essays , which perished in the Gordon Riots , survived till our own day , he might have shared with Bacon the fame of a great lawyer who was also a great seeker . " But ages yet to come shall mourn the burning of his own , " Cowper sang ; and we desire to mourn with the ages . He was not a patron in the eighteenth-century sense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he has the supreme merit of discovering Blackstone . It was at his advice that Blackstone settled in Oxford , and the Vincrian Professorship , and indirectly the Commentaries , were the result . So much for learning . But there is also a tradition of extraordinary wit and vivacity in conversation , a social tact which made him the finest of hosts and the most engaging companion . It is possible that the tradition has been overdone . Seward , who has a scent like Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff 's for any sort of mot , has only a few flimsy jokes to record , and Horace Walpole , who was ever tender to a hint of brilliance , will have none of Mansfield 's . In contrasting him with Fox and Pitt , Walpole declares that they had wit in their speeches , though not in conversation , but Murray neither in one nor the other . We tied a few sayings in court quoted , wonderfully few , and by no means good , of which the best is the advice to a counsel : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was too fluent and copious for the parsimony of language which is the basis of wit . But the word has many meanings , and if grace of manner and an extraordinary knowledge of men be a form of it , then Mansfield had it in abundance . His courtesy and ready kindness delighted the world , and contemporary memoirs ( except Horace Walpole 's ) abound in praises of the lord chief justice in society . He had the freshness of spirit which men of his balanced and capable type carry often far into old age , and his favorite toast of " Young Friends and Old Books " is an epitome of his art of life . From Lincoln 's Inn Fields the family moved to a great house in Bloomsbury Square , of which more hereafter . About the same time they seem to have bought the charming little estate of Caen Wood , on the slopes of Highgate , and there , after his retirement from the King 's Bench , Mansfield spent his days . Only in these mellow autumn years have we any picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brilliant figure , muds hated and widely feared , but in the purple and splendor of his public appearances we lose sight of one aspect , and that the most pleasing . He was very clannish , like all his countrymen , and when the little Murrays , Lord Henderland 's children , came to Westminster School , he would have them out to Highgate on holidays , and tell them old stories of his boyhood , ? how he had seen a man who had been at the execution of Charles I. , and how at school he had boiled a plum pudding in his nightcap . He took immense pains to have his peerage given the proper remainder , for he had a Scots pride in founding a great family . But if he had a warm heart for his family , he had also a long memory for his friends . Lord Foley had been kind to him at Oxford , and so , when a rising junior and a young man much sought after in society , he used continually to isolate himself , from Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobleman , who had become very fussy and exacting . Once he was asked the reason of it all . " It is enough , " he replied . " if I contribute by my visits to the entertainment of my fast friends . " At Caen Wood he had often parties of King 's Bench lawyers down for the day , who would tell him the gossip of the courts and Lord Kenyon 's latest misquotation , while he would recite passages from Pope , or take their advice on landscape gardening , or repeat to them , under his beech trees , " 0 Melibcce , Deus nobis hale otia tacit . " He had always looked forward to this old age of leisure ; for we are told that when in the thick of his work he used to talk of the dace far niente , and quote , " Libor esse mild non videtur , qui non aliquando nihil agit . " His dinners be-came famous in the town . Abstemious himself , ? his only love was claret , and Heaven knows how many hogsheads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like many temper-ate men , loved hilarity . His eulogists dilate on the charm of his conversation . " He was ever as ready to hear as to deliver an opinion , " says one . " I can-not recollect the time , " says another , " when , sitting at table with Lord Mans-field , I ever failed to remark that happy and engaging art which he possessed of 786 Lord Mansfield . putting the company in a good humor with themselves . I am convinced that they liked him the more for his seeming to like them so well . " And then they conclude , one and all , with that quaint eighteenth-century phrase which means so much , " He was a sincere Christian , without bigotry or hypocrisy . " Much of this , to be sure , was due to endowments which are not necessarily Christian , ? his voice and his superb presence . From the Vanloo , painted when he was twenty-eight , to the great Reynolds , which represents him in the robes of the chief justice , we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Reynolds saw him , in his regal old age , the bench can have witnessed no nobler figure of a man . If race means anything , it is here in its perfection . The arch of the brows , the keen , invincible eyes , the leonine cast of the head , and , above all , the mouth , tart , humorous , infinitely wise , make the figure a kind of archetype , the Lord Chief Justice for all time . And his voice matched with his presence . By all accounts , it was singularly clear and sweet and penetrating , with the liquid , silvery tone found in some women 's voices . He spoke with great slowness and distinctness , giving each syllable its full quality , but it is pleasant to learn that to the last lie pronounced some words broadly , more Boreati . It was right that Westminster and Oxford should not wholly drive out the old idiom of the Perth grammar school . He said " brid " for " bread , " we are told , and " reg'ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call upon " Mr. Soleester . " This was displeasing to a purist like Chief Justice Willes , whose attack upon Mansfield 's voice is curious in its isolation . " He was cursed , " he wrote , " with a loud , clamorous monotony , and a disagreeable discordance in his accents , as struck so harsh upon the ear that he seemed rather to scream than to plead ; and from thence was called Orator Strix ' or the ' Caledonian Screecher . ' " But Dr. Johnson , who did not love a Scots accent , having many odd pronunciations of Ws own , was captivated by his " sweetness , " and the testimony of the world gave lam the epithet of " silver-tongued , " as it afterwards gave it to Erskine . But the real man behind all this external charm is the true object of interest . His character and intellect were so fully revealed during his long career that there is small divergence in men 's judgments . Certain broad qualities are universally granted , certain obvious faults censured . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily answered by an appeal to fact . The truth is that he is a more puzzling figure than the world will readily admit . Men love a garish , high-colored sketch , and history , generally speaking , is intolerant of niceties . We are told that Mansfield subordinated all things to personal ambition ; that he lost in heart what he gained in intellect ; that he had no moral courage ; that he was the polished , capable man of the world , a high product of a bloodless age . Such a criticism deserves a word ; for though it has truth it needs much explanation , and taken baldly it leads to an estimate which is radically unjust . " The condemnation which a great man lays upon the world , " Hegel has written , " is to force it to explain him ; " and the saying is true of other , s than the philosopher . The common accusation is that lie was without moral courage , a sun worshiper who frankly loved the easy path and the sweet things of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cowardice was an intricate quality , curiously bound up with his virtues . Certain antagonisms were so hateful to him that he shrank from open conflict . The Junius affair is a case in point . The master of invective who used the bludgeon was an opponent difficult to meet for one whose weapon was the rapier . In the libel actions he maintained // honestly a real point of view , but he was obviously ill at ease , and in the altercation with Lord Camden which followed he seems to have deserved Horace Walpole 's abuse . Unpopularity , so long as it was confined to paper and spoken words , seems to have given him acute uneasiness , and ho was apt to make an unworthy peace with his adversary . Camden , who was far from his intellectual equal , won several victories in debate from this curious sensitive complaisance of his rival . Sometimes it would seem that he felt himself standing on a razor edge , his early Jacobitism , his Scots birth , his professional hauteur , raising a host against him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , to the delight of the baser sort . On the other band , he could on occasions show himself independent enough . On the bench he might often have won an easy popularity , but he remained true to his own ideals of equity and toleration . He was for religious equality , when it was the most forlorn of causes ; and if he was a loyal Tory , he could speak against his party and Ilia interest . In 1700 he attacked the Prerogative on the question of the Order in Council which laid an embargo on corn , though his primary motive may have been his lawyer 's constitutionalism ; but in 1770 he was the chief agent in carrying George Grenville 's Controverted Elections Bill , which from the High Tory point of view was a piece of unleavened radicalism . The truth is that he paid the penalty of the affection of Isis friends . A hatred of the unpleasant , a love for easy ways , grew upon him till it became second nature , and the cause must be urgent indeed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of courage he had more than his share . By universal consent he was perfectly cool and fearless in the presence of physical danger . In the deplorable affair of the Gordon Riots , his is one of the few characters which emerge with any credit . He had shown himself an unflinching foe of the intolerable rant which sometimes calls itself Protestant , and when he arrived in Par1i:fluent Street , on that fateful day , he was recognized and attacked by the snob . His coachman managed to force his way to the door of the house , but the carriage windows were shivered , and Mansfield 's gown and wig were almost pulled to pieces . Thorlow was ill , and Mansfield took his place on the woolsack , " with calm dignity , " says Lord Campbell ; " quivering like an aspen , " the Duke of Gloucester told Horace Walpole . It would have been difficult for an old man who had just escaped murder to show an untroubled face , however stout his heart might be . The scene must have been the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beheld : Lord Hillborough and Lord Stormont with black eyes , the Archbishop of York with his lawn sleeves gone , the Duke of Newcastle in rags , and most of the others with mud-bespattered faces and wigs awry , and all crying out twenty different words of advice ; and then the sudden entry of Lord Mountfort , with a face like is ghost , and the report that Lord Boston was even then being torn in pieces . Mansfield did his best to restore order and proceed with the business of the day ; but when the Duke of Richmond proposed a sortie he was ready to go first , carrying the mace . At the end of the sitting he was left alone , and we are told that , after drinking tea in his private room , he drove quietly home in a momentary lull of the riot . On Tuesday , the Otis of June , 1780 , the mob attacked the house in Bloomsbury Square . He had received warning , but in a spirit of commendable tolerance he refused to have soldiers keeping guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be more seriously inflamed . He trusted to the reverence traditionally shown to the English justices ; but he had underrated Protestant zeal . When the rioters battered at his door , be escaped with his wife by a back passage . Then , for a little , anarchy was triumphant . Books , pictures , and furniture were burned in a bonfire on the pavement ; the cellars were pillaged , and the miscreants grow drunk on the chief justice 's claret ; soon the flames reached the house , and in the morning nothing remained but a blackened shell . It is impossible to overestimate the gravity of the misfortune to a man of Mansfield 's nature . He had taken much pride in his career , and lie had filled his house with remembrances . But now his own diaries , the books in which Pope and Bolingbroke had written their names , his pictures , busts , and prints , his rare and curious furniture , all had perished utterly . He had founded a family , but the heirlooms were gone which he had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to his past , it most have seemed as if he stood again bare and isolated in the world , beggared of the fruits of his life 's work . The town sympathized with his misfortune , and for once there is no word spoken on his conduct but the highest praise . When he took his seat on the bench , he was received , we are told , " with a reverential silence more affecting than the most eloquent address . " He rejected with dignity all proposals of compensation , and when he presided at the trial of Lord George Gordon he showed not a trace of prejudice or resentment . Once only he referred indirectly to his loss . He defended the strong measures taken by the government in quelling the riots . " I will give you my reasons within as short a compass as possible . I have not consulted books ; indeed , I have no books to consult . " His intellect was so many-sided and masterful that his contemporaries , in trying to describe it , fell into a conventional grandiloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no talent in a colossal degree ; but he had all , or nearly all , in some proportion , and the whole was harmoniously compounded . His mind was clear and penetrating ; all faculties at his command for use , and none blunted by years or routine . He attained to that perfect consciousness of power and ready facility which is the highest pleasure in life . For all his industry and his learning , there is never a hint of stress about him . After a long day in the courts , he turns to Horace or He Thou or the salons of St. James 's with an unfailing alacrity of spirit . Nimble , keen , subtle , unwearied , ? if these be not characteristic of supreme genius , they at least denote a perfect talent . It is the perfection of the legal talent , a lawyer being rather an interpreter than a leader ; mediocrity , if you like , but of the alcrea mediocritas stamp . His principles and opinions illustrate the curious equipoise of his character . He had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his youth , and was matured into the constitutionalism which detested the vagaries of Chatham , and saw in the French Revolution the last word of anarchy . But he had a kind of political rationalism , which led him sometimes to the most pronounced liberal views , and made him the foe of religious disabilities and the advocate of free trade . A little of the Bute type of High Tory , a little of the French intellectuel , and something of the enlightened critical man of affairs made up his political character . As a biographer neatly puts it , Precedent and Principle were always at war within him . He had much kinship with one side of the Whigs , and no real affinity with the reactionary and corrupt elements in his own party . But for the demagogues who followed Wilkes he had all the scorn of a scholar and an aristocrat . To him the voice of the people was an unintelligible patois , and not to be identified with the voice of God . It is not hard to explain the various antipathies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had no part in the Whig family circle . Chatham found him a formalist too able to despise and too logical to refute . But to men so different as Montesquieu and Burke he seemed wholly admirable , ? the founder of scientific jurisprudence , a scholar among pedants . On one sub-ject all our authorities agree , ? his ex-traordinary eloquence . Horace Walpole is frankly eulogistic . He compares him with Chatham and the elder Fox , and calls him " the brightest genius of the three , " whose figure was " engaging , from a decent openness . " His own crit-icism is that he " refined too much , and could wrangle too little , for a popular assembly . " It is hard to realize the proper effect of eighteenth-century ora-tory . We have lost the atmosphere of pageant and ceremony , of scholarship and abundant leisure . In reading Mans-field 's great speeches , we find neither the fire and passion and broken lights of imagination which we have in Chat-ham , nor the cosmic philosophy of Burke , nor the exquisite terseness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pla-cid , like the man ; but the matter is al-ways impressive , and there is much to admire in the lithe vigor and ease of the diction . We can readily understand how , spoken by one of his voice and pre-sence , it seemed the height of eloquence to an older school which thought Chat-ham a play actor and Burke an Irish madman . And so his character stands as some-thing polished and complete , the ' ' four square man " that Simonides spoke of . But this perfection , if it has few flaws , has its limitations , as his enemies were ready to perceive . The chief charge is the expected one of a radical coldness of heart . Here , again , while admitting truth in the accusation , we must protest against the ordinary acceptation of the ward . He could be very kind , and he could form the warmest friendships ; and if any one doubts this , let him read his correspondence in 1782 with the Bishop of Bristol , when the two old men , friends from youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as well beloved by young Inca , as his relations with Erskine bear witness . The great instance cited against him is his conduct on that memorable clay when Chatham fell dying on the floor of the House of Lords . The incident is told in a letter of Lord Camden to the Duke of Grafton : " Many crowding about the earl to observe his countenance , all affected , most part really concerned ; and even those who might have felt a secret pleasure at the accident yet put on the appearance of distress , excepting the Earl of M. , who sat still , almost as much unmoved as the senseless body itself . " Now who was this " Earl of M. " ? It has been generally held to refer to Mansfield , but Lord Brougham insisted that it was Lord MarcInnont . Marchmont was the only other Earl of M. present ; he belonged to the straitest sect of the " King 's friends , " and he had always been in opposition to Chatham . It is impossible to decide the question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of generosity in Mansfield 's conduct ; for when the question of the annuity to the Chatham title came before the Lords , he listened to the virulent attacks of the court party in silence , and uttered no word in praise of his dead rival . This antagonism of the two was a conflict of permanent types , and the most significant commentary on Mansfield 's limitations . The one , with all his high-heeled strutting and histrionic stuff , had just that generous warmth of feeling and that sudden lightning fire of genius which were foreign , and indeed incomprehen-sible , to the bland and capable intelli-gence of the other . Mansfield was the safer captain for ordinary weather , but Chatham the pilot for the storm . The one was a great and brilliant man of af-fairs , while the other was the fiery spirit fighting its way in crudeness and hyste-ria and splendor to a kind of immortal-ity . He discovered the " great people " 790 Lord Mansfield . behind the fanatics and the placemen , and he worked for his clientele . But Mansfield was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished product of a highly civilized world , one with " no strife nor no sedition in his powers , " and secure and happy in this tranquillity . He is , indeed , the most un-northern of all great Scots ; for , compared to him , Hume was perfervid , and Dundas an enthusiast . He suffered , in fact , for his birthplace ; for he was attacked by the press as a " termagant Scot , " who had " emerged from his native wealds , rocky caverns , and mountainous heights pretty early in life , to veneer over a Scotch education with a little English erudition . " The critic talks of his nature as " rugged and full of pauper pride and native insolence , " which Heaven knows it never was . Lovat had foreseen this danger ahead of " his cousin Murray . " " Mr. Solicitor , " he said at the trial , " is a great man , and he will meet with high promotion if he is not too far north . " But Mr. Solicitor was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with Lovat , he was a southron of the southrons . Except for a suspicion of an accent , he might never have ventured beyond the world of St. James 's . ' the trial of Lovat has , indeed , a curious interest ; for . if Chatham was Mansfield 's extreme opposite in temperament , Lovat was his counterpart in racial character . Shaggy , barbarous , steeped in vices , and yet with a wild subtlety and poetry in his extraordinary brain , he was the type of the back world of Scotland , ? that old , cruel , foolish world of mists and blood , of crazy beliefs and impossible loyalties . The splendid chief justice knew nothing of it , and in this ignorance he gained success , but lost an indefinable something which his birth should have given him ; for we must confess that he was a little insensible to the warmth of common humanity . From the day when he rode his shelty over the Bridge of Esk he never returned to his own country . He never saw his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of his boyhood . Lord Campbell , in a passage which makes one respect the honest soul , dwells on the pathos and joys of such a home-coming , and quotes Captain Morris 's lines : But to Mansfield all this was a sealed book . Somewhere in the race for honors he had lost this old sentiment , though he retained his family pride and a lingering affection for his race . It ie4scarcely a defect , but it is part of his great limitation , which we may call a lack of soul . Heartless he was not , for he was kind above the average , but in his very freedom from the prejudices of the crowd he fell short of the prejudice which is also wisdom . It is the old complaint against the entirely rational and clear-sighted man that , in his unbroken march , he misses the wayside virtues which fall to the blind and feeble .
