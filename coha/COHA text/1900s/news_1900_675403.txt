txt What might have proved a serious fire at the Casino last night was prevented by- the presence of mind of David Abrahams , Miss Kittle Mitchell , - and Miss Clara Havel , of the " Little Red Riding Hood " Company . As it was. : enough damage was done to prevent a performance , and Misses Mitchell and Havel were painfully , though not seriously , burned . There was little or no excitement in the auditorium . A few minutes before . the time for the raising of the curtain Misses . Mitchell and Havel , assisted by Miss Mary Horton. their maid , were applying the finishing touches to their make-up in a dressing room near the proscenium box-on the right hand side of the stage . To do this they used an alcohol lamp for the purpose of heating curling . irons and melting wax . The latter caused the alcohol flame to flare up and same drapery and bunting were ignited . While Miss Horton was dispatched for assistance , Misses Mitchell and Havel grabbed the burning material , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their injuries will not prevent their appearance today . Mr. Abrahams was talking to Miss Madge Lessing , who occupied the adjoining dressing room , when Miss Horton , very much I frightened , appeared before them . Mr. Abrahams was made up as a cat at the time , and he showed feline agility in rushing to the aid of Misses Mitchell and Havel . Meanwhile some of the stage hands learned of the trouble , and at least two of them lost their heads . One ran into the street and sent in a fire alarm , while the other set all the automatic sprinklers behind the footlights in operation , with the result of deluging all the chorus girls and other members of the cast who were awaiting . the curtain call . This caused the liveliest kind of a stampede . Many of the members of the chorus grabbed such of their street clothes as they could hastily gather and made for the street . Some ran to the Parker House , others took cabs for their homes , while two of them ran into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile the firemen had arrived and promptly extinguished the blaze with slight loss . While the excitement on the stage was at its height Manager George W. Lederer , who had learned of the trouble , went in front of the curtain and said that owing to a slight accident the opening of the performance would be delayed for a few minutes . Then ha instructed Fred .1 . Eustice , leader of the orchestra , to do his best to entertain the audience . The fire out , Mr. Lederer and his stage manager sought to collect the scattered members of the company . Many were miesing , and those on the stage and in the dressing rooms were drenched and absolutely refused to " go on " Then Mr. Lederer discovered that many of the costumes used in other acts were also wet through and could not be used . Mr. Lederer then went before the curtain again , and after explaining what had happened told his listeners to go to the box office and get either their money back or tickets for Some otheyalate . The audience quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty . Manager Lederer said there would be the usual matinee this ' afternoon . The damage by fire will not exceed $100 , but the loss by water will reach at least $2,500 . Misses ? Mitchell and Havel had their injuries dressed by Dr. Frauenthal of 1,402 Broadway , and were taken home . The firemen and the members of the company warmly commended them for their efforts . " Of course . I was frightened , " said Miss Mitchell to a reporter . " You would have been , too . if you had seen how the flames ran up the wall . But Miss Havel and I pulled the draperies down , and it is a godsend that our costumes did not ignite . Yes , my arm pains me , but I guess it will soon be all right . Mr. Abrahams was of great help to us , and , do you know , I really believe he fainted after all was over . I did not suppose that men fainted , did you ? I thought that was only a woman 's privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly , " remarked Mr. Abrahams , " but the smudge and smoke annoyed me terribly , and I was somewhat overcome . I soon recovered after getting into the open air . " " Some one closed the door of my dressing room . " asserted Miss Carrie Glover , who is a sister of Amelia Glover , the dancer , and a sister-in-law of Henry E. Dixey . " Miss Fannie Dudley and I occupied the same room , and some mean thing shut us in and I tried to keep us there . But when we saw the smoke we wet some- towels , and , placing them about our faces , fought our way out and reached the caf ? by means of the iron stairway . " " Really , there was no cause for alarm , " Manager Lederer insisted . The dressing rooms are zinc lined and practically fireproof . Ent for the fact that the costumes were saturated with water from the sprinklers , a performance could have been given . I am glad there was no panic in the audience , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Havel behaved splendidly , and I am very sorry that they sustained painful burns . , Although some damage was done to cos't tumes and scenery under the stage , the incident demonstrated the worth of our automatte sprinklers .
