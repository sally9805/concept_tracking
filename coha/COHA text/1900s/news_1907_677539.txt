txt After a morning spent in legal argilment over the admission of the affidavit made in Abraham Hummel 's office by Evelyn Nesbit , it was decided yesterday by the counsel engaged in the trial of Harry K. Thaw for the murder of Stanford White that the final decision of the matter must wait upon the testimony of the allenists summoned for the People . Mr. Delmas announced that be would call Mrs. Harry Thaw once more to the stand , to swear that when she saw HumMel it was as a client consulting a lawyer in a professional manner . Mr. Jerome had six experts to call , many of whom had found it difficult to get away from the institutions aver which they presided , and he asked that he might be allowed to put his hypothetical question to them at the beginning of yesterday afternoon 's session . Permission was granted , and , with Dr. Austin Flint upon the stand , he read , first , the hypothetical question framed by the defense , and theli his own version of the facts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a perfect description of the case there was anything which would enable him to say Thaw was insane . It took about an hour and a half for Mr. Garvan to read the People 's question . It gave a complete summary of all the facts of the case , and at Its conclusion Dr. Flint declared that it showed that , in his opinion as a scientist , Thaw at the time of the shooting was in a condition to know the quality of his act and to distinguish between right and wrong . The experts summoned by Mr. Jerome in addition to Dr. Austin Flint , Dr. Carlos F. , and Dr. William Mabon , who have been in attendance ever since the trial began , were Dr. William Hirsch , Cornell Medical School , New York ; Dr. William Pritchard , New York Polyclinic Hospital ; Dr. Allen Ross Diffendort Superintendent of the Connecticut State Hospital for the Insane , Middletown . Conn. ; Dr. Albert Warren Ferris . College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York , and Dr. Allan Hamilton . Special interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained in the first instance br the defense , and has always been understood to have strong views upon the mental condition of the defendant at the time he saw him in the Tombs last Summer . He was not put on the stand by the defense . Neither he nor Dr. Carlos was sworn yesterday , and Mr. Jerome would not inform Mr. Deimos why he was keeping them in reserve . It is surmised that the District Attorney is saving them for the answer of the People to the sur-rebuttal of the defense , if there is any need of them . Fight When Hammel Is Called . As soon as the court opened Abraham Hummel was called to the stand , but his part was very little more than a thinking one In the legal drama which was played before him . He sat on the chair by the Justice 's side , plainly interested in the arguments of the District Attorney and Mr. Dermas . He lay back with his eyes half closed and one foot crossed over the other watching closely the moves of counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White 's description of him as the smartest lawyer in New York was read he looked up at the ceiling and smiled , and he turned not a hair as Mr. Delmas took him to task as a lawyer in answering a doubtful , question without giving him a chance to object . He enjoyed his position , and , i apparently careless as to whether he was permitted to give evidence or not , took in all the points of the game . It was a keenly contested fight that he witnessed . Mr. Delmas took up the purely technical side of the argument , which Mr. Jerome had directed to the court on Wednesday . He began by putting to one side the question whether Evelyn Nesbit was consulting Hummel as her lawyer , and that , therefore , professional privilege debarred him from revealing the conversation , and directly attacked Mr. Jerome 's authorities for his method of impeaching the credibility of a witness . In passing he objected to " that burst of passion , rhetorically calculated , it would seem , to enlighten the judicial mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent men sitting in th box repeatedly admonished by your Honor to pay no attention to any statement except it was In evidence , would not in any degree he influenced by the unsworn , unsupported statement of an impassionate advocate . " Then he proceeded to argue that Mr. Jerome , In quoting a decision of the Supreme Court , gave it precisely an opposite meaning from that It properly bore . He maintained that only those parts of the Hummel affidavit which bore directly upon the statements made by Evelyn Nesbit might be put in evidence , and that consequently all those passages which told of the alleged ill-treatment by Thaw could not be admitted . Then with an elaborate apology for his own lack of familiarity with the practice of the New York courts , he argued from his California experience that , since he found some parts of the question put by Mr. Jerome were objectionable , he might object to the whole . However , to bring himself within the law of the State without doubt , he proceeded to analyze the question put by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Thaw having beaten Evelyn Nesbit in order to make her sign allegations against Stanford White . He reduced the question to an inquiry whether she had told Thaw it was ncl true that White had drugged her , and declared most formally that he would assume the responsibility for his colleagues of allowing this question to be asked . Mr. Jerome was out of'the court when tit finished , but a careful note of this offer was taken by Mr. Garvan . The decision of the court was briefly // DR . MT DECLARES THAW WAS SANE // stated . " The cases cited are not authorities on the proposition presented : The objection must be sustained , " said Justice Fitzgerald . Hummel Gets Answer In . Mr. Jerome was taken aback by this . He had quoted case after case in support of his claim . It was with an effort that he pulled himself tog-ether to ask the witness what he might . " At the interview in your office on Oct. 27 .. 1903 , did Evelyn Nesbit , prior to your dictating anything , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Stanford White had drugged her ? " " She certainly did , " replied Mr. Hummel promptly . Mr. Delmas sprang to his feet . ' ? Do you say you are a lawyer ? " he called to the witrieSs . Mr. Hummel smiled and Mr. Jerome replied , hotly : Will you please address the court ? I am informed by my assistant that you substantially admitted the question might be answered . " " I submit , " said Mr. Delmas , " that I expressly reserved the righe of objecting upon the question Of privilege . Did not the learned District Attorney 's assistant hear me ? " Mr. Jerome protested against Mr. Delmas 's tactics and the court 's recent decision . " I submit . Sir , that if the learned gentleman would address the court rather than the learned District Attorney and his learned assistants we should proceed more courteously and in order . I confess that the ruling of the court after the le vestigation I have made of the authorities is so absolutely and completely a surprise to me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain amount of consideration , " said Mr. Delmas in his moot finished accents . " In view of the painful position in which the learned District Attorney finds Trims elf I will refrain from ascribing to him virtues which seem to be so scornfully rejected . However , the question and answer are in . Let them stand . " A discussion arose about what exactly it was which the Justice had ruled Mr. Jerome must not ask . The question , as first proposed , stated that Thaw wanted to send White to the penitentiary ; that he had tried to force Evelyn Nesbit to sign a document attacking White , and that she had told Thaw that none of her allegations against White was true . As it was read over and over again Mr. Delmas became uneasy at its effect upon the jury and protested against its repetition . Court 's Ruling Modified . However , the argument went on , and the Justice declared that in ruling against the question he had only meant that it contained a few matters which were objectionable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , and Mr. Jerome might ask it . This view of the ruling of the court dismayed Mr. Delmas . It was clear that the People were gaining by piecemeal a great deal of the ground which , they had lost at one swoop . Mr. Delmas argued vigorously and earnestly , but the Judge sent for some of the authorities which Mr. Jerome had cited , and declared that the original question , with all its allegations , was unobjectionable if the District Attorney would omit the one statement that Evelyn Nesbit had told her story to Hummel " prior to any dictation . " Then Mr. Delmas shifted his ground . He fell back upon the double defense that the testimony of Evelyn Nesbit Thaw was not supposed to recite facts historically true , but merely dealt with her conversations with Thaw , and that , in the second place , whatever she confided to Hummel was under the seal of professional privilege . Mr. Jerome replied that It wag clear that Mrs. Thaw 's evidence went ' a ... good deal further than merely relating her conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege as a sword and a shield at the same time , " he declared . " She has testified about these fasts in both direct examination and cross-examination . The privilege , if there ever was one . Is gone . " To clear this matter up ft was agreed that the defense should summon Mrs. Thaw again . Only she could say if sh% had retained Hummel as her counsel andpaid him a regular fee , and Justice Fitzgerald . ' though he was loath to do so . consented to interrrupt the examination of Hummel to have her appear again . " There have bean a food many departures in this trial , ' ne said , from established rule . But I understand It is the wish of the defense that Mrs. Thaw be hoard before I rule on the question of professional privilege , and I shall allow her evidence . " The adjournment for the lunch recess was then agreed upon , but , as it was made , Mr. Jerome raised a breeze . " One of the lawyers for the defense , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which is the witness to be called . " " Is it the practice of the Atlantic Coast to forbid witnesses to talk to counsel ? " asked Mr. Deimas . " May I ask that this witness be cautioned against communicating with anyone during recess ? " persisted Mr. Jerome . " There is no other witness before me except the one on the stand . " said Justice Fitzgerald , looking at Mr. Hummel . " Recess tilt 2 o'clock . " Knew He Was Doing Wrong . For the convenience of what Mr. Del-1 nts ' characterized as " the equeelron or platoon of experts " summoned for the People , it u as decided to adjourn the examination of Mr. Hummel , and the con-1 sequent recalling of Mrs. Evelyn Nesbit Thaw , until they had answered the hypothetical question drawn up by Mr. , Jerome . The six allenists to be examined were at once sworn and Dr. Austin Flint Ras placed upon the stand . Printed copies of the People 's question were handed to the others . It formed a small volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formal questions about his qualifications as an expert and was then asked the hypothetical question which had been put by the defense to Dr. Evans and Dr. Wagner . He declared that from the facts therein contained he was of opinion that at the time of the shooting the defendant knee that he was doing wrong . Then came the People 's hypothesis . It was read by Mr. Garvan and occupied about an hour and a half . In the middle a recess was taken for a few minutes , but the witness resumed the stand immediately the court reassembled . It recited in chronological order practically all the evidence given during the case . Wherever possible the actual words of the witnesses were used , and the only things omitted were the exhibits , the will , codicil , and letters of Thaw . The witness had examined these before . When it was finished , once more Dr. Flint was asked if from all these facts he would gather that at the time of the shooting Thaw was capable of knowing the quality of his act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an adjournment before he began his Cross-examination , on thesground that the hypothetical question was only a partial statement of the case and that he wished to add something to it . It was , he said , impossible for him to cross-examine upon 39 printed pages offhand , and he must ask the indulgence of the court . The trial was then adjourned until 10:30 o'clock this morning . JEROME 'S LONG QUESTION . Careful Review of the Whole Case in a Query for the Experts . The hypothetical question prepared by the District Attorney assumes in the first place that the witness is familiar with all the . principal exhibits in the case . Wthout reciting them , - it asks that he shall take into consideration the letters which Thaw wrote to his lawyer , Mr. Longfellow , and to Evelyn Nesbit , the will and the codicil , and the appeal to Anthony Comstock to do what he could to bring Stanford White to justice . Then it takes up Thaw 's early life , re . fers to his weak ancestry , and tells of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth the relations of Thaw and Evelyn Nesbit with his introduction to her in New York , aitd tells how he knew her as a chorus girl to whom he sent an unsolicited present of 50 . Then the events at the time she was at school are narrated , and mention is made of Thaw 's tenderness at the time she underwent an operation . The question goes over all the events which took place in Paris in 1903 , and the conversation between Thaw and Evelyn Nesbit when She refused : to marry him is narrated at length . Tile way in which Stanford White obtained her mother 's confidence and the occurrence in fhe Twenty-foerth Street house is set forth , A description is given of the effect Evelyn Nesbit 's confession had upon Thaw . He is pictured as walking the ' floor all night , sobbing and crying . It is also set forth that from that time Thaw promised to loon after Evelyn Nesbit and made up his mind that her mother ' had been fooled by Stanford White . The trip Thaw and Evelyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were told her about Thaw after her return to America in October , 1903 , are set forth at length . The visit to Hummel 's office and the statements she made about the affidavit are also reviewed , and the whole chain of circumstances which led to her finally making it up with Thaw at the end of 1003 . A good deal of emphasis is laid upon the stories of Thaw 's own brutality , and it is assumed that these played an important part in the negotiations between Evelyn Nesbit and him ? e It is also pointed out that he displayed no anger when Evelyn pointed out to him the man who had been spreading these scandals about him . The threat of Stanford White that he would shoot Thaw if he could find him is mentioned , and then the review of the case takes up the way in which the defendant and Evelyn Nesbit lived at a hotel in this city and traveled together in Europe until the Autumn of 1904 . Their marriage in Pittsburg in April , 1905 , is related , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caf ? Martin just before the shooting . The version of the actual tragedy followed is that told on the stand by James Clinch Smith , brother-in-law of White , and every detail of Thaw 's movements about the Madison Square Roof Garden as well as the remarks he made , are set forth at length . The events of his arrest are pieced together from the testimony of the policemen and others who seized him and took him to the police station , The conversation he had with his wife in the elevator at the Garden , his statements to the police , and the false name and address that he gave are all included . The opinion of tile officers that he was at this time rational in his bearing is also noted . The question having thus laid the foundation of the facts of the case passes on to consider the evidence which had been adduced upon Thaw 's mental state . It refers to his letters and will and points out that in all his close association with Evelyn Nesbit he never seemed to her anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It picks up a number of isolated facts to show his aversion to White , such as his belief that through him he was kept out of certain clubs in New York and White 's remark that he hoped some day to get Evelyn Thaw " back . " His wife 's stories about the " pie girl " and his own efforts to get Anthony Comstock to prosecute White are mentioned , and the testimony of Mrs. William Thaw as to his appearance in November , 1903. is set forth at length . All the testimony which tile allenists tor the defense gave is carefully reviewed . and Thaw 's statements to them with his delusions about persecutions and the inspiration of Providence are included . The results of the physical examination which they made . showing that there was ! ohing very abnormal about him except a curious depression and ridge at the back of the head and an exceedingly irregular heart action , are detailed categorically . It is pointed out that Thaw did not according to these physicians show any signs of using drugs and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses appeared to be good . hut he was unwilling to accept other people 's suggestions . He much preferred to follow his own line of thought . Finally the question takes up the last visits paid him by the experts in the Tombs , and tells how on one occasion Thaw refused to undergo an examination . although they were there by appointment , because his lawyer had not brought some papers with him . Taking all these things into consideration , considering also the letters , will , and codicil of Thaw , Dr. Austin Flint was asked : " Assuming all the facts mentioned in the statements just read to you , I ask you to express your opinion as a scientific man based on those facts alone , and excluding all others as to whether or not the person described as H. K. T. when he shot the person therein described as S. W. knew the nature and quality of the act that he was doing . whether he knew if such act were wrong ? " To this Dr. Flint replied : " In my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shot the person described as S. W. knew that his acts were wrong and knew the nature and quality of those acts . "
