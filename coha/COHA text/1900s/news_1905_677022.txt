Harper of the University of Chicago , who returned from the east yesterday , looking better than his friends have seen him for some time , is the authority for the foregoing statement . The college that maintains high ideals , that has a good location , and a definite mission may receive its share of Mr. Rockefeller 's gift . Other Institutions of learning , especially the out of date colleges , according to President liarnel. " will not ha assisted . Benefit Line Sharply Drawn . " Schools unfortunately situated , " Dr. Harper said , " are not to be considered candidates for aid . Reeketeller 's magnificent fund will be of tremendous importance to the world , but only the right kind of a college must receive its benefits . If a college can not turn out well trained men it does n't deserve to benefit by this bequest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration or ' Instruction , and lacks the proper ideals , it can not be considered as a ** Mr Aid Good Colleges Axe Few , " There are many colleges in Illinois and Iowa which do not deserve assistance from this fund , " continued Dr. Harper. , " Perhaps there are thirty or forty of them . The number which will receive help will probably be small . " We are lacking In colleges In this country . I mean by this colleges of the better kind , such as we mean to help . Perhaps we have universities enough . There ought to be only a few universities , for the reason that they require such great endowments . While a college can get along on a $1,600,000 endowment , I believe a university should have at least a $50,000,000 endowment and perhaps a. $100,000,000 endowinent .

" There has been a great awakening in the higher education in the last ten years  --  even in the last year . In the last six months there has been the greatest impetus in the history of the world . The recent gifts of hlr. tarnegie and Mr. , Rockefeller have been stupendous . One can hardly conceive of the importance of Mr. Rockefeller 's large done " ' Problem of Small Colleges . Concerning the small college and Its uses , Dr. Harper had this to say recently : " One of the most serious problems of education is the problem of the small college . It is a serious problem , because the greatest interests , material and spiritual , are at stake ; a delicate one , because peculiar questions are involved of privilege and right .. " There is a widely prevailing belief that the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the results produced . This belief furnishes a substantial element of strength to the cause of the small college . However , who can say dogmatically that it would have been better or worse for this or that boy bad he gone to the smaller institution instead of to the larger ? " The student of the small college , it is urged , has greater advantage because of the closer contact into which he comes with the officers of the faculty . It is true that the student who knows intimately his instructor , and is known by him , has a greater chance of achieving satisfactory results ' than the student who has little personal contact with his instructor . But the student in the larger institutions not only comes into relationship with a greater number of instructors but touches closely as many of this number as ho would have touched in the smaller college . - Pony n4 ** Tngtittitinrin " A second factor that has helped the smaller institutions is the feeling of awe , sometimes of fear , jealousy , or hostility , which is aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown large and powerful . The small college is loved and cherished just because it is small and weak . The larger institution is hated and opposed because it Is powerful . This has been the history of nearly every one of the state universities in the west . The small college always will have friends because of its weakness . The corollary likewise is true . This feeling of hostility toward the larger colleges , therefore , is a guarantee of the continued interest in the small , as opposed to the in ariturinns. 11 , Tonal Men n ? Wealth " Another factor in the upbuilding of the small college is the desire of men who have bean successful In accumulating wealth to do something with that wealth that will be constructive and creative .

" ' Fran 1 th Ilagsfnrarl Regarding the condition of his health Dr. Harper said : " I feel now as well as I ever did . So far as I am able to tell , my condition is excellent . I am strong and have a good appetite and work does not tire me . In fact , I have not taken a single backward step since my operation last February . The improvement perhaps has been slow , but it has been steady , and I intend to back to my work tomorrow as usual . "
