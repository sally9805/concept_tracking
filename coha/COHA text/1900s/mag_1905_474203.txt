TWO trails are open to the man who would settle for himself the vexed question of animal reasoning . The first leads to the books and authorities ; the second , to the woods and fields . Following the first , one finds strife and misunderstanding , for this question of brute reasoning is almost as old as philosophy ; following the second , one finds peace at least. , and the mystery that shrouds all life , and something of the reverent wonder and humility of those who , like Agassiz , look at Nature as one looks at a mother , with love as well as knowledge and without prejudice . To be quite fair , in an article of this kind , one must follow both trails . But first it is necessary to clear away the underbrush . If we could define reason sharply and draw a line about it , then our problem would be a simple one , for we could tell by exact measurement whether or not an animal had entered our circle . Unfortunately for our definition , no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning and a robin is singing . At first there are the sensations of light and color and melody and the simple gladness of being alive ? the heart 's response to the robin 's song . That first moment is like a little child 's whole life . Then vaguely , dreamily at first , the thoughts come and go ; out of the shadow into the light of full consciousness , vanishing , appearing , vanishing again into . pure sense-impression . And spite of our learned talk in the psychologies , it would be a very wise man ? and he has not yet appeared ? who would draw the line and say : " This is thought , and that is no thought . This belongs to man alone , and that to the man and the robin . " For thought , if we are to describe it picturesquely at all , is like a river , beginning in unseen springs and vanishing into an unfathomed ocean ; and between its source and end it overflows all its banks . Our deepest wisdom is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first thought of a little child , who lives with the animals mostly in a world of sense-impression , is strangely like the last word of the sages . If the subconscious self he indeed a subtle and mysterious manifestation of mind on its highest levels , then are we not removed far away but brought nearer to the animal mind , which seems at times to have knowledge outside the realm of senses , which receives warnings and premonitions of danger , and which communicates with its fellows by silent , telepathic impulses . Most of our difficulty in the past has been due to the fact that , like the theologians , we have drawn lines of distinction where none have any right to exist . We have gone on the general supposition that reason guides man and instinct guides the animal , and that between the two a sharp line is drawn . Probably no such line exists between instinct and reason ; and what separates man from the animals is not a line , but a million years of development . As Quinet observes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That we should have fallen into this error is small wonder . It was the scientists who first misled us . It was the great Ouvier 's mistake to announce the opposition between instinct and reason , and to declare in proof that " the mental powers of any animal stand in inverse ratio to his instincts . " One needs only to consider the wolf and the beaver , strong in instinct , wonderfully intelligent , to see the shortsightedness of the proof . A score of times its falsity has been demonstrated ; but nevertheless we still go on defining instinct in contrast to reason , as if they excluded each other , instead of being wrapped up together in the same cranium . Spencer seems to take the opposite end of the same error , for he tells us qwq Here was a judgment , an act of reason in its simplest form . No sense or instinct could have served to tell the sex of the animal at that distance , but from the circumstance of the calf the bull drew his own conclusion . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal finds himself frequently in circumstances where the mechanism of reflex action and his habitual or instinctive ways are entirely inadequate , and then any candid observer must see a new faculty come into play ; and this faculty , judging by the resultant action ? which is the only possible way we have of judging what goes on in the animal 's head ? is of the same kind , though it may differ enormously in degree , as that which we find in ourselves . Any process of reflection , whether by symbols ( language ) or by successive mental pictures , out of which comes a new consciousness or conception of things that is true or logical in view of the circumstances , is an . act of reason ? no matter what head houses the process . It is not necessary , as Mill and Mivart maintain , that the conclusion should be asserted as true in order to form a true judgment . The fox that sees a wounded companion in a trap and passes silently by on the other side asserts a judgment as positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few pious observations ; and the coon that comes to a cry of distress , and that dies to save a companion from the dogs , may act on impulse indeed , as we often do ourselves , but the impulse itself asserts a previous judgment which only the Samaritan can understand . There is no warrant either in Nature or reason for making distinctions where none exist , and saying : this in animals is instinct , and this same thing in man is reason . " God is the intellect of brutes , " says one great writer , revamping a proverb as old as the Aryan race ; and says another : " Instinct knows not that it knows ; intelligence knows that it is ignorant . " That may or may not be true . It leads , however , to another important consideration , and with it we must return to OUT moose . Had I been psychologically inclined at the time , I might have analyzed that mental process in myself by which reached a judgment , recognizing andnaming the successive stages of attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstituted consciousness , and then declared : this is a judgment , ? which would ; of course , have been a very different kind of judgment from the first , which merely declared : this is a cow moose . The difference between the two constituted the whole basis of the contention between Sir William Hamilton , who defined a judgment to cover the first mental process I have mentioned , and John Stuart Mill , who insisted on the second . Mill would say : " Did the moose affirm his judgment I think he did , most emphatically1 , ? that is , did he say , this is a moose , with the conception of is as symbolic of the existence of a thing ? And did he understand the thingness of the thing , and recognize his judgment as true , with an abstract conception of truth Here is a chance for endless dispute and hair-splitting , which need not concern us greatly . Whether or not the bull was capable of the second kind of judgment is open to argument . In a word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but does he reason that he reasons l ? that is the question . Some of our psychologists declare that he does not . Perhaps they are right ; but I am not sure . Neither are they , for they do not know ; and their occasional intolerance is , as Kant pointed mit , a sure indication that they still have doubts of their own convictions . As I write , a dog over the way attracts my attention . My neighbor has topdressed the lawn there , creating a horrible stench , a rank offence that smells to heaven . But the dog , whose nose is a thousand times more sensitive than mine , finds the most malodorous spot and lies clown and rolls in it in an ecstasy of delight . My poor nose is undoubtedly at fault in preferring toilet-water and scented soap , like the ear of a man who finds Wagner noisy and rejoices in a tune that be can whistle . " When the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy , " represents merely a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods I can always hear low melodies ? subtle , entrancing , tantalizing things that seem at first to be all in my own head , and that are seldom traceable to their true source in almost imperceptible vibrations of dry shells of wood , resonant as violins , and in the shrilling of a hundred teolian harps thrummed delicately by the wind 's fingers . Niue persons out of ten to whom I indicate the phenomenon declare it is nonsense ; the tenth hears it and is silent . It may be that with a finer organization , like the dog 's nose or the exquisite nerve-membranes of certain insects , our world would be full of music and entrancing odors , instead of smells and noises ; and that with a finer soul much of our progress , of which we now boast as lifting us above the animal , would seem like an aimless bustle about material and useless things , or like a struggle of savages crazy with lust of power , which they know not how to use , and with self-interest , which they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am puzzling out my psychological consciousness with doubt and hesitation , the whole process may be clear and luminous as daylight to the . moose without analysis . I have seen so much of animals in the wilderness , and have been puzzled so many times to account for their actions , that I am shy about making hasty generalizations . It is generally claimed by psychologists that the animal never attains to self-consciousness and personality . That may indeed be true : but , on the other hand , the animal does attain au individuality which makes him different from all others of the same species , and I do not quite know where to draw the line showing where individuality ends and personality begins . I have watched a hound dreaming , yelping in his sleep as he chased a fox over the shadowy hills of dreamland . And I have been puzzled to know what lie thought of himself when he woke up in the quiet kitchen and acted as if ashamed for making such a row in his dreams . At any event , the reasonable difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between one who puts his foot on the bottom of the stairs without the impulse to climb , and the one who , aided by some inner power , starts at the same place and mounts laboriously to the top ? a suggestive if not a convincing conclusion . For a step or two , at least , the animal CYT. ? No. 664 ? 74seems to follow me . Lubbock 's experiments with ants and Hubert 's with bees have shown conclusively that even insects adapt means to an end in a way utterly beyond the scope of mere instinct . With animals and birds the field is much wider and the evidence more overwhelming . One need only to read the ertormuus number of unusual animal incidents recorded by Wallace , Darwin . Romance , Haeekel , and the French scientists , especially Broca and Milne-Edwards , to have his mind opened anew and without prejudice to the question of animal reason , and to see the absurdity of the Cartesian theory of autnmatie mechanism . Savages , as well as monkeys , go behind a lookingglass to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chain pulls and tugs impotently ; a coon or a monkey in the same circumstance will often go back to investigate and clear the tangle and untie the knots . The chimpanzee builds a Platform on which to sleep ; all the other tribes of monkeys , with one exception , have not enough instinct or reason to do the thing . Otters break their young from the strong weasel instinct to hunt , and take them fishing instead . Ospreys do the same thing for their nestlings. - Birds change the style of their architecture to meet new conditions . The orioles have several times been known to fasten twigs together to make a better foundation for their nests . I have five authentic instances of a woodcock setting a broken leg in a clay cast . Old birds choose and build better than young , showing some capacity for improvement ; and all birds and animals can be taught a multitude of things that their ancestors never knew . If we - could place one of these educated . animals beside a child that by some fatality had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with only his instincts to guide him , we would have an object-lesson that would make all further argument unnecessary . As Darwin says , after recording a large number of reasonable animal actions , " Any one who is not convinced by such facts as these . and by what he may observe with his own dogs , that animals reason , would not be convinced by anything I could add . " So far we have hardly entered either of the trails that opened before us , but have simply been hacking at the underbrush that catches our feet . and blinds our view . We have gone far enough , however , to understand a little better the contention of the scientists ; and , of these , two may be taken as typical of all the rest . Darwin 's Descent of Man is an effort to establish the fact that all of man 's faculties without exception are evolved by gradual process from the faculties of the animals ; and of reason he says : " Of all the faculties of the human mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a few persons now dispute the fact that animals possess some power of reasoning . Animals may constantly be seen to pause , deliberate , and resolve . It is a significant fact that the more the habits of any particular animal are studied by a naturalist , the more he attributes to reason and the less to unlearned instincts . " This is the substance of all his teaching on the subject ; and we need not quote his many instances , nor go into the question of the origin of the reasoning faculty in animals , which , he says , " is as hopeless an inquiry as how life itself originated " ; nor consider his reverent pause at the thought of God , with which this and every honest iisquiry must end . St. George Mivart , in a careful and honest . analysis of Darwin 's work , first separates the faculties of the mind into the " indeliberate " qualities , such as instinct , reflex action , sense - perception , emotion ( with emotional language ) , automatic memory , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " deliberate " qualities , such as self-consciousness , reason , will , rational speech , intelligent memory , etc. , which belong to man alone . These two sets of faculties are absolutely distinct and separate , and Mivart maintains that all which Darwin ascribes to reason in animals may be explained by the indeliberate or unreasoning faculties . It need hardly be pointed out here that the weakness of the argument lies in the fact that between these two sets of faculties lies , not a line , but a border-land , in which inevitably the different faculties must meet and mingle . A host of other able scientists have entered the same field . Huxley 's wellknown view that mental faculties in men and animals are dependent on physical organization , and that since the organizations are similar , so also are the faculties , was first declared by Cabanis in 1844 ( Rapport du Physique et du Moral de l'Hommc ) , in which he tried to show the unity of physical life and mind , ? which is the basis also of Spencer 's contention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations from strict biologists . Bain ( Mind and Body ) regards all thought as dependent solely on physical conditions . Maudsley ( Philosophy of Mind ) holds that the whole intellectual life of man depends on the physical - workings of the brain ; the difference between men and animals therefore must be determined anatomically . Bastian ( Brain as an Organ of Mind ) holds substantially the same opinion . Haeckel ( History of Creation , translation , and Entstehung d . Meuse &; engeschlechtes ) regards the brain and associated ganglia as the organ of the psychical life , and shows that everything in man , as in the lower animals , is to be explained by purely physiological evolution . " The mental powers of the human race have developed step by step from the mind of the lower vertebrates . " Broca , in a brilliant essay on the intellectual life of animals and men , before the Anthropological Society of Paris , holds that man has no claim whatever to any specific or distinctive intellectual life . Quatrefages ( L'Espce Humaiae ) more mildly claims a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual faculties of man and brute , and thinks the difference lies in moral and spiritual considerations ; but MilneEdwards ( Comparative Anatomy , not translated ) sweeps even this away by showing that animals possess a rudimentary moral sense . A score of other writers might be mentioned ; but these are enough to show that , from the biological standpoint , the possession of reasoning faculties by the brutes would seem to be an inevitable conclusion from their organization . In my ignorance , which is somewhat tempered by faith as well as knowledge , I do not go to the extreme of this school of biologists . Huxley claimed that " if a man were transported in a barrel of rum to the sun , he would inevitably be classed with the monkeys " ; a conclusion which , as De Pressense points out , might indeed follow if naturalists in the sun were at the same superficial point of development as our own , ? our ornithologists , for instance , who regard identification of species as the essential thing , or our biologists who take Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the mind is a small matter . While there is undoubtedly an intimate relation between mind and body , there is certainly no identity , either in animals or men . Neither instinct nor intelligence can ever be reduced to sensation , for there is something in them which is ultimately independent of matter , and which , therefore , anatomy can never reach . How a change in the cortical layers of the brain becomes thought or consciousness is a mystery as profound as the mystery of life and death . As far as we can see and understand , instinct and reason are not of matter , any more than electricity is of the wires over which it runs . Both are primordial things , born of the intelligent Something which is above matter , and which loves to reflect itself in even the dull places of earth . More than this , instinct is not the animal , and reason is not the man . With man 's reason are his will and emotions ? love , fear , courage , generosity , ? none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the man . With the animal 's instinct are other things that we must consider ? something which looks like will , and emotions of love , fear , courage , and self-denial , which are undeniably like those in our own hearts , however much they differ in degree . Since we share so much in common of the physical and emotional life , it is hardly more than to be expected that the animal himself , apart from his instinct , should share something of our rational faculties . In the past this conclusion would undoubtedly have been deemed " perversive to faith and morals " ; but at the present time , with our batter knowledge of animals and men , the tendency is the other way . For myself I have long been puzzled to know why men generally havebeen so unwilling to admit the possibility of brute reasoning , ? unless , indeed , it were doubt of their own ; or a matter of a had conscience , which sought some excuse , however small , for hunting and killing the animals so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are still disturbed may be comforted by Sydney Smith 's reflection : " I confess , " he said ( I quota from memory ) , " I feel so at ease about the superiority of mankind ; I have such marked contempt for the understanding of every baboon I have ever met ; I feel so sure that the monkeys will never rival us in poetry and music , ? that I see no reason why justice should not be done to whatever fragments of soul and tatters of understanding they may really possess . " Against this contention of the biologists , which makes animal reasoning almost a necessity in view of their organization , a score of thinkers , each an authority in his own field , assert a contrary opinion . They are right , too ; but this does not prove that the others are altogether wrong , and it is needless for us to go farther into the controversy . Joly , in his L'Homme et l'Anirrial , has the best summary from the scientific standpoint ; and from a purely literary side it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Comedic Humaine originated in a comparison of animals and men , following a long controversy on the subject we are considering be-. tween Olivier on the one hand and SaintHilaire on the other . Truth often has contrary aspects , as a sail on the sea appears white or black according to our different positions . It is certain that the biologist , who grubs in the cellar of life , will find himself in opposition to the theologian , often more scientific in spirit , who rummages the attic with its memories of the past , fragrant as lavender , and its package of old love-letters , and its wide outlook over the sunny landscape . What is strange is , that they so seldom realize thet they are both invMigoting opposite ends of the same eternal mystery . On the second trail , which leads direct to nature , one leaves all this conflict behind him . And be will do well for the moment to leave also all the impedimenta gathered from books of animal lore on the one hand and from superficial classification of skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two extremes of mechanical biologists and enthusiastic nature students , declares : " We are tempted to apply today to the animal what Pascal said in reference to man : If men humble thee , I lift thee up ; if they uplift thee , I humble . " He is particularly troubled by the records of animal intelligence , thinking the modern observers must romance about animals much as Ruusseau dirt about savages . And then comes Bfichner , who gathers together the results of recent experiments with bees , ants , birds , and animals , and in a scientific spirit makes out a case for the animal much more astounding and revolutionary than the most daring of modern nature-writers has ventured to suggest . Mivart , who is certain that animals do not reason , wishes that a book were written on the stupidity of brutes , to balance the records of intelligence by other observers ; and a recent classifier of our natural history longs to write a volume on " the meanness of animals to one another " as he has seen them in captivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a different mind . Even so . A. man sees what ho goes forth for to see ; and what he sees is invariably a reflection of himself in Nature 's luoking-glass . The butcher sees mutton , and the prophet the ways of God , in the same flock of sheep ; and both are right . Savages , whose reasoning powers arc not highly developed , invariably consider the animals as reasoning like themselves , and they are undoubtedly nearer to the truth than the biologist or psychologist . The point is this , that . it is better to leave the books . at home , and consult your dog first and the anthoriti afterward ; and better still to leave your dog at home and watch the wild birds and animals with open eyes and with open heart . Philip 's profound suggestion to " come and see " is the best argument in the world of nature AS in the realm of grace . For , spite of a thousand bird-books , we know almost nothing of the sparrow that goes deeper than his skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studied any single wild animal till they understood him , but have been content with theories or experimentation or general classifications . It took me twenty years of watching and questioning before I found out why a beaver and an otter quarrel when they meet each other , and when I found out the reason it . was not anatomical , nor is it recorded in the natural histories . A house-sparrow that I watched for an idle moment , one day while a train waited on a siding , did a thing in the eyes of half a earful of witnesses that surpassed anything I have ever seen recorded in the bird-books . So with other birds and animals . One needs only to study them honestly and sympathetically to reach his own conclusion , If happily you are a boy , a pet coon or a crow will settle the question ; if a sportsman , the first good fox run over the snow will clear up any lingering doubts ; and if you belong to the race of nature-lovers , the love itself will light the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of suggestion , should be mentioned here . In forming a judgment of animal reasoning it is well to remember that we have but one psychology . The general idea seems to he that we should seek a special psychology , distinct from our own , in order to understand the animals . Nothing could be more erroneous or misleading . So far as we can see , the laws of mind are as constant as the laws of physics and chemistry , which apply equally well to the oil-wells and to the light from Arcturus and the Pleiades . We know a little , a very little , of our own psychology , and that is the only measure we possess to lay upon the life of any creature . All thought except my own is strange to me ; I am never sure of it , but can only infer and then estimate it from the actions of the animal under observation . ' Whether the animal be a man or a bear , T am under the same necessity to watch his actions , and then infer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head under similar circumstances . To one who judges animals in this rational way there is no doubt of their reasoning . The only problem lies in the quality and amount of that reason , and in the origin and cause of that whole process of history which stretches like a wide sea between us and the animal kingdom .
