txt //pid survey the author passes the line of demarcation of Alexander VI , and the voyages of Magalhaes and Elcano , Loaisa , Villalobos , and others , down to the expedition of Legazpi . The salient points of this expedition are briefly outlined , his peaceful reception by Tupas and the natives , but their later hostility , because the Spaniards " seized their provisions , " their defeat , the Spaniards ' first settlement in Sebu , and the despatching of the advice-boat to Nueva Espana to discover the return passage , and inform the viceroy of the success of the expedition . From Sebu the conquest and settlement is extended to other islands , and the Spanish capital is finally moved to Manila . Events come rapidly . The conquest proceeds " by force of arms or by the efforts of the religious who have sown the good seeds of the gospel . " Land is allotted to the conquerors , and towns are gradually founded , and the amount of the natives ' tribute is fixed. @# At Legazpi ' s death Guido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despatch among Legazpi ' s papers , and continues the latter ' s plans .

" The two towns of Betis and Lubao allotted by Lavezaris to himself are taken from him later by order of his successor , Dr. Francisco de Sande , but are restored to him by express order of the king , together with the office of master-of-camp. @# Succeeding Lavezaris in 1575 , Dr. Francisco de Sande continues " the pacification of the islands . . . . especially that of the province of Camarines . " The town of Nueva Caceres is founded , and Sande ' s partially effective campaign to Borneo , and its offshoot  --  that of Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa to Mindanao  --  undertaken . The " San Juanillo " is despatched to Nueva Espana , " but it was lost at sea and never heard of again . " Sande is relieved of his governorship by Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pefialosa , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexico. " @# Chapter III details the events of Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pefialosa ' s administration and the interim of government of Diego Ronquillo . Events , with the greater stability constantly given the islands , follow more quickly . Gonzalo de Penalosa , by an agreement with the king , is to take six hundred colonists  --  married and single  --  to the islands , in return for which he is to be governor for life . He establishes the town of Arevalo in Panay , builds the Chinese Parian , endeavors , although unsuccessfully , to discover a return passage to Nueva Espana , by the South Sea , and despatches " a ship to Peru with merchandise to trade for certain goods which he said that the Filipinas needed . " He imposes the two per cent export duty on goods to Nueva Espana , and the three per cent duty on Chinese merchandise , and " although he was censured for having done this without his Majesty ' s orders " they " remained in force , and continued to be imposed thenceforward . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest of the island of Ternate , but proves a failure . Cagayan is first pacified , and the town of Nueva Caceres founded . Gabriel de Rivera , after an expedition to Borneo , is sent to Spain to consult the best interests of the islands . Domingo de Salazar receives his appointment as bishop , and is accompanied to the islands by Antonio Sedeno and Alonso Sanchez , the first Jesuits in the islands . In 1583 Gonzalo de Penalosa dies , and is succeeded by his kinsman Diego Ronquillo . Shortly after occurs Manila ' s first disastrous fire , but the city is rebuilt , although with difficulty . In consequence of Rivera ' s trip to Spain , the royal Audiencia of Manila is established with Santiago de Vera as its president and governor of the islands. @# In the fourth chapter are related the events of Santiago de Vera ' s administration , and the suppression of the Audiencia . Vera reaches the islands in 1584 , whence shortly afterwards he despatches another expedition to the Malucos which also fails . The pacification continues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspired between Manila and Pampanga chiefs . Fortifications are built and an artillery foundry established under the charge of natives . During this term Candish makes his memorable voyage , passing through some of the islands . Finally the Audiencia is suppressed , through the representations made by Alonso Sanchez , who is sent to Spain and Rome with authority to act for all classes of society . On his return he brings from Rome " many relics , bulls , and letters for the Filipinas . " Through the influence of the Jesuit , Gomez Perez Dasmarinas receives appointment as governor of the islands ; and with his salary increased to " ten thousand Castilian ducados " and with despatches for the suppression of the Audiencia , and the establishment of regular soldiers , he arrives at Manila in May , 1590. @# Chapter V deals with the term of Gomez Perez Dasmarinas and the interims of Pedro de Rojas and Luis Perez Dasmarinas . The term of the new governor is characterized by his great energy and enthusiasm . The Manila wall and other fortifications , the building of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebuilding of Manila , and the opening of negotiations with Japan , are all a part of his administration , and he is the inspirer of them all . The first note to the future expeditions to , and troubles with , Camboja and Siam is struck by an embassy from the first country in charge of Diego Belloso with offers of trade and friendship and requests for aid against Siam , the latter being at the time deferred . In accordance with his great desire to conquer Ternate , the governor fits out a great fleet in 1593 , sending the advance vessels to the Pintados in care of his son . Shortly after , leaving the city in charge of Diego Ronquillo , although with too few troops for defense , Gomez Perez sets out to join his son , but is assassinated by his Chinese rowers , who mutiny and make off with the galley . After his death , the contests for his office begin , for the dead governor had assured various people that they would be appointed in case of his death . Especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wealthy man of the Pintados , to whom he " had shown an appointment drawn in his favor . " In Manila , Pedro de Rojas , lieutenant-assessor , is chosen governor ad interim , but after forty days Luis Perez Dasmarinas takes the office by virtue of an appointment regularly drawn in his favor . The return of the troops to Manila proves an efficacious relief from fears of a Chinese invasion . The vessels sent to Nueva Espana in 1593 fail to make the voyage because of stormy weather , but the governor ' s death is learned in Spain by way of India . The troubles between the bishop and governor culminate somewhat before the latter ' s death , in the departure of the former for Spain , as a result of which an archbishopric with suffragan bishops is established in the islands , and the Audiencia is reestablished . The office of lieutenant-assessor is given more weight and Morga is sent out to fill it in 1595 under its changed title of lieutenant-governor . In the administration of Luis Perez Dasmarinas affairs begin actively with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Blas Ruiz de Hernan Gonzalez and Diego Belloso . The governor , completely under the influence of the Dominicans , although against the advice of the " majority of people in the city " sends a fleet to Camboja . Gallinato fails to reach that country until after Blas Ruiz and Belloso have quarreled with the Chinese there , killed the usurping Cambodian king , Anacaparan , and thrown the country into confusion . Much to their displeasure Gallinato refuses to continue the conquest , chides the others harshly , and departs for Manila by way of Cochinchina . At Cochinchina Blas Ruiz and Belloso go to the kingdom of Lao to find the legitimate king of Camboja , Prauncar . On their arrival they find that he has died , but partly through their efforts and those of two Malays , the king ' s younger son , who still survives , is placed on the throne . Gallinato experiences difficulty in Cochinchina , where he endeavors to regain the standard and various other articles from the galley of Gomez Perez that had been stolen by the Chinese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Figueroa agrees to subdue Mindanao at his own expense , in return for which he is to have its governorship for two generations . In pursuance of this he fits out a large expedition , but shortly after reaching the island is killed in a fight and ambush , whereupon his first commanding officer Juan de la Xara schemes to continue the expedition , and establishes his men in a settlement near Tampacan , called Murcia. @# The administration of Governor Francisco Tello forms the subject-matter of chapter VI . At his arrival in 1596 , news is received in the island of the appointment of Fray Ignacio de Santibanez as archbishop , and of two appointments for bishops . News of the death of Estevan Rodriguez is brought to Manila , and the machinations of Juan de la Xara to carry on the expedition independently of Manila learned . His death shortly after arrest , while on his way to Oton to push his suit with Rodriguez ' s widow , frustrates his plans . Juan Ronquillo is sent to Mindanao and takes over the command there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river of Mindanao and the fortifying of La Caldera , on the Mindanao coast . However he gains a complete victory over the combined forces of Mindanaos and Ternatans , which causes him to send another despatch to Tello . But the latter ' s reply to the first despatch having been received , in accordance with its orders he burns his fort , and after establishing a garrison at La Caldera , returns to Manila with the rest of his command . There he is arrested for not awaiting Tello ' s second despatch , but is liberated on producing a letter ordering him in any event to return to Manila . Gallinato , on his return from Cochinchina is accused by his own men of not following up the victory at Camboja , for had he done so , " all that had been hoped in that kingdom would have been attained . " An incipient rebellion in Cagayan is checked by the murder of its leader by his own countrymen " who had offered to do it for a reward . " In the year 1596 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had set out from Peru to rediscover the Solomon Islands reaches the Philippines after great sufferings from famine and disease , and after the death of many men , among them the commander himself . The voyage is related in detail in a letter from the chief pilot , Pedro Fernandez de Quiros to Morga ; it is full of stirring adventure , and of keen and appreciative observation . One of the vessels , the " San Geronymo " despatched to Nueva Espana in 1596 , is forced to put in at a Japanese port because of storms . There they receive ill-treatment , and the efforts of the Franciscan missionaries in Japan in their behalf lead to the edict sentencing them to death , in accordance with which six Franciscans , three Jesuits , and seventeen native helpers are crucified in 1597 . Taicosama ' s wrath , intensified by the accusation that the Spaniards conquered kingdoms " by first sending their religious to the kingdom " and by entering afterward " with their arms , " is satisfied by the crucifixion of the religious and their assistants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are allowed to return to Manila . The religious write a letter of farewell to Dr. Morga , in which they inform him that Japan intends to attack the Philippines . Luis Navarrete Fajardo is sent to Japan to demand satisfaction , but accomplishes little . Faranda Quiemon , one of Taicosama ' s vassals , a man of obscure birth , obtaining permission to make an expedition of conquest , sets about his preparations , but owing to lack of resources and initiative fails to complete them . Meanwhile great caution is exercised in Manila , and the Japanese residing there are sent back to Japan , while those coming on trading vessels are well treated but gotten rid of as soon as possible . Cambodian affairs are again set on foot , although against the advice of some , through the instrumentality of Father Alonso Ximenez , a Dominican who had accompanied Gallinato on the former expedition , but who had been left behind at Cochinchina through his own disobedience of orders . Affairs in Mindanao and Jolo assume a threatening aspect . One Juan Pacho , commander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with twenty of his men , and a new commander of La Caldera is appointed until a punitive expedition can be undertaken . In 1598 the archbishop arrives , and the Manila Audiencia is reestablished by royal order , and the seal received with great pomp and ceremony . A letter received that same year by Morga from Blas Ruiz details events in Camboja since he and Belloso went there with Gallinato ' s expedition . Blas Ruiz seeks to excuse their actions in Camboja and holds out the hope of Spanish conquest and influence on the mainland , and asks help from the islands . As a consequence of this letter , Luis Perez Dasmarinas secures permission to attempt an expedition to the mainland at his own expense to aid the king of Camboja and then to seize the kingdom of Champan , whose king was a constant menace to all navigators throughout that region . Negotiations with China and the granting of an open port to Spaniards called El Pinal , are opened and secured through the efforts of Juan de Zamudio who is sent to China for saltpeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Portuguese , who fear the loss of their own trade at Macao . At El Pinal the survivors of two of Luis Perez ' s three ships meet with Juan de Zamudio , after suffering great storms , hardships , and wrecks . The same favor is extended him by the Chinese as to Zamudio , but the Portuguese show their hostility to him also , imprisoning the men sent by him to Macao to ask for help , and even attempting force against him . Both Zamudio and a messenger from Luis Perez carry news of the latter ' s disaster to Manila , whereupon a ship and supplies are sent him with orders to return to Manila . Hernando de los Rios Coronel , sent to Canton by Luis Perez to negotiate with the Chinese , writes from that city to Dr. Morga concerning China and the possibility , desirability , and advantages of the Chinese trade in China instead of Manila , and the opposition of the Portuguese . China he describes as a country " full of rivers and towns , and without a palmo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Luis Perez ' s fleet , commanded by Luis Ortiz , reaches Camboja , where he and his companions join the Spanish , Portuguese , and Japanese already there . This small force , which is eyed askance by the Malay leaders and others envious of , and hostile to them on account of their prowess and their influence with the weak king , is further increased by Captain Juan de Mendoza Gamboa and Fray Juan Maldonado , a learned Dominican , and their men . The former , having obtained permission to go on a trading expedition to Siam , for which he is given letters of embassy , is also entrusted to convey certain supplies to Don Luis at Camboja , where he fails to find him . Maldonado is sent by his order as a companion to Don Luis . This addition to their forces is welcomed by the Spaniards in Camboja , and they refuse to let them depart until hearing definite news of Luis Perez . The arrival of a contingent of Japanese , mestizos , and one Spaniard , who had left Japan on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camboja . The leaders Blas Ruiz , Belloso , and Maldonado treat with the king on their own account , but not so satisfactorily as they wish . Conflicts and quarrels arising between their forces and the Malays , the latter finally overpower and kill the Spaniards , Portuguese , and Japanese , except several who remain in the country and Mendoza , Maldonado and a few men who escape in the former ' s vessel . In Camboja confusion and anarchy again reign and the king is bullied and finally killed by the Malays . The Joloans and Mindanaos are emboldened by the final abandonment and dismantling of the fort at La Caldera  --  which is decided upon by the governor against the opinion of the Audiencia  --  and , joined in self-defense by the peaceful natives of Mindanao , make an incursion against Spaniards and natives in the Pintados in 1599 , in which they take immense booty and many captives . The next year they return with a larger force , but are defeated by the alcalde-mayor of Arevalo , whereupon they resolve to be revenged . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Franciscan who has escaped crucifixion , to open negotiations with his successor Daifusama . The latter , desiring trade for his own northern province of Quanto , requests the governor of Manila , through the religious , for commerce , and men to build ships for the Nueva Espana trade which he wishes to open . He does not negotiate concerning religion , for " the profit and benefit to be derived from friendship and commerce with the Spaniards was more to the taste of Daifusama than what he had heard concerning their religion . " However , the religious writes that freedom is given to evangelize throughout Japan , although the only concession given is that the religious could establish a house at their trading station . In October of 1600 news reaches Manila of the coming and depredations of Oliver van Noordt ' s two vessels . The description of the preparations , made by Morga , the instructions given him by the governor , his instructions to Juan de Alcega , and the fight and its consequences follow . In the same year of 1600 the vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both unable to reach Nueva Espana , and are wrecked  --  the latter near Catanduanes , and the former in the Ladrones , where it is rifled by the natives and the men surviving distributed through the different villages . In 1600 the " Santo Tomas " on its way to the islands puts in at the Ladrones , but the commander , fearing storms , refuses to wait for the Spanish prisoners of the " Santa Margarita , " although petitioned to do so by the religious and others . Accordingly a Franciscan , Juan Pobre , full of pity for the unfortunate men , casts in his lot with them and voluntarily remains behind . The " San Felipe " is wrecked eighty legues from Manila , and its cargo taken overland to that city . Mindanao and Jolo affairs are meanwhile given into command of Gallinato , and although he is partially successful , the rains , hunger , and disease work for the natives , and finally in May of 1602 , Gallinato sends to Manila for instructions . Juan de Mendoza and Fray Juan Maldonado , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are received there coldly by the king , and their trading is unsatisfactory . Fearing violence they depart one night without notifying the Siamese , taking with them certain Portuguese held in Siam as partial prisoners , but are pursued by the Siamese who molest them until in the open sea . From wounds received during the week ' s continual conflict both Mendoza and Maldonado die , the latter first writing to his Order and advising them " on their consciences not to again become instruments of a return to Camboja . " Troubles in Maluco between the Dutch and natives on the one side and the Portuguese and Spanish on the other , render it necessary to send aid several times from Manila . In March of 1601 , a letter is written by the king of Tidore to Morga requesting aid against Ternate and the Dutch , in response to which supplies and reenforcements are sent in 1602. @# The seventh chapter deals with events during the period of Pedro de Acuna ' s administration . With his arrival in May of 1602 , new life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first concerns himself with home affairs . He constructs galleys but has to postpone an intended visit to Pintados , in order to attend to Japan and Jolo , and despatch the vessels to Nueva Espana . It is determined to open commerce with Quanto , but to defer the matter of sending workmen to Japan to show the Japanese how to construct ships , as that will be detrimental . Religious of the various orders go to Japan , but are received less warmly than Geronymo de Jesus ' s letter leads them to expect . The latter pressed by Daifusama for the performance of his promises finally asks permission to go to Manila to advocate them in person , whence he brings back assurance of trade with Quanto . The vessel despatched there is forced to put in at another port , but is allowed to trade there and to return . Two vessels despatched to Nueva Espana in 1602 are forced to return , putting in on the way  --  the first at the Ladrones and the other at Japan . The first brings back most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment in Japan finally escapes . As a result of an embassy sent to Daifusama from this vessel chapas or writs of safety are provided to the Spaniards so that any vessel putting into Japanese ports will be well treated in the future . The reenforcements sent to Gallinato at Jolo serve only to enable him to break camp and return to Manila . While Acuna is on his way to Pintados to inspect those islands , a raiding expedition of Moros goes as far as Luzon and Mindoro , committing many depredations , thus compelling the governor to return , who narrowly escapes capture . A punitive expedition of Spaniards and Indians sent in pursuit of the Moros inflicts but slight damage . Shortly before this a fleet prepared at Goa for the chastisement of the Malucos sets out under Andrea Furtado de Mendoza , but is separated by storms . Some of the vessels with the commander reach Amboina , but in so crippled and destitute a condition that they are forced to ask help from Manila . Acuna , although arranging independently for an expedition to Maluco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Portuguese . Early in that year the prelude to the Chinese troubles of that same year is given by the coming of the Chinese mandarins to see the island of gold , which causes many , among them the archbishop and some religious , to counsel watchfulness . In 1603 occurs the second disastrous fire in Manila , with a loss of over one million pesos. @# The victorious Malays in Camboja are finally driven out by a combination of patriotic mandarins , and make the brother of their old king sovereign , whereupon relations between Camboja and the Philippines are again established by sending there a number of religious . In May of 1603 two ships with reenforcements arrive at Manila , bringing certain ecclesiastical news . The aid rendered Furtado de Mendoza by Gallinato does not prove sufficient to subdue the Ternatans , and Gallinato returns to Manila . The present installment of Morga ends with the courteous letter written to Acuna by Furtado de Mendoza , in which he renders praise to Gallinato and his men .

In my judgment it is entertaining , profitable , and worthy of publication .

Knowing my poor resources , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed was the fact that , if what is given were to bear an equal proportion to the receiver , there would be no one worthy of placing his works in your Excellency ' s hands ; and oblivion would await the deeds achieved in these times by our Spaniards in the discovery , conquest , and conversion of the Filipinas Islands  --  as well as various fortunes which they have had from time to time in the great kingdoms and among the pagan peoples surrounding the islands : for , on account of the remoteness of those regions , no account has been given to the public which purports to treat of them from their beginnings down to the present condition . I entreat your Excellency to accept my good will , which is laid prostrate at your feet ; and should this short treatise not afford that pleasure , which self-love  --  that infirmity of the human mind  --  leads me to expect , will your Excellency deal with me , as you are wont to deal with all , and read this book and conceal its imperfections with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so richly endowed with these and other virtues  --  which , through the divine power , cause lofty things not to keep aloof from humble ones ; and which , in addition to your own natural greatness , have placed your Excellency in your present office for the good of these realms , where you reward and favor the good , and correct and check the opposite .

Thus , by the mercy of God , they preserve their kingdoms and subjects in the purity of the Christian religion , meriting thereby their glorious title and renown of " Defenders of the Faith . " Moreover , by the valor of their indomitable hearts , and at the expense of their revenues and possessions , they have ploughed the seas with Spanish fleets and men , and discovered and conquered vast kingdoms in the most remote and unknown parts of the world . They have led the inhabitants of these regions to a knowledge of the true God , and into the fold of the Christian church , in which those peoples now live , governed in civil and political matters with peace and justice , under the shelter and protection of the royal arm and power , which were wanting to them when weighed down by blind tyrannies and barbarous cruelties , on which the enemy of the human race had so long reared them for himself. @# For this reason the crown and scepter of Espana have extended themselves wherever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting , with the glory and splendor of their power and majesty , and the Spanish monarchs have excelled the other princes of the earth by having gained innumerable souls for heaven , which has been Espana ' s principal intention and its wealth . These , together with the great riches and treasures which Espana enjoys , and the famous deeds and victories which it has won , cause the whole world to magnify and extol its lofty name and the energy and valor of its subjects , who in accomplishing these deeds have lavished their blood. @# Having won America , the fourth part of the earth , of which the ancients knew naught , they sailed in the course of the sun until they discovered an archipelago of many islands in the eastern ocean , adjacent to farther Asia , inhabited by various peoples , and abounding in rich metals , precious stones , and pearls , and all manner of fruit . There raising the standard of the Faith , they freed those peoples from the yoke and power of the demon , and placed them under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may justly raise in those islands the pillars and trophies of Non plus ultra which the famous Hercules left on the shore of the Cadiz Sea , which were afterward cast down by the strong arm of Carlos V , 4 our sovereign , who surpassed Hercules in great deeds and enterprises. @# After the islands had been conquered by the sovereign light of the holy gospel which entered therein , the heathen were baptized , the darkness of their paganism was banished , and they changed their own for Christian names . The islands also , losing their former name , took  --  with the change of religion and the baptism of their inhabitants  --  that of Filipinas Islands , in recognition of the great favors received at the hands of his Majesty Filipo the Second , our sovereign , in whose fortunate time and reign they were conquered , protected , and encouraged , as a work and achievement of his royal hands. @# Their discovery , conquest , and conversion were not accomplished without great expenditure , labor , and Spanish blood , with varying success , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and furnish a spacious field of which historians may treat , for such is their office . Certainly the subject matter is not scanty , and contains both serious and pleasant elements sufficient to be worthy of attention , so that it will not depreciate historians to treat of Indian occurrences and wars , which those who have not experienced undervalue . For the people of those regions are valiant and warlike nations of Asia , who have been reared in continual warfare , both by sea and by land , and who use artillery and other warlike implements , which the necessity of defending themselves against great and powerful neighboring kingdoms , taught them to use skilfully ; and  --  although somewhat imperfectly  --  they have gained dexterity and have completed their education in the school of Espana , which recently brought war to their gates  --  thus sharing the experience of other provinces of Europe , who also had formerly been ignorant and careless of the use of arms. @# Some painstaking persons , to whom  --  for lack of time and means  --  I have given and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to write this history ; and I hope that they will publish it in better shape than the fragmentary histories which we have hitherto received from some contemporary historians. 5 @# I spent eight years in the Filipinas Islands , the best years of my life , serving continuously as lieutenant of the governor and captain-general , and , as soon as the royal Audiencia of Manila was established , in the office of auditor , which I was the first to fill. 6 And desirous that the affairs of those islands should be known , especially those which occurred during my connection with them , I have related these matters in a book of eight chapters , tracing them from their origin so far as was necessary . The first seven chapters contain an account of the discoveries , conquests , and other events in the islands and neighboring kingdoms and provinces , which occurred during the time of the proprietary governors 7 until the death of Don Pedro de Acuna . The eighth and last chapter contains a brief summary and account of the nature of these regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and other details ; moreover , it treats of the acquaintance , dealings , and intercourse which they maintain with their neighboring islands and pagan communities . As fearful am I for the imperfections which will be found in this work , as I am persuaded that they deserve forgiveness , since my design and chief intent has been to give each one his due and to present the truth without hatred or flattery , which has been injured in some current narratives. 8 The latter is a fault to be severely reproved in those who relate the deeds of others , inasmuch as it was prohibited by a penal law which Cato and Marcius , tribunes of the Roman people , established for those who , in relating their own deeds , overstepped the truth  --  although this seemed less worthy of punishment , on account of the self-love which intervenes in such a case. @# There will not be wanting some person who will point out my oversights , but I shall have already answered him by confessing them ; and should this not suffice to silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulysses , and  --  considering the haste with which I have written  --  endure this inconvenience and difficulty , desiring only to please and serve whomsoever may read it ; and this will be sufficient to protect me from greater dangers. @# Notice is given that @# In reading this history , one may find certain words  --  names of provinces , towns , magistrates , arms , and vessels  --  which it has seemed more suitable to write by their usual names in those regions . In the last chapter , which contains an account of the islands and their peculiarities , these words will be explained and defined. @# @# ? Of the first discoveries of the eastern islands ; the voyage thither by Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi ; the conquest and pacification of the Filipinas during his governorship , and that of Guido de Labazarris , who afterward held the office. @# ? CHAPTER FIRST @# According to ancient and modern cosmographers , that part of the world called Asia has adjacent to it a multitude of greater and lesser islands , inhabited by various nations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silver , and other minerals , as they abound in fruit and grain , flocks , and animals . Some of the islands yield all kinds of spices which are carried away and distributed throughout the world . These islands are commonly designated in their books , descriptions , and sea-charts , as the great archipelago of San Lazaro , and are located in the eastern ocean . Among the most famous of them are the islands of Maluco , Celeves , Tendaya , Luzon , Mindanao , and Borneo , which are now called the Filipinas. @# When Pope Alexander the Sixth divided the conquests of the new world between the kings of Castilla and of Portugal , the kings agreed to make the division by means of a line drawn across the world by the cosmographers , so that they might continue their discoveries and conquests , one toward the west and the other toward the east , and pacify whatever regions each might gain within his own demarcation. @# After the crown of Portugal had conquered the city of Malaca , on the mainland of Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancients Aurea Chersonesus  --  a Portuguese fleet , in the year one thousand five hundred and eleven , on hearing of neighboring islands and especially of those of Maluco and Banda , where cloves and nutmegs are gathered , went to discover them . After touching at Banda , they went to Terrenate , one of the islands of Maluco , at the invitation of its king , to defend him against his neighbor , the king of Tidore , with whom he was at war . This was the beginning of the Portuguese settlement in Maluco. @# Francisco Serrano , who after this discovery returned to Malaca , and thence went to India with the purpose of going to Portugal to give an account of the discovery , died before he had accomplished this voyage , but not , however , without having communicated in letters to his friend , Fernando de Magallanes , what he had seen ; 9 for they had been together at the taking of Malaca , although the latter was then in Portugal . From this relation , Magallanes learned whatever was necessary for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Magallanes , who for certain reasons had entered the service of the king of Castilla , told the emperor Carlos V , our sovereign , that the islands of Maluco fell within the demarcation of the latter ' s crown of Castilla , and that their conquest belonged to him , according to the concessions made by Pope Alexander ; moreover , he offered to make the expedition and navigation to the islands in the emperor ' s name , by sailing through that part of the demarcation belonging to Castilla , and by availing himself of a famous astrologer and cosmographer , named Ruyfarelo sic , whom he had with him. @# The emperor , moved by the importance of the undertaking , entrusted Fernando de Magallanes with this expedition and discovery , supplying him with the necessary ships and provisions therefor . Thus equipped , he set sail and discovered the strait to which he gave his name . Through this he entered the southern sea , and sailed to the islands of Tendaya and Sebu , where he was killed by the natives of Matan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Maluco , where the sailors fell into disputes and contentions with the Portuguese then stationed in the island of Terrenate . Finally , not being able to maintain themselves there , the Castilians left Maluco in a ship , called the " Victoria , " the only remaining vessel of their fleet . As leader and captain , they chose Juan Sebastian del Cano , who made the voyage to Castilla by way of India , where he arrived with but few men , and informed his Majesty of the discovery of the great archipelago , and of his voyage. @# The same enterprise was attempted at other times , and was carried out by Juan Sebastian del Cano , Comendador Loaisa , the Saoneses , and the bishop of Plasencia. 11 But these did not bear the fruits expected , on account of the hardships and perils of so long a voyage , and the opposition received by those who reached Maluco , from the Portuguese there. @# After all these events , as it was thought that this discovery might be made quicker and better by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forty-five , 12 a fleet , under command of Rui Lopez de Villalobos , was sent by that route . They reached Maluco by way of Sebu , where they quarreled with the Portuguese , and suffered misfortunes and hardships , so that they were unable to effect the desired end ; nor could the fleet return to Nueva Espana whence it had sailed , but was destroyed . Some of the surviving Castilians left Maluco by way of Portuguese India and returned to Castilla . There they related the occurrences of their voyage , and the quality and nature of the islands of Maluco and of the other islands that they had seen. @# Afterward as King Don Felipe II , our sovereign , considered it inadvisable for him to desist from that same enterprise , and being informed by Don Luys de Velasco , viceroy of Nueva Espana , and by Fray Andres de Urdaneta of the Augustinian order  --  who had been in Maluco with the fleet of Comendador Loaisa , while a layman  --  that this voyage might be made better and quicker by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fray Andres de Urdaneta left the court for Nueva Espania , 13 for , as he was so experienced and excellent a cosmographer , he offered to go with the fleet and to discover the return voyage . The viceroy equipped a fleet and its crew with the most necessary things in Puerto de la Navidad , in the southern sea , under charge of a worthy and reliable man , Miguel Lopez de Legazpi , a citizen of Mexico and a native of the province of Guipuzcoa . On account of the viceroy ' s death , the Audiencia which was governing in his place completed arrangements for the despatching of Legazpi , and gave him instructions as to his destination , with orders not to open them until three hundred legues at sea ; for there were differences among members of the fleet , some saying that they would better go to Nueva Guinea , others to the Luzones , and others to Maluco . Miguel Lopez de Legazpi left Puerto de la Navidad in the year one thousand five hundred and sixty-four , with five ships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four other religious of the Order of St. Augustine . After sailing westward for several days , he opened his instructions , and found that he was ordered to go to the islands of Luzones and there endeavor to pacify them and reduce them to the obedience of his Majesty , and to make them accept the holy Catholic faith. 14 He continued his voyage until reaching the island of Sebu , where he anchored , induced by the convenience of a good port and by the nature of the land . At first he was received peacefully by the natives and by their chief Tupas ; but later they tried to kill him and his companions , for the Spaniards having seized their provisions , the natives took up arms against the latter ; but the opposite to their expectations occurred , for the Spaniards conquered and subdued them . Seeing what had happened in Sebu , the natives of other neighboring islands came peacefully before the adelantado , rendered him homage , and supplied his camp with a few provisions . The first of the Spanish settlements was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sanctisimo Nombre de Jesus Most holy name of Jesus , 15 because a carved image of Jesus had been found in one of the houses of the natives when the Spaniards conquered the latter , which was believed to have been left there by the fleet of Magallanes . The natives held the image in great reverence , and it wrought miracles for them in times of need . The Spaniards placed it in the monastery of St. Augustine , in that city. @# That same year the adelantado despatched the flagship of his fleet to Nueva Espana , with the relation and news of what had happened during the voyage , and of the settlement in Sebu . He requested men and supplies in order to continue the pacification of the other islands . Fray Andres de Urdaneta and his associate , Fray Andres de Aguirre , sailed in the vessel. @# One of the ships which left Puerto de la Navidad in company with the fleet and under command of Don Alonso de Arellano , carried as pilot one Lope Martin , a mulatto and a good sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the islands , it left the fleet and went among them ahead of the other vessels . There they bartered for provisions , and , without awaiting the adelantado , returned to Nueva Espana by a northerly course  --  either because of their slight gratification at having made the voyage to the islands , or to gain the reward for having discovered the return passage . They soon arrived and declared that they had seen the islands and discovered the return voyage . They alleged various reasons for their coming , but brought no message from the adelantado , or news of what had happened to him . Don Alonso de Arellano was well received by the Audiencia which was governing , where the rewarding of him and his pilot was considered . This would have been done , had not the adelantado ' s flagship arrived during this time , after having made the same voyage . It brought an authentic account of events , of the actual state of affairs , and of the settlement of Sebu . Moreover , they related that Don Alonso de Arellano , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had preceded the fleet with his ship at the entrance of the islands , and was seen no more . They said also that , besides those islands which had peacefully submitted to his Majesty , there were many others , large and rich , well-inhabited , and abounding in food and gold . They hoped to pacify and reduce those islands with the reenforcements requested . They said that the adelantado had named all the islands Filipinas , 16 in honor of his Majesty . Reenforcements were immediately sent to the adelantado , and have been sent every year , as necessity has demanded , so that the land has been conquered and maintained. @# The adelantado heard that there were other islands near Sebu , abounding in provisions , and accordingly sent some Spaniards thither to reduce the natives to peace , and bring back rice for the camp . Thus he relieved his necessity and maintained himself as well as possible until , having gone to the island of Panay , he sent Martin de Goiti , his master-of-camp , and other captains thence to the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the guidance of a native chief of the latter island , called Maomat , to try to pacify it and reduce it to the obedience of his Majesty . When they reached the bay of Manila , they found its settlement on the seashore , near a large river , and under the rule and protection of a chief called Rajamora . Opposite , on the other side of the river , was another large settlement named Tondo , which was likewise held by another chief named Rajamatanda. 17 These settlements were fortified with palm-trees and stout arigues 18 filled in with earth , and very many bronze culverins and other pieces of larger bore . Martin de Goiti , having begun to treat with the chiefs and their people concerning the peace and submission which he demanded , found it necessary to come to blows with them . The Spaniards entered the land by force of arms , and took it , together with the forts and artillery , on the day of St. Potenciana , May nineteen , one thousand five hundred and seventy-one. 19 Upon this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many others of the same island of Luzon did the same. 20 @# When the news of the taking of Manila and of the Spanish settlement there reached Panay , Adelantado Legazpi set in order the affairs of Sebu and other islands which he had subdued , entrusted their natives to the most reliable soldiers , and having taken the most necessary precautions for the government of those provinces , which are commonly called Bicayas de los Pintados , 21 because the natives of them have all their bodies marked with fire , went to Manila with the remainder of his men . He was well received there , and established afresh with the natives and their chiefs the peace , alliance , and homage , which had been given . On the very site of Manila , of which Rajamora made a donation to the Spaniards for their settlement , the adelantado founded his town and colony , on account of its strength and its situation in a well-provisioned district , and in the midst of all the other islands . He left it its name of Manila which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the city , the governor established therein his seat and residence , and fortified it with special care . He paid more attention to the above , in order to make this new settlement the seat of government , than to the temperature , and width of the site , which is hot and narrow from having the river on one side of the city and the bay on the other , while at the back are to be found large swamps and marshes , which make the place very strong. @# From this post he continued to prosecute the pacification of the other provinces of this great island of Luzon and of surrounding districts . Some submitted voluntarily ; others were conquered by force of arms or by the efforts of the religious , who have sown the good seed of the holy gospel therein . Various of them have labored valiantly in this , not only in the time and administration of Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi , but also in that of the governors that have succeeded him . The land was apportioned among its conquerors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the settlements of cities and towns which had been founded , and other special encomiendas , were assigned to the royal crown , for the necessities that arise and the expenses of the royal exchequer . The affairs of government and the conversion of the natives were treated as was necessary . Ships were provided for the annual voyage to Nueva Espana , which return with the usual supplies . Thus the condition of the Filipinas Islands has reached its present known height in both spiritual and temporal matters. @# Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi , as above-said , discovered the islands , colonized them , and made a good beginning in the work of pacification and subjugation . He founded the city of Sanctisimo Nombre de Jesus in the provinces of Pintados , and then the city of Manila in the island of Luzon . In this island he conquered the province of Ylocos , in whose settlement and port called Vigan , he founded a Spanish colony , to which he gave the name of Villa Fernandina. 23 He also pacified the province of Pangasinan and the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives were to pay throughout the islands , 24 and made many ordinances concerning their government and conversion , until his death in the year one thousand five hundred and seventy-four , at Manila , where his body was buried in the monastery of St. Augustine. 25 @# At his death , there was found among his papers a sealed despatch from the Audiencia of Mexico , which was governing when the fleet left Nueva Espania , appointing a successor to the government , in case of the death of the adelantado . By virtue of this despatch , Guido de Labazarris , formerly a royal official , took the office and was obeyed . He continued the conversion and pacification of the islands with great wisdom , valor , and system , and governed them. @# During his term the pirate Limahon came from China , and attacked Manila with a fleet of seventy large war-ships and many soldiers . He entered the city , and , after killing the master-of-camp , Martin de Goiti , with other Spaniards who were at his house , marched against the fort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken refuge , with the intention of seizing and subjecting the country . The Spaniards , reinforced from Vigan by Captain Joan de Salzedo and his soldiers  --  for Salzedo saw this pirate pass his coasts , and brought the reinforcement to Manila  --  defended themselves so bravely that , after having killed many of Limahon ' s men , they forced him to reembark , to leave the bay in flight , and to take refuge in Pangasinan River . The Spaniards went thither in search of him and burned his fleet. 26 For many days they besieged this pirate on land , but he , taking flight in small boats that he made there secretly , put to sea and abandoned the islands. @# During the government of this same Guido de Labazarris , trade and commerce were established between Great China and Manila . Merchant ships came every year and the governor received them kindly , and as a consequence commerce has been growing ever since. @# This same governor apportioned all the pacified land in the island of Luzon and surrounding islands , to the conquerors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Betis and Lubao in the province of Pampanga , besides others of some importance . The succeeding government dispossessed him of these towns ; but afterward his Majesty , on account of his good services , granted them all to him , and he enjoyed them , together with the office of master-of-camp of the islands , as long as he lived. @# @# ? The administration of Doctor Francisco de Sande , and the events of the Filipinas Islands during his term. @# ? CHAPTER SECOND @# When the news of the entrance and conquest of the Filipinas Islands by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi , and of his death , reached Espania , his Majesty appointed as governor and captain-general of the islands , Doctor Francisco de Sande , a native of Caceres , and alcalde of the Audiencia of Mexico . The latter journeyed thither , and took over his government in the year one thousand five hundred and seventy-five. @# During this administration , the pacification of the islands was continued , especially that of the province of Camarines , by Captain Pedro Chaves , who often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and received their submission . A Spanish colony was founded there which was called the city of Caceres . Among other enterprises , the governor made in person the expedition to the island of Borneo with a fleet of galleys and frigates. 27 With these he attacked and captured the enemy ' s fleet , which had come out to meet him . He captured also the principal settlement , where the king of the island had his house and residence , but after a few days he abandoned it and returned to Manila , on account of sickness among the crews , and his inability to support and care for the Spaniards in that island . On the way back , and by his orders , Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa entered the island of Jolo ; he came to blows with the natives and their chief , whom he conquered , and the latter rendered him acknowledgment and submission in the name of his Majesty . Thence he went to the island of Mindanao which he explored , reconnoitering its river and chief settlements . On his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been pacified , to friendship and alliance with the Spaniards . The governor despatched the ship " San Juanillo " to Nueva Espana , under command of Captain Juan de Ribera , but it was lost at sea and never heard of again. @# Doctor Sande remained until Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Penalosa came from Espania as the new governor and captain-general . After his residencia the doctor returned to Nueva Espana to fill the office of auditor of Mexico. @# @# ? Of the administration of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Penalosa , and of Diego Ronquillo , who filled the office because of the former ' s death. @# ? CHAPTER THIRD @# Because of the many accounts that had reached the court of his Majesty concerning the affairs of the Filipinas , and because of their need of being supplied with settlers and soldiers to pacify them , an arrangement was made with Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Penalosa , a native of Arevalo , and chief alguacil of the Audiencia of Mexico , who was residing at court , so that it might be done better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this arrangement he was to be governor of the Filipinas for life and was to take six hundred married and single men from the kingdoms of Castilla to the Filipinas . His Majesty granted him certain assistance and facilities for this purpose , together with other favors as a reward for this service. @# Don Gonzalo prepared for the voyage , raised his people , and embarked them in the port of San Lucas Barremeda , but , as the fleet left the bar , one of his ships was wrecked . He returned in order to repair his losses , and , although he took less than at first , he made his journey to the mainland , and at Panama , embarked his people in the South Sea , and set sail for the Filipinas , where he arrived and took over the government , in the year one thousand five hundred and eighty. @# Don Gonzalo Ronquillo founded a Spanish town in the island of Panay , in Oton , which he named Arevalo . During his term , the trade with the Chinese increased , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the Chinese could bring and sell their merchandise . He tried to discover a return passage from the islands to Nueva Espana , by way of the south , for which purpose he sent his cousin , Captain Don Juan Ronquillo del Castillo . The latter could not effect this , for after sailing for some time , until finding himself near Nueva Guinea , he could go no farther , on account of many severe storms , and returned to the Filipinas . In like manner , Don Gonzalo sent another ship , under command of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Vallesteros , to Peru , with some merchandise , in order to obtain certain goods from those provinces which he said that the Filipinas needed . This vessel returned from Peru after the death of the governor . The latter imposed the two per cent duty on the merchandise exported to Nueva Espana , and the three per cent duty on the goods imported by the Chinese to the Filipinas . Although he was censured for having done this without his Majesty ' s orders , these duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# During this same term , as his Majesty had succeeded to the kingdoms of Portugal , and had ordered the governor of Manila to maintain good relations with the chief captain of the fortress of the island of Tidore , in Maluco , and to assist him when necessary , he sent a fleet and soldiers thither from Manila , under command of Captain Don Juan Ronquillo del Castillo . This he did at the request of Diego de Azambuja , chief captain of Tidore , for the expedition and conquest of the island of Terrenate . But after reaching Maluco , the expedition did not succeed in its object. 28 Thenceforward supplies of men and provisions continued to be sent from the Filipinas to the fortress of Tidore. @# During this same administration , the province of Cagayan in the island of Luzon , opposite China , was first pacified 29 by Captain Joan Pablos de Carrion , who founded there a Spanish colony , which he named Nueva Segovia . He also drove a Japanese pirate 30 from that place , who had seized the port with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Don Gonzalo Ronquillo had entered into the government , he sent Captain Gabriel de Ribera with a small fleet , consisting of one galley and several frigates , to explore the coast and settlements of the island of Borneo , with orders to proceed thence to the kingdom of Patan on the mainland , where pepper is produced . The captain having coasted along and reconnoitered Borneo , returned with his fleet to Manila , on account of the advanced season and lack of provisions . Thence the governor sent him to Espana , with authority from himself and from the islands , to confer with his Majesty upon several matters that he desired to see carried out , and upon others which would prove advantageous to the islands. 31 The captain found his Majesty in Portugal , gave him a few pieces of gold and other curiosities which he had brought for that purpose , and stated the matters of which he had come to treat . The result was that his Majesty , among other favors , appointed him marshal of Bonbon , for his hardships during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of which he had come to treat. @# It was during the administration of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo , that the first bishop of the Filipinas was appointed , in the person of Don Fray Domingo de Salazar , of the Dominican order , a man of great learning and piety . As soon as he arrived in the islands , he took upon himself the management and jurisdiction of ecclesiastical affairs , which were at first in charge of the Augustinian friars who had come at the time of the conquest , and afterwards of the discalced Franciscan religious , who had arrived at the time of the conversion . The bishop erected his cathedral in the city of Manila , by apostolic bulls , with prebends paid by the royal exchequer , until there should be tithes and ecclesiastical revenues to maintain themselves . Moreover , he provided whatever else was necessary for the service and decoration of the church , and for the divine worship which is celebrated there with great solemnity and display . Don Fray Domingo de Salazar took Antonio Sedeno and Alonso Sanchez , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . They were the first to establish that order in the Filipinas , which , since that time , has been steadily growing , to the great profit and fruit of the teaching and conversion of the natives , consolation of the Spaniards , and the education and teaching of their children in the studies which they pursue. @# Don Gonzalo Ronquillo was in such poor health from the day on which he entered upon his administration , that he died in the year one thousand five hundred and eighty-three , and his body was buried in the monastery of St. Augustine in Manila. @# His kinsman , Diego Ronquillo , by virtue of his appointment through a decree of his Majesty , succeeded him in the governorship ; this man continued what Don Gonzalo had commenced , especially in the assistance for Maluco and pacification for other islands. @# During the same term of Diego Ronquillo , a fire broke out in the city of Manila , which started at midday in the church of the convent of St. Augustine , while the doors of the church were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city was burned in a few hours , as it was built of wood . There was great loss of goods and property , and some persons were in danger . The city was rebuilt with great difficulty and labor , leaving the Spaniards very poor and needy. 32 @# The main result of the matters treated at court by Mariscal Gabriel de Ribera was ( although at that time the death of Governor Don Gonzalo Ronquillo was unknown ) to order the establishment of a royal Audiencia in the city of Manila , whose president was to be governor and captain-general of all the Filipinas . In view of this , the necessary instructions were issued , and the presidency given to Doctor Sanctiago de Vera , alcalde of the Audiencia of Mexico , and a native of the town of Alcala de Henares . He went to the islands with the usual reenforcements from Nueva Espana , taking with him the royal seal of the Audiencia , the auditors whom his Majesty was sending , the fiscal , and other officials and assistants of the said Audiencia . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Rojas , and Gaspar de Ayala  --  the latter as fiscal . At the end of two years , Don Antonio de Ribera went as third auditor. @# @# ? Of the administration of Doctor Sanctiago de Vera , and of the establishment of the Manila Audiencia , and until its suppression ; and of events during his term. @# ? CHAPTER FOURTH @# The president and auditors arrived at the Filipinas in the month of May , in the year 1584 , while Diego Ronquillo was governing . Doctor Sanctiago de Vera entered upon his office , and immediately established the Audiencia . The royal seal was received and deposited with all possible solemnity and festivity . Then they began to attend to the affairs both of justice and of war and government , to the great profit of the country . At this time new reenforcements were sent to Maluco for the conquests that the chief captain of Tidore intended to make of the island of Terrenate . Captain Pedro Sarmiento 33 went from Manila for this purpose , and on another occasion the captain and sargento-mayor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with the desired result. @# President Sanctiago de Vera also continued the pacification of several provinces of the islands , and did many things , which proved advantageous in every respect . He discovered a rebellion and insurrection which the native chiefs of Manila and Pampanga had planned against the Spaniards , and justice was done the guilty. 35 He built with stone the fortress of Nuestra Senora de Guia Our Lady of Guidance , within the city of Manila on the land side , and for its defense he caused some artillery to be founded by an old Indian , called Pandapira , a native of the province of Panpanga . The latter and his sons rendered this service for many years afterward , until their deaths. @# During the administration of President Sanctiago de Vera , the Englishman Thomas Escander , 36 entered the South Sea through the Strait of Magallanes ; on the coast of Nueva Espana , close to California , he had captured the ship " Santa Ana , " which was coming from the Filipinas laden with a quantity of gold and merchandise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering through the province of Pintados , he came in sight of the town of Arevalo and of the shipyard where a galleon was being built for the navigation of the Nueva Espana line . Wishing to burn this vessel , he made the attempt , but he was resisted by Manuel Lorenzo de Lemos , who was supervising its construction . The Englishman passed on , and went to India , whence he took his course to Inglaterra , having followed the same route which the Englishman Francisco Draque Francis Drake 37 had taken several years before . The latter had , in like manner , passed through the Strait of Magallanes to the Peruvian coast , where he made many prizes. @# At this time , the Audiencia and the bishop thought it advisable that some person of sufficient and satisfactory qualities should be sent to Espana , to the court of his Majesty , to give a thorough and detailed account of the state of affairs in the Filipinas Islands , and to request that some necessary measures might be taken concerning them . The court was especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Audiencia could be dispensed with , for it was a heavy burden to all estates , because of the newness of the country . The person of Father Alonso Sanches , of the Society of Jesus , a learned man , and one well informed concerning the country , and very active in business , was chosen for this purpose . Instructions were given him , and authority to act for all estates , religious orders , and communities , as to what he was to treat and request in Espana , and at the court of his Holiness in Roma , where he was also to go. 38 This father reached Madrid , and after having conferred with his Majesty several times respecting those things of which he thought fit to treat and to make requests , went to Roma , where he introduced himself as the ambassador of all the estates of the Filipinas , and on their behalf he kissed the foot , and visited the pontiffs who ruled during that time , after the death of Sixtus the Fifth . Having received from them favors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Filipinas , he returned to Espana , where again he solicited a decision on the business which he had left under discussion when he went to Roma . His Majesty listened to the messages that he brought from the pontiffs , and lent him a favorable ear concerning the affairs of the islands . In private audiences the father made the king understand his requests , and decide them to his own satisfaction . But as soon as the despatches reached the Filipinas , much of their contents appeared outside the intention and expectation of both bishop and Audiencia , and the city , citizens , and encomenderos . They appeared even detrimental to the inhabitants of the islands , and therefore they expressed their displeasure toward Father Alonso Sanches , who was still in Espana . The father negotiated for the suppression of the Audiencia of Manila , and the appointment of a new governor ; and in begging such an one , the same father , because of his friendly relations with him , proposed one Gomez Perez Dasmarinas , who had been corregidor of Leon and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court , and corregidor-elect of Logrono and Calahorra . His Majesty appointed him governor and captain-general of the Filipinas , and increased the annual salary of his office to ten thousand Castilian ducados . Moreover , he made him a knight of the Order of Sanctiago , and gave him a large sum of money with which to meet the expenses of the voyage . He was provided with the necessary despatches , both for the exercise of his office , and for the suppression of the Audiencia of Manila , and the establishment of a camp of four hundred paid soldiers with their officers , at his Majesty ' s expense , for the garrison and defense of the land . His Majesty ordered him to sail immediately for Nueva Espana in the ships on which Viceroy Don Luis de Velasco sailed in the year one thousand five hundred and eighty-nine , who was going to govern that country. @# Gomez Perez Dasmarinas left Mexico as soon as possible , and with what ships , soldiers , and captains he needed , sailed for the Filipinas , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thousand five hundred and ninety. @# @# ? Of the administration of Gomez Perez Dasmarinas , and of Licentiate Pedro de Rojas , who was elected by the city of Manila to act as governor , on account of the former ' s death , until Don Luis Dasmarinas was received as the successor of Gomez Perez , his father. @# ? CHAPTER FIFTH @# As soon as Gomez Perez Dasmarinas reached the Filipinas , he was received as governor with universal acclaim . He suppressed the Audiencia , and the residencias of its president , auditors , fiscal , and other officials were taken by Licentiate Herver del Coral , whom Viceroy Don Luys de Velasco had sent for that purpose , by virtue of a royal decree received to that effect . The new governor inaugurated his rule by establishing the paid garrison , and by executing , with great enthusiasm and zeal , many and various things , for which he possessed royal orders and instructions , not shrinking from any kind of labor , or taking any care of himself . His first labor was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assiduously , that it was almost completed before his death. 39 He also built a cavalier on the promontory of Manila where the old wooden fort , which he called Sanctiago , formerly stood , and fortified it with some artillery . He razed to the ground the fort of Nuestra Senora de Guia , which his predecessor had built ; he built of stone the cathedral of Manila , and encouraged the inhabitants of the city who had shortly before begun to build , to persevere in building their houses of stone , a work which the bishop was the first to begin in the building of his house . During his term he increased trade with China , and regulated better the navigation of Nueva Espana , and the despatch of vessels in that line . He built some galleys for the defense of the coast , pacified the Zambales , who had revolted , and ordered his son Don Luys Dasmarinas , of the habit of Alcantara , to make an incursion with troops from Manila into the interior of the island of Luzon , 40 by crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen by Spaniards , until he arrived at Cagayan . He built also an artillery foundry in Manila , where , for want of expert founders , but few large pieces were turned out. @# In the first year of his administration , he sent the president and auditors of the suppressed Audiencia to Espana . Licentiate Pedro de Rojas , the senior auditor , remained with the governor by order of his Majesty , as lieutenant-assessor in matters of justice , until some years later appointed alcalde in Mexico. @# During Gomez Perez ' s administration , the relations and peace existing between the Japanese and the Spaniards of the Filipinas began to become strained ; for hitherto Japanese vessels had gone from the port of Nangasaqui to Manila for some years , laden with their flour and other goods , where they had been kindly received , and despatched . But Taicosama , 41 lord of all Xapon , was incited through the efforts of Farandaquiemon  --  a Japanese of low extraction , one of those who came to Manila  --  to write in a barbarous and arrogant manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening to come with a fleet and troops to lay waste the country . But , between demands and replies , several years were spent , until at last Taico died. 42 @# While Xapon was causing the governor some anxiety , the king of Camboja sent him an embassy by the Portuguese Diego Belloso , who brought a present of two elephants and offers of friendship and trade with his kingdom , and implored aid against Sian  --  which was threatening Camboja . The governor answered the king , and sent him a horse , with a few emeralds and other objects , but postponed until later what related to aid , and thanked him for his friendship . This was the origin of the events and the expeditions made later from Manila to the kingdoms of Sian and Camboja , on the mainland of Asia. @# From the moment that Gomez Perez received his charge in Espana , he had cherished the desire to lead an expedition from Manila to conquer the fort of Terrenate in Maluco , on account of the great importance of this enterprise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other occasions . He was constantly making necessary arrangements for undertaking this expedition , but so secretly that he declared it to no one , until , in the year ninety-three , seeing that the preparations for his intention appeared sufficient , he declared his purpose , and made ready to set out in person , with more than nine hundred Spaniards and two hundred sail , counting galleys , galliots , frigates , vireys , and other craft . He left the war affairs of Manila and of the islands , with a few troops  --  although insufficient for the city ' s defense  --  in charge of Diego Ronquillo , his master-of-camp ; and those of administration and justice to Licentiate Pedro de Rojas . He also sent his son , Don Luys Dasmarinas , forward with the rest of the fleet , as his lieutenant in the office of captain-general , to the provinces of Pintados , whence they were to sail ; while he himself remained in Manila making his final preparations and arming a galley of twenty-eight benches , in which he was to sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pay , 43 whom , in order to win their good will , he would not allow to be chained , and even winked at their carrying certain weapons . About forty Spaniards embarked on the galley , and the galley itself was accompanied by a few frigates and smaller vessels , in which private individuals embarked . The governor sailed from the port of Cabit , in the month of October , one thousand five hundred and ninety-three , for the provinces of Pintados , where they were to join the fleet which was awaiting them there , and to proceed to Maluco . In the afternoon of the second day of the voyage , they reached the island of Caca , 44 twenty-four legues from Manila , and close to the coast of the same island of Luzon , at a place called Punta del Acufre Sulphur Point , where there is a strong head wind . The galley tried to round this point by rowing , but being unable to make any headway until the wind should drop , they anchored and spread an awning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the galley went in closer to the shore in sight of the galley , and awaited it there. @# The governor and those who accompanied him passed the night playing on the poop , until the end of the first watch . After the governor had gone into his cabin to rest , the other Spaniards went also to their quarters 45 for the same purpose , leaving the usual guards in the midship gangway , and at the bow and stern . The Chinese rowers , who had three days before that conspired to seize the galley whenever a favorable opportunity presented itself  --  in order to avoid the labor of rowing on this expedition , and their covetousness of the money , jewels , and other articles of value aboard the vessel  --  thought that they should not lose their opportunity . Having provided candles , and white shirts with which to clothe themselves , and appointed chiefs for its execution , they carried out their plan that same night , in the last watch before dawn , when they perceived that the Spaniards were asleep . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time put on their shirts , lit their candles , and catan 46 in hand , attacked the guards and the men who slept in the quarters ballesteras and in the wales , and wounding and killing them , they seized the galley . A few of the Spaniards escaped , some by swimming ashore , others by means of the galley ' s tender , which was at the stern . When the governor heard the noise from his cabin , thinking that the galley was dragging and that the crew were lowering the awning and taking to the oars , he hurried carelessly out bareheaded through the hatchway of the cabin . Several Chinese were awaiting him there and split his head with a catan . Thus wounded he fell down the stairs into his cabin , and the two servants whom he kept there , carried him to his bed , where he immediately died . The servants met the same fate from the stabs given them through the hatch . The only surviving Spaniards in the galley were Juan de Cuellar , the governor ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were sleeping in the cabin amidships , and who remained there without coming out ; nor did the Chinese , thinking that there were more Spaniards , dare to go in until next day , when they took the two men out and later put them ashore on the coast of Ylocos , in the same island of Luzon , in order that the natives might allow them to take water on shore , which they badly needed. @# Although the Spaniards who were in the other vessels , close to the land , perceived the lights and heard the noise made in the galley from their ships , they thought that some work was being done ; and when shortly afterward , they learned what was happening from those who had escaped by swimming , they could render no assistance and kept still , as everything was lost , and they were few and not in sufficient force therefor . They waited for the morning , and when it began to dawn , they saw that the galley had already set its bastard , and was sailing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue it. @# The galley sailed with a favorable wind all along the coast of the island until leaving it . It took some water at Ylocos , where the secretary and the religious were abandoned . The Chinese tried to make for China , but not being able to fetch it , they ported in the kingdom of Cochinchina , where the king of Tunquin seized their cargo and two large pieces of artillery which were intended for the expedition of Maluco , the royal standard , and all the jewels , money , and articles of value ; the galley he left to drift ashore , and the Chinese dispersed and fled to different provinces . Governor Gomez Perez met this unfortunate death , whereupon the expedition and enterprise to Maluco , which the governor had undertaken , ceased also . Thus ended his administration , after he had ruled somewhat more than three years. @# Among other despatches which Gomez Perez Dasmarinas brought from Espana there was an order from his Majesty which authorized him to appoint the person whom he thought best to succeed him in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoint his successor . He showed this order to several of the most important persons of the island , giving each one to understand that he would be appointed , especially to Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa , an inhabitant of Pintados , a rich man of merit , and one of the first conquerors of the land . To him the governor showed an appointment drawn in his favor . He made use of the captain on all occasions and had him go with himself to Maluco . The news of the seizure of the galley was soon known in Manila . The citizens and soldiers that had remained there , assembled at the house of Licentiate Pedro de Rojas , to discuss advisable measures . First of all they elected the latter governor and captain-general . Then they sent Captain Don Juan Ronquillo del Castillo and other captains with two frigates ( for there were no other vessels ) in pursuit of the galley , a fruitless attempt , for the galley was nowhere to be seen . The new governor also sent a message to Don Luis Dasmarinas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perez in Pintados , informing him of the latter ' s death and of what had happened , as well as of his own recent election to affairs of government . He also ordered them to return with all speed to Manila , for the city was left almost deserted , and without the necessary precautions for any emergency. @# The news caused great grief in the fleet . Don Luys Dasmarinas and Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa , each in his own heart , was certain that he was to become governor , taking it for granted that the governor had nominated him for the office . With this hope , both of them with the best ships and crews of the fleet , set sail together for Manila with the utmost speed. @# Licentiate Pedro de Rojas , anxious about this provision , which the governor would leave among his papers and drawers deposited in the monastery of St. Augustine in Manila , in the possession of Fray Diego Munoz , prior and commissary of the Holy Office , made the effort to gain possession of them . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the said provision , for the prior had anticipated him and set aside one of the drawers , in which the provision was supposed to be found , to await Don Luys Dasmarinas ' s arrival in the city . Juan de Cuellar , who had escaped from the galley , arrived from the province of Ylocos , and testified that an appointment for the succession to the governorship had been made by Gomez Perez , but he did not state whom ; or among what papers the nomination could be found . Thereupon the licentiate Pedro de Rojas and those devoted to him became more anxious. @# Forty days passed in this manner , at the end of which Don Luis appeared in the bay near the city , accompanied by Estevan Rodriguez and many men ; and there he anchored , not choosing to enter the city , or to disembark . He caused a search to be made for the papers kept in St. Augustine , and among them was found the royal order and the nomination of Don Luys Dasmarinas to succeed to the governorship . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , changing their ideas , and notwithstanding some opposition from the partisans of Licentiate Rojas , summoned Don Luys Dasmarinas to the municipal house and placed him in possession of the government . The same was done by the soldiers whom Don Luys had with him , and by the fleet . Each day brought a new disappointment to Licentiate Rojas , who returned to his office of lieutenant-assessor , after a rule of forty days. @# If the death of Governor Gomez Perez Dasmarinas was an unfortunate event , both for the loss of his person and for the loss of a so good opportunity for the conquest of Terrenate , when all were certain of success , the return of the fleet and the arrival of the troops in the city was none the less a fortunate event , for , not many days after  --  having anticipated their usual time for the voyage  --  there arrived in Manila many Chinese ships which carried many men and little merchandise , and seven mandarins bearing the insignia of their office . This gave sufficient motive for suspecting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maluco and of the city ' s lack of defense , and that they had therefore come on this occasion to try to seize the country . But they desisted from the attempt when they found the city with more troops than ever . They returned to China without showing any other particular motive for coming , and without either side showing that their motives were understood ; except that Governor Don Luys was watchful and on his guard . He took the proper measures , especially those concerning the Chinese , and their settlement and Parian. @# No ships went to Nueva Espana from the Filipinas that year , because Governor Gomez Perez , before starting on the expedition to Maluco , had sent there the vessels " San Felipe " and " San Francisco , " both of which , on account of heavy storms , had to put back , the " San Felipe " to the port of Sebu and the " San Francisco " to Manila , and they were unable to resail until the following year . It was suspected in Nueva Espana that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ships , and persons were not wanting to affirm more than had really happened ; nor was it possible at the same time  --  in the town of Mexico  --  to ascertain whence the news had emanated . This was very shortly known in Espana , by way of India , letters having been sent to Venecia Venice , through Persia ; and immediately they set about appointing a new governor. @# In the first year of the government of Gomez Perez Dasmarinas , the need of an Audiencia began to be felt by many , upon their seeing all the power vested in one man , and that there was no one to whom they could apply for remedy for certain cases. 47 He who felt this most keenly was Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar , who had had certain differences and disputes with the governor , which obliged him to start for Espana , notwithstanding his advanced age . The governor readily gave him leave for that year , and a vessel for the voyage , in order to rid himself of him ; but at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fray Francisco de Ortega of the Augustinian order to court , to meet whatever the bishop might allege and to defend his side . Both reached Espana , and each spoke as his interests demanded . The chief thing insisted upon by the bishop was a request for the reestablishment of the Audiencia , and the foundation of other bishoprics in the Filipinas , besides that of Manila , as well as other things which he thought beneficial to the spiritual and temporal welfare . In all this he was opposed by Ortega . But the authority and piety of the bishop were of such weight , that , although at first the cause that made him , at his advanced age , leave his church , and travel five thousand legues to Espana , seemed trivial , afterward he was favorably received by his Majesty and the Council and all his petitions and propositions were considered and discussed at length , and many consultations were held with his Majesty , in order to have a decision passed upon them. @# In the same year of ninety-three in which Gomez Perez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Majesty , resolved that the office of lieutenant-assessor in judicial matters , which had been filled by Licentiate Pedro de Roxas since the suppression of the Audiencia , should be made more important than formerly in order to facilitate matters ; that the title of the office should thereafter be that of lieutenant-general ; and that in judicial matters the holder of it should have authority to hear cases of appeal not exceeding the value of one thousand Castilian ducados . Thereupon Licentiate Pedro de Rojas was promoted to the office of alcalde of Mexico , and Doctor Antonio de Morga was appointed by his Majesty to take the latter ' s residencia , and to the office of lieutenant-general of the Filipinas . In the course of his journey the latter arrived at Nueva Espana in the beginning of the year ninety-four , and found that the ships which , as above said , had failed to come from the Filipinas , had not arrived . Moreover the death of Gomez Perez , and the other events that had occurred , were unknown until the arrival of Don Juan de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , in the galleon " Sanctiago , " which had been sent to the islands the year before by Viceroy Don Luys de Velasco , with the necessary supplies . He brought news of the governor ' s death and of the succession to the office by the latter ' s son , Don Luys Dasmarinas . Men and fresh supplies for the islands were prepared immediately and together with many passengers and religious from Espana , Doctor Antonio de Morga embarked in the port of Acapulco , in the galleons " San Felipe " and " Santiago , " with everything under his charge . He set sail March twenty-two of ninety-five , and arrived under fair weather in the port of Cabit , June eleven of the same year . He entered upon his office of lieutenant-general , and began to occupy himself with his duties and the other matters in his charge. @# While Don Luys Dasmarinas was governing , the suspicions and fear of Xapon continued , which , together with the Chinese trouble , kept the people in continual anxiety . The governor sent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despatches to the viceroy of Canton and to that of Chincheo , where many of the Chinese who had seized the galley and killed Governor Gomez Perez , were thought to be found . Supposing that they had gone there with the galley , the governor requested the Chinese authorities to deliver the culprits for punishment , and to restore the royal standard , artillery , and other things which had been seized . This was not obtained , for as the galley had gone to Cochinchina , and the Chinese had dispersed in so many directions , it could not be effected . However , after several days , some of the guilty Chinese were brought from Malaca to Manila , having been captured there by the chief captain , Francisco de Silva de Meneses . From these men more accurate information was derived concerning what had happened in the seizure of the galley and of the governor ' s death , and justice was dealt them. @# In the year ninety-four , when Don Luys was governor , a large junk came to the Filipinas with some Cambodians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castilian , named Blaz Ruyz de Hernan Gonzalez , and the other two Portuguese called Pantaleon Carnero and Antonio Machado . While they were in the city of Chordemuco , 48 in Camboja , with Prauncar 49 Langara , king of Camboja , the king of Sian attacked the former king with many soldiers and elephants , conquered the land , and seized the house and the treasures of the king , who , with his wife , mother , sister , and his one daughter , and two sons , fled inland to the kingdom of Lao . The king of Sian leaving some of his captains to guard Camboja returned to his home with the rest of the army , sending what booty he could not carry away by land , to Sian by sea in several junks . He captured the Portuguese and Castilians whom he found there i. e. , in Camboja , and embarked the above mentioned three with other Cambodian slaves on board this junk , besides many goods , and with a Siamese guard and a Chinese crew . While they were at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took possession of the junk , and killed and imprisoned the Siamese guards . After that the Spaniards and the Chinese came to blows as to who should have the prize and where it was to be taken . The three Spaniards overcame the Chinese , and killing most of them , took the junk to Manila with all its cargo , and the vessel was adjudged to them . Liberty was granted to the Cambodians as well as to the Chinese who had survived the fray. @# The king of Sian reached his court in the city of Odia 50 and waited for the arrival of the junk ; but seeing that it delayed longer than was necessary , he suspected that it had been seized or lost , and desired to send someone to bring him news of it and the reason for the delay . Among the prisoners he had made in Camboja was the Portuguese , Diego Belloso , who had been sent to Manila in the time of Gomez Perez Dasmarinas by King Prauncar Langara , to request his friendship and assistance against Sian which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Camboja with the governor ' s answer and present , Belloso found that the Siamese had seized the country and had occupied it . Accordingly they captured him , and the Siamese king seized the present which he carried off with the other captures to his country . This Diego Belloso , getting wind of the king ' s intention , had word sent to the latter that , if he were to send him on this business , he would go as far as Manila , since he knew that archipelago so well , and find out what had happened to the junk . At the same time he said that he would establish friendship and commerce in the king ' s name with the Spaniards , and would procure many European curiosities for him , which were to be found in Manila , especially a colored stone large enough to serve as a hilt for the two-handed sword which the king used  --  a thing which the king greatly desired on account of a smaller one that he had found among the presents , and which he carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this and had a junk prepared ; he sent in it a Siamese who was in his service , and all the other men necessary for the voyage , together with Diego Belloso . He sent two elephants to the governor of Manila , and a quantity of benzoin , ivory , and other merchandise for sale , with the proceeds of which they were to buy the curiosities mentioned by Belloso . Having set sail they encountered a storm , and the junk put in at Malaca , where they learned that the other junk of the Siamese king , for which they were looking , had been seized , and that the Spaniards who had embarked as prisoners at Camboja , had taken it with all its cargo to Manila , after killing the Siamese guards. @# At this news the Siamese king ' s servant began to look less favorably upon the journey to Manila , and accordingly , although against Belloso ' s desire , began to discharge and sell the goods in Malaca with the intention of returning immediately to Sian . One morning this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was found dead in the junk , although he had retired safe and sound the night before . Thereupon Diego Belloso became master of the situation , and after again embarking the goods and elephants on the junk , left Malaca , and journeyed to Manila . There he found Don Luys Dasmarinas acting as governor , because of his father Gomez Perez ' s death . To him he gave the present of the elephants , which he brought from the king , and told him what else had been sent . The other goods and merchandise were offered for sale by another Siamese who represented his king ' s service in the same junk. @# Belloso met Blas Ruys de Hernan Goncales and his two companions in Manila . Among them all they agreed to persuade Governor Don Luys to send a fleet to Camboja to aid King Langara who was living in exile and stripped of his kingdom . They alleged that it would be easy to restore the king to power , and that at the same time the Spaniards might gain a foothold on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence would follow other important and more considerable results . They called on the religious of the Order of St. Dominic to support them before the governor in this plan . These easily put the matter on such good footing  --  for the governor followed their advice in everything that it was decided to prepare a fleet with as many men as possible , under command of the captain and sargento-mayor , Juan Xuarez Gallinato , himself in a ship of moderate size . He was to be accompanied by two junks : one under command of Diego Belloso , and the other under that of Blas Ruyz de Hernan Goncalez , with one hundred and twenty Spaniards , some Japanese and native Indians , and all else that was necessary. @# This resolution seemed inexpedient to the majority of people in the city , both because it took so many men away , and also , because the success of the expedition seemed very doubtful . Admitting reports that the country of Camboja was in the hands of the king of Sian , who held it with sufficient forces  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition would be to make the king of Sian  --  from whom the governor had just received presents and a friendly embassy in the person of Belloso  --  their declared enemy . And without sending the king an answer they were about to take up arms against him in favor of one who was unknown to them , and from whom the Spaniards had received neither pledges nor obligations . Lieutenant-general Don Antonio de Morga and Master-of-camp Diego Ronquillo , together with other captains and influential persons , spoke of this matter to Don Luys , and even requested him in writing to desist from this expedition . But although he had no reasons on his side to satisfy them , he was so taken by the expedition , that , inasmuch as the said religious of St. Dominic upheld him , he would not change his plans . Accordingly he despatched the fleet to the kingdom of Camboja at the beginning of the year ninety-six , which is generally one week ' s voyage . On the other hand , he dismissed the Siamese who had accompanied Belloso , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siam , to whom he sent in return for his presents , some products of the country , which he thought appropriate . The Siamese , seeing that they were being sent back to their country , were satisfied , and expected no other result of their coming. @# A storm overtook the fleet , and the flagship which carried Juan Xuarez Gallinato and the majority of the Spaniards , took refuge in the strait of Sincapura near Malaca , where it remained for many days . The other two junks which carried Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz with some Spaniards , Japanese , and natives of Manila , reached Camboja with great difficulty , and Blas Ruyz , preceding Belloso , went up the river Mecon as far as the city of Chordemuco . There they learned that the mandarins of Camboja had united against the Siamese whom they had conquered and driven from the kingdom ; and that one of these mandarins , Anacaparan by name , had taken possession of the country , and was governing under the title of king , although against the will of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them thought that they had arrived in good season for the furtherance of their designs , since confusion reigned among the Cambodians , and the Siamese were out of the country . Expecting Gallinato and the flagship to arrive directly , they spent several days in Chordemuco with the permission of Anacaparan , who resided nine legues away in Sistor . Although the latter knew of the entry of these ships and their men , and that many more were coming , whose intentions he knew ; and although he thought that it would not be favorable to him : yet he dissembled with them , waiting to see what time would bring . At the same time six Chinese ships with their merchandise arrived in Chordemuco and , while they were discharging it , the Chinese being many and hating the Spaniards , behaved towards them with great arrogance and insolence . This obliged the Spaniards , for the sake of their reputation , and in order to avenge themselves for injuries received , to take up arms against the Chinese . This they did , killing many Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took offense at this , and was desirous for the Chinese to avenge themselves by his aid . To remedy this evil Fray Alonso Ximenez , 52 of the Dominican order , who accompanied the Spaniards , thought that he , together with Blas Ruys and Diego Belloso , and about fifty Spaniards , a few Japanese , and men from Luzon , should leave the rest to guard the ships in Chordemuco , and should go up in small boats to Sistor , in order to obtain an interview with Anacaparan and offer him excuses and satisfaction for the trouble that they had had with the Chinese . And in order to negotiate with him more easily , they made a letter of embassy in the name of the governor of Manila , because Gallinato carried with him the one given them by the governor . This device was of little service to them , because Anacaparan not only did not grant them audience , but after having seized their boats , kept them so hard pressed in a lodging outside the city , and so threatened that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what they had taken from them to the Chinese , that the Spaniards were quite anxious to return to Chordemuco and board their vessels for greater security . They decided to do so as best they could. @# Their necessity , and beholding themselves in this danger , encouraged them , one night , although at great risk , to leave their lodgings , and find a passage where they could cross the river to the city side . They crossed the river , arms in hand , late at night , and as silently as possible . Finding themselves near the city , and their courage and determination increasing , they entered the city and went as far as the king ' s house . They set fire to it , to the magazines , and to other buildings on their way , and threw the Cambodians into so great confusion , that that night and the following morning they killed many people , among them King Anacaparan himself . After this they thought it unwise to advance or maintain their ground , and accordingly marched back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cambodians , with arms and several elephants , started to pursue the Spaniards and overtook them before the latter reached their ships . The Spaniards defended themselves valiantly , and continued their march until embarking without the loss of a single man , while the Cambodians returned to the city with some of their men killed and wounded. @# Diego Belloso and Bias Ruiz had hardly boarded their ships , when Captain Gallinato entered Chordemuco with the flagship , by way of the river . They told him all that happened with the Chinese and Cambodians and of the favorable condition of affairs for continuing them , alleging that , since the usurper Anacaparan was dead , many Cambodians would immediately join the Spaniards in defense of the name and fame of Langara their legitimate king . But , although some of the Cambodians themselves came to visit the fleet , and assured Gallinato of the same , of the death of Anacaparan , and of the deeds of the Spaniards in Sistor , he appeared to give no credit to any of them , and could not be induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even to consider it . On the contrary he rebuked the Spaniards for what had taken place in his absence , and after depriving them of all that they had seized from the Chinese and Cambodians , put to sea in order to return to Manila . Belloso and Blas Ruiz persuaded him to go at least to Cochinchina , where the galley seized when Governor Gomez Perez was killed was said to have been taken , and where were the royal standard and the artillery carried aboard the galley , and for which he should ask . They promised , while Gallinato was making these negotiations , to go overland to the kingdom of Lao , where Langara , king of Camboja , was living , in order to restore him to his kingdom . Captain Gallinato consented to this , and sailed along the coast , until he entered the bay of Cochinchina , where , although he was apparently well received by the natives of the country , he would not disembark from his ships , but sent Gregorio de Vargas from them to visit the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to treat with him concerning the galley , the standard , and the artillery . While he was thus engaged , Gallinato allowed Blas Ruyz and Diego Belloso to go ashore to endeavor to make the journey to Lao , for he agreed easily to their request because he thus got rid of them and left them busied in this matter , so that they could not do him any ill turn in Manila in regard to leaving Camboja. @# Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz went to the king of Sinua , son of the king of Tunquin , and begged him to help them in their journey . From him they received all that was necessary , and were well treated and served until they reached the city of Alanchan , 53 capital of the kingdom of Lao , where they were kindly received by the king of the country . They found that Prauncar Langara , king of Camboja , and his elder son and daughter had died , and that only his son Prauncar survived , and the latter ' s stepmother , grandmother , and aunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrival of the Spaniards , and the death of the usurper Anacaparan . The same news was brought by a Cambodian from Chordemuco , who also added that since the death of Anacaparan , his younger son Chupinanu was reigning , that the country was entirely divided into factions , and that many upon seeing their natural and lawful king would leave Chupinanu and would join him and obey him. @# The few difficulties for the departure having been overcome by the arrival at this time of the mandarin Ocuna de Chu at Lanchan , in Lao 54 from Camboja , who had been sent by order of other mandarins and grandees of Camboja with ten praus well equipped with artillery and weapons to fetch their lawful king , it was decided to go down to Camboja . Prauncar , his grandmother , aunt , and stepmother  --  he wife of Langara  --  together with Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz , embarked and journeyed in the said boats and praus down the rivers flowing from Lao to Camboja. 55 There they found fresh disturbances in the provinces . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially two Moro Malays , Acuna La Casamana 56 and Cancona , who were in the country with a Malay army and a quantity of artillery and elephants . Prauncar was victorious on various occasions , and Chupinanu with his brothers and other rebels having died in battle , became master of almost all the provinces of his kingdom . He made Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz chiefs in war affairs , and they managed war matters until they completely established Prauncar on the throne . When the war was almost entirely ended , the king made Belloso and Blas Ruyz great chofas 57 of his kingdom , gave them two provinces , and granted them other favors , although not so many as they expected , or as he had promised while still in Lao . The chief reason for this was the stepmother , grandmother , and aunt of the king , who managed him , on account of his youth , and of his being addicted to wine , in excess even of his father Langara . The Moro Malay , Acuna Lacasamana , had great influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spaniards , he was continually opposing them , and seeking their destruction , with whom , on this account , they were always at odds . It must be understood that this Moro held unlawful relations with the wife of Langara , the stepmother of King Prauncar. @# Captain Gallinato ' s fleet remained in Cochinchina negotiating with the king of Tunquin for the royal standard and the artillery of the galley , as above stated , for the galley was lost upon that coast , and this king had the rest in his possession . The latter not only did not restore them , but entertaining Gallinato with flattering speech , was , on the contrary , planning to take from him his ships and their contents . Gallinato was secretly warned of this by one of the chief women of Cochinchina , who came to the fleet to see him , after which he kept a much more careful watch than before , and allowed no one to go ashore . But this order was of no avail with Fray Alonso Ximenez , one of the Dominican religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the expedition . When the latter went ashore , they seized and kept him there . The Cochinchinese , imagining that the fleet was off its guard , sent some fire ships against it , followed by some galleys and warboats , in order to burn it , while many men armed with arquebuses annoyed the Spaniards from the neighboring shore . The fleet succeeded in getting away from the fire and put off from shore , and resisted the enemy ' s ships with artillery , musketry , and arquebuses , thus sinking some of them . After this the Spaniards waited no longer , but leaving Fray Alonso Ximenez on shore , and two lay companions , whom he took with him , put to sea and left the bay of Cochinchina , and ran toward the Filipinas. @# While these things were happening in Camboja and Cochinchina , orders had arrived from Espana from his Majesty to conclude an agreement that Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa had made with Gomez Perez Dasmarinas , under which the former was to pacify and settle the island of Mindanao at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island for two lives 58 and other rewards . The said agreement was effected , after certain difficulties that arose were settled . Don Estevan Rodriguez prepared men and ships , and what else was necessary for the enterprise , and with some galleys , galleots , frigates , vireys , barangays , and lapis , 59 set out with two hundred and fourteen Spaniards for the island of Mindanao , in February of the same year , of ninety-six . He took Captain Juan de la Xara as his master-of-camp , and some religious of the Society of Jesus to give instruction , as well as many natives for the service of the camp and fleet. @# He reached Mindanao River , after a good voyage , where the first settlements , named Tancapan and Lumaguan , both hostile to the people of Buhahayen , received him peacefully and in a friendly manner , and joined his fleet . They were altogether about six thousand men . Without delay they advanced about eight legues farther up the river against Buhahayen , the principal settlement of the island , where its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the settlement , the fleet cast anchor , and immediately landed a large proportion of the troops with their arms . But before reaching the houses and fort , and while going through some thickets cacatal 60 near the shore , they encountered some of the men of Buhahayen , who were coming to meet them with their campilans , carazas 61 and other weapons , and who attacked them on various sides . The latter i. e. , the Spaniards and their allies , on account of the swampiness of the place and the denseness of the thickets cacatal , could not act unitedly as the occasion demanded , although the master-of-camp and the captains that led them exerted themselves to keep the troops together and to encourage them to face the natives . Meanwhile Governor Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa was watching events from his flagship , but not being able to endure the confusion of his men , seized his weapons and hastened ashore with three or four companions , and a servant who carried his helmet , in order that he might be less impeded in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickets cacatal where the fight was waging , a hostile Indian stepped out unseen from one side , and dealt the governor a blow on the head with his campilan , that stretched him on the ground badly wounded. 62 The governor ' s followers cut the Mindanao to pieces and carried the governor back to the camp . Shortly after , the master-of-camp , Juan de la Xara , withdrew his troops to the fleet , leaving behind several Spaniards who had fallen in the encounter . The governor did not regain consciousness , for the wound was very severe , and died next day . The fleet after that loss and failure left that place , and descended the river to Tampacan , where it anchored among the friendly inhabitants and their settlements. @# The master-of-camp , Juan de la Xara , had himself chosen by the fleet as successor in the government and enterprise . He built a fort with arigues and palms near Tampacan , and founded a Spanish settlement to which he gave the name of Murcia . He began to make what arrangements he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things independently of , and without acknowledging the governor of Manila , without whose intervention and assistance this enterprise could not be continued. @# @# Of the administration of Don Francisco Tello , and of the second establishment of the Audiencia of Manila ; and of occurrences during the period of this administration. @# CHAPTER SIXTH @# Governor Don Luis Dasmarinas was awaiting news from Captain Juan Xuarez Gallinato , and from Governor Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa concerning the voyage which each had made at the beginning of the year ninety-six , to Camboja and to Mindanao , when news reached Manila , in the month of June , that two ships had entered the islands by the channel of Espiritu Santo , and that they brought a new governor sent from Espana , namely , Don Francisco Tello de Guzman , knight of the Order of Sanctiago , a native of Sevilla , and treasurer of the India House of Trade . He arrived at Manila in the beginning of July and entered upon his office . It was also learned that Fray Ygnacio Sanctivanez , of the Order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province of Burgos , had been nominated in Nueva Espana as archbishop of Manila , for Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar had died in Madrid ; and that Fray Miguel de Venavides , a native of Carrion and a religious of the Order of St. Dominic , who had gone to Espana with Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar , had been appointed bishop of the city of Segovia in the province of Cagayan ; also that Fray Pedro de Agurto , of the Order of St. Augustine , a native of Mexico , had been appointed in Mexico , bishop of the city of Sanctisimo Nombre de Jesus , and that these two bishops with another for the city of Caceres , in the province of Camarines , who was not yet named , had been lately added to the Filipinas and appointed as suffragans to the archbishop of Manila , at the instance of Bishop Fray Domingo . Also it was learned that the Audiencia which had been suppressed in Manila was to be reestablished there , as well as other things which the bishop had presented at court. @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , news was brought of the death of Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa in Mindanao , by Brother Gaspar Gomez of the Society of Jesus . The latter brought the body for burial in the college of Manila , of which Don Estevan was patron . Juan de la Xara wrote that he had charge of affairs , that he had settled in Tampacan , that he intended to continue the pacification and conquest of the island as should seem most advisable , and that reenforcements of men and other things should be sent him . It was learned that he intended to make an ill use of the government , and would not remain dependent on , and subordinate to , the governor of the Filipinas ; and that he was depriving the heirs of Estevan Rodriguez of what lawfully belonged to them . It was learned that , in order to make himself safer in this respect , he was sending his confidants to the town of Arevalo in Oton where Don Estevan had left his wife , Dona Ana de Osseguera , and his two small daughters , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry him . This resolution appeared injurious in many respects , and the attempt was made to rectify matters . But in order not to disturb the affairs of Mindanao , the matter was left alone for the present , until time should show the course to be followed . And so it happened that when Juan de la Xara left the camp and settlements of Mindanao , and came hurriedly to Oton to negotiate his marriage in person  --  although the widow of Don Estevan had never been favorable to it  --  Don Francisco Tello sent men to arrest him . He was brought to Manila , where he died while his trial was being conducted. @# After the imprisonment of Juan de La Xara , Don Francisco Tello immediately sent Captain Toribio de Miranda to Mindanao , with orders to take command of the camp and to govern , until some one should agree to continue the enterprise . When he arrived at Mindanao and the soldiers saw that Juan de La Xara ' s schemes had been defeated , and that the latter was a prisoner in Manila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Miranda and the orders that he brought. @# In Manila the governor was considering carefully the necessary measures for continuing the war , since the island of Mindanao was so near the other pacified islands , and the island itself contained some provinces that professed peace and were apportioned as encomiendas , and had Spanish magistrates , such as the rivers of Butuan , Dapitan , and Caragan , so that it was desirable to pacify the whole island and subject it to his Majesty . The royal treasury was spent and could not bear the expense ; and Estevan Rodriguez had bound himself by a legal writ , to carry the war to entire completion at his own expense , in accordance with the terms of his agreement . The guardian of his children and heirs brought the matter before the court , and refused to fulfil this obligation on account of Estevan Rodriguez ' s death . In order not to lose time , for what had been commenced had to be continued in one way or another , the governor decided to prosecute it , drawing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own account or on the account of Estevan Rodriguez ' s heirs , if such should be according to law . The governor then searched for a person to go to Mindanao , and selected Don Juan Ronquillo , general of the galleys . The latter was given the necessary reenforcements of men and other things , with which he reached Mindanao . He took command of the Spanish camp and fleet which he found in Tampacan . He confirmed the peace and friendship with the chiefs and people of Tampacan and Lumaguan , restored and set in better order the Spanish settlement and fort , and began to make preparation for the war against the people of Buhahayen . He spent many days in making a few incursions into their land and attacks on their forts , but without any notable result , for the enemy were many and all good soldiers , with plenty of arquebuses 63 and artillery , and had fortified themselves in a strong position . They had many other fortifications inland and went from one to the other with impunity , whenever they wished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to so swampy a country . The latter found themselves short of provisions without the possibility of getting them in the country on account of the war , inasmuch as the camp contained many men , both Spaniards and the native servants and boatmen , and it was not easy at all times to come and go from one part to another in order to provide necessities. 64 @# Meanwhile Don Juan Ronquillo , seeing that the war was advancing very slowly and with little result , and that the camp was suffering , drew up a report of it , and sent letters in all haste to Governor Don Francisco Tello , informing him of the condition of affairs . He wrote that it would be better to withdraw the camp from Mindanao River , so that it might not perish ; and that a presidio could be established on the same island in the port of La Caldera , which could be left fortified , in order not to abandon this enterprise entirely , and so that their friends of Tampacan and Lumaguan might be kept hostile to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp and fleet would return to Manila , if permitted , for which he requested the governor to send him an order quickly . Upon the receipt of this despatch , Governor Don Francisco Tello resolved to order Don Juan Ronquillo , since the above was so and the camp could not be maintained , nor the war continued advantageously , to withdraw with his whole camp from Mindanao River . He was first to make a great effort to chastise the enemy in Buhahayen , and then to burn the Spanish settlement and fort and to go to La Caldera , fortify it , and leave there a sufficient garrison with artillery , boats , and provisions for its maintenance and service . Then he was to return to Manila with the rest of his men , after telling their friends in Tampacan that the Spaniards would shortly return to the river better equipped and in greater numbers. @# Silonga and other chiefs of Buhahayen were not neglecting their defense , since , among other measures taken , they had sent a chief to Terrenate to ask assistance against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thereupon the king of Terrenate despatched a numerous fleet of caracoas and other boats to Mindanao with cachils 65 and valiant soldiers  --  more than one thousand fighting men in all  --  and a quantity of small artillery , in order to force the Spaniards to break camp and depart , even could they do nothing else . When the news reached Buhahayen that this fleet was coming to their defense and support , they made ready and prepared to attack the Spaniards , who also having heard the same news were not careless . Consequently the latter turned their attention more to the main fort , and reduced the number of men in the smaller forts on Buquil River and other posts , mouths , and arms of the same river . These served to strengthen the garrison of the main fort and the armed galleys and other smaller craft , in order to use the latter to resist the expected attack of the enemy . The enemy having gallantly advanced to the very fort of the Spaniards with all their vessels and men , attacked and stormed it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance . The Spaniards within resisted valiantly , and those outside in the galleys on the river assisted them so effectively that together , with artillery and arquebuses , and at times in close combat with swords and campilans , they made a great slaughter and havoc among the men of Terrenate and those of Buhahayen , who were aiding the former . They killed and wounded a great number of them and captured almost all the caracoas and vessels of the enemy , so that very few boats escaped and they were pursued and burned by the Spaniards , who made many prisoners , and seized immense booty and many weapons from the enemy . As soon as possible after this , the Spaniards turned against the settlements and forts of Buhahayen where some of their results were of so great moment that the enemy , seeing themselves hard pressed and without anyone to help them , sent messages and proposals of peace to Don Juan Ronquillo , which were ended by their rendering recognition and homage , and the renewal of friendship with the people of Tampacan , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sealed it by the marriage of the greatest chief and lord of Buhahayen with the daughter of another chief of Tampacan , called Dongonlibor . Thereupon the war was apparently completely ended , provisions were now to be had , and the Spaniards with little precaution crossed and went about the country wherever they wished . The people of Buhahayen promised to dismantle all their forts immediately , for that was one of the conditions of peace . Then the Spaniards returned to their fort and settlement at Tampacan , whence Don Juan Ronquillo immediately sent despatches to Governor Don Francisco Tello , informing him of the different turn that the enterprise had taken . In view of the present condition he requested the governor to issue new instructions as to his procedure , saying that he would wait without making any change , notwithstanding the arrival of the answer which he expected to his first report , for conditions had now become so much better than before that the governor ' s decision would be different. @# The governor had already answered Don Joan Ronquillo ' s first despatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despatch arrived with news of the successes in Mindanao . Suspicious of the men in the camp who had constantly shown a desire to return to Manila , and little relish for the hardships of war , and fearing lest they would return at the arrival of the first order , executing that order and abandoning the enterprise which had reached such a satisfactory stage ; and thinking that it would be unwise to abandon the river : the governor made haste to send a second despatch immediately by various roads , ordering them to pay no attention to his first orders , but to remain in Mindanao , and that he would soon send them what was necessary for further operations. @# It seems that this message traveled slowly ; for , the first having arrived , they obeyed it without any further delay , and camp was raised and the country abandoned . To their former enemy of Buhahayen they gave as a reason that the governor of Manila had summoned them ; and to their friends of Tampacan , they said that they would leave men in La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent them from Manila . This news caused as much sorrow and sadness to the latter , as joy to the people of Buhahayen . Then after burning their fort and settlement , the Spaniards embarked all their forces as soon as possible , left the river , and went to La Caldera , twenty-four legues farther down in the direction of Manila . Having entered port , they built a fortress and left there a garrison of one hundred Spaniards , with some artillery , provisions , and boats for their use. @# At this juncture , the governor ' s second message to General Don Joan Ronquillo arrived , to which the latter replied that he was already in La Caldera , and could not return to the river . Then , without any further delay , Don Juan Ronquillo went to Manila with the balance of his fleet , by way of the provinces of Oton , and Panay . The governor , having heard of his coming , sent to arrest him on the road before he entered the city , and proceeded against him by law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without awaiting the orders he should have expected after the favorable turn that affairs had taken . Don Juan Ronquillo was set at liberty on showing a private letter from the governor , which the latter had sent him separately with the first instructions , to the effect that he should return to Manila with his troops in any event , for they were needed in the islands for other purposes ; and because of this letter Don Juan had determined not to await the second order. @# Captain and Sargento-mayor Gallinato crossed from Cochinchina to Manila in the flagship of his fleet , and informed Don Francisco Tello whom he found governing , of the events of his expedition ; and that Blas Ruyz and Diego Belloso had gone by land to Lao from Cochinchina in search of King Langara of Camboja . Thus by their absence he avoided the blame of leaving Camboja , although there were not wanting many of his own followers who angrily gave information of the opportunity that he had lost by not showing himself or staying in Camboja when he had so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done so , all that had been hoped in that kingdom would have been attained. @# The other ship of his convoy , to which the balance of his fleet had been reduced , of which he made Alferez Luys Ortiz commander , could not pursue the voyage on account of heavy storms , and put in at Malaca . Some of the Spaniards remained there , and Ortiz with the rest of the crew , was able to set sail after a few months , and returned to Manila. @# Coincident with the above , and at the beginning of Don Francisco Tello ' s administration , two Indian chiefs of the province of Cagayan , the more powerful of whom was called Magalat , were detained in Manila , because they , with their kinsmen , and others who followed their party and opinion , often incited the settlements of that province to rebellion ; and it had cost no little trouble to subdue them ; besides the daily murder of many Spaniards and other injuries inflicted upon the peaceful natives and their crops . Magalat was captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his brother and other natives , was in Manila , and unable to leave it , that province became more secure. @# Some Dominican religious bound for Segovia , the capital of that province , where they give instruction , moved with pity , persuaded the governor to let Magalat and his brother return to their country with them . To such an extent did they importune the governor , that he granted their request . Having reached Cagayan , the chiefs went inland by the Lobo River and again incited the whole country to rebellion . With the help of other chiefs of Tubigarao , and other settlements , they so stirred up things , that it was impossible to go to those settlements or a step beyond the city . Magalat was the leader of the rebels , and he committed cruel murders and injuries even upon the natives themselves , if they refused to rise against the Spaniards . This reached such a point that the governor was obliged to send the master-of-camp , Pedro de Chaves , from Manila with troops , in order that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties , the latter had so good fortune that he seized many insurgent leaders upon whom he executed justice and public punishment . As for Magalat himself , the governor caused him to be killed in his own house and land where he had fortified himself , by the hand of his own Indians , who had offered to do it for a reward ; for in no other way did it appear possible . Had Magalat not been killed , the war would have dragged on for many years , but with his death the province became quiet and the peace secure. @# In April of the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-five , Adelantado Alvaro de Mendana de Neira sailed from Callao de Lima in Peru , to colonize the Salomon Islands , which he had discovered many years before in the South Sea , 66 the principal one of which he had called San Christoval . He took four ships , two large ones  --  a flagship and an almiranta  --  a frigate , and a galliot , with four hundred men in all . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his three brothers-in-law . On the way he discovered other islands at which he did not stop ; but not finding those which he had previously discovered , and as his almiranta had been lost , he anchored with the other ships at an island near Nueva Guinea , inhabited by blacks , to which he gave the name of Santa Cruz Holy Cross . There he settled  --  little to the satisfaction of his men . The adelantado , two of his brothers-in-law , and many of his people died there . Dona Ysabel Barreto abandoned the colony , on account of sickness and want , and embarked the survivors aboard her flagship , frigate , and galliot . But while they were sailing toward the Filipinas the frigate and galliot disappeared in another direction . The flagship entered the river of Butuan , in the island of Mindanao , and reached Manila after great want and suffering . There Dona Ysabel Barreto married Don Fernando de Castro , and returned to Nueva Espana in his ship , the " San Geronymo , " in the year ninety-six . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , so that it seems fitting to reproduce literally the relation , to which Don Pedro Fernandez de Quiros , chief pilot on this voyage , affixed his signature , which is as follows. @# Relation of the voyage of Adelantado Alvaro de Mendana de Neira for the discovery of the Salomon Islands @# On Friday , the ninth of the month of April , one thousand five hundred and ninety-five , Adelantado Alvaro de Mendana set sail with his fleet for the conquest and settlement of the western islands in the South Sea , sailing from the port of Callao de Lima , which lies in twelve and one-half degrees south latitude . Laying his course toward the valleys of Santa , Truxillo , and Sana , and collecting men and provisions , he went to Paita. 67 There he took in water and numbered his forces , which amounted to about four hundred persons . Then with his four vessels , two large and two small , he left the said port , which is five degrees higher than the former port , and directed his course west-southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took Pedro Merino Manrique as master-of-camp ; his brother-in-law , Lope de la Vega , as admiral ; and Pedro Fernandez de Quiros as chief pilot . Following the above-mentioned course he sailed to the altitude of nine and one-half degrees , whence he sailed southwest by west to fourteen degrees , where he changed his course to northwest by west . On Friday , the twenty-first of the month of July , having reached an altitude of ten long degrees , we sighted an island to which the general gave the name of Madalena. 68 From a port of this island , about seventy canoes came out , each containing three men , or thereabout , while some came swimming and others on logs . There were more than four hundred Indians , white and of a very agreeable appearance , tall and strong , large-limbed , and so well made that they by far surpassed us. 69 They had fine teeth , eyes , mouth , hands and feet , and beautiful long flowing hair , while many of them were very fair . Very handsome youths were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered no part . Their bodies , legs , arms , hands , and even some of their faces , were all marked after the fashion of these Bissayans . And indeed , for a barbarous people , naked , and of so little reason , one could not restrain himself , at sight of them , from thanking God for having created them . And do not think this exaggeration , for it was so . These people invited us to their port , and were in turn invited to our flagship , and about forty of them came aboard . In comparison with them we appeared to be men of less than ordinary size . Among them was one who was thought to be a palmo taller than the tallest man of our fleet , although we had in the fleet men of more than average height . The general gave some of them shirts and other things , which they accepted with much pleasure , dancing after their fashion and calling others . But being annoyed at the liberties that they took , for they were great thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to frighten them . When they heard it they all swam ashore , seized their weapons , and at the sound of a conch threw a few stones at the ships and threatened us with their lances , for they had no other weapons . Our men fired their arquebuses at them from the ships and killed five or six of them , whereat they stopped . Our fleet sailed on and we discovered three other islands . This island has a circumference of about six legues . We passed it on its southern side . On that side it is high and slopes precipitously to the sea , and has mountainous ravines where the Indians dwell . There seemed to be many inhabitants , for we saw them on the rocks and on the beach . And so we continued our course to the other three islands . The first , to which was given the name San Pedro , is about ten legues from Magdalena , and like it extends northwest by north . It has a circumference of about three legues . The island is beautiful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertain whether it was inhabited or not , for we did not stop there . To the southeast and about five legues from it lies another island to which the general gave the name of Dominica . It is very sightly , and to all appearances thickly populated , and has a circumference of about fifteen legues . To the south and a little more than one legua from it lies another island with a circumference of about eight legues , which received the name of Sancta Cristina . Our fleet passed through the channel that separates the one island from the other , for all that we saw of these islands is clear sailing . On the west side of Sancta Cristina , a good port was found , and there the fleet anchored. 70 These Indians did not seem to me to resemble the first ; but many beautiful women were seen . I did not see the latter , but some who did assured me that in their opinion , they are as beautiful as the women in Lima , but light complexioned and not so tall  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles of food seen in that port were swine and fowl , sugar-cane , excellent bananas , cocoanuts , and a fruit that grows on high trees . Each of the last is as large as a good-sized pineapple , and is excellent eating . Much of it was eaten green , roasted , and boiled . When ripe it is indeed so sweet and good that , in my estimation , there is no other that surpasses it . Scarcely any of it , except a little husk , has to be thrown away. 71 There was also another fruit with a flavor like that of chestnuts , but much larger in size than six chestnuts put together ; much of this fruit was eaten roasted and boiled . Certain nuts with a very hard shell , and very oily , were also found , which were eaten in great quantities , and which , according to some , induced diarrhoea . We also saw some Castilian pumpkins growing . Near the beach there is a fine cascade of very clear water , which issues from a rock at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width of four or five fingers . Then near by there is a stream , from which the boats drew a full supply of water . The Indians fled to the forests and rocks , where they fortified themselves and tried to do some mischief , by throwing stones and rolling down rocks , but they never wounded anyone , for the master-of-camp restrained them , by placing outposts . The Indians of this island , on seeing one of our negroes , made signs toward the south , saying that there were men like him there , and that they were wont to go there to fight ; that the others were armed with arrows ; and that they make the journey thither in certain large canoes which they possess . Since there was no interpreter , or much curiosity to learn more , no further investigations were made , although , in my opinion , this is impossible for Indians so remote , unless there be a chain of islands ; for their boats and their customs in other things show that they have not come from any great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one-half degrees . The adelantado ordered three crosses to be planted , and on Saturday , August fifth , to weigh anchor and set sail southwest by west . We sailed with easterly and east southeasterly winds , now southwest by west and now northwest by west , for about four hundred legues . One Sunday , August twenty , we sighted four low islands with sandy beaches , abounding in palms and other trees . On the southeast side , towards the north , was seen a great sandbank . All four islands have a circuit of about twelve legues . Whether they were inhabited or not , we could not tell , for we did not go to them . That year appeared to be one of talk , of which I speak with anger . These islands lie in an altitude of ten and three-quarters degrees . They were named San Bernardo , 72 because they were discovered on that saint ' s day . Thenceforward we began to meet southeasterly winds , which never failed us , and which seem to prevail in those regions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said direction , never going above eleven or below ten degrees , until Tuesday , August twenty-nine , when we discovered a round islet , of about one legua in circumference , surrounded by reefs . We tried to land there , so that the almiranta could take on wood and water , of which there was great need , but could find no landing-place . We gave it the name of La Solitaria Solitary Island . It lies in an altitude of ten and two-thirds degrees , and is about one thousand five hundred and thirty five legues from Lima. 73 From this island we continued to sail in the said course : a thing which drew a variety of opinions from the men , some saying that we did not know where we were going , and other things which did not fail to cause some hard feelings ; but by the mercy of God , at midnight on the eve of Nuestra Senora de Setiembre Our Lady of September , we sighted an island of about ninety or one hundred legues in circumference , which extends almost east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hundred legues from Lima. 74 The whole island is full of dense forests , even to the highest ridges ; and where it was not cleared for the Indians ' fields , not a palmo of earth could be seen . The ships anchored in a port on the north side of the island , in ten degrees of latitude . About seven legues north of that port , there is a volcano with a very well shaped cone , which ejects much fire from its summit , and from other parts . The volcano is high and about three legues in circumference . On the side toward the sea it is very steep and quite bare , and offers no landing ; and it rumbles frequently and loudly within . Northeast of this volcano are several small inhabited islets , surrounded by many shoals . The distance to these islets is seven or eight legues . The shoals extend about northwest , and one who saw them said that they were numerous . Around the large island were several small ones , and as we sailed around them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large one . Within sight of this large island , and to the southeast of it , we saw another island of no great size . This must be the connecting link with the other islands. 75 After having put into port at the great island Sancta Cruz , as it had been named , the adelantado ordered Captain Don Lorenzo , his brother-in-law , to go with the frigate in search of the almiranta , of which I have no favorable conjectures , and which had disappeared on the night that we sighted the island . It was sought on this and on two other occasions , but nothing except the shoals above-mentioned were found . What was seen in the way of food in this bay and port was swine , fowl , bananas , sugar-cane , some two or three kinds of roots resembling sweet potatoes , which are eaten boiled or roasted and made into biscuits , buyos i. e. , betel , two kinds of excellent almonds , two kinds of pine-nuts , ring-doves and turtle-doves , ducks , gray and white herons , swallows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit which I mentioned as being in the first islands , chestnuts , and walnuts . Sweet basil , of great fragrance , and red flowers , which are kept in the gardens at that port , and two other kinds of different flowers , also red , are found . There is another fruit which grows on high trees , and resembles the pippin in its pleasing smell and savor ; a great quantity of ginger grows wild there , as also of the herb chiquilite , from which indigo is made. 76 There are agave-trees , abundance of sagia sago ( ? ) , 77 and many cocoanuts . Marble is also to be seen , as well as pearl shells and large snail-shells , like those brought from China . There is a very copious spring and five or six rivers of small volume . There we settled close by the spring . The Indians endeavored to prevent us ; but as the arquebus tells at a distance , upon seeing its deadly effects , their hostility was lukewarm , and they even gave us some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions , several cases of not over good treatment happened to the Indians ; for the Indian who was our best friend and lord of that island , Malope by name , was killed , as well as two or three others , also friendly to us . No more of all the island than about three legues about the camp was explored . The people of this island are black . They have small single-masted canoes for use about their villages ; and some very large ones to use in the open sea . On Sunday , October eight , the adelantado had the master-of-camp stabbed . Tomas de Ampuero was also killed in the same way . Alferez Juan de Buitrago was beheaded ; and the adelantado intended to have two others , friends of the master-of-camp , killed , but was restrained therefrom at our request . The cause of this was notorious , for these men tried to induce the adelantado to leave the land and abandon it . There must have been other reasons unknown to me ; what I saw was much dissoluteness and shamelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October eighteen , after a total eclipse of the moon on the seventeenth , the adelantado died ; 78 November two , Don Lorenzo , his brother-in-law , who had succeeded him as captain-general ; the priest Antonio de Serpa , seven or eight days before ; and November eight the vicar , Juan de Espinosa . Disease was rampant among our men and many died for lack of care , and the want of an apothecary and doctor . The men begged the governor Dona Ysabel Barreto to take them out of the country . All agreed to embark , and by the mercy of God , we left this port on Saturday , the eighteenth of the said month , and sailed southwest by west toward the island of San Cristoval or rather in search of it , to see whether we could find it or the almiranta , in accordance with the governor ' s orders . For two days nothing was seen ; and at the request of all the men , who cried out that we were taking them to destruction , she ordered me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees of latitude , to Manila . Thence I steered north northwest to avoid meeting islands on the way , since we were so ill prepared to approach any of them , with our men so sick that about fifty of them died in the course of the voyage and about forty there in the island . We continued our course short of provisions , navigating five degrees south and as many north , and meeting with many contrary winds and calms . When we reached an altitude of six long degrees north latitude , we sighted an island , apparently about twenty-five legues in circumference , thickly wooded and inhabited by many people who resembled those of the Ladrones , and whom we saw coming toward us in canoes . From the southeast to the north and then to the southwest , it is surrounded by large reefs. 79 About four legues west of it are some low islets . There , although we tried , we failed to find a suitable place to anchor ; for the galliot and frigates which accompanied our ship had disappeared some days before. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reached an altitude of thirteen and three-quarters degrees , and in the two days that we sailed west in this latitude , we sighted the islands of Serpana i. e . , Seypan and Guan in the Ladrones . We passed between the two and did not anchor there , because we had no cable for lowering and hauling up the boat . This was the third of the month of January , one thousand five hundred and ninety-six . On the fourteenth of the same month we sighted the cape of Espiritu Sancto , and on the fifteenth we anchored in the bay of Cobos. 81 We reached there in such a state that only the goodness of God could have taken us thither ; for human strength and resources would hardly have taken us a tenth of the way . We reached that place so dismantled and the crew so weak that we were a most piteous sight , and with only nine or ten jars of water . In this bay of Cobos the ship was repaired and the men recuperated as much as possible . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bay , and on the tenth of the same month we anchored in the port of Cabite , etc. @# Besides my desire to serve your Grace , I am moved to leave this brief relation for you , by the fact that if , perchance , God should dispose of my life , or other events should cause me or the relation that I carry to disappear , the truth may be learned from this one , which may prove a matter of great service to God and to the king our sovereign. 82 Will your Grace look favorably upon my great desire to serve you , of which I shall give a better proof , if God permit me to return to this port . Will your Grace also pardon my brevity , since the fault lies in the short time at my present disposal . Moreover , since no man knows what time may bring , I beg your Grace to keep the matter secret , for on considering it well , it seems only right that nothing be said about the first islands until his Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for , as the islands occupy a position midway between Peru , Nueva Espania , and this land , the English , on learning of them , might settle them and do much mischief in this sea . Your Grace , I consider myself as the faithful servant of your Grace . May God our Lord preserve you for many years in great joy and increasing prosperity , etc . Your Grace ' s servant , PEDRO FERNANDEZ DE QUIROS To Doctor Antonio de Morga , lieutenant-governor of his Majesty in the Filipinas. @# When Governor Don Francisco Tello entered upon his office , in the year ninety-six , he found the " San Geronymo , " the ship in which Don Fernando de Castro and his wife Dona Ysabel Barreto were returning to Nueva Espana , preparing for the voyage in the port of Cabite . He also found there the galleon " San Felipe " laden with Filipinas goods , preparing to make its voyage to Nueva Espana . As soon as Governor Don Francisco Tello entered upon his administration , both ships were despatched and set sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made the voyage , reaching Nueva Espania at the end of the said year of ninety-six . The vessel " San Felipe , " which was a large ship and heavily laden with merchandise and passengers , and whose commander and general was Don Mathia de Landecho , encountered many storms on the voyage , so that at one time it became necessary to throw considerable cargo overboard , and they lost their rudder while in thirty-seven degrees of latitude , six hundred legues from the Filipinas , and a hundred and fifty from Xapon . Seeing themselves unable to continue their voyage , it was decided to put back to the Filipinas . They set about this and changed their course , but experienced even greater difficulties and trials . Many times they gave themselves up as lost , for the seas ran high , and as the vessel had no rudder , the rigging and few sails were carried away , and blown into shreds . They could not hold the vessel to its course , and it worked so often to windward that they were in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Filipinas . Xapon was the nearest place , but not sufficiently near to enable them to reach it or to venture near its coast which is very wild , and unknown to them even by sight ; and even should they have the good fortune to reach it , they did not know how the Japanese would receive them . At this juncture arose confusion and a diversity of opinion among the men aboard . Some said that they should not abandon the course to Manila , in spite of the great peril and discomfort that they were experiencing . Others said that it would be a rash act to do so , and that , since Xapon was much nearer , they should make for it , and look for the port of Nangasaqui , between which and the Filipinas trade was carried on . There they would be well received and would find means to repair their ships , and of resuming the voyage thence . This opinion prevailed , for some religious in the ship adopted it , and the rest coincided with them , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship to Xapon . Accordingly they altered their course for that country , and after six days sighted the coast and country of Xapon , at a province called Toca ; 83 and although they tried by day to reach the land , at night , when they lowered the sails , the tide carried them away from it . Many funeas 84 came to the ship from a port called Hurando , and the Spaniards , persuaded by the king of that province , who assured them of harbor , tackle , and repairs , entered the port , after having sounded and examined the entrance , and whether the water was deep enough . The Japanese , who were faithless , and did this with evil intent , towed the ship into the port , leading and guiding it onto a shoal , where , for lack of water , it touched and grounded . Therefore the Spaniards were obliged to unload the ship and take all the cargo ashore close to the town , to a stockade which was given them for that purpose . For the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as to repairing the ship and leaving port again , the latter were given to understand that it could not be done without permission and license from Taicosama , the sovereign of Japon , who was at his court in Miaco , one hundred legues from that port . General Don Matia de Landecho and his companions , in order to lose no time , resolved to send their ambassadors to court with a valuable gift from the ship ' s cargo for Taicosama , to beg him to order their departure . They sent on this mission Christoval de Mercado , three other Spaniards , Fray Juan Pobre , of the Franciscan order , and Fray Juan Tamayo , of the Augustinian order , who were aboard the vessel . They were to confer concerning this affair with Taico in Miaco , and were to avail themselves of the Franciscan fathers who were in Miaco . The latter had gone as ambassadors from the Filipinas to settle matters between Xapon and Manila , and were residing at court in a permanent house and hospital , with Taico ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although with considerable opposition from the religious of the Society of Jesus established in the same kingdom . The latter asserted other religious to be forbidden by apostolic briefs and royal decrees to undertake or engage in the conversion of Japon . The king of Hurando , although to all appearances friendly and kind to the Spaniards in his port , took great care to keep them and their merchandise secure . He immediately sent word to court that that ship of foreigners called Nambajies 85 had been wrecked there , and that the Spaniards had brought great riches . This kindled Taicosama ' s greed , who , in order to get possession of them , sent Ximonojo , one of his favorites and a member of his council , to Hurando . Ximonojo , upon his arrival , took possession of all the merchandise , and imprisoned the Spaniards within a well-guarded palisade , after having forced them to give up all their possessions and what they had hid , under pain of death . Having exercised great rigor therein , he returned to court , after granting permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Miaco . The ambassadors who had been sent before to Miaco with the present , were unable to see Taico , although the present was accepted ; nor did they succeed in making any profitable arrangement , although father Fray Pedro Baptista , superior of the Franciscan religious residing there , employed many methods for the purpose of remedying the grievance of the Spaniards . These attempts only served to intensify the evil ; for the favorites , who were infidels and hated the religious for making converts at court , on seeing Taico so bent upon the riches of the ship and so unwilling to listen to any restitution , not only did not ask him to do so , but in order to make the matter easier , and taking advantage of the occasion , set Taicosama against the Spaniards ; telling him that the religious and the men from the ship were all subjects of one sovereign , and conquerors of others ' kingdoms . They said that the Spaniards did this by first sending their religious to the kingdoms , and then entered after with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were aided in this purpose by the fact that when the favorite , who went to seize the property of the ship , was in Hurando , its pilot , Francisco de Sanda , had shown him the sea-chart in which could be seen all the countries which had been discovered , and Espana and the other kingdoms possessed by his Majesty , among which were Piru and Nueva Espana . When the favorite asked how those distant kingdoms had been gained , the pilot replied that the religious had entered first and preached their religion , and then the soldiers had followed and subdued them . It is true that the said pilot imprudently gave those reasons , which Ximonojo noted well and kept in mind , in order to relate them to Taicosama whenever a suitable opportunity should present itself , which he now did. @# All this , together with the persistency with which the religious begged Taico to restore the merchandise to the Spaniards , resulted in angering him thoroughly , and like the barbarous and so avaricious tyrant that he was , he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preached the religion of Namban 86 in his kingdoms . Five religious who were in the house at Miaco were immediately seized , together with another from the " San Felipe " who had joined them , and all the Japanese preachers and teachers. 87 It was also understood that the persecution would extend to the other orders and Christians in Japon , whereupon all received great fear and confusion . But later Taico ' s wrath was moderated , for , allowing himself to be entreated , he declared that only the religious who had been found in the house at Miaco , and their companions , the Japanese preachers and teachers , who were arrested , would be crucified ; and that all the others , together with the Spaniards of the ship , would be allowed to return to Manila . Fonzanbrandono , brother of Taracabadono , governor of Nangasaqui , was entrusted with the execution of the order . He placed all those who were taken from the house of the Franciscan religious at Miaco on ox-carts , under a strong guard ; namely , Fray Pedro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ las Casas , Fray Goncalo , Fray Francisco Blanco , Fray Francisco de San Miguel , and twenty-six sic Japanese preachers and teachers with two boys who were in the service of the religious . Their right ears were cut off , and they were paraded through the streets of Miaco and through those of the cities of Fugimen , Usaca , and Sacai , 88 to the great grief and sorrow of all Christians who saw their sufferings . The sentence and cause of their martyrdom was written on a tablet in Chinese characters , which was carried hanging on a spear ; and read as follows. @# Sentence of the Combaco , 89 lord of Xapon , against the discalced religious and their teachers , whom he has ordered to be martyred in Nangasaqui. @# Inasmuch as these men came from the Luzones , from the island of Manila , in the capacity of ambassadors , and were allowed to remain in the city of Miaco , preaching the Christian religion , which in former years I have strictly forbidden : I order that they be executed together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sic men will be crucified in the city of Nangasaqui . And whereas I again forbid the teaching of this religion henceforward : let all understand this . I command that this decree be carried out ; and should any person dare to violate this order , he shall be punished together with his whole family . Given on the first of Echo , and second of the moon. 90 @# Thus these holy men were taken to Nangasaqui . There , on a hill sown with wheat , in sight of the town and port , and near a house and hospital called San Lazaro , established in Nangasaqui by the said religious on their first coming from the Filipinas , before going up to the capital , they were all crucified in a row . The religious were placed in the middle and the others on either side upon high crosses , with iron staples at their throats , hands , and feet , and with long , sharp iron lances thrust up from below and crosswise through their sides. 91 Thus did they render their souls to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifth of February , day of St. Agueda , of the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-seven . They left behind in that ploughed field , and through it in all that kingdom , a great quantity of seed sown , which they watered with their blood , and from which we hope to gather abundant fruit of a numerous conversion to our holy Catholic faith . Before these holy men were crucified , they wrote a letter to Doctor Antonio de Morga , in Manila , by the hand of Fray Martin de Aguirre , which reads word for word as follows. @# To Doctor Morga , lieutenant-governor of Manila , whom may God protect , etc . , Manila. @# Farewell , Doctor ! farewell ! Our Lord , not regarding my sins , has , in His mercy , been pleased to make me one of a band of twenty-four sic servants of God , who are about to die for love of Him . Six of us are friars of St. Francis , and eighteen are native Japanese . With hopes that many more will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last farewell and the last embraces of all this company , for we all acknowledge the support which you have manifested toward the affairs of this conversion . And now , in taking leave , we beg of you  --  and I especially  --  to make the protection of this field of Christendom the object of your special care . Since you are a father , and look with favor upon all things which may concern the mission of the religious in this conversion , so may your Grace find one who will protect and intercede for you before God in time of need . Farewell sir ! Will your Grace give my last adieu to Dona Juana . May our Lord preserve , etc . From the road to execution , January twenty-eight , one thousand five hundred and ninety-seven. @# This king ' s greed has been much whetted by what he stole from the " San Felipe . " It is said that next year he will go to Luzon , and that he does not go this year because of being busy with the Coreans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the islands of Lequios 92 and Hermosa , throw forces from them into Cagayan , and thence to fall upon Manila , if God does not first put a stop to his advance . Your Graces will attend to what is fitting and necessary. 93 @# FRAY MARTIN DE LA ASCENCION @# The bodies of the martyrs , although watched for many days by the Japanese , were removed by bits ( especially those of the monks ) from the crosses as relics by the Christians of the place , who very reverently distributed them around . Together with the staples and the wood of the crosses they are now scattered throughout Christendom. @# Two other religious of the same band , who were out of the house at the time of the arrest , did not suffer this martyrdom . One , called Fray Geronimo de Jesus , 94 hid himself and went inland , in order not to leave the country ; the other , called Fray Agustin Rodriguez , was sheltered by the fathers of the Society , who sent him away by way of Macan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked and stripped , left Japon . They embarked at Nangasaqui and went to Manila in various ships which make that voyage for the Japanese and Portuguese . The first news of this event was learned from them in the month of May of ninety-seven . Great grief and sadness was caused by the news , in the death of the holy religious , and in the disturbances which were expected to take place in future dealings between Japon and the Filipinas ; as well as in the loss of the galleon and its cargo en route to Nueva Espana . The value of the vessel was over one million pesos ? , and caused great poverty among the Spaniards . After considering the advisable measures to take under the circumstances , it was ultimately decided that , in order not to allow the matter to pass , a circumspect man should be sent to Japon with letters from the governor to Taicosama . The letters were to set forth the governor ' s anger at the taking of the ship and merchandise from the Spaniards , and at the killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make all the reparation possible , by restoring and returning the merchandise to the Spaniards , and the artillery , tackle , and spoils of the vessel that were left , as well as the bodies of the religious whom he had crucified ; and Taicosama was so to arrange matters thenceforth , that Spaniards should not be so treated in his kingdom. @# The governor sent Don Luis Navarrete 95 Fajardo as bearer of this message , and a present of some gold and silver ornaments , swords , and valuable cloth for Taicosama . He also sent him an elephant well caparisoned and covered with silk , and with its naires i. e. , elephant keepers in the same livery , a thing never before seen in Xapon . According to the custom of that kingdom , Don Luis was to make the present to Taico when he presented his embassy , for the Japanese are wont to give or receive embassies in no other manner . When Don Luys de Navarrete reached Nangasaqui , Taicosama readily sent from the court for the ambassador and for the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anxious to see the gifts , especially the elephant , with which he was greatly delighted . He heard the embassy and replied with much ostentation and display , exculpating himself from the death of the religious upon whom he laid the blame , saying that after he had forbidden them to christianize , or teach their religion , they had disregarded his orders in his own court . Likewise , the seizure of the ship and its merchandise , which entered the port of Hurando in the province of Toza , had been a justifiable procedure , according to the laws of Japon , because all ships lost on its coast belong to the king , with their merchandise . Nevertheless , he added that he was sorry for all that had happened , and that he would return the merchandise had it not been distributed . As to the religious , there was no remedy for it . But he begged the governor of Manila not to send such persons to Xapon , for he had again passed laws forbidding the making of Christians under pain of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the religious and would be glad to have peace and friendship with the Luzon Islands and the Spaniards , and for his part , would endeavor to secure it . He said that if any other vessel came to his kingdom from Manila , he would give orders that it be well received and well treated . With this reply and a letter of the same purport for the governor , Don Luys Navarrete was dismissed . He was given a present for the governor consisting of lances , armor , and catans , considered rare and valuable by the Japanese . The ambassador thereupon left Miaco and went to Nangasaqui , whence by the first ship sailing to Manila , he sent word to Governor Don Francisco concerning his negotiations . But the message itself was taken later to Manila by another person , on account of the illness and death of Don Luis in Nangasaqui . Taicosama rejoiced over his answer to the ambassador , for he had practically done nothing of what was asked of him . His reply was more a display of dissembling and compliments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasted and published arrogantly , and his favorites said in the same manner , that the Spaniards had sent him that present and embassy through fear , and as an acknowledgment of tribute and seigniory , so that he might not destroy them as he had threatened them at other times in the past , when Gomez Perez Dasmarinas was governor . And even then the Spaniards had sent him a message and a present by Fray Juan Cobo , the Dominican , and Captain Llanos. @# The Japanese Faranda Quiemon sought war with Manila , and the favorites who aided him did not neglect to beg Taico not to lose the opportunity of conquering that city . They said that it would be easy , since there were but few Spaniards there ; that a fleet could be sent there quickly , which Faranda would accompany . The latter assured Taico of success , as one who knew the country and its resources . They urged him so continually that Taico entrusted Faranda with the enterprise , and gave him some supplies and other assistance toward it . Faranda began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was never able to carry out ; for , being a man naturally low and poor , he possessed neither the ability nor the means sufficient for the enterprise . His protectors themselves did not choose to assist him , and so his preparations were prolonged until the enterprise was abandoned at the death of Taico , and his own death , as will be stated later. @# Meanwhile news was constantly reaching Manila that a fleet was being equipped in Japon , completely under the supervision of Faranda , and it naturally caused some anxiety among the people in spite of their courage and determination to resist him , for the enemy was arrogant and powerful . Although the city was thoroughly resolved and determined to resist him , yet the governor and city would never show openly that they were aware of the change which Taico was about to make , in order not to precipitate the war or give the other side any reason for hastening it . Trusting to time for the remedy , they so disposed affairs in the city , that they might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had settled in Manila  --  and they were not few  --  back to Xapon , and made those who came in merchant ships give up their weapons until their return , which they endeavored to hasten as much as possible ; but in all other respects , they treated them hospitably . And because it was heard that Taico intended to take possession of the island of Hermosa , a well-provisioned island off the Chinese coast , very near Luzon , and on the way to Xapon , in order to make it serve as a way-station for his fleet , and thus carry on more easily the war with Manila , the governor sent two ships of the fleet under command of Don Juan de Camuzio , to reconnoiter that island and all its ports , and the nature of the place , in order to be the first to take possession of it . At least , if means and time should fail him , he was to advise China , and the viceroys of the provinces of Canton and Chincheo , so that , since the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese from entering the island , which would prove so harmful to all of them . In these measures and precautions several days were spent in the matter . However , nothing was accomplished by this expedition to Hermosa Island beyond advising Great China of Xapon ' s designs. @# Several days after the imprisonment of Father Alonso Ximenez in Cochinchina where Captain and Sargento-mayor Juan Xuarez Gallinato had left him , the kings of Tunquin and Sinua permitted him to return to Manila . He took passage for Macan in a Portuguese vessel . Not only did he arrive unwearied by his voyages , hardships , and imprisonment , but with renewed energy and spirits proposed to set on foot again the expedition to Camboja . Although little was known of the state of affairs in that kingdom , and of the restoration of Prauncar to his throne , he together with other religious of his order , persuaded Don Luys Dasmarinas , upon whom he exercised great influence , and who was then living in Manila , taking no part in government affairs , and inclined him to broach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at his own expense , from which would ensue good results for the service of God and of his Majesty . Don Luys discussed the matter with Governor Don Francisco Tello , and offered to bear all the expense of the expedition . But a final decision was postponed until the receipt of news from Camboja , for their only information was that Blas Ruyz and Diego Belloso , leaving Captain Gallinato and his ships in Cochinchina , had gone to Lao. @# At the departure of Don Juan Ronquillo and his camp from Mindanao River , the people of Tampacan were so disheartened , and the spirit of those of Buhahayen so increased that , in spite of the friendship that they had made , and the homage that they had rendered , they became declared enemies to the former . Matters returned to their former state , so that , not only did the inhabitants of Buhahayen not dismantle their forts , as they had promised to do , but they repaired them and committed other excesses against their neighbors of Tampacan . They would have altogether broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards would return better prepared and in larger number , as they had left the garrison at La Caldera with that intention . Thus they let matters stand , neither declaring themselves fully as rebels , nor observing the laws of friendship toward the men of Tampacan and other allies of the Spaniards. @# Near the island of Mindanao lies an island called Jolo , not very large , but thickly populated with natives , all Mahometans . They number about three thousand men , and have their own lord and king . When Governor Francisco de Sande was returning from his expedition to Borneo , he sent Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa to Jolo . He entered the island and reduced the natives to his Majesty ' s rule as above related . The natives were apportioned to Captain Pedro de Osseguera for his lifetime , and after his death , to his son and successor , Don Pedro de Osseguera . He asked and collected for several years what tribute they chose to give him , which was but slight , without urging more , in order not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his camp in Mindanao , the men of Jolo , seeing Spanish affairs flourishing , were willing to enjoy peace and pay their tribute ; but at the departure of the Spaniards , they became lukewarm again . Captain Juan Pacho , who commanded the presidio of La Caldera in Don Juan Ronquillo ' s absence , having sent some soldiers to barter for wax , the Joloans maltreated them and killed two of them . Juan Pacho , with the intention of punishing this excess of the Joloans , went there in person with several boats and thirty soldiers . As he landed , a considerable body of Joloans descended from their king ' s town , which is situated on a high and strongly-fortified hill , and attacked the Spaniards . Through the number of the natives and the Spaniards ' inability to make use of their arquebuses , on account of a heavy shower , the latter were routed , and Captain Juan Pacho and twenty of his followers killed . The rest wounded and in flight took to their boats and returned to La Caldera. @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reputation lost by it , both among the Joloans , and their neighbors , the people of Mindanao . Although it was considered necessary to punish the Joloans in order to erase this disgrace , yet as this should be done signally and just then there was not sufficient preparation , it was deferred until a better opportunity . Only Captain Villagra was sent immediately as commander of the presidio of La Caldera , with some soldiers . Having arrived there , they spent their time in pleasure , until their provisions were consumed , and the garrison suffering . They were maintained and supported because of the slight protection that the people of Tampacan felt , knowing that there were Spaniards on the island , and hoped for the arrival of more Spaniards , as Don Juan had promised them , and for punishment and vengeance upon the men of Jolo. @# While affairs in the Filipinas were in this condition , ships from Nueva Espana arrived at Manila , in the month of May , one thousand five hundred and ninety-eight . These ships brought despatches ordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed in the Filipinas some years before . Don Francisco Tello , who was governing the country , was named and appointed its president ; Doctor Antonio de Morga and Licentiates Christoval Telles Almacan and Alvaro Rodriguez Zambrano , auditors ; and Licentiate Geronymo de Salazar , fiscal ; and other officials of the Audiencia were also appointed . By the same ships arrived the archbishop , Fray Ignacio de Sanctivanes , who enjoyed the archbishopric only for a short time , for he died of dysentery in , the month of August of the same year . The bishop of Sebu , Fray Pedro de Agurto came also . On the eighth of May of this year-five hundred and ninety-eight , the royal seal of the Audiencia was received . It was taken from the monastery of San Agustin to the cathedral upon a horse caparisoned with cloth of gold and crimson , and under a canopy of the same material . The staves of the canopy were carried by the regidors of the city , who were clad in robes of crimson velvet lined with white silver cloth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The horse that carried the seal in a box of cloth of gold covered with brocade was led on the right by him who held the office of alguacil-mayor , who was clad in cloth of gold and wore no cloak . Surrounding the horse walked the president and auditors , all afoot and bareheaded . In front walked a throng of citizens clad in costly gala dress ; behind followed the whole camp and the soldiers , with their drums and banners , and their arms in hand , and the captains and officers at their posts , with the master-of-camp preceding them , staff in hand . The streets and windows were richly adorned with quantities of tapestry and finery , and many triumphal arches , and there was music from flutes , trumpets , and other instruments . When the seal was taken to the door of the cathedral of Manila , the archbishop in pontifical robes came out with the cross , accompanied by the chapter and clergy of the church to receive it . Having lifted the box containing the seal from the horse under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president . Then the auditors went into the church with him , while the band of singers intoned the Te Deum laudamus . They reached the main altar , upon the steps of which stood a stool covered with brocade . Upon this they placed the box with the seal . All knelt and the archbishop chanted certain prayers to the Holy Spirit for the health and good government of the king , our sovereign . Then the president took the box with the seal , and with the same order and music with which it had been brought into the church it was carried out and replaced upon the horse . The archbishop and clergy remained at the door of the church , while the cortege proceeded to the royal buildings . The said box containing the royal seal was placed and left in a beautifully-adorned apartment , with a covering of cloth of gold and crimson , on a table covered with brocade and cushions of the same material , which stood under a canopy of crimson velvet embroidered with the royal arms . Then the royal order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the nominations for president , auditors , and fiscal . Homage was done them and the usual oath administered . The president proceeded to the Audiencia hall , where the court rooms were well arranged and contained a canopy for the royal arms . There the president , auditors , and fiscal took their seats and received the ministers and officials of the Audiencia . Then the ordinances of the Audiencia were read in the presence of as many citizens as could find room in the hall . This completed the establishment of the Audiencia on that day . Thenceforth it has exercised its functions , and has had charge and disposition in all cases , both civil and criminal , of its district . The latter includes the Filipinas Islands and all the mainland , of China discovered or to be discovered . In charge of the president who acts as governor of the land , were all government affairs according to royal laws , ordinances , and special orders , which were acted on and brought before the Audiencia. @# A few days after the Chancilleria of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events in the kingdom of Camboja after the arrival of Prauncar  --  son and successor of Prauncar Langara , who died in Laos  --  together with Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz de Hernan Gonzalez , and of his victories and restoration to the throne , as has already been related . The news came in letters from King Prauncar to Governor Don Francisco Tello and Doctor Antonio de Morga . They were signed by the king ' s hand and seal in red ink . The letters were written in Castilian so that they might be better understood . Since they were alike in essence , I thought it proper to reproduce here the letter written by King Prauncar to Doctor Antonio de Morga , which reads word for word as follows. @# Prauncar , King of Camboja , to Doctor Antonio de Morga , greeting ; to whom I send this letter with great love and joy. @# I , Prauncar , King of the rich land of Camboja , I , sole lord of it , the great , cherish an ardent love for Doctor Antonio de Morga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I have learned through Captain Chofa Don Blas , the Castilian , that he , from the kindness of his heart , took an active part and has assisted the governor of Luzon to send to this country Captain Chofa Don Blas , the Castilian , and Captain Chofa Don Diego , the Portuguese , with soldiers to find King Prauncar my father . Having searched for him in vain , the two chofas and the soldiers killed Anacaparan , who was reigning as sole great lord . Then they went with their ships to Cochinchina , whence the two chofas went to Lao , to find the king of this land . They brought me back to my kingdom , and I am here now through their aid . The two chofas and other Spaniards who have come , have helped me to pacify what I now hold . I understand that all this has come to me because the doctor loves this country . Hence I shall act so that Doctor Antonio de Morga may always love me as he did my father Prauncar , and assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other Spaniards and Christians who dwell in my kingdom . I shall build them churches and permit them to christianize whatever Cambodians choose to become Christians . I shall provide them with servants and I shall protect them as did formerly King Prauncar my father . I shall provide Doctor Antonio de Morga with whatever will be useful to him from this country . The two chofas have received the lands which I promised them . To Captain Don Blas , the Castilian , I gave the province of Tran , and to Captain Chofa Don Diego , the Portuguese , the province of Bapano . These provinces I grant and bestow upon them for the services which they have rendered me and in payment for the property they have spent in my service , so that they may possess and enjoy them as their own , and do what they will with them while in my service. 96 @# Together with the king ' s letter Blas Ruis de Hernan Gonzalez wrote another detailed letter to Doctor Morga , informing him of all the events of his expeditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morga , Lieutenant-governor of the Filipinas Islands of Luzon , in the city of Manila , whom may our Lord preserve. @# From Camboja : Your Grace must have already heard of events in this kingdom of Camboja , from my arrival until the captain withdrew the fleet . These accounts will undoubtedly vary according to what each man thought fit to say in order to gild his own affairs : some according to their bent and opinion , and others according to their passion . Although the matter has been witnessed and thoroughly known by many persons , I am about to relate it as well as possible to your Grace , as to a person who can weld all the facts together and give to each circumstance the weight which it may possess and deserve . I shall also give an account among other things of all that happened to Captain Diego Belloso and myself on the journey to Lao , and the vicissitudes and wars in this kingdom , from our arrival until the condition of affairs now in force . Since Spaniards have taken part in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner and retirement with which I have lived in this kingdom ever since my arrival here from Manila , sustaining the soldiers and other men whom I brought in my ship at my own expense , keeping them in a state of discipline and honor , and never allowing them to abandon themselves to sensual pleasures ; although I had no credentials for this , for Gallinato had those which the governor was to give me . I shall not discuss the why and wherefore of most of the Chinese matters , because Fray Alonso Ximenez and Fray Diego 97 witnessed some of the events and heard of others and will have informed your Grace of everything , including the war against the usurper , and Gallinato ' s abandonment of this kingdom when affairs had practically been settled . Had he continued to follow up matters , half of the kingdom would today justly belong to his Majesty , and the whole of it would be in the power and under the rule of the Spaniards ; and perhaps the king himself with most of his people would have embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only ask your Grace to consider the kingdom which we came to help , that the Chinese had no more right there than we had , and that we had to try to gain reputation , not to lose it . Since we came with a warlike attitude , and it was the first time that an armed Spanish force set foot on the mainland , was it right for us to endure insults , abuse , contempt , and open affronts from a so vile race as they are , and before all these pagans ? Was it right to endure the further action of their arguments before the usurping king , to induce him to kill us ; their many evil and infamous reports to him concerning us , in order to induce him to grant their request ; and above all their impudence in killing and disarming Spaniards and going out in the streets to spear them ? All this I endured very patiently in order not to disturb the land by breaking with them , until one day when they actually tried to kill some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unequal , they had already wounded and maltreated them . We came out at the noise and the Chinese drew up in battle array , armed with many warlike instruments , challenging us to battle , with insults and expressions of contempt . At this juncture , what would have become of our reputation had we retired when the advantage was on their side ? Then , too , after attacking and killing many of them what security had we in this tyrannical kingdom , which showed itself not at all friendly to us , with only one ship , 98 which was at the time aground , and with the artillery and provisions ashore ; while they had six ships and many rowboats all provided with one or two culverins and many men , both in the ships and those living in the port ? 99 Would it have been right , after war had broken out , to have them with all their resources while we had none ? Had they taken our lives , what reputation would the Spaniards have left in these kingdoms ? For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than to be at their mercy , or at that of the king . Accordingly , in order to assure our lives we were obliged to seize their ships and to strengthen ourselves by means of them , since the Chinese began the war . After this , father Fray Alonso Ximenez and we thought that , by making an embassy with presents to the king , and by exculpating ourselves in this matter , before him , everything would turn out well ; and that if we had peace with him , and our persons in safety in a fort , or under his word and safe-conduct , we would give the Chinese their ship and property . All this was written out and signed by us . In order to carry this out , a letter was written in the name of the governor of that city i. e . , Manila , and we went to deliver it nine legues away at the residence of the king , leaving the vessels guarded . But when he found us there , the king deprived us of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive the letter , which went under form of embassy , or to hear us unless we first restored the ships . Then he immediately began to prepare arms and to assemble many men , with the intention , unless we restored the ships , of killing us , or reducing us by force to such straits as to compel us to restore them ; and after their restoration , of making an end of us all without trouble or risk to his own men . For he trusted us in nothing , since we were going in search of , and bringing help to , him whom he had dispossessed . All this was told us by some Christians among them , especially by a young mestizo from Malaca who lived among them and knew their language . Therefore considering that we were already separated from our companions , and that , if we restored the ships , they could easily take ours by means of them and kill the men left in them , and then us who were in that place ; also that if we waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily kill us : we decided to seek the remedy by first attacking them instead of waiting to be attacked ; and try to rejoin our men and assure our lives or end them by fighting . Accordingly we attacked them , and such was our good fortune that we killed the king in the fight . Then we retired to our ships with great difficulty , without the loss of a single Spaniard . We did not allow the king ' s house to be sacked , so that it might not be said that we had done this to rob him . At this juncture , the captain and sargento-mayor , our leader , arrived . He belittled and censured what we had done , and ridiculed our statement and that of some of the Cambodians , namely , that we had killed the usurper . All that he did was simply to collect whatever silver and gold certain soldiers seized during these troubles , and everything valuable in the ships , and then to burn the latter . Then he drew up a report against us and dispossessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distrust . After that he gave orders for the departure from the kingdom , paying no heed to many Cambodians who came to speak to us when we went ashore , and told us that we might build a fortress there , for they had a legitimate king before , but that he who was their king lately had driven him to Lao , and thus they had no king ; that they would gather wherever the most protection could be found ; and that we should continue the war . Nor did the captain accept any of our suggestions , when we told him that the usurper had imprisoned a kinsman of the lawful king ; that we should go to his rescue ; that the latter would raise men in favor of the legitimate king ; and that with his support we would take possession of the kingdom , and then go to get the king . But he was deaf to all this and accordingly abandoned the kingdom , and this great opportunity was lost . The only thing that we could obtain from him by great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cochinchina to inquire about the galley , since they had intended to send from Manila for that purpose . I also offered to go to Lao by land at my own expense , in search of the king of Camboja , for I knew that that way led thither . Accordingly , as soon as we arrived in Cochinchina , the captain sent Diego Belloso and myself to Lao , and Captain Gregorio de Vargas to Tunquin . Meanwhile he held an auction among the soldiers of everything valuable from the Chinese ships , and of what else he had taken from the soldiers ; but the men were all without a real , and so he had everything bought for himself , at whatever price he was pleased to give . The king of Sinoa , a province of Cochinchina , equipped us for the voyage with a good outfit , by giving us an embassy for that country , and men to accompany us on the road . Thus we made the entire journey well provided and always highly honored and feared and much looked at , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were all sick on the road ; but in all our troubles we were greatly comforted by the love which the people showed towards us , and : by the kind reception that we met at the hands of all . Finally we reached Lanchan , the capital and the royal seat of the kingdom . This kingdom has a vast territory , but it is thinly populated because it has been often devastated by Pegu . It has mines of gold , silver , copper , iron , brass , sic and tin . It produces silk , benzoin , lac , brasil , wax , and ivory . There are also rhinoceroses , many elephants , and horses larger than those of China . Lao is bounded on the east by Cochinchina and on the northeast and north by China and Tartaria , from which places came the sheep and the asses that were there when I went . Much of their merchandise is exported by means of these animals . On its west and southwest lie Pegu and Sian , and on the south and southeast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich country , and everything imported there is very expensive . Before our arrival at Lanchan , a cousin of the exiled king , on account of the usurper ' s death , had fled thither from Camboja , fearing lest the latter ' s son who was then ruling would kill him . He related what we had done in Camboja , in consequence of which the king of Lao received us very cordially , and showed great respect for us , praising our deeds and showing amazement that they had been accomplished by so few . When we arrived the old king of Camboja , together with his elder son and daughter , had already died , and there was left only the younger son with his mother , aunt , and grandmother . These women rejoiced greatly over our deeds and arrival , and more attention was given them thenceforth . Before our arrival at the city , we met an ambassador , whom the usurping king , Anacaparan , had sent from Camboja , in order that he might reach Lanchan before we did , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pretext of asking for the old queen , who was the step-mother of the dead king Prauncar , and whom Anacaparan claimed to be his father ' s sister . The king of Lao was sending her , but at our arrival , and on our assuring him of Anacaparan ' s death , he ordered her to return , and the ambassador , for fear of being killed , fled down the river in a boat to Camboja . Then we declared our embassy , and asked for the heir of the kingdom in order to take him to our ships and thence to his own country . We were answered that he i. e. , the younger son was the only one , and that they could not allow him to go , especially through a foreign country , and over such rough roads and seas . The youth wished to come , but his mothers 101 would not consent to it . Finally it was decided that we should return to the fleet and proceed with it to Camboja . We were to send them advices from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escort . His mothers gave me letters directed to that city i. e . , Manila , making great promises to the Spaniards on behalf of the kingdom , if they would return to Camboja to pacify the land and restore it to them . The king of Lao entrusted me with another embassy , in which he petitioned for friendship and requested that the fleet return to Camboja , adding that , should Gallinato be unwilling to return , he would send large forces by land to our assistance , under command of the heir himself . Thus we took leave and went to Cochinchina . While these things were happening in Lao , the following occurred in Camboja . As soon as the fleet had departed , the news of Anacaparan ' s death was published . When it was heard by Chupinaqueo , kinsman of the lawful king , who was in prison , he escaped from his prison , incited a province to rise , collected its men , and having proclaimed Prauncar as the lawful king , came to get us with about six thousand men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sons of the usurper , who were now ruling . Not finding us in Chordemuco , where our ships had been lying , he sent boats to look for us as far as the bar . Seeing that we were nowhere to be found he seized all the Chinese and other people there , and returned to his province where he had gathered his forces , and there he fortified himself . Meanwhile the men at Champan , who had gone thither to take it , returned , whereupon the commander of the camp , called Ocuna de Chu , took sides with the sons of the usurper and had one of them  --  the second  --  Chupinanu by name , proclaimed king , because he was the most warlike . For this reason , the elder brother , called Chupinanon , and those of his party were angered , and consequently there was continual strife between them . Then all having united , together with the army from Chanpan , pursued Chupinaqueo , who came out to meet them with many of his men . They fought for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate to be conquered and cruelly killed . Thus for the time being Chupinanu ruled as king , and the camp was disbanded , each man going to his own home . At this time a ship arrived from Malaca on an embassy , bringing some Spaniards who came in search of us , and a number of Japanese . Chupinanu would have liked to have killed them all , but seeing that they came on an embassy , and from Malaca , he let them go immediately . A large province , called Tele , seeing the cruelty with which the king treated them , revolted , and declaring themselves free , proclaimed a new king ; then they marched against Chupinanu , and defeated and routed him , took from him a large number of elephants and artillery , and sacked his city . In the battle , most of the Spaniards and Japanese who had come from Malaca were killed . Chupinanu retreated with all his brothers , six in number , to another province , always accompanied by Ocuna de Chu . There they began to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malays , leaders of all the other Malays on whom Chupinanu relied strongly , who on the break-up of the camp after Chupinaqueo ' s death , had gone to the lands of which they were magistrates . But in order that what follows may be understood , I will tell who these Malays are . When this country was being ravaged by Sian , these two went to Chanpan , taking with them many of their Malays , as well as many Cambodians ; and because the ruler of Champan did not show them all the honors that they desired , they caused an insurrection in the city when he was away . They fortified themselves there , and then plundered the city , after which they returned to this kingdom with all the artillery and many captives . When they arrived here the usurper Anacaparan was ruling . Congratulating one another mutually for their deeds , the usurper gave them a friendly welcome , and they gave him all the artillery and other things which they had brought . Then the usurper gave them lands for their maintenance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easy for him to capture Champan , and offered to seize its king . Since the latter had been so great and long-standing an enemy of the Cambodians , Anacaparan immediately collected an army , which he sent under command of Ocuna de Chu . When we killed Anacaparan , these forces were in Chanpan , and , as above said , they returned after his death . These men presented themselves before the new king , Chupinanu , with all their Malays and it was at once decided to attack the insurgents of Tele . At this juncture arrived the ambassador who had fled from Lao as we reached Lanchan . He said that we had remained there and that our purpose was to ask for the lawful heir of Camboja in order to take him to our ships and transport him to his kingdom ; that the king of Cochinchina was going to help us in this undertaking ; that we had entered Lao with that report ; and that the king of Lao was about to send the heir with great forces by river and by land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea and join them in Camboja , where we would declare war and inflict severe punishment upon whomsoever would not render homage . When the new king and his followers heard this news they were frightened , and consequently each thought only of himself . A few days later it was reported from the bar that four Spanish ships had entered , accompanied by many galleys from Cochinchina . This report was either a vision that some had seen , or was a fiction ; and we have been unable to clarify the matter to this very day . At any rate , on hearing this news , these people confirmed as true the entire report of the ambassador who had fled . The mandarins of Camboja , taking into consideration the war which was now waging with the men of Tele , and the new one threatened by the Spaniards , Cochinchina , and Lao , decided to depose the new king and render homage to the one who was coming from Lao . For this purpose they communicated with the two Malays and together with them attacked the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two elder brothers fled separately , each to the province where he thought to find more friends . After this the mandarins ordered a fleet of row-boats to proceed toward Lao to receive their king , who they said was already coming . They sent Ocuna de Chu as leader of the fleet and also his two sons . Other boats were sent to the bar to receive the Spaniards , and make friendly terms with them , sending for that purpose certain Spaniards there . Two Cambodian mandarins and the two Malays were to remain to guard the kingdom , and to act as governors . The Spaniards went to the bar , but , finding nothing , returned . Ocuna de Chu took the road to Lao , but seeing that he did not meet his king , or hear any news of him , resolved to go to Lanchan and ask for him . He continued his march , but suffered some pangs of hunger , for he had left the kingdom unprovided , and the way was long . On account of this some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ten armed praus . All the kingdom of Lao was thrown into great confusion . Imagining that he was coming to make war , they abandoned their villages and property , and fled to the mountains . But on seeing that he was coming on a peaceful mission , they lost their apprehension . At his arrival we were already on the road to Cochinchina , whereupon the king ordered us to return to Lanchan immediately . The king of Lao , on learning what was happening in Camboja , despatched there a large fleet by sea , and forces by land , and sent for the king of that country . He despatched me to Cochinchina with news of what was happening , and to take the ships to Camboja ; but , while on the way , I heard of the battle fought by our fleet , whereupon I returned to Camboja with the king . When we reached the first village of the kingdom , we learned from the spies who had preceded us , that , as the news of the ships had been untrue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces where the two brothers sought shelter had proclaimed them kings , and were at war with one another ; that the people of Tele had come to fight with the governors , who were divided into factions ; and that each man obeyed whom he pleased . But they said that Ocuna Lacasamana , one of the Malay headmen , had the greatest force of artillery and praus ; and that a Japanese junk  --  the one that had been in Cochinchina when our fleet was there  --  had arrived , and was supporting Chupinannu . The sea and land forces were collected together at the point where this news had been received , and it was found that they were not sufficient to make a warlike entry . A fort was built there , and a request for more men sent to Lao . In the meantime , secret letters were despatched to probe the hearts of the leading men . The men from Lao delayed , and no answers were received to the letters . Feeling insecure in that place , they deliberated upon returning to Lao , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Malays who had fortified himself in his own land , saying that he was on their side , although he had rendered homage to Chupinanu  --  a feigned promise because he had seen the king ' s delay  --  but that as soon as the king entered the land he would join his party . Soon after news came from another Cambojan governor , to the effect that , although he had rendered homage to Chupinanu , yet , if the king would come to him , he would attack Chupinanu , and depose or kill him . For that he said that he had four thousand men fortified with himself on a hill . He sent one of his relatives with this message . All trusted in this man , and immediately we set out for that place . When the above-mentioned man learned of the king ' s approach , he attacked the other king and routed him ; then he came out to receive us , and thus we entered . That province and many others were delivered to us immediately . Chupinanu withdrew to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forces , joined us ; the Japanese did the same . The king then gave orders to pursue Chupinanu until he was taken and killed . Then he seized another man who was acting as judge in another province and put him to death . Soon after war began against the eldest of the brothers and against the people of Tele who also refused homage . At this juncture , a ship arrived from Malaca with fourteen Spaniards of our fleet , who had put into Malaca . The king was delighted thereat , and honored and made much of them , when he learned that they were some of the men who had killed the usurper . They were esteemed and respected in an extraordinary manner by the whole kingdom . Captain Diego Belloso tried to assume charge of them by virtue of an old document from Malaca ; this I forbade , alleging that the right of this jurisdiction should proceed from Manila , since the restoration of this kingdom proceeded from that place , and that those men were Castilians and had nothing to do with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter was brought , replied that the matter lay between us two , and refused to mingle in those affairs . Some of the newcomers coincided with Belloso ' s opinion , and others with mine ; and thus we have gone on until now . This has been the cause of my not asking the king for a fort to secure our personal safety . It would have been a footing for some business , 102 and what I shall relate later would not have happened to us . After the arrival of the Castilians , the king sent an embassy to Cochinchina  --  a Spaniard and a Cambodian  --  to get father Fray Alonso Ximenez and certain Spaniards , who , as we heard , had remained there . The ruler of Chanpan seized them , and they have not returned . The wars continued , in all of which the Spaniards and Japanese took part . Whatever we attacked , we conquered with God ' s assistance , but where we did not go , losses always resulted . Consequently we gained great reputation and were esteemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were making an incursion , Ocuna de Chu , who was now called manbaray  --  the highest title in the kingdom  --  tried to revolt . In this he was aided by one of the Malay chiefs called Cancona . The king summoned me and ordered me to bring with me the Spaniards of my party . He ordered Diego Belloso to remain , for both of us were leaders and still are , in any war in which any of us is engaged . I came at his bidding , and he told me that those men were trying to kill him and deprive him of his kingdom , and asked me to prevent such a thing . The mambaray was the one who ruled the kingdom , and since the king was young and addicted to wine , he held the latter in little esteem and considered himself as king . At last , I , aided by Spaniards , killed him ; then his sons were captured and killed . Afterward the Malay Cancona was seized and killed , and the king was extricated from this peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I learned that another grandee who was head of a province was trying to rebel and join Chupinannon ; I captured him and after trying him , put him to death . Therefore the king showed great esteem for us , and the kingdom feared us ; that province was subdued and we returned to the king . At this time a vessel arrived from Sian , and ported here on its way to an embassy at Manila . On board this vessel were father Fray Pedro Custodio and some Portuguese . The king was greatly delighted at the arrival of the father and wished to build him a church . We all united and continued the war . Again we returned , after having reduced many provinces to the obedience of the king , and left Chupinanon secluded on some mountains , thus almost ending the war . Hereupon many Laos arrived under the leadership of one of their king ' s relatives , for hitherto they had done nothing nor uttered any sound . I do not know whether it was from envy at seeing us so high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the kingdom , or whether they decided the matter beforehand in their own country ; they killed a Spaniard with but slight pretext . When we asked the king for justice in this matter , the latter ordered his mandarins to judge the case . Meanwhile we sent for the Japanese who were carrying on the war in another region , in order to take vengeance if justice were not done . The Laos , either fearing this , or purposing to make an end of us , attacked our quarters at night and killed the father and several Spaniards who had accompanied him and who were sick ; they also killed some Japanese , for their anger was directed against all . The rest of us escaped and took refuge on the Japanese vessel , where we defended ourselves until the arrival of the Japanese . The Laos made a fort and strengthened themselves therein . There were about six thousand of them . They sent a message to the king saying that they would not agree to any act of justice which he might order to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths that they had caused , and for the disrespect with which they treated him ; but , in order not to break with their king , he refused to give us forces with which to attack them , although we often requested him to do so ; nor did we attack them ourselves , as we were without weapons . The king sent word of this affair to Lao , and we remained for the time , stripped , without property , without arms , without justice or revenge , and quite angry at the king , although he was continually sending us excuses , saying that if the king of Lao did not do justice in this matter , he himself would do it , and would not let them leave the country on that account ; he also sent us food , and some clothes and weapons . At this juncture a ship was despatched on an embassy to Malaca in which we wished to embark , but neither the king nor his mothers would allow Diego Belloso or me to leave . Some of the Spaniards embarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained with us ; and the king from that time on made us more presents than ever . The Japanese gathered in their ship , and refused to continue the war . When the enemy learned that we were in confusion , they collected large forces and regained many undefended regions . The king requested the Laos to go to war , since they had thrown into confusion those who were defending his country . They went , lost the first battle , and returned completely routed , leaving many dead and wounded on the field . Chupinanon followed up the victory and came within sight of the king ' s residence , only a river separating them . Thereupon the king quite disregarded the Laos , and persuaded us and the Japanese to take up arms again and defend him . By this time we had all reequipped ourselves with arms and ammunition , and after much entreaty from him and his mothers , we went to war and relieved a fortress which Chupinanon was besieging . We won two battles and forced him to withdraw , thus taking from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lands which had remained in those regions . We captured a quantity of rice and provisions from the enemy  --  with which the king ' s forces recuperated themselves , for they were suffering famine  --  and we went into quarters . This we did , I , the Spaniards , and the Japanese who were on my side . Diego Belloso and his men went to Tele , killed its king , and returned after having conquered part of the province . At this time a Portuguese ship arrived from Macao , 103 laden with merchandise ; on which account , and on beholding our deeds , the Laos were filled with great fear of us , and without leave from the king , departed in boats to their country . Thereupon we went to the king , and requested him not to let them go without doing justice , unless he wished to break friendship with Luzon and Malaca . He replied that he did not dare detain them , but that if we wished to pursue and dared to fight them , he would secretly give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed them . But since they were far ahead of us and under the spell of fear , we could not overtake them for many days . For this reason Belloso turned back with some Spaniards and Japanese . I followed with great difficulty  --  on account of certain strong currents , for we dragged the praus part way with ropes  --  although with but few men , until I overtook many of the Laos , and seized their praus and possessions , from which we all received compensation and gained still more in reputation , which at present we enjoy to a higher degree than was ever enjoyed by any nation in foreign lands . We are greatly esteemed by the king and his men , and by those native here ; and greatly feared by foreigners . Accordingly we receive great respect in all parts of the kingdom . They have bestowed upon Captain Diego Belloso and myself the title of grandee , the highest in their kingdom , so that we may be more respected and feared , and better obeyed . Two of the best provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be made over to us as soon as the turmoils of war are settled and assemblies have been held to take the oaths to the king , which has not yet been done . In the meantime we are making use of other people whom the king orders to be given us . There is no opportunity in the kingdom for any one else to possess entire power and command , beyond Ocuna Lacasamana , leader of the Malays , whom the king favors on account of his large forces , and because he needs him for the wars in which he is engaged . The Spaniards have some encounters with his men , for which reason we hold aloof from one another . I have informed your Grace so minutely of these wars and affairs , in order that it may be judged whether his Majesty has any justifiable and legal right to seize any portion of this kingdom , since his forces killed the man who was quietly in possession of it ; and since its heir , who was driven away where he had lost hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Majesty ' s subjects , who have guarded and defended his person from his enemies . For the hope that the king will give it up voluntarily will never be realized , as he rather fears having so many Spaniards in his country , even while he esteems them ; for he dreads lest they deprive him of his kingdom , since he sees that this only requires the determination therefor . Some of our enemies impress this fact upon him , especially the Moros . I beg and entreat your Grace , who can do so much in this matter , to see that we do not lose our hold on this land , since so much has been accomplished in it , and it has been brought to a so satisfactory state . Moreover it is very important to possess a fortress on the mainland , since it is the beginning of great things . For if a fortress be built here , and the king see a large force in this land , he would have to do what he knows to be just , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aunt , and grandmother , who rule and govern , for he only does as they tell him . He is a child and is addicted to wine more than his father ; he only thinks of sports and hunting , and cares nothing for the kingdom . Therefore should he see many Spaniards , and that nobody could harm them , he would do whatever they wished , because , as above-said , he loves them ; neither would our opponents dare to offer any opposition . If perchance there should be so few men in the Filipinas at present that no great number of them can be sent , at least send as many as possible with the fathers , so as not to lose this jurisdiction and our share in anything ; for Diego Belloso sent to Malaca for religious , men , and documents , so that by that means he may become chief justice of this land , and make over this jurisdiction to Malaca . Since this kingdom has been restored by that kingdom i. e. , the Philippines , your Grace should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If some soldiers should come , and the Cambodians should refuse them the wherewithal to maintain themselves because of their small number , and not fearing them , I would do here whatever your Grace bade me , so long as it were reasonable ; and until more soldiers came , I could manage to make the Cambodians give it , however much against their inclination . These men should come bound hard and fast by documents , so that , as the country is very vast , they should not be tempted to avail themselves of license , for lack of discipline was the cause of our encounter with the Laos . It has been very difficult for me to despatch this vessel , because little is given to the king for any purpose , and because there were many opponents to prevent it  --  for it is evident that the mandarins , whether native or foreign , are not pleased to see men set over them in the kingdom  --  and as I am poor , for I have lived hitherto by war , and subsisted from its gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . The Spaniard whom I entrust with this mission is poor and an excellent soldier ; and to enable him to go , I have assisted him from my indigence . Will your Grace please assist both him and the Cambodian , in order that the latter may become acquainted with some of the grandeur of his Majesty . I would rejoice to be the bearer of this , so as to give your Grace a long account of these affairs and of other notable things , and of the fertility of these kingdoms ; but neither the king nor his mothers have allowed me to go , as the bearer will state , among other things . Your Grace may believe him , for he is a person disinterested in all respects , having just arrived from Macan . On account of the many wars , the king does not possess many things to send your Grace . He sends two ivory tusks , and a slave . Your Grace will forgive him ; he will send many things next year , if the pacification of his country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I have spoken to him and persuaded him to send to that city i. e . , Manila to request soldiers , in order to complete the pacification of the country ; but his mothers would not have it on any account , I am sure that they act thus in order not to promise them lands for their maintenance , or that they may not seize the land . But when they were in Lao , they promised very vast lands . But if what is done is not sufficient to provide for them , let the mercy of God suffice . When this embassy was despatched , Diego Belloso and myself told the king that if he did not give us the lands that he had promised us , we intended to go to Luzon , because we did not now possess the wherewithal with which to maintain ourselves . Many things occurred with respect to this request , but finally he gave us the lands , as is stated in the embassy ; he gave them to us on condition of our holding them in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more resources for your Grace ' s service . I spent all my possessions in meeting the expenses that I incurred in that city i. e . , Manila , and in maintaining my men in this kingdom . For that purpose I took the silver of the common seamen of my vessel , and although I paid the latter with some silver which we found in the Chinese ships , Gallinato would not consent to it , but took it all for himself . In Malaca they made me pay it out of the property on my ship , and would not consent to their being paid out of the prizes , since the war was considered a just one. 104 For this reason I am now destitute of any property , and therefore do not possess the means of serving your Grace as I ought and as I should have desired . Recollecting your Grace ' s unique armory I send you a bottle and a small flask of ivory . Your Grace will forgive the trifle for I promise to compensate for it next year . Your Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great pleasure therein . Will your Grace do me the favor to protect my affairs , so that they may gain some merit by your favor . Trusting to this , may our Lord preserve your Grace , and give you increase in your dignity , as this servant of your Grace desires in your affairs . From Camboja , July twenty , one thousand five hundred and ninety-eight. @# Your Grace ' s servant , @# BLAS RUYZ DE HERNAN GONCALES @# Through this news and despatch from Camboja we learned in Manila of the good result attained by the stay of Diego Belloso and Blas Ruys in that land . Don Luys Dasmarinas gaining encouragement in the enterprise that he had proposed , discussed it with greater warmth . But since difficulties were still raised as to the justification with which an entrance could be made into Camboja with armed forces for more than the protection of , and completion of establishing , Prauncar in his kingdom , and to leave preachers with him  --  it was said on Don Luys ' s behalf that after accomplishing the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same king of Camboja , proceed to the neighboring kingdom of Champan and take possession of it for his Majesty . He would drive thence a usurper , the common enemy of all those kingdoms , who lorded over it , and who , from his fortress near the sea , sallied out against all navigators , plundering and capturing them . He had committed many other crimes , murders , and thefts , on the Portuguese and other nations , who were obliged to pass his coasts in their trading with , and voyages to , China , Macan , Xapon , and other kingdoms , concerning all of which sufficient testimony had been given . On account of all these reports , the theologians and jurists decided that the war against the ruler of Champan and the conquest of his lands was justifiable , and that this position was of no less importance to the Spaniards than that of Camboja. @# The governor and president , Don Francisco Tello , held a consultation with the Audiencia and others  --  religious and captains  --  as to what in their opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was resolved that , since Don Luys offered to make this expedition at his own expense with those men who chose to follow him , the plan should be carried out. 105 Accordingly , an agreement was made with him on the above basis . He was to take the men at his own expense , with commission and papers from the governor for affairs of government and war , and provisions from the Audiencia for the administration of justice . He began preparing ships , men , and provisions , in order to sail as soon as possible. @# In the meanwhile , Governor Don Francisco Tello despatched Don Joan de Camudio with a moderate-sized ship to Great China to obtain leave from the viceroy of Canton for the Spaniards to communicate and trade with his province . He was also to fetch saltpeter and metals which were wanted for the royal magazines of Manila . Don Joan reached his destination with good weather , and after stationing himself off the coast of Canton , sent certain of his company to the city with despatches for the tuton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Spaniards and the reason thereof , he gave them audience , and treated them cordially . The Portuguese residing in Macan near the city of Canton , made many efforts to prevent the viceroy , the conchifu , and other mandarins from admitting the Castilians of Manila into their country , alleging that the latter were pirates and evil-doers , who seized upon whatever kingdom and province they visited . They told them so many things that it would have sufficed to destroy them , had not the viceroy and mandarins looked at the matter dispassionately ; for they knew the declaration of the Portuguese to be hate and enmity , and that these passions moved them to desire that the Castilians have no trade with China , for their own interests . The affair went so far , that , having been brought before a court of justice , silence was imposed upon the Portuguese of Macan , under penalty of severe corporal punishment ; while the Castilians were given and assigned a port on the same coast , named El Pinal Pine Grove , twelve legues from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always enter and make a settlement of their own ; and they were given sufficient chapas i. e. , edicts or passports of safety and provisions therefor . Thereupon Don Joan de Camudio , entered El Pinal with his ship and there he was furnished with everything needful by the Chinese at a moderate price while the Spaniards went to and fro on the river upon their business to Canton in lorchas 106 and champans . While the Spaniards were detained , in the said port they were always well received in the city and lodged in houses within its walls . They went about the streets freely and armed , a thing which is new and unique in China in respect to foreigners . This caused so great wonder and envy to the Portuguese ( who are not so treated ) that they tried with might and main to prevent it , even going so far as to come by night in boats from Macan to El Pinal to fire the ship of the Castilians . This did not succeed , however , for , having been heard , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch was always kept on board , until the ship having accomplished its business and object departed thence , much to the satisfaction of the Chinese , who gave the Spaniards chapas and documents for the future . The ship reached Manila at the beginning of the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-nine. @# After Don Luys Dasmarinas had equipped two moderate-sized ships and a galliot , and collected two hundred men who chose to follow him in this enterprise to Camboja  --  they were part of the unemployed in Manila  --  with the necessary provisions , ammunition , and equipment on his ships ; and accompanied by Fray Alonso Ximenez and Fray Aduarte of the Order of St. Dominic and Fray Joan Bautista of the Order of St. Francis , some Japanese , and native Indians of Manila : he set sail with his fleet from the bay , in the middle of July , 107 of the year ninety-eight . The weather was somewhat contrary as the seasons of the vendavals had set in , but his desire to accomplish his voyage , lose no time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to disregard the weather ; he thought that , once at sea , he would be able to stop on the coast in the port of Bolinao. @# This plan did not succeed so well as Don Luis had anticipated , for , as soon as the fleet of these three ships left the bay it was so buffeted by the weather that it could not fetch the port of Bolinao or hold the sea . The flagship sprung a leak , and the ships returned to the mouth of the bay above Miraveles , 108 where they stayed several days refitting . When the weather moderated they set sail again , but again they were buffeted so violently that the ships were separated from one another , and the galliot  --  the weakest of them  --  with difficulty made the port of Cagayan . Quite dismantled and very necessitous , it entered by the bar of Camalayuga to the city of Segovia , which is at the head of the island of Luzon opposite Great China . There the alcalde-mayor of that province furnished it the necessary provisions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with twenty-five Spaniards and some Indians , hastened preparations for their departure and again left that port to rejoin the fleet which he had to follow , according to his instructions , making for the bar of the river of Camboja which was their destination . He had scarcely left Cagayan , when the almiranta entered the port in the same distress as the galliot . It was also detained some days to refit . Then it left again to rejoin the flagship and the galliot . The flagship being a stronger vessel kept the sea with difficulty ; and as the storm lasted a long time , it was compelled to run in the open toward China . The storm continued to rage so steadily that , without being able to meliorate its voyage , the ship was obliged to sail , amid high seas and cloudy weather , to certain small uninhabited islands on the coast of China below Macan . There it was many times in danger of shipwreck , and parts of the cargo were thrown away daily . The almiranta , after having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same storm , and anchored near the flagship , where it was lost with some men and its entire cargo. 109The flagship did its best to rescue those who escaped from the almiranta , and although the former kept afloat several days , at length it grounded near the coast . There it began to leak so badly that , with that and the strong sea which struck it broadside , the vessel went to pieces . The ship ' s boat had already been lost , and in order to save their lives before the ship was completely wrecked they were obliged to make rafts and prepare framework and planks on which Don Luis and the religious and crew  --  in all one hundred and twenty Spaniards  --  went ashore . They brought away from the said ship a few of the most valuable objects , the weapons , and the most manageable pieces of artillery , abandoning the rest as lost . All of the Spaniards were so soaked and in so ill a plight that some Chinese who came to the coast , from some neighboring towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of having been given certain things that had been brought away from the wreck , provided them with food and with a native vessel of small burden in which to leave that place and make for Macan and Canton , which were not far. @# As soon as Don Luis and his men sighted Macan , the former sent two soldiers of his company in Chinese vessels to the city and settlement of the Portuguese to announce their arrival and hardships , in order to obtain some help from them . He sent two other soldiers to Canton to ask the viceroy or tuton for assistance and protection , so that they might equip themselves in , and sail from , China , in prosecution of their voyage . The people of Macan and their chief captain Don Pablo of Portugal received the Castilians so ill that they were thrown into prison and not allowed to return to Don Luis . To the latter they sent word warning him to leave the coast immediately , as they would treat them all no less ill . When the Portuguese learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions had gone to Canton for the same purpose , they at once sent two Portuguese , members of their council and magistracy camara and regimiento to oppose their entry into China , by saying that they were robbers and pirates , and evil-doers , as they had said before of Don Joan de Camudio , who at this time was with his ship in the port of El Pinal , as abovesaid. @# In Canton , Captain Hernando de los Rios and his companion met Alferez Domingo de Artacho and other companions belonging to Don Joan ' s ship , who , on learning of the disaster of Don Luis ' s fleet and that it had been wrecked near by , came together and defended themselves against the calumnies and pretensions of the Portuguese . The result was that , as the main difficulty had been already overcome in the case of Don Joan , and the viceroy and mandarins were informed that all were from Manila , who Don Luis Dasmarinas was , and that he was going to Camboja with his fleet , they received him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Camudio , and gave him permission to enter the port of E1 Pinal with him . There the two met , with much regret by the one at Don Luis Dasmarinas ' s loss , and with much satisfaction by the other at finding there Don Joan de Camudio and his men , who provided them with certain things that they needed . With Don Joan ' s assistance , Don Luis at once bought a strong , moderate-sized junk , on which he embarked with some of his men , and the artillery and goods which had been saved . He enjoyed the same advantages in that port as the Spaniards of Don Joan de Camudio ' s ship . He intended to remain there until , having sent news to Manila , ships and the other necessary things for pursuing his voyage thence to Camboja , should be sent him , in respect to which Don Luis would never allow himself to show any discouragement or loss of resolution. @# Don Joan de Camudio left El Pinal , leaving Don Luis Dasmarinas and his men in that port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Manila in twelve days . After him , Don Luis sent Alferez Francisco Rodrigues with three companions to Manila in a small chapman to beg the governor and his supporters for help and assistance in his present emergency , a vessel , and what was needful to continue the expedition that he had begun . In Manila the news of Don Luis ' s loss and of the conditions to which he was reduced , was learned both from Don Joan de Camudio and from Alferez Francisco Rodrigues , who reached Manila after the former . Seeing that it was impossible for Don Luis to continue the voyage to Camboja , and that there was neither property nor substance with which to equip him again , nor the time for it , a moderate-sized ship was purchased and despatched from Manila to E1 Pinal with provisions and other things , under command of the same Alferez Francisco Rodrigues , who was accompanied by some soldiers of whom he was captain and leader . Through them Don Francisco Tello sent orders to Don Luis to embark his men and return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition to Camboja or of anything else. @# Captain Hernando de los Rios , who attended to Don Luis ' s affairs in Canton , wrote a letter at this time to Doctor Antonio de Morga ; and in order that what happened in this respect may be better understood , the letter reads word for word as follows. @# Fernando de los Rios Coronel , to Doctor Antonio de Morga , of his Majesty ' s council , and his auditor in the royal Audiencia and Chancilleria of the Filipinas , whom may our Lord preserve , in Manila . The hardships which have befallen us within the short time since we left Manila , have been so many , that , if I were to give your Grace an account of them all , it would weary you ; moreover the short time in which Don Joan is to depart does not allow of it . And since he will relate everything fully , I will relate only what occurred to us after reaching this land ; for our Lord was pleased to change our intentions , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were having had terminated . In sight of the port we were overtaken by a storm which greatly endangered our lives and forced us to come to this kingdom of China , where we expected at least that the Portuguese would allow us to refit our ship . As it was the Lord ' s will that we should lose it , we have suffered hardships enough , for scarcely anything was saved . I lost my property and a portion of that of others , because I was not present at the time of the wreck , as my general ordered myself and a coast-pilot the day before to go to look for fresh provisions . This coast is so wretchedly laid down on the charts that we did not know where we were , and on account of bad weather I could not return to the ship . Consequently I was obliged to go to Canton , where the Sangleys , who conveyed me and those who left the ship with me , accused us of having killed three Sangleys . And had we not found there Alferez Domingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleading against the Portuguese , we would have fared very ill . It was God ' s will , that , with their aid , we settled the case in court ; and , although without proofs , and without taking our depositions , they condemned us to a fine of fifty taes of silver . There we learned that for one and one-half months they i. e. , the men of Juan Zamudio ' s vessel had been defending themselves against the Portuguese , who , as soon as the Spaniards had arrived , went about saying that they were robbers and rebels , and people who seized the kingdoms into which they entered , and other things not worth writing . But in the end , all their efforts , good and evil  --  and indeed very evil  --  profited them nothing , because , by means of great assiduity and a quantity of silver , the Spaniards negotiated a matter which the Portuguese had never imagined , namely , the opening of a port in this country , in order that the Spaniards might always come safely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was never extended to the Portuguese , on account of which the latter are , or will be , even more angered . Besides , silence was imposed upon the Portuguese , although this was no part of the negotiations , so that they might not attempt by other means to do us all the injury possible ( as the Sangleys who were among them tell us ) . It is impossible to tell how much the Portuguese abhor the name of Castilians , unless it be experienced as we have done for our sins , for they have placed us in great extremity , as Don Joan will relate fully . For , when our general wrote to them that we had been wrecked , and were dying of hunger among infidels , and in great peril , and that he was not coming to trade , but was engaged in the service of his Majesty , the welcome given him by the Portuguese was to seize his messengers and keep them up to the present time in a dungeon . Lastly , while we have been in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will relate , although they are so near , not only do they leave us to suffer , but , if there are any well-disposed persons , they have forbidden them to communicate with us or to give us anything , under both temporal and spiritual penalty . In truth , to reflect upon this cruelty , and still more to experience it as we are doing , exhausts all patience . May God in His mercy give us patience and consolation because these infidels i. e. , the Chinese are the people who have corrupted the natural light more than any other people in the world . Hence angels and not men are required to deal with them . Since there are historians who record events in these regions , I shall not go into details respecting them . I only say , in order that you may understand in what a country we are , that it is the true kingdom of the devil , where he seems to rule with full power . Hence each Sangley appears to be the devil incarnate , for there is no malice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , with all its order and method , seems good as far as its preservation is concerned , yet , in practice , it is all a scheme of the devil . Although here they do not rob or plunder the foreigners openly , yet they do it by other and worse methods . Don Joan has worked hard , and gratitude is certainly due him , for he has accomplished a thing so difficult , that the Portuguese say only the devil or he could have done it . However , it is true that it has cost him , as I have heard , about seven thousand pesos , besides the risk to which he has been exposed ; for the Portuguese attempted to burn him in his ship ; and although their schemes came to naught , it is impossible to describe the bitterness which they feel at seeing us come here to trade , because of the signal injury they receive thereby . However , if one considers it thoroughly , the truth is that , if this business were established on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , because they would dispose of innumerable articles that they possess , and the majority of them , especially the poor , would profit by selling the work of their hands , and what they get from India , for which they always obtain a good price . As far as raising the price of Chinese merchandise to them is concerned , once established , and if the Sangleys understood that ships would come every year , they would bring down much more merchandise : and so much the more as Canton possesses such a large quantity of it , that there is more than enough for twice as many as are here , as we have seen with our own eyes . I can testify that , if they wish to load a ship with only one kind of goods , they can do so , even if it be needles ; the more so , since the greater part of what the Chinese consume is not included among our articles of purchase , the great bulk of our purchases being raw silk . Therefore I believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city i. e . , Manila for the following reasons which present themselves to me . The first is that , if orders were given for a ship to come authorized to invest the bulk of the money of that city i. e . , Manila , much more and better goods could be bought with much less money , and in articles which would prove more profitable ; since , in short , we would save what the people of Chincheo gain with us at Manila  --  a goodly sum. @# The second reason is that that city i. e . , Manila would be provided with all necessaries , because one can find in the city of Canton anything that can be desired. @# The third is that by this means we would avoid the excessive commerce of the Sangleys in that city i. e . , Manila , who cause the harm which your Grace knows , and even that which we do not know . They are people who , the less they are admitted , the better will it be for us in every respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them than the number required for the service of the community ; and then they would neither raise the price of provisions , nor retail what remains in the country , as they do now . Thus many pernicious sins which they commit and teach to the natives would be avoided . Although there seems to be some difficulty in establishing this and in smoothing down the Portuguese , still it might be accomplished. @# The fourth reason is that , if the purchase is made here , it will reach that city i. e . , Manila by Christmas , and each man would store his property in his house , and prepare and arrange it ; and then , even should the ships from Castilla arrive early , no loss would be suffered as at present  --  when , if those ships arrive before the goods purchased from China reach Manila the merchandise rises a hundred per cent. @# The fifth reason is that the ships might easily take in cargo any time in the month of May , and take advantage of the first vendavals , which sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing then , they run less risk , and will reach Nueva Espana one month or even two months earlier . Then , they can leave that country in January and come here i. e. , to the Filipinas by April without any of the dangers which beset them among these islands if they sail late , as we know. @# The sixth reason is that the many inconveniences now existing at the time of the purchase in Manila would be avoided  --  inconveniences with which your Grace is acquainted  --  and the citizens would have less trouble . Also in respect to the lading and its allotment i. e. , of shipping room a better system could certainly be followed , and it would be known who is to share in it . Things would be better remedied , because neither the money of Mexico nor that of companies would be allowed to be employed . The strict prevention of this alone would be sufficient to assure prosperity to Manila in a short time ; for , if only the inhabitants were to send their invested property , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexicans would have to be employed on the goods sent from here  --  I mean from Manila  --  if they do not allow the Mexicans to purchase in that city i. e . , Manila . And if less merchandise is sent from here i. e . , China , and consequently Manila and there are more buyers there i. e. , in Mexico , the goods would be worth double . This is self-evident , and if , as your Graces have already begun to remedy this matter , the measure be rigorously carried still farther , that city i. e . , Manila must prosper greatly . For , by not sending to Nueva Espana any other produce except that from that city i. e . , Manila mainly purchased in this country i. e . , China , Manila would prosper as greatly as one could desire . If we consider the benefit and favor which his Majesty confers upon us in this matter , we would esteem it much more than we do now . But I believe that we shall regret it , when , perchance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , in opposition to what I have said about coming to purchase here , that his Majesty would be defrauded of the customs and duties which the Sangleys now pay , and of their tribute . But there is a remedy for all this , for with the freight duties alone his Majesty would save much more ; as also by buying ammunitions here and other articles which he needs for the conservation of that country i. e. , the islands twice as cheaply and abundantly , and without depending on the Chinese to bring them at their leisure , who at times  --  and indeed every year  --  leave us without them , since we are forced to go to get them . As far as the tribute is concerned , I believe that his Majesty would be better served if there were no Sangleys there at all , than by receiving the tribute . And it might happen , through this way , if our Lord ordered it , that a door might be opened for the preaching of the gospel and for the conversion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially aimed at by him . After all , things require a beginning , and the road would be opened , although at present it seems shut ; for , if we hope that the Portuguese attempt this , I do not know when they will do it , considering that they have not tried to do so , for so long as they have been settled here . Even the Sangleys say that the Portuguese began like ourselves . At first they went to and fro ; then two sick men remained ; the next year they built four houses ; and thus they continued to increase . I know that there is no other difficulty for us to do likewise than that which the Portuguese offer . To return to the Portuguese opposition , it is something amazing , for not only are they vexed at our coming here , but also at our going to Camboja or to Sian . They assert that those districts are theirs , but I can not see why they so designate them  --  for it is just the contrary  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our negligence , to seize our possessions near the strait of Malaca , and enter the line of demarcation falling to the crown of Castilla , as I would make them fully understand if an opportunity were presented . One can read in Historia de las Indias 111 i. e . , History of the Indias in the one hundred and second chapter , and before and after it , that , at the request of the Portuguese , his Holiness drew the said line from three hundred and seventy legues west of the islands of Caboverde , which were called the Espericas . The one hundred and eighty degrees of longitude falling to the Portuguese terminate and end as above said , near the above-mentioned strait . All the rest belongs to us . Furthermore , since we are subjects of one king , how do we suffer them to forbid us all our trade ? Why do they bar us from Maluco , Sian , Camboja , Cochinchina , China , and all the rest of this archipelago ? What are we to do then , if they wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have dwelt on this matter in order to express my feelings . Not until our departure shall I write to your Grace about the fertility and nature of the country , and of its greatness . Then I shall endeavor to give a full account of the land , and to mark out this coast , for nothing is put down correctly. @# This is the best coast 112 of all that have been discovered , and the most suitable for galleys , if God should ordain that they come hither . I have already discovered where the king keeps his treasure . The country is very rich , and the city of Canton well supplied , although there is nothing to be said in regard to its buildings , of which the whole city possesses few of any importance , according to the information received from a Theatin 113 Sangley with whom I found much pleasure in talking  --  though I was able to do so for only one afternoon . He was a man of intelligence and reason , and it is said that he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , Pekin , where the king resides , and in Lanquien i. e . , Nankin the fathers of the Society enjoy the quiet possession of three houses . There are seven fathers , among whom is one called Father Ricio , 114 an associate of Father Rugero who went to Roma . He is an excellent mathematician and has corrected the Chinese calendar which contained many errors and false opinions , and their fantastic idea of the world , which they believed to be flat . He made them a globe and a sphere , and with this and the sound arguments and reasons which they give them , the fathers are considered as people descended from heaven . He says that in those regions the people would be very favorable to conversion , if there were ministers ; and that there i. e. , in Pekin the foreigners are not looked upon with wonder as they are here i. e. , in Canton . He says that the people are much more sensible and reasonable , so much so that they call the people of this country barbarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toledo , namely thirty and two-thirds degrees , and that from there to Paquien is a twenty-five days ' journey , so that the latter city must lie in more than fifty degrees of latitude. 115 The above-mentioned brother comes down annually to collect the stipend given them by the people here for their three houses . Now they are expecting a great friend of theirs who is said to be the second person nearest to the king . One can travel through all this land by water , and therefore it abounds in everything , for articles are conveyed over the rivers and there is no need of beasts of burden , which is its special greatness. @# He who wishes to depict China without having seen the land , must draw a country full of rivers and towns , and without a palmo of ground left lying idle . I wish I had more time in which to describe some of the things of China which I have observed and inquired about with special care , and of which , if God please , I shall be the messenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we shall arrive there at a seasonable time , if it be our Lord ' s will that we leave this place with good auspices . The king sent a ship to Manila at the end of August to ask for assistance . I do not know whether it has arrived or whether it returned to put in port , for it left very late . Bias Ruis sent fifty picos 116 from Camanguian . According to report , the king has apportioned and given him nine thousand vassals , and as many more to Belloso. @# At present we ourselves are enduring the necessity of which Don Juan Camudio will inform you . I entreat your Grace to help us , since it is of so great importance . I kiss many times the hand of my lady Dona Joana . May our Lord preserve your Grace for many years in the prosperity and tranquillity which we your servants desire . From the port of El Pinal , frozen with cold , the twenty-third of December , ninety-eight. @# If my brother should come before I return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your Grace to do good to all  --  especially to those of that land  --  to show him the goodness which your Grace has always shown me. @# FERNANDO DE LOS RIOS CORONEL @# After Don Juan de Camudio ' s departure from El Pinal , where Don Luis Dasmarinas remained with his junk awaiting the assistance that he expected from Manila and which he had requested through Don Joan and Alferez Francisco Rodrigues , Don Luis thought that , since some time had passed , the answer was being delayed , while his people were suffering great want and cold there . Therefore he tried to put out to sea in the junk , and to make for Manila . But the weather did not permit this , nor was the vessel large enough to hold all of Don Luis ' s men for the voyage . He stopped near the fort where the Portuguese of Macan again sent him many messages and requests to leave the coast at once , warning him that they would seize him and his companions , and would send them to India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered them that he had not come to harm or offend them , but that he was going to the kingdom of Camboja for the service of God and of his Majesty ; that he had been shipwrecked and had suffered many hardships , the severest of which had been due to the Portuguese of Macan themselves , subjects of his Majesty ; that he was expecting help from Manila in order that he might return thither ; and that he begged and requested them to aid and protect him , and to free the two Castilians whom they had seized . Finally he declared that if , in spite of all this , they should attempt to do him any harm or injury , he would defend himself to the best of his ability ; and he protested that any losses resulting therefrom would lie at their door . Thenceforward Don Luis Dasmarinas kept strict watch on his ship . He kept his weapons ready and the artillery loaded , and was on his guard day and night . And he was not mistaken , for the people of Macan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this end the chief captain himself came one day , with some fustas and other vessels , and with men armed with javelins , guns , and artillery , when they thought the Castilians would be off their guard , to attack Don Luis Dasmarinas . The latter , suspecting what was about to happen , awaited them arms in hand ; and as he saw the Portuguese fleet attacking him , he began to play upon them with his muskets , arquebuses , and a few pieces of artillery , with such rapidity that he inflicted a very severe loss upon his enemy and upon the ship which carried the chief captain , killing one of his pages who stood behind him , and other persons . The chief captain retired with all the other vessels , and they made for the high sea , having been defeated by Don Luis , who did not attempt to follow them but remained on the watch . As the Portuguese did not dare attack him again they made for Macan , and Don Luis Dasmarinas put into the port of El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security . There Don Luis remained until Captain Francisco Rodrigues arrived with the ship from Manila , and joined him . They distributed their men between the two ships and made some purchases with what this last ship had brought from Manila , in the very city of Macan , for the Portuguese , for the sake of their own interests , gave and sold them goods , in spite of a certain apprehension of the law . They returned to Manila leaving a few men in El Pinal who had died of sickness , among whom was Fray Alonso Ximenez , the principal promoter of this enterprise . His associate , Fray Diego Aduarte , did not choose to return to Manila , but went to Macan and thence to Goa , in order to go to Espana . Don Luis reached Manila with both ships , and his expedition to Camboja and his conduct of the said enterprise remained in this state. @# It has been already related that the galliot , one of the ships of Don Luis Dasmarinas ' s fleet , in which Luis Ortiz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refitted there , sailed again during fairly good weather to find the fleet . This ship although so inadequate to resist storms at sea , was permitted , through God ' s mercy , to encounter those which it met without being wrecked . It made its way along the coast of Cochinchina and Champan , inside the shoals of Aynao , and reached the bar of Camboja . Expecting to find all or some of the ships of its convoy within the bar , it ascended the river as far as the city of Chordemuco . There they found Diego Belloso and Blas Ruys de Hernan Goncalez , with some Castilians who had joined them , and other Portuguese who had come by way of Malaca , and with whose assistance many battles had been won in favor of King Prauncar , who had been restored to his kingdom , although some of his provinces had not been entirely pacified . It was learned there that neither Don Luis Dasmarinas nor any other of his fleet had reached Camboja . Those in the galliot said that Don Luis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , arms , and some religious , to accomplish what he had always desired to do in that kingdom ; that he would not be long in coming ; and that their galliot and crew belonged to his fleet . Blas Ruis and his Castilian companions greatly rejoiced over so opportune news . The former thought that everything was turning out well , and that now , according to the present state of affairs , matters would be accomplished and settled as they wished . Diego Belloso and his party , although they did not show their regret , were not so pleased , for they much preferred the happy termination and reward of this expedition to be for the Portuguese and the government of India . They had had certain quarrels and disputes with Blas Ruis over this . But seeing that the affair had reached this state , they conformed to the times . Thereupon all joined together , Portuguese and Castilians , and informed Prauncar and his mandarins of the arrival of Alferez Luis Ortiz with his galliot and companions , saying that they were part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Luis Dasmarinas was coming in it in person , with religious and men to aid and serve the king , in conformity to what he himself had requested in his letter to Manila , several months before . The king seemed pleased at this , and so did some of his mandarins who liked the Spaniards , and recognized what benefits they had derived from them hitherto . These believed that the matter would turn out as it was represented to them . But the king ' s stepmother , and other mandarins of her party , especially the Moro Malay Ocuna Lacasamana , were vexed at the arrival of the Spaniards , for they thought that the latter , being valiant men , numerous , and so courageous , as they already knew , would dominate everything , or at least would take the best ; moreover they alone wished to deal with King Prauncar . Thus their aversion for Spanish affairs became known to be as great as the favor with which Prauncar , on the contrary , regarded them . The latter immediately assigned the Spaniards a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place which Blas Ruiz and Diego Belloso occupied. @# Before Don Luis Dasmarinas left Manila with his fleet , Captain Joan de Mendoca Gamboa requested Governor Don Francisco Tello to allow him to go to the kingdom of Sian with a moderate-sized ship , in order to trade . For the greater security of his voyage and business , he asked the governor to give him letters to the king of Sian , in which the latter should be informed that he was sent as the governor ' s ambassador and messenger to continue the peace , friendship , and commerce which Joan Tello de Aguirre had contracted with Sian the year before . Seeing that Don Luis Dasmarinas , who was on the way to Camboja , had left in Manila for another occasion some ammunition and other things of use to his fleet , Don Joan , in order better to facilitate the granting of his request , offered to take these stores on board his ship and sail round by way of Camboja , where he supposed that he would find Don Luis Dasmarinas , and deliver them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having furnished him with the necessary despatches , Don Joan de Mendoca left Manila with his ship , taking as pilot Joan Martinez de Chave , who had been Joan Tello ' s pilot when the latter went to Sian . He took as companions some sailors and Indian natives . He had a quantity of siguei 117 and other goods to barter , and the ammunition and provisions which he was to convey to Don Luis . With him embarked Fray Joan Maldonado 118 and an associate , both religious of the Order of St. Dominic . The former was a grave and learned man and a very intimate friend of Don Luis Dasmarinas , to whom his order took great pleasure in sending him as a companion . They left Manila , without knowing of Don Luis ' s shipwreck two months after the latter had set sail . Crossing over the shoals they shortly reached the bar of Camboja and ascended to the capital , where they found the galliot of the fleet and learned that its other ships had not arrived . The king received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruiz , Luis Ortiz , and their companions . They passed the time together , and would not let Joan de Mendoca leave Camboja with his ship until something was heard of Don Luis Dasmarinas . A few days later , they learned through Chinese ships , and by other means , that the latter had put into China with difficulty and in distress , and that he was there preparing to continue his voyage . Although this event caused them sorrow , they still hoped that in a short time Don Luis would be in Camboja with the two ships of his fleet. @# At this same time , a mestizo , named Govea , son of a Portuguese and a Japanese woman , who lived in Japon , collected some mestizo companions , as well as Japanese and Portuguese , on a junk which he owned in the port of Nangasaqui , with the intention of coasting along China , Champan , and Camboja , to seek adventures and to barter , but mainly to make prizes of what they might meet at sea . With them embarked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galleon " San Felipe , " while on its way to Nueva Espana in the year ninety-six . His name was Don Antonio Malaver , and he had been a soldier in Italia . He came to the Filipinas from Nueva Espana as captain and sargento-mayor of the troops brought that year by Doctor Antonio de Morga in the fleet from Nueva Espana to Manila . Don Antonio Malaver , who had no wish to return to the Filipinas , thinking that by that way he could go to India and thence to Espana , and that on the road there might fall to him some share of the illgotten gains of that voyage , embarked with Govea and his company . After they had run down the coast and heard some news of the entry of Spaniards into Camboja , Don Antonio persuaded Govea to enter the river of Camboja , where they would find Spaniards , and affairs in such a state that they might take some effective action in that kingdom , and thrive better than at sea . They went up as far as Chordemuco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and list . As they all  --  and they were a considerable number of men  --  saw the delay of Don Luis Dasmarinas , they proclaimed as leaders Fray Joan Maldonado , Diego Belloso , and Blas Ruis . Then they began to treat with King Prauncar on their own account concerning their establishment and comfort , and to request lands and rice for their maintenance and other things which had been promised them , alleging that they did not derive the necessary usufruct and profit out of his concessions to Belloso and Blas Ruis . Although the king gave them good hopes for everything he brought nothing to a conclusion , being hindered in this by his stepmother and the mandarins of her party , who would have liked to see the Spaniards out of the kingdom ; and in this they gained more animus every day by the non-arrival of Don Luis Dasmarinas . Consequently , the Spaniards spent the time in going to and fro between their quarters and the city to negotiate with the king , with whose answers and conversations they sometimes returned satisfied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his Malays had their quarters near those of the Spaniards , and since they were Moros , so opposed in religion and pretension , the two parties had no affinity . Once a quarrel arose between Spaniards and Malays , and several men were severely wounded on both sides . Among them Alferez Luys Ortiz , commander of the galliot , had both legs run through and was in great danger . King Prauncar was angry at this , but did not dare to inflict any punishment or make any reparation for these injuries . While matters were at such a heat and the Malays were ill-disposed toward the Spaniards , one day while Fray Joan Maldonado , Diego Belloso , and Blas Ruyz were in the city , and Luys de Villafane was in command of the quarters , on account of the wounds and illness of Luys Ortiz , another quarrel arose in the quarters with the Malays . Luys de Villafane , taking advantage of this opportunity , determined , with a few Spaniards who followed him , to unite with Govea and his men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they possessed , and sack them . Incited by anger and still more by covetousness , they carried this out , and after having killed many Malays and taken a quantity of property from them , they retired and fortified themselves in their own quarters and in the Japanese ship . The king and his mandarins were very angry at this , and not less so were Fray Joan Maldonado , Belloso , and Blas Ruyz , who were in Chordemuco ; but Ocuna Lacasamana was far the angriest , at seeing the injury and insult done him , and at the breaking of the peace so recently made in reference to former quarrels . Although Fray Joan Maldonado , Belloso , and Blas Ruiz went at once to the quarters to remedy the matter , they found it so complicated that not even King Prauncar , who tried to intervene , could compose it . The latter warned the Spaniards to look to their personal safety , for he saw their party fallen and in great danger , without his being able to help it . Fray Joan Maldonado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Diego Belloso and Bias Ruis , yet took refuge in Joan de Mendoca ' s ship for greater security , and some Spaniards did the same . Diego Belloso , Blas Ruiz , and the others relying on the king ' s friendship , and their services in the country , remained on shore , although they took every precaution and kept the closest possible guard over their safety. 119 @# The Malay Lacasamana , aided by his men and the mandarins of his party , and supported by the king ' s step-mother , lost no more time , nor the present opportunity , but attacked the Castilians , Portuguese , and Japanese , at once , both by land and sea . Finding them separated  --  although some offered as much resistance as possible  --  he killed them all , including Diego Belloso and Blas Ruiz de Hernan Goncales . Then he burned their quarters and vessels except that of Joan de Mendoca , who , fearing the danger , descended the river toward the sea and defended himself against some praus that had followed him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s associate , and some few Spaniards . On shore there remained alive only one Franciscan religious , five Manila Indians , and a Castilian named Joan Dias , whom the king , who grieved exceedingly for the deaths of the Spaniards , had hid carefully in the open country . Although the king advised the friar not to appear in public until the Malays were appeased , that religious , imagining that he could escape their fury , emerged with two Indians in order to escape from the kingdom . But they were found and killed like the others . Joan Dias and three Indians remained many days in concealment , and the king maintained them , until , after other events , they could appear . Thus the cause of the Spaniards in Camboja came to an end , and was so entirely defeated that the Moro Malay and his partisans remained complete masters . They managed the affairs of the kingdom with so little respect for King Prauncar , that finally they killed him also . Thereupon a fresh insurrection broke out , the provinces revolted , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion and disturbance than before. @# The Spanish garrison left in La Caldera , at the withdrawal of Don Joan Ronquillo ' s camp from the river of Mindanao , passed into command of Captain Villagra at the death of Captain Joan Pacho in Jolo , and was suffering for lack of provisions ; for neither the people of the river could give them to the Spaniards , nor would the Joloans furnish any on account of the war declared upon them . Therefore the garrison urgently requested Governor Don Francisco Tello either to aid their presidio with provisions , soldiers , and ammunition , or to allow them to retire to Manila  --  a thing of which they were most desirous  --  since there they gained no other special result than that of famine , and of incarceration in that fort , and of no place wherein to seek their sustenance . The governor , in view of their insistence in the matter ; and having but little money in the royal exchequer , with which to provide for and maintain the said presidio  --  and for the same reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their outrages upon the Spaniards , and their insurrection was deferred  --  and thinking that the return to Mindanao matters would be a long question : he was inclined to excuse the difficulty and anxiety of maintaining the presidio of La Caldera . In order to do it with a reasonable excuse he consulted the Audiencia and other intelligent persons , and requested them to give him their opinion . But he first communicated his wishes to them and gave them some reasons with which he tried to persuade them to give him the answer that he desired . The Audiencia advised him not to remove or raise the garrison of La Caldera , but to reenforce and maintain it , and to attend to the affairs of Jolo and the river of Mindanao as soon as possible , even if what was necessary for those two places should be withdrawn from some other section . They said that this was the most urgent need , and the one which required the greatest attention in the islands , both in order to pacify those provinces and to keep them curbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should gain courage and boldly venture still farther , and come down to make captures among the Pintados and carry the war to the very doors of the Spaniards. 120 Notwithstanding this reply the governor resolved to raise and withdraw the garrison , and sent orders to Captain Villagra immediately to burn the fort which had been built in La Caldera , to withdraw with all his men and ships , and return to Manila . This was quickly done , for the captain and the soldiers of the garrison waited for nothing more than to dismantle the fort and leave . When the Joloans saw the Spaniards abandoning the country , they were persuaded that the latter would return to Mindanao no more , and that they had not sufficient forces to do so . Thereupon they gained fresh resolution and courage , and united with the people of Buhahayen on the river , and equipped a number of caracoas and other craft , in order to descend upon the coast of Pintados to plunder them and make captives . The people of Tampacan , who lost hope of receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s return to the river , since they had also abandoned the fort of La Caldera and left the country , came to terms with and joined the people of Buhahayen , their neighbors , in order to avoid the war and injuries that they were suffering from the latter . Then all turned their arms against the Spaniards , promising themselves to make many incursions into their territory and gain much plunder . Accordingly they prepared their fleet , and appointed as leaders and commanders of it two of the experienced chiefs , of the river of Mindanao , called Sali and Silonga . They left the Mindanao River in the month of July of the year ninety-nine , in the season of the vendavals , with fifty caracoas , containing more than three thousand soldiers armed with arquebuses , campilans , carasas , other weapons with handles , and many culverins , and steered toward the islands of Oton and Panay , and neighboring islands . They passed Negros Island and went to the river of Panay , which they ascended for five legues to the chief settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sacked the settlement , burned the houses and churches , captured many native Christians  --  men , women , and children  --  upon whom they committed many murders , cruelties , and outrages . They pursued these in boats more than ten legues up the river , and destroyed all the crops . For the alcalde-mayor , and those who could , fled inland among the mountains , and accordingly the enemy had a better opportunity to do what they pleased . After they had burned all the vessels in the river , they left the river of Panay with their boats laden with pillaged goods and captive Christians . They did the same in the other islands and towns which they passed . Then they returned to Mindanao , without any opposition being offered , with a quantity of gold and goods and more than eight hundred captives , besides the people whom they had killed . In Mindanao they divided the spoil , and agreed to get ready a larger fleet for the next year , and return to make war better prepared. 121 @# This daring attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pintados , both on account of their deeds there and also on account of the fear and terror with which they inspired the natives ; because of the latter being in the power of the Spaniards , who kept them subject , tributary , and disarmed , and neither protected them from their enemies , nor left them the means to defend themselves , as they used to do when there were no Spaniards in the country . Therefore many towns of peaceful and subjected Indians revolted and withdrew to the tingues , 122 and refused to descend to their houses , magistrates , and encomenderos . As was reported daily , they all had a great desire to revolt and rebel , but they were appeased and reduced again to subjection by a few promises and presents from their encomenderos and religious who showed great pity and sadness over their injuries . Although in Manila people regretted these injuries , and still more those which were expected in the future from the enemy , they did nothing but regret them  --  since the governor was ill provided with ship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss which they had suffered for having raised the camp on the river of Mindanao and dismantled the presidio of La Caldera. @# As soon as the weather permitted , the Mindanaos and Joloans returned with a large fleet of more than seventy well-equipped ships and more than four thousand fighting men , led by the same Silonga and Sali , and other Mindanao and Jolo chiefs , to the same islands of Pintados , with the determination of taking and sacking the Spanish town of Arevalo , which is situated in Oton . Captain Joan Garcia de Sierra , alcalde-mayor of that province , having heard of this expedition and of the designs entertained by the enemy , took the most necessary precautions , and , gathering into the town all the Spaniards who lived there and in its neighborhood , shut himself up in it with all of them . Then , having repaired , as well as possible , a wooden fort there , he gathered there the women and their possessions . He and the Spaniards  --  about seventy men  --  armed with arquebuses , awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river of Panay again , passed Negros Island and made for the town of Arevalo , where they anchored close to the native settlement . Then they landed one thousand five hundred men armed with arquebuses , campilans , and carasas , and , without stopping on the way marched against the Spanish town which was the object of their attack . The Spaniards , divided into troops , sallied forth and opened fire with their arquebuses upon the enemy with such vehemence that they forced them to retreat and take refuge on board their caracoas . So great was the enemy ' s confusion that many Mindanaos were killed before they could embark . Captain Joan Garcia de Sierra , who was on horseback , pursued the enemy so closely to the water ' s edge that the latter cut off the legs of his mount with their campilans and brought him to the ground where they killed him . The enemy embarked with a heavy loss of men , and halted at the island of Guimaraez , 123 in sight of Arevalo . There they counted their men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a few , and among whom was one of the most noted chiefs and leaders . Then they sailed for Mindanao , making a great show of grief and sorrow , and sounding their bells and tifas. 124 They made no further delay at the Pintados , deriving little profit or gain from the expedition , but much injury , and loss of men and reputation , which was felt more deeply upon their arrival in Jolo and Mindanao . In order to remedy this disaster , it was proposed to renew their expedition against the Pintados at the first monsoon with more ships and men , and it was so decided. @# When the affairs of Japon were discussed above , we spoke of the loss of the ship " San Felipe " in Hurando , in the province of Toca ; of the martyrdom of the discalced Franciscan religious in Nangasaqui ; and of the departure of the Spaniards and religious who had remained there , with the exception of Fray Geronymo de Jesus , who , changing his habit , concealed himself in the interior of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given an answer to the governor of Manila , through his ambassador , Don Luis Navarrete , excusing himself for what had happened , was induced , at the instigation of Faranda Quiemon and his supporters , to send a fleet against Manila ; that he had supplied Faranda with rice and other provisions in order to despatch it ; and that the latter had begun preparations , but not having managed to bring the matter to the point that he had promised , the enterprise was dragged on and left in that condition . What happened after these events is that Taicosama was seized with a severe sickness in Miaco and died , not without having first had time to dispose of the succession and government of his kingdom , and to see that the empire should be continued in his only son , who was ten years old at that time . For this purpose he fixed his choice on the greatest tono in Japon , called Yeyasudono , lord of Quanto  --  which are certain provinces in the north  --  who had children and grandchildren , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kingdom . Taicosama summoned Yeyasudono to court , and told him that he wished to marry his son to the latter ' s granddaughter , the daughter of his eldest son , so that he might succeed to the empire . The marriage was celebrated , and the government of Japon left , until his son was older , to Yeyasudono , associated with Guenifuin , Fungen , Ximonojo , and Xicoraju , his special favorites and counselors , 125 to whose hands the affairs of his government had passed for some years , in order that thus united they might continue to administer them after his death , until his son , whom he left named and accepted by the kingdom as his successor and supreme lord of Japon , was old enough to rule in person . After the death of Taicosama in the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-nine , 126 the five governors kept his son carefully watched in the fortress of Usaca , with the service and pomp due his person , while they remained at Miaco at the head of the government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an expedition against Manila ceased altogether , and nothing more was said about the matter . Since the affairs of Japon are never settled , but have always been in a disturbed condition , they could not last many days as Taico left them . For , with the new administration and the arrival at court , from other provinces of Japon , of tonos , lords , captains , and soldiers , whom the combaco in his lifetime had kept busy in the wars with Coray i. e . , Corea and the king of China , in order to divert them from the affairs of his kingdom , the men began to become restless and corrupt . The result was that the four governors entertained suspicions of , and quarreled with , Yeyasudono , for they feared from his manner of governing and procedure that he was preparing , on account of his power , to seize the empire for himself , and to exclude and take no notice of Taico ' s son , who had been married to his granddaughter . The flame burned still higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way about the matter ; and now , either because they desired the succession of Taico ' s son , or because they liked to see matters in disorder so that each one might act for his own interest  --  which was the most likely motive , and not the affection for Taicosama , who , being a tyrant , had been feared rather than loved  --  they persuaded the governors to oppose Yeyasudono and check his designs . Under this excitement , the opposition became so lively , that they completely declared themselves , and Yeyasudono found it convenient to leave the kingdom of Miaco and go to his lands of Quanto , in order to insure his own safety and return to the capital with large forces with which to demand obedience . The governors , understanding his intentions , were not idle , but collected men and put two hundred thousand soldiers in the field . They were joined by most of the tonos and lords of Japon , 127 both Christian and pagan , while the minority remained among the partisans and followers of Yeyasudono @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quanto to meet the governors and their army , in order to give them battle with one hundred thousand picked men of his own land . The two armies met , and the battle was fought with all their forces. 128 In the course of the struggle , there were various fortunes , which rendered the result doubtful . But , finally , after a number of men had deserted from the camp of the governors to that of Yeyasudono , it was perceived that the latter ' s affairs were improving . Victory was declared in his favor , after the death of many soldiers and lords . Those who remained  --  for but few escaped  --  including the four governors , surrendered to Yeyasudono . After he had beheaded the majority of the tonos , and deprived others of their seigniories and provinces , which he granted again to men devoted to his party ; and after his return to the capital , triumphant over his enemies , and master of the whole kingdom : he inflicted special punishment upon the governors , by having them crucified immediately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets of the principal cities of Usaca , Sacay , Fugimen , and Miaco , in carts , until they died on the crosses in the midst of other tortures . Since these were the men through whose zeal and advice Taico had , a few years before , inflicted the same punishment upon the discalced friars whom he martyred , we may infer that God chose to punish them in this world also with the same rigor. @# Thus Yeyasudono remained the supreme ruler of Japon as Taico had been , but failed to withdraw the son from the fortress of Usaca ; on the contrary he set more guards over him . Then , changing his own name , as is usual among the seigniors of Japon , he styled himself Daifusama for the sake of greater dignity. @# Fray Geronymo de Jesus , associate of the martyrs , who kept hidden in Japon on account of the tyrant Taicosama ' s persecution , lived in disguise in the interior of the country among the Christians . Consequently , although he was carefully sought , he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Daifu ' s seizure of the government , he came to Miaco . He found means to reveal himself to one of Dayfu ' s servants , to whom he told many things about the Filipinas , the king of Espana , and the latter ' s kingdoms and seigniories , especially those of Nueva Espana and Peru , of which the Filipinas were a dependency and with whom they had communication , and the importance to Daifu of gaining the friendship and commerce of the Spaniards . The servant found an opportunity to relate all these things to Daifu , who for some time had desired to have the trade and commerce which the Portuguese had established in Nangasaqui in his own kingdoms of Quanto , of which he was the natural lord , in order to give it more importance . Thinking that this could be accomplished through the means which Fray Geronymo had suggested , he had the latter summoned . Having asked him his name , Fray Geronymo told the king that after the martyrdom of his associates , he had remained in Japon , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manila had sent when Taicosama was alive , to treat of peace and friendship with the Spaniards , and who had died as was well known , after having made converts to Christianity and established several hospitals and houses at the capital and other cities of Japon , where they healed the sick and performed other works of piety , without asking any other reward or advantage than to serve God , to teach the souls of that kingdom the faith and path of salvation , and to serve their neighbors . In this work , and in works of charity , especially to the poor , as he and his fellow religious professed , they lived and maintained themselves , without seeking or holding any goods or property upon the earth , solely upon the alms which were given them therefor . After this , he told him who the king of Espana was , that he was a Christian , and that he possessed great kingdoms and territories in all parts of the world ; and that Nueva Espana , Piru , Filipinas , and India , belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attending above all else to the growth and conservation of the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ , the true God , and Creator of the universe . The religious explained to the king , as well as he could , other things concerning the Christian religion , and said that if he wished friendship with his Majesty and the latter ' s subjects of Manila , as well as with his viceroys of Nueva Espana and Piru he i. e . , Fray Geronymo would be able to compass it , for it would be very useful and profitable to the king and to all his Japanese kingdoms and provinces . This last motive , namely , the profit and benefit to be derived from friendship and commerce with the Spaniards , was more to the taste of Daifusama than what he had heard concerning their religion . Although he did not reject the latter or say anything about it , yet at this interview and at others with Fray Geronymo  --  whom Daifu had given permission to appear in public in his religious habit , and to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship with the governor of Manila , of the Spaniards ' coming yearly with ships from Manila to trade at Quanto , where the Japanese had a port , and an established commerce with the Spaniards . Also his Japanese were to sail thence to Nueva Espana , where they were to enjoy the same amity and trade . As he understood the voyage to be long and Spanish ships necessary for it , Daifu proposed that the governor of Manila send him masters and workmen to build them . He also proposed that in the said kingdom and principal port of Quanto , which , as above-said , lies in the north of Japon , and is a mountainous country , abounding in silver mines , which were not worked because no one knew how , Fray Geronymo and whatever associates he might choose from among the Spaniards who came there , should establish their house and dwelling , just as the religious of the Society of Jesus had theirs with the Portuguese in Nangasaqui . Fray Geronymo , who desired by any means to restore the cause of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , as they had begun to do when the martyrs were alive  --  for this aim alone moved him  --  did not doubt that he could once and many times facilitate Daifusama ' s desires , and even assured him that they would certainly be realized through his help , and that there would be no difficulty whatever to prevent this . Thereupon Daifu appeared favorable and more inclined to the affairs of Manila than Taico , his predecessor , had been . He assured the religious that he would give the Spaniards a good reception in Japon , and that the ships , which should happen to put in there in distress or in any other way , would be equipped and despatched with all necessities ; and that he would not allow any Japanese to go to plunder or commit any injury on the coasts of the Filipinas . In fact , because he learned that six ships of Japanese corsairs had sailed that year from the island of Zazuma Satsuma and other ports of the lower kingdoms , and had seized and plundered two Chinese merchantmen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its coast , he immediately had them sought out in his kingdom . Having imprisoned more than four hundred men , he had them all crucified . Likewise he ordered that , in the future , the annual ships from Nangasaqui to Manila laden with flour and other goods should not be so numerous , but only enough to supply Manila , and that they should have the permission and sanction of its governor , so that they might not be the cause of loss or injury to that place. @# Since Daifu pressed Fray Geronymo more and more every day for the fulfilment of what he had taken upon himself , the latter told him that he had already written and would write again about those matters to the governor and royal Audiencia of Manila . He requested Daifu to send a servant of his household with these letters and the message , in order that they might have more credit and authority . Daifu approved of this and despatched them through Captain Chiquiro , a pagan Japanese and a servant of his , who took a present of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geronymo . There was no special letter from Daifu , except that Fray Geronymo said that he wrote and petitioned in the name of Daifu . He explained the better condition of peace and friendship now existing between the Filipinas and Japon , and what Daifu promised and assured . He wrote that , in order to facilitate the above , Daifu had promised him that the Spaniards could go with their ships to trade at Quanto , and that the governor should send him masters and workmen to build ships for the voyage from Japon to Nueva Espana . There was also to be commerce and friendship with the viceroy of that country . He said that Daifu had already given leave for religious to go to Japon , to christianize and to found churches and monasteries , and had given him a good site for a monastery in Miaco , where he was , and that the same would be done in other parts and regions of Japon in which they might wish to settle . Fray Geronymo insidiously and cunningly added this last to Daifu ' s promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filipinas to push the matter more earnestly before the governor and Audiencia , that they might agree to this more easily , in order not to lose the great results that Fray Geronymo said were set afoot. @# During the same administration of Don Francisco Tello , in the year one thousand six hundred , toward the end of the month of October , a ship came from the province of Camarines with news that two ships , a flagship and its almiranta , well armed and with foreign crews , had entered and anchored in one of its northern bays , twenty legues from the channel and cape of Espiritu Sancto . Under pretense of being friends of the Spaniards they asked , and bartered with , the natives for rice and other provisions that they needed . Then they weighed anchor and went away , making for the channel through which they entered , after having left certain feigned letters for Governor Don Francisco Tello , in which they declared themselves friends , and that they were coming to Manila to trade by permission of his Majesty . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships by swimming to the island of Capul , and also through an Englishman , 129 seized by the natives while on shore , we learned that these ships were from Holanda , whence they had sailed in a convoy of three other armed vessels , with patents and documents from Count Mauricio de Nasao who called himself Prince of Orange , in order to make prizes in the Indias. 130 Having entered the South Sea through the strait of Magallanes , three of the five ships had been lost , and these two , the flagship and the almiranta coasted along Chile , where they captured two vessels . Then , having turned away from the coast of Lima , they put out to sea and pursued their voyage , without stopping anywhere , in the direction of the Filipinas , among which they entered with the intention of plundering whatever might come their way . Having learned that a galleon , named " Santo Tomas " was expected from Nueva Espana with the money derived from the merchandise of two years ' cargoes which had been sent there from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to arrive from China , by which they could fill their hands ; and that there were no galleys or armed ships at that season which could do them any harm : they determined to go as far as the mouth of Manila Bay , and stay there , supplying themselves with the provisions and refreshments which might enter the city ; and accordingly , they carried out this resolution . The flagship named " Mauricio , " with one hundred men and twenty-four pieces of bronze artillery with ladles 131 was under the command of Oliber de Nort i. e . , Oliver van Noordt of Amstradam . This ship was one of those which the count of Leste had several years before at the taking of the city of Cadiz. 132 The almiranta named " Concordia , " with forty men and ten pieces of artillery , was under command of Captain Lamberto Viesman of Roterdam . When these ships were seen on the coast of Chile , Viceroy Don Luis de Velasco , who was governor in Piru , despatched a fleet of vessels well equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast of Piru and Nueva Espana , as far as California . The fleet left Callao de Lima , under command of Don Joan de Velasco , but was unable to find the enemy , as they had left the coast , put out to sea , and steered for the Filipinas . Moreover the Piru fleet , having been overtaken by a storm on its way back from California , lost its flagship with all hands aboard and was never seen again. @# Governor Don Francisco Tello , seeing that this corsair was making incursions among the islands , according to the information given him by certain captains and soldiers whom he had sent by land along the coasts of the island of Luzon , in order to prevent the enemy from landing men and from injuring the settlements , and from the information given by certain small single boats which had kept in sight of the enemy , discussed plans for meeting this necessity . This it appeared very difficult to do on that occasion , not only because the governor found himself without any kind of rowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to sea , but also because he had few soldiers in the camp , for the majority of them were with Captain and Sargento-mayor Joan Xuarez Gallinato in the Pintados provinces , together with galleys , galliots , and other craft , for the purpose of defending the natives against the ships of the Mindanaos and Joloans , who were continually making plundering expeditions against them , and of preparing for the expedition which it was thought would be made from Jolo at the first monsoon , and which could no longer be deferred . When the governor saw himself hard pressed by this difficulty , and that the Dutch enemy could cause so much harm , take so many prizes , and then depart with them , leaving the country ruined , he summoned the Audiencia and communicated the state of affairs to them , requesting the auditors to assist him in person in any advisable course . They discussed what should be done , namely , to put the port of Cabit , which is inside the bay , into a state of defense , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines , artillery , and shipyard ; then to endeavor to equip several ships with which to put to sea and offer some resistance to the enemy  --  even if no more could be done  --  so that he might not firmly establish himself in the land , and that he might be induced to leave the islands . For , if the enemy found everything so defenseless and if no resistance were offered him , he would remain there until he attained his designs . The execution of these measures was entrusted to Doctor Antonio de Morga . Licentiate Telles de Almacan was ordered to remain in the city with the governor and president for its defense , and to supply thence the port of Cabit and Doctor Antonio de Morga with what was necessary for the latter ' s commission . On the same day , the last of October of the year six hundred , Doctor Antonio de Morga left Manila with some soldiers and ammunition and went to the port of Cabit , which he put in a state of defense with one hundred and fifty men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and night over the port , by means of sentinels and outposts at the necessary points . He collected at the settlement all the vessels in port , and stationed them as near as possible to the shipyards , where a galizabra was being built , and where lay a ship of Sebu with a small Portuguese patache , the latter of which had come from Malaca laden with merchandise . For the defense of these he placed and planted on shore twelve pieces of moderate-sized bronze cannon with ladles , besides two of greater range , which were placed on a point at the entrance of the port . These altogether commanded the port and the vessels in it . Farther on along the beach , a rampart was made with stakes and planks , filled in with earth , behind which , in case the enemy should enter , the soldiery could cover and defend themselves with their artillery . After the auditor had thus put the said port in a state of defense , he planned to complete the galizabra , although much work was still needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the same time to refit the Sebu ship . He attended to these works with so great haste that within thirty days he hoisted the yards on the galizabra and on the Sebu ship , and furnished each of the two with eleven pieces of artillery , both of large and moderate size , which had been sent from Manila , in addition to the artillery in the port. @# The corsair reached the mouth of the bay , eight legues from the port of Cabit , but did not dare to make a dash into the port , as he had planned , for he learned from some Sangleys who were going out to sea with their champans , that it was already defended . However , he was not informed that the Spaniards were arming to attack him , or that there was any preparation or forces at that season for that purpose . Accordingly he contented himself with remaining at the mouth of the bay , moving about with both ships and their boats , and going from one side to another on various days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city with provisions , and not allowing one to escape him . At night he anchored under shelter of the land . All this took place four legues from the mouth of the bay , and he went no farther from it , in order to be ready for any occasion that might present itself. @# Doctor Antonio de Morga kept several very small and swift vessels within sight of the enemy , under shelter of the land , which informed him daily of the enemy ' s position and doings . They reported that he had quietly stationed himself , and that every evening he placed his guard on deck with drums and flags , and firing of musketry . The corsair ' s forces could be estimated from that and it could be seen that the larger and better contingent was aboard the flagship , which was a good and swift ship . The auditor also took the precaution not to let any chapman or ship leave the bay , in order not to give the corsair an opportunity to learn what was going on . When affairs reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done , and suggested that , if the latter thought it advisable , the Portuguese vessel might also be equipped , in order to sally out with the two ships  --  the galizabra and the " Sant Antonio " of Sebu  --  for he had laid an embargo on it , and had fitted it for that purpose . Ammunition and some provisions of rice and fish were provided for the two ships , and it remained only to man them with sailors and soldiers who were to go out in them . Of such there was little supply ; the sailors were hiding and feigning sickness , and one and all showed little desire to undertake an affair of more risk and peril than of personal profit . The captains and private soldiers of the city , who were receiving neither pay nor rations from the king , but who could go on the expedition , did not offer their services to the governor ; and if anyone were ready to do so , he dissembled until knowing who was to be commander of the fleet . For , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not inclined to appoint any of them , nor were the others willing to go under their command . Each one claimed and boasted himself capable of being the leader , and none other of his neighbors was to have command . The governor was prevented from going out in person , and learned that all the people of the city were willing to go with Doctor Antonio de Morga if he had command of the fleet , and would not mind any dangers that might present themselves . When the governor learned the desire of those who were able to embark , and understood that there was no other means by which to realize the aim in view , and that each day ' s delay was of very great detriment , he summoned the auditor to the city and set the matter before him . In order that the latter might not refuse , the governor issued an act and had the auditor immediately notified by the secretary of the government and ordered , on behalf of his Majesty , to embark as general and commander of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as matters stood , the suitable result could not be attained otherwise . The auditor , thinking that , if he failed to take up the matter , he would receive the blame of losing so pressing an occasion for the service of God and his Majesty , and for the welfare of the whole country ; and , since war affairs both of sea and of land had been under his charge and management , that it might be reckoned ill against him if he turned his back at this juncture , when he had been sought for it and served especially with papers from the governor , appointing him to the charge : obeyed for the discharge of his conscience the orders set forth in the governor ' s act , which together with his answer reads word for word as follows. @# Edict of Governor Don Francisco Tello , and reply of Doctor Antonio de Morga @# In the city of Manila , on the first of December , one thousand six hundred , Don Francisco Tello , knight of the Order of Santiago , governor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal Audiencia resident therein , declared : That , whereas , because of the coming to these islands of two hostile English sic ships , the preparation of a fleet to attack them was immediately discussed with the resolution and advice of the royal Audiencia , and for this effect it was resolved that Antonio de Morga should go to the port of Cabit to attend to the fitting and despatch of the said war-vessels and the defense of that port , as appears , by the act and resolution made thereon , in the book of the government matters pertaining to this said Audiencia , on the last day of the month of October , of this present year , and to which we refer ; and whereas , in execution of the said resolution , he has attended until now , to the defense of the said port , and the fitting and equipping of the said fleet , consisting of the vessel " San Diego , " 133 of Sebu , the galleon " San Bartolome , " which he caused to be finished in the shipyard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaca , a galliot which was fitted up , and other smaller craft ; and whereas , the said fleet , because of his diligence and care , is in so good condition that it can shortly sail , and the said enemy is still near this city , on the coast of the island of Miraveles i. e . , Corregidor ; and whereas , many captains , knights , and chief men of this community have heard that the said auditor was to make the said expedition , they have offered to go with him to serve the king , our sovereign , in it at their own expense ; and whereas , a great preparation of men and provisions has been made with this intent , which would fail and be of no effect did the said auditor not sail with the said fleet in pursuit of the said enemy , and would not have the result aimed at  --  a matter so greatly to the service of God our Lord , and the welfare of this country  --  and whereas , moreover , the said auditor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , and has been general of his Majesty ' s fleets by the latter ' s own appointment at other times , and lieutenant of the captain-general in this kingdom for several years , in which he has fulfilled his duties well ; and whereas he is highly esteemed and liked by the soldiers ; and whereas he is the most suitable man , according to the condition of affairs ; and for other just considerations that move the governor thereto , so that the said expedition may be effected and not fall through , or at least , so that it may not be delayed with loss and trouble : therefore he ordered  --  and he did so order  --  the said auditor , since he has fostered this affair , and has personally put it in its present good shape , and since all the men  --  and they are many  --  who receive no pay , have prepared in consideration of him , to prepare himself to go as general and commander of the said fleet in pursuit of the enemy , with all possible haste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary messages and instructions , for thus is it advantageous to the service of the king our sovereign .

He gave him the commission in due legal form , and authority for the said absence . Thus he provided and ordered , and affixed his signature thereto. @# DON FRANCISCO TELLO @# Before me : @# GASPAR DE AZEBO @# In the city of Manila , on the first of December , of the year one thousand six hundred , I , the government notary , served the above act upon Doctor Antonio de Morga , auditor of the royal Audiencia .

Thereupon may your Lordship order and provide what may be found most expedient , and as such he will fulfil it . He affixed his signature to this writ. @# DOCTOR ANTONIO DE MORGA @# GASPAR DE AZEBO @# Doctor Antonio de Morga provided himself with all that was requisite for the expedition without asking or taking anything from the king ' s exchequer . He aided several needy soldiers who came to offer their services , and many other persons of importance who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were already enough men for the expedition , and an abundance of provisions , ship ' s stores , and arms ; whereupon all embarked . With the volunteers and regulars whom the governor had in camp under Captain Augustin de Urdiales , and whom he gave to the auditor , there were men enough to man both ships each with about one hundred soldiers in addition to gunners , sailors , and common seamen , of the last mentioned of whom there was a smaller supply than was needed . As admiral of this fleet the governor appointed Captain Joan de Alcega , an old soldier , and one well acquainted with the islands ; as captain of the paid soldiers who were to sail in the almiranta , Joan Tello y Aguirre ; as sargento-mayor of the fleet , Don Pedro Tello , his kinsman ; the necessary other offices and positions ; and the nomination and title of general of the fleet to Doctor Antonio de Morga . He gave the latter closed and sealed instructions concerning what he was to do in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them until he had put to sea , outside of the bay of Manila . The instructions read as follows. @# * * * * * @# Instructions given by the governor to Doctor Antonio de Morga @# What Doctor Antonio de Morga , auditor of the royal Audiencia of these Filipinas Islands , and captain-general of the fleet which is about to pursue the English sic enemy , has to do , is as follows. @# First , inasmuch as we have been informed that the English sic enemy , against whom this fleet has been prepared , lies in the bay of Maryuma , 135 it is ordered that , lest perchance the enemy hearing of our fleet should try to escape without receiving any injury , the fleet sail as quickly as possible in his pursuit , in order to engage and fight him until , through the grace of our Lord , he be taken or sunk. @# Item : If , in fighting the said enemy both with artillery and in grappling  --  and this shall be attempted with all the diligence and care possible  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter should take to flight at sight of the fleet , he shall be pursued until the desired result is attained. @# Item : If , at the time that the fleet sails to attack the said enemy he shall have left this coast and news is received that he has coasted to any other of these islands , the fleet shall follow and pursue him until he is taken or sunk . If the enemy has left these islands , the fleet shall pursue him as far as possible ; but this is left to your own discretion so long as the object be attained. @# Item : Inasmuch as the opinion was expressed in a council of war held on the second day of the present month and year , by the master-of-camp and the captains who were present , that , if there were no certain information of the course and direction taken by the enemy , the said fleet should follow the coast of Ilocos , and make for the strait of Sincapura , through which it is presumed that the enemy will pass in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , if the said general should not receive any information as to the course taken by the enemy , then he shall do what he thinks most expedient , as the one in charge of the affair , and as the enemy and the occasion allow , endeavoring to obtain the desired object , namely , the overtaking and destruction of the enemy. @# Item : If the fleet should encounter any other hostile pirates or any others going about these islands or who shall have left them after doing them injury , whether they be English , Japanese , Terrenatans , Mindanaos , or others , it shall endeavor to chastise and injure them , so that should this occur a good result might also be obtained therefrom. @# Item : If the enemy be captured , as is hoped through the grace of God our Lord , the survivors and ships shall be brought in by the fleet. @# Item : Any spoil found in the said ships shall be divided as is customary , among the victors. @# Item : Great care shall be exercised to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning this , the course taken on similar occasions shall be followed. @# Item : A good system in regard to the provisions and ammunition carried shall be observed , and the use of them all well moderated , especially should the fleet leave sight of these islands. @# Item : If perchance , after having engaged the said enemy or pursued him , he should leave these islands , then , the object having been accomplished , you shall endeavor to return as speedily as possible to the islands . If the weather do not permit a return until the monsoon sets in , you shall endeavor to keep the fleet together and to supply and provide it with everything necessary , at the expense of his Majesty , so that you may pursue your voyage with the greatest speed and safety possible . Given in the city of Manila , the tenth of December of the year one thousand six hundred. @# DON FRANCISCO TELLO @# By order of the governor and captain-general : @# GASPAR DE AZEBO @# The auditor went to the port with all his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the " Sant Antonio " of Sebu , on account of its having more room to accommodate the assistants gente de cumplimiento who embarked with him . He left the Portuguese patache because the governor had taken off the embargo , in order to allow the Portuguese to return with it to Malaca without loss of time . Then he equipped two caracoas for the service of the fleet with Indian crews and two Spaniards to direct them . After they had confessed and taken communion , they left the port of Cabit and set sail on the twelfth day of the month of December of the year one thousand six hundred , with Alonzo Gomez as chief pilot . They also took Father Diego de Santiago and a lay brother of the Society of Jesus , and Fray Francisco de Valdes of the Order of Augustine , aboard the flagship ; and Fray Joan Gutierrez 136 and another associate of the same order aboard the almiranta , so that they might attend to whatever required their ministry. @# At night of the same day both ships of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Miraveles at the mouth of the bay . Immediately at daybreak a barangai approached the ships from shore with the sentinels whom the auditor had hastily sent the day before to obtain some reliable news of the corsair ' s position . They told him that , as soon as the fleet sailed from the port of Cabit , the enemy , who lay in the direction of the port Del Fraile of the Friar , 137 had also weighed anchor , and having stowed their small boats , both ships had crossed to the other and sea side , and that they had seen him anchor after nightfall opposite the point of Valeitegui , 138 where he still was . Upon hearing this , the auditor thought that perhaps the corsair had been informed of the preparation of the fleet and of its departure , and had consequently weighed anchor from his position ; and that , since he had stowed his small boats aboard the ships , he was about to put to sea to avoid the fleet . He immediately sent the same news to the admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seeing that he was ordered thereby to seek the enemy with all diligence , pursue him , and endeavor to fight him , he thought best to shorten the work before him , and to lose no time and not allow the enemy to get farther away . With this object in view , the fleet spent the thirteenth of December , St. Lucy ' s day , in making waist-cloths , arranging the artillery , getting ready the weapons , alloting men to their posts , and preparing themselves to fight on the next day , on which it was thought that they would fall in with the corsair . The auditor sent special instructions in writing to the admiral concerning what he was to do and observe on his part . These instructions specified chiefly that upon engaging with the enemy , both ships were to grapple and fight the corsair ' s flagship  --  in which were carried all the forces  --  and other things which will be understood from the instructions given to the admiral . These were as follows. @# These instructions are given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time the auditor notified the admiral that the fleet would weigh anchor from its anchorage shortly after midnight , and would go out of the bay to sea , crowding all sail possible , so that at dawn it might be off the point of Baleitigui to windward of the point where the enemy had anchored on Tuesday night , according to the sentinels ' report. @# At the appointed hour both vessels  --  the flagship and the almiranta  --  weighed anchor from Miraveles , and , favored by a light wind , sailed the rest of the night toward Baleitigui . The two caracoas used as tenders could not follow because of a choppy sea , and a fresh northwester ; they crossed within the bay , and under shelter of the land to the other side . At the first streak of light both vessels of the fleet found themselves off the point ; and one legua to leeward , and seaward , they sighted the corsair ' s two vessels riding at anchor . As soon as the latter recognized our ships and saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the masthead , they weighed anchor and set sail from their anchorage , after having first reenforced the flagship with a boatload of men from their almiranta , which stood to sea , while the flagship hove to , and awaited our fleet , firing several pieces at long range . The flagship of our fleet being unable to answer the enemy with its artillery because the gun-ports were shut , and the vessel was tacking to starboard , determined to close with him . It grappled his flagship on the port side , sweeping and clearing the decks of the men on them . Then the colors with thirty soldiers and a few sailors were thrown aboard . They took possession of the forecastle and after-cabin and captured their colors at masthead and quarter , and the white , blue , and orange standard with the arms of Count Mauricio flung at the stern . The main- and mizzen-mast were stripped of all the rigging and sails , and a large boat which the enemy carried on the poop was captured . The enemy , who had retreated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking him with so great resolution , sent to ask the auditor for terms of surrender . While an answer was being given him , Admiral Joan de Alcega , who , in accordance with the instructions given him the day previous by the auditor , ought to have grappled at the same time as the flagship , and lashed his vessel to the enemy , thinking that the victory was won , that the corsair ' s almiranta was escaping , and that it would be well to capture it , left the flagship and followed astern of Lamberto Viezman , crowding all sail and chasing him until he overtook him . Oliber de Nort , seeing himself alone and with a better ship and artillery than the auditor ' s , waited no longer for the answer to the terms for which he had asked at first , and renewed the fight with musketry and artillery . The combat between the two flagships was so obstinate and bitter on both sides that it lasted more than six hours , and many were killed on both sides . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not more than fifteen of his men were left alive , and those badly maimed and wounded. 139 Finally the corsair ' s ship caught fire , and the flames rose high by the mizzen-mast and in the stern . The auditor , in order not to endanger his own ship , found it necessary to recall his colors and men from the enemy ' s ship , and to cast loose and separate from it . This he did , only to discover that his ship , from the pounding of the artillery during so long a combat , as it was but slightly strengthened , had an opening in the bows and was filling so rapidly that being unable to overcome the leak , it was foundering . The corsair seeing his opponent ' s trouble and his inability to follow him , made haste with his few remaining men to extinguish the fire on board his ship . Having quenched it , he set his foresail , which was still left . Shattered in all parts , stripped of rigging , and without men he reached Borneo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressed that it seemed impossible for him to navigate , or to go farther without shipwreck . The Spanish flagship , which was fully occupied in trying to remedy the extremity to which it was reduced , could not be assisted , because it was alone and far from land , and consequently sank so rapidly that the men could neither disarm themselves , nor get hold of anything which might be of help to them . The auditor did not abandon the ship , although some soldiers , in order to escape therein , seized the boat at the stern , and asked him also to get into it . Thereupon they made off and went away , in order to prevent others from taking it away from them . When the ship sunk , the auditor swam constantly for four hours , with the quarter colors and the enemy ' s standard which he took with him . He reached a very small desert island , two legues away , called Fortuna , where a few of the ship ' s men who had more endurance in the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned , for they had not even disarmed themselves , and whom this predicament had overtaken when exhausted by the long fight with the enemy . Those who met death on this occasion were fifty in all . The most important among them were Captains Don Francisco de Mendoca , Gregorio de Vargas , Francisco Rodriguez , and Gaspar de los Rios , 140 all of whom died fighting with the enemy . Among those drowned at sea were Captains Don Joan de Camudio , Augustin de Urdiales , Don Pedro Tello , Don Gabriel Maldonado , Don Cristoval de Heredia , Don Luis de Belver , Don Alonso Locano , Domingo de Arrieta , Melchior de Figueroa , Chief-pilot Alonso Gomez , father Fray Diego de Santiago , and the brother who went with him . Admiral Joan de Alcega , having overtaken Lamberto Viezman slightly after midday , captured him with little resistance ; and although he afterward saw the so battered ship of Oliber del Nort pass by and escaping at a short distance , he did not pursue him . On the contrary , without stopping longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prize with some of his own men , whom he had put aboard it , to follow him . He neither looked for his flagship nor took any other step , imagining that if any mishap had occurred , he might be blamed for leaving the flagship alone with the corsair and pursuing Lambert Biezman without orders from the auditor , and contrary to the instructions given him in writing ; and fearing lest if he were to rejoin the auditor after having left him , ill would befall himself . The auditor took the wounded and the men who had escaped from the islet of Fortun , at nightfall , in his ship ' s boat which he found at that port , as well as the corsair ' s boat and a caracoa which arrived there . And on the following day , he landed them in Luzon , at the bar of Anazibu , in the province of Balayan , 141 thirty legues from Manila , where he supplied them with provisions as quickly as possible . Moreover he explored the coast and neighboring islands with swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corsair . This prize was taken to Manila , with twenty-five men alive and the admiral , ten pieces of artillery , and a quantity of wine , oil , cloth , linen , weapons , and other goods which it carried . The admiral and the Dutchmen of his company were garroted by orders of the governor. 142 Thus ended the expedition . Thereby was averted the injury which it was thought that the corsair would inflict in these seas , had he been allowed to remain there with the aim that he cherished , although so much to the detriment of the Spaniards by the loss of their flagship , which would not have happened had the orders of the auditor been observed . Governor Don Francisco Tello presented an attestation of this event to the auditor , which is as follows. @# * * * * * @# Attestation of Governor Don Francisco Tello of events in the expedition against the Dutch corsair @# Don Francisco Tello , knight of the Order of Santiago , governor and captain-general in these Filipinas Islands , and president of the Audiencia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certify to whomever may see this present , that last year , one thousand six hundred , a squadron of Dutch war-vessels under command of Oliber del Nort , after passing through the strait of Magallanes to the South Sea , reached these islands , in the month of October of the said year , with two armed ships . They entered among these islands , making prizes and committing depredations , and at length stationed themselves off the entrance of the bay of the city of Manila , with the design of lying in wait for the merchant ships from China , and for the galleon " Santo Tomas , " expected from Nueva Espana with the silver of two years belonging to the merchants of this kingdom . By a decision of the said royal Audiencia , on the thirty-first of October of the said year , Doctor Antonio de Morga , senior auditor of the said Audiencia , was commissioned and charged to go immediately to the port of Cabit , and place and hold it in a state of defense , and to prepare and equip a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said auditor busied himself in person . Having , with great assiduity and industry , fortified and put the said port in a state of defense , he completed in the shipyard and then launched , a moderate-sized ship , armed and equipped another belonging to private persons then in the port , both of which he equipped with yards and rigging  --  all inside of forty days . In order that the expedition might be made more quickly , and with a supply of soldiers and the most necessary equipment , inasmuch as affairs were such that it could be done by no one else , on the first of December of the same year , I nominated and appointed the said auditor to sail as general of the fleet in pursuit of the enemy , and to fight him until destroying and driving him from these islands . The said auditor performed and accomplished this in the following manner . On the twelfth of the said month of December , he sailed with the two ships of his fleet from the port of Cabit ; on the fourteenth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corsair outside of the bay of this city , off the promontory of Baleitigui , with his two ships  --  flagship and almiranta . He pursued the enemy until he came close to him ; and both fleets having prepared for action , engaged one another . The said auditor in his flagship attacked the corsair ' s flagship with great gallantry and resolution , and grappled it . The latter was a large and strong ship , carrying a quantity of artillery and many fighting men . The auditor immediately threw on board the enemy the infantry colors with thirty arquebusiers and a few volunteers and sailors , who captured the forecastle , after-cabin , and the colors of the vessel . At the end of the action , these men retreated to our ship on account of the violent fire which at the last began to rage aboard the enemy ' s ship . Thereupon the action and fight continued on both sides , and lasted more than six hours , during which the artillery , musketry , and arquebuses were repeatedly discharged in all quarters . In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viezman , was defeated and captured , with the crew , artillery and other things aboard it . The two flagships having cast loose and separated on account of the fire which had broken out , and the quantity of water that poured in our bows , the enemy took to flight with only the foremast standing , with nearly all his men killed , and having lost his boat , the standard and the colors at his masthead and quarter . Stripped of his yards , sails , and rigging , and the ship leaking in many places , the enemy ran before the wind . It has been heard from various sources that he passed Borneo with only fifteen or sixteen men alive , and most of them maimed and wounded , and that a few days later , he was entirely wrecked not far from the Sunda. 143 The said auditor and his companions suffered great hardship and danger ; for besides several men of note who died fighting , the ship which was leaking at the bows as above said , because of being weak and not built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop or overcome the leak , foundered that same day , and part of the men on board were drowned on account of being wearied with fighting and not even yet having disarmed . When the ship sunk , the said auditor , who would never leave or abandon it , took to the water with the rest of the men , and escaped by swimming , with some of the enemy ' s colors about him , to an uninhabited islet , called Fortun , two legues from the place where the fight had taken place . The next day he took away the people from that place in several small boats which he found , and landed them in safety on this island . In all the above , the said auditor acted with great diligence and valor , exposing himself to all the risks of the battle and afterward of the sea . He did not receive any reward for his services , nor any salary , expenses , or any other recompense . On the contrary , he contributed and spent his own property to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also assisted some volunteers who went with him . Of the booty taken from the corsair ' s almiranta , which was brought to this city , he refused to take nor did he take anything ; on the contrary , the share which should have fallen to him , he ceded and passed over to the king , our sovereign , and to his royal exchequer . Thus our aim and object , namely , the destroying and defeating of the said corsair , has been accomplished , so much to the service of God and of his Majesty , and to the welfare of this kingdom , as is more minutely set forth by acts , depositions , and other inquiries concerning this expedition . At the request of the said Doctor Antonio de Morga , I gave him the present , with my signature attached , and sealed with the seal of my arms . Given in Manila , August twenty-four , one thousand six hundred and one. @# DON FRANCISCO TELLO @# * * * * * @# In the same year of one thousand six hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship the " Sancta Margarita , " with Juan Martinez de Guillestigui as general , who had arrived the year before in the same capacity ; and the " San Geronimo , " under Don Fernando de Castro . On their way , both ships met with storms in the latitude of thirty-eight degrees and at six hundred legues from the Filipinas , and suffered great hardship . At the end of nine months at sea , after many of the men had died and much of the merchandise had been thrown overboard and lost , the " San Geronimo " put back to the Filipinas , off the islands of Catenduanes , outside of the channel of Espiritu Santo , and there was wrecked , although the crew were saved . The flagship " Sancta Margarita , " after the death of the general and most of the crew , ported at the Ladrones Islands and anchored at Zarpana . There natives who went to the ships , seeing it so abandoned and battered , boarded and took possession of it , and of its goods and property . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their settlements , where they killed some and apportioned others to various villages , where they maintained them and gave them better treatment . The Indians wore the gold chains and other things of the ship around their necks , and then hung them to the trees and in their houses , like people who had no knowledge of their value. 144 @# In the month of May of the year six hundred and one , the galleon " Santo Tomas " arrived at the Filipinas from Nueva Espana with passengers , soldiers , and the return proceeds of the merchandise which had been delayed in Mexico . Its general was Licentiate Don Antonio de Ribera Maldonado , who had been appointed auditor of Manila . A small patache had sailed in company with the galleon from the port of Acapulco , but being unable to sail as rapidly as the " Santo Tomas , " after a few days ' voyage , it dropped behind . When they arrived off the Ladrones Islands , some natives went out , as usual , to meet the ship in their boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship " Sancta Margarita , " which had been lost there the year before . The loss of that vessel was learned from those men ; also that as many as twenty-six Spaniards were living in the towns of those islands ; and that if the ship would wait , the natives would bring them. @# The religious and men with the general tried to persuade him , since the weather was calm , to wait in that place , in order to take these men from those islands , where they had lingered for a year . Certain more courageous persons even offered to go ashore to get them either in the galleon ' s boat or in the vessels of the Ladrones themselves . But the general would not allow this , believing that time would be lost , and his expedition exposed to peril . Without leave from the general , Fray Juan Pobre , a lay-brother , who was in charge of the discalced religious of St. Francis , who were coming on that occasion to the Filipinas , jumped into one of the Ladrones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island of Guan , where he remained with the Spaniards whom he found . The galleon " Santo Tomas , " without further delay , pursued its voyage , to the great grief and regret of the Spaniards on shore , who saw themselves left among those barbarians , where some of them died later of illness and other hardships . The galleon reached the Filipinas , making for the cape of Espiritu Santo and the harbor of Capul , at the conjunction of the moon and change of the weather . The land was so covered with thick fogs , that the ship was upon it before it was seen , nor did the pilots and sailors know the country or place where they were . They ran toward the Catenduanes , and entered a bay , called Catamban , 145 twenty legues from the channel , where they found themselves embayed and with so much wind and sea astern of them , that the galleon ran upon some rocks near the land and came very near being wrecked that night with all aboard . At daybreak , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship made fast to some rocks . As the weather did not improve , and the ship was hourly in greater danger of being wrecked , and the cables with which it was made fast had given way , he determined to disembark the cargo there , and as quickly as possible , by means of the boat . They went to work immediately and took off the people , the silver , and the greater part of the goods and property , until , with native boats , the Spaniards and Indians of that province carried everything to Manila over a distance of eighty legues , partly by sea and partly by land . They left the ship  --  a new and handsome one  --  wrecked there , without being able to derive any profit whatever from it. @# The daring and audacity of the Mindanaos and Joloans in making incursions with their fleets into the islands of Pintados had reached such a state that it was now expected that they would come as far as Manila , plundering and devastating . In order to check them , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Francisco Tello , deriving strength from weakness , determined that the expedition against Jolo should be made at once , without more delay , in order to punish and pacify it , with the forces and men whom Captain and Sargento-mayor Joan Xuarez Gallinato held in Sebu and in the Pintados , together with more men , ships , and provisions , which were sent him , accompanied by the necessary documents and instructions for him to enter the island , chastise its king and inhabitants , and pacify and reduce it to the obedience of his Majesty . By this means , until there should be an opportunity to settle the affairs of Mindanao , which is quite near Jolo , the audacity of the enemy would be checked ; and by bringing the war into his own country , he would not come out to commit depredations . Captain Gallinato set out on this expedition with two hundred Spanish soldiers , ships , artillery , enough provisions for four months  --  the time which it was thought the expedition would last  --  and with Indians as rowers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he arrived at Jolo , at the bar of the river of this island , which is two legues from the principal town and dwellings of the king , he landed his men , artillery , and the necessary provisions and left his ships under a sufficient guard . The islanders were all in the town and dwellings of the king , which are situated on a very high hill above some cliffs , and have two roads of approach through paths and roads so narrow that they can be reached only in single file . They had fortified the whole place , intrenched it with palms and other woods , and a number of culverins . They had also collected provisions and water for their sustenance , besides a supply of arquebuses and other weapons . They had neither women nor children with them , for they had taken them out of the island . They had requested aid from the people of Mindanao , Borney , and Terrenate , and were awaiting the same , since they had been informed of the fleet which was being prepared against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp near the town , before this aid should arrive , and to attack the fort . After he had quartered himself at a distance of one-half legua , in a plain facing the ascent , he sent interpreters with messages to the king and chiefs of the island , calling on them to surrender , and telling them that good terms would be given them . While waiting for an answer , he fortified his quarters in that spot , intrenching himself wherever necessary . He mounted the artillery in the best position for use , and kept his men ready for any emergency . A false and deceptive answer was returned , making excuses for the excesses that had been committed , and for not complying just then with what had been asked of them , and making loud promises to do so later . All this was with the object of detaining the captain in that place , which is very unhealthy , until the rains should set in , his provisions run short , and the arrival of the expected aid . After this answer had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more careless on account of it , swarmed down quickly from the said fort in a large body of probably somewhat over one thousand ; and armed with arquebuses and other weapons with handles , campilans , and caracas , attacked and assaulted the quarters and camp of the Spaniards . This could not be done so secretly as not to be seen by the Spaniards , and allow them opportunity to prepare to receive the Joloans before their arrival . This the Spaniards did , and having permitted the natives to come all together in a body to the very inside of the quarters and trenches , as soon as the Joloans had discharged their arquebuses , the Spaniards opened fire upon them , first with their artillery , and then with their arquebuses , killing many , and forcing the rest to retire in flight to the fort . The Spaniards pursued them , wounding and killing to the middle of the hill . But seeing that farther on the paths were so narrow and rough , they retreated before the heavy artillery fire from the heights , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their quarters . Upon many other days , efforts were made to reach the fort , but without any result . Thereupon Gallinato , in consideration of the war being prolonged beyond what had been expected , built two forts , one where he kept his ships in order to defend them and the port ; and the other one-half legua farther on in a suitable place where they could take refuge and communicate with the camp . The forts were built of wood and fascines , and fortified with the artillery from the ships . The Spaniards shut themselves up in these forts , whence from time to time they sallied , making incursions as far as the enemy ' s fort . The latter always remained shut up in their fort without ever choosing to come down or to yield ; for he was convinced that the Spaniards could not remain long in the island . When Gallinato saw that the rains were fast setting in , that his men were becoming ill , and that his provisions were failing , without his having accomplished the desired task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining resources ; and that the enemy from Mindanao with other allies of theirs were boasting that they were gathering a large fleet in order to drive the Spaniards from Jolo : he sent news of all that had occurred to the governor of Manila , with a plan of the island and fort and a relation of the difficulties which the enterprise presented . He sent this in a swift vessel , by Captain and Sargento-mayor Pedro Cotelo de Morales , toward the end of May of the year six hundred and two , in order to obtain instructions as to his procedure , and the necessary reenforcements of men and provisions . The captain was charged to return quickly with the answer. @# When the Moro Ocuna Lacasamana and his followers killed Diego Belloso , Blas Ruyz de Hernan Goncales , and the Castilians and Portuguese with them in the kingdom of Camboja , we said that Joan de Mendoca Gamboa with father Fray Joan Malclonado , and his associate , Don Antonio Malaver , Luys de Villafane , and other Spaniards who escaped by embarking with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , defending themselves against some Cambodian and Malayan praus which pursued them until they crossed the bar . Joan de Mendoca pursued his voyage along the coast to Sian , where his main business lay . Having reached the bar he ascended the river to the city of Odia , the court of the king , and the latter received the letter and message of Governor Don Francisco Tello , although with less pomp and courtesy than Joan de Mendoca wished. @# Then he bartered his merchandise , and was so stingy in the regular custom of making some presents and gifts to the king and his favorites that he even bargained closely over the presents offered . The king was even inclined to seize the artillery of his ship , for which he had a great longing . Joan de Mendoca , fearing this , sunk it in the river with buoys , so that he could recover it at his departure , and for appearances left in the ship only one iron gun and some culverins . There was a Portuguese of the Order of St. Dominic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last two years , administering to the Portuguese who carried on trade in that region . Among these Portuguese were some whom the king had brought from Camboja and Pigu , when at war with both kingdoms . These and other Portuguese had had some quarrels with Siamese in the city , and had killed one of the king ' s servants . The king , being little inclined to clemency , had fried some of the delinquents and had forbidden the other Portuguese and the religious to leave the city or kingdom , although they had urgently asked leave and permission to do so . On seeing themselves deprived of liberty , less well treated than before , and threatened daily , they conspired with Fray Joan Maldonado to be smuggled aboard his vessel at its departure , and taken out of the kingdom . The religious took the matter upon himself . After Joan de Mendoca had concluded his business , although not as he had desired , since the king gave him no answer for the governor , putting it off , and his merchandise had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice of Fray Joan Maldonado , to recover his artillery some night , and to descend the river as rapidly as possible . On that same night the Portuguese religious and his companions , about twelve in number , were to leave the city secretly and wait eight legues down the river in an appointed place , where they would be taken aboard . This plan was carried out , but when the king heard that Don Joan de Mendoca had taken his ship and departed without his leave and dismissal , and that he was carrying away the friar and the Portuguese who had been kept at his court , he was so angered that he sent forty praus with artillery and many soldiers in pursuit of him with orders to capture and bring them back to court or to kill them . Although Joan de Mendoca made all possible haste to descend the river , the ship , being without oars and its sails not always to be depended upon , and the distance to cover more than seventy legues , he was overtaken by the Siamese in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed the defensive , and gave them so much trouble with his artillery and musketry , that they did not dare to board him . Nevertheless , they approached him several times , and managing to break through , tossed artificial fire aboard , which caused the Spaniards much trouble , for the combat lasted more than one week , day and night . Finally , when near the bar , in order that the ship might not escape them , all the praus surviving the previous engagements attacked with one accord and made the last effort in their power . Although the Siamese could not carry out their intentions , and suffered the more killed and wounded , the Spaniards did not escape without severe losses ; for the pilot , Joan Martinez de Chave , the associate of Fray Joan Maldonado , and eight other Spaniards died in the conflict . Fray Joan Maldonado was badly wounded by a ball from a culverin , which shattered his arm , and Captain Joan de Mendoca also received dangerous wounds . Thereupon the Siamese reascended the river , and the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not favorable for crossing by way of the shoals to Manila or Malaca , which lay nearer to them , they steered for Cochinchina , where they put in and joined a Portuguese vessel lying there , for which they waited until it should sail to Malaca , in order to sail in its company . There Fray Joan Maldonado and Captain Joan de Mendoca grew worse of their wounds , and both died . Fray Joan Maldonado left a letter , written a few days before his death , for his superior and the Order of St. Dominic , in which he related his journeys , hardships and the cause of his death ; and informed them of the nature and condition of the affairs of Camboja ( whither he had been sent ) , of the slight foundation and motives for them troubling themselves with that enterprise , and the slight gain which could be hoped from it . He charged them upon their consciences not again to become instruments of a return to Camboja . The ship went to Malaca with its cargo , where everything was sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still living returned to Manila sick , poor , and needy , from the hardships which they had undergone. @# The affairs of Maluco continued to assume a worse appearance , because the ruler of Terrenate was openly waging war against his neighbor of Tidore and against the Portuguese who were with the latter . He had allowed some ships which had come to Terrenate from the islands of Holanda and Zelanda by way of India to trade with him , and through them had sent a message to Inglaterra and to the prince of Orange , concerning peace , trade , and commerce with the English and the Dutch . To this he had received a favorable answer , and he expected shortly a large fleet from Inglaterra and the islands , with whose help he expected to accomplish great things against Tidore and the Filipinas . Meanwhile , he kept some Flemings and Englishmen in Terrenate who had remained as pledges , and a factor engaged in purchasing cloves . These people had brought many fine weapons for this trade , so that the island of Terrenate was exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief captain wrote yearly to the governor of the Filipinas , informing him of what was going on , so that it might be remedied in time , and aid sent to them . Once , Cachilcota , 146 brother of the king of Tidore , a brave soldier and one of the most famous of all Maluco , came to Manila for that purpose . They always received men , provisions , and some ammunition ; but what they most desired was that an expedition should be made opportunely against Terrenate , before the English and Dutch came with the expected fleet . This could not be done without an order from his Majesty , and great preparation and equipment for such an enterprise . The same message was always sent from Tidore . At last , during this administration of Don Francisco Tello , Captain Marcos Dias de Febra returned with this request , and brought letters to the governor and to the Audiencia from the king of Tidore , and from the chief captain , Rui Goncales de Sequeira , in which were detailed contemporaneous events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The king wrote specially about this to the king of Espana and to Doctor Antonio de Morga , with the latter of whom he used to correspond , the following letter , which was written in Portuguese and signed in his own language. @# To Doctor Morga , in the Filipinas Islands , from the king of Tidore. @# I greatly rejoiced in receiving a letter from your Grace written on the eighth of November last , because by it I particularly understand your great sincerity in remembering me and my affairs ; for this , may God reward your Grace with long life and prosperity for the service of the king , my sovereign . For I understood that he keeps your Grace in these islands with the hope of their increase , and I am aware that your being there will serve as a remedy for this fortress and island of Tidore . I have written to the governor and to the Audiencia in Manila , concerning the succor for which I beg , for I have asked it so often , on account of the great necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be checked ; otherwise it may later cost much to the king our sovereign . I beg your Grace to favor me in this , or at least in what may be necessary for the future , for thus it will render a great service to God and to the king , my sovereign . May God preserve your Grace with life for many years . From this island of Tidore , today , March eight , one thousand six hundred and one. @# THE KING OF TIDORE @# The bearer , namely , Marcos Dias , will give your Grace a flagon and a little flask of Moorish brass workmanship . I send them in order that your Grace may remember this your friend. 147 @# Marcos Dias returned to Tidore at the first monsoon , in the beginning of the year six hundred and two , bearing an answer to his message , and taking the reenforcements that had been asked , of provisions , ammunition , and a few soldiers . He was satisfied therewith , until a fitting opportunity should offer for making the desired expedition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acuna , governor and president of the Filipinas , and of what happened during his administration , until his death in June of the year six hundred and six , after his return to Manila from Maluco , where he had completed the conquest of the islands subject to the king of Terrenate. @# CHAPTER SEVENTH @# In the month of May of six hundred and two , four ships came to Manila from Nueva Espana , with a new governor and president of the Audiencia , named Don Pedro de Acuna , knight of the Order of St. John , comendador of Salamanca , and lately governor of Cartagena in Tierra Firme . He was received into the government to the great satisfaction of the whole country , on account of the need there of one who would be as skilled in matters of war as watchful and careful in the government . Don Francisco Tello , his predecessor , awaiting his residencia which was to be taken , had to remain in Manila until the following year , six hundred and three , and in the month of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon seeing things in so great need of stability , and so limited resources in the royal treasury for the purpose , found that his lot was not so good as he had imagined when he had been appointed ; since the state of affairs obliged him to risk a part of his reputation without his being able to remedy matters as quickly as was to be desired . He took heart as much as possible , however , and without sparing himself any personal labor in whatever presented itself , he began with what was to be done in Manila and its environs . He began to construct galleys and other vessels in the shipyard , for there was great need of these , in order to defend the sea , which was full of enemies and pirates from other islands , especially from Mindanao . He discussed going immediately in person to visit the provinces of Pintados , in order to supply more quickly the needs of that region , which was causing the greatest anxiety . But he had to postpone that several months to arrange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ships which were to make the voyage to Nueva Espana , all of which came at once and had to be seen to. @# Chiquiro , the Japanese , having arrived in Manila , delivered his message and present to Governor Don Pedro de Acuna , who had been in the government but a few days . The matter and its determination , together with the reply , were immediately considered . It required the greatest amount of thought to decide how this was to be made , in the most fitting manner possible . For , although friendship with Daifusama was held to be a good thing and of great profit , and a necessity to obtain and conclude , even should certain difficulties have to be overcome ; and although the sailing to Quanto and its commerce were not of much account to the Spaniards ; nevertheless those things would be fulfilled by sending a ship there with some goods for exchange . But the rest , namely , the trade and friendship with Nueva Espana , and the sending of masters and workmen to build ships in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which Fray Geronymo had assured him would be done , was a serious matter and impossible to be carried out , as it was very harmful and prejudicial to the Filipinas . For their greatest security from Japon had ever been the Japanese lack of ships and their ignorance of navigation . As often as the latter had intended to attack Manila , they had been prevented by this obstacle . Now to send the Japanese workmen and masters to make Spanish ships for them and show them how such vessels were made , would be to give them the weapons that they needed for their own i. e. , the Filipinas ' destruction , while their navigation to Nueva Espana , and making long voyages , would cause very great troubles. 148 Each matter singly was of great importance and consideration , and such that the governor could not decide them , and they could not be decided in Manila , without informing his Majesty and the latter ' s viceroy of Nueva Espana , who was so much concerned , thereof . In order to take measures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning with his reply , a moderate present of Spanish articles was sent to Daifu , in the same ship which had come , in return for what it had brought . These Fray Geronymo was to give Daifu in person . The former was written to tell Daifu with what pleasure the governor received the good-will that he manifested to him , and the peace and friendship with the Spaniards , and all the other things that he was doing for them ; and that he , the governor , would keep it and observe it in so far as he was concerned , and that very year he would send a Spanish ship to trade at Quanto according to Daifu ' s desire , and that he would despatch it quickly . As to the navigation which the latter wished to undertake to Nueva Espana and his desire to have masters sent him for that purpose , to build ships for that voyage , that was a matter which  --  although the governor would do his best to effect , and to please him in everything  --  was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter ' s viceroy in Nueva Espana thereof ; for he , the governor , had no power or authority outside of the affairs of his government of the Filipinas . He said that he would write and would treat of it immediately , and hoped that it would be properly settled there . Until the reply came from Espana , which would necessarily have to be delayed three years , because that country was so far , he begged Daifu to be patient and suffer it , since it was not in his control , and nothing else could be done . The governor wrote Fray Geronymo to humor Daifu in everything , with the best words he could use to please him , but not to embarrass himself thenceforward by promising him and expediting such things for him . With this despatch , Chiquiro sailed for Japon with his ship , but was so unfortunate on the voyage that he was wrecked off the head of Hermosa Island , and neither the vessel nor its crew escaped . News thereof was not received in Manila or in Japon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters from Fray Geronymo de Jesus , and the news of the changed conditions which he wrote existed in Japon , and the permission which he said that Daifu had given him to make Christians and build churches , not only the discalced religious of St. Francis but those of the other orders of St. Dominic and St. Augustine , set about going to Japon without loss of time ; and , in order to be taken , each one made use of the Japanese ships and captains which were then at Manila , having come with flour , and which were about to return . In particular , the Order of St. Dominic sent to the kingdom of Zazuma four religious , under Fray Francisco de Morales , 149 Prior of Manila , in a ship about to go to that island and province . They said that they had been summoned by its king , the only one who had not yet rendered homage to Daifusama . The Order of St. Augustine sent two religious to the kingdom of Firando in a ship which had come from that port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manila , because they had heard that they would be well received by the king of that province . The Order of St. Francis , in the ships about to sail to Nangasaqui , sent Fray Augustin Rodrigues , 151 who had been in Japon before , in company with the martyrs , and a lay-brother , with orders to go to Miaco , to become associates of Fray Geronymo de Jesus . Although some difficulties presented themselves to the governor in regard to the departure of these religious from Manila , and their going to Japon so hastily , yet on account of the great pressure which they brought to bear upon him , these were not sufficient to cause him to refuse them the permission which they requested . The religious reached the provinces to which they were going and were received there , although more coolly than they had expected , and with fewer conveniences than they needed for their support , and less inclination than they desired for the matters of the conversion , in which they had imagined that they were to have great and immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , the kings and tonos of those provinces kept them in order , by means of them , to open intercourse and commerce in their lands with the Spaniards  --  which they desired for their own interests rather than for the religion , to which they were not inclined. @# The governor , Don Pedro de Acuna , in fulfilment of his letter , namely , that he would send a ship to Quanto , prepared and then sent out a medium-sized ship , named " Santiago el Menor " i. e . , St. James the Less , with a captain and the necessary seamen and officers , and some goods consisting of red wood , 152 deerskins , raw silk 153 and other things . This ship set out with orders to go to Quanto , where it would find discalced Franciscan religious and there to sell its goods and return with the exchange  --  and with the permission of Daifusama  --  to Manila . Thus Japanese matters were provided for , as far as seemed necessary , according to the state of affairs. @# Daifusama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his servant , whom he had sent to Manila with the letters from Fray Geronymo de Jesus , pressed the latter so closely concerning the things which he desired and about which he had treated with him , that Fray Geronymo , seeing that Chiquiro was slow in returning , and that few arguments were of avail with Daifu , in order to satisfy him the better , requested permission of him to go to Manila in person , there to communicate and conclude matters with the governor by word of mouth , and bring a reply to him . He said that he would leave at the court Fray Augustin Rodriguez and another companion , who had lately come to him , as hostages for his return . The king granted the permission and gave him provision , so that Fray Geronymo came quickly to Manila , where he learned of the message which Chiquiro had taken . Then he began to treat with Governor Don Pedro de Acuna , about his business , saying that Chiquiro had not yet arrived in Xapon , which gave rise to the suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor being unable to double the head of Xapon in order to pass to the north side , put into the port of Firando , where the religious of St. Augustine had had a station for a short time , and anchored there . Thence the captain advised the court of Miaco that he had been unable to reach Quanto . He sent also the letters for the religious and what was to be given to Daifu . The religious , Fray Geronymo ' s associates , gave Daifu the presents which were for him , and told him that the governor was sending that ship at his disposition and command , but that the weather had not allowed it to reach Quanto . Daifusama received the presents , although he did not believe what they told him , but that they were compliments to please him . He ordered the ship to get its trading done immediately , and to return with some things which he gave them for the governor , and thenceforward to go to Quanto as promised him . Thereupon it returned to Manila. @# Fray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been said , that he had opportunity to treat with Governor Don Pedro de Acuna , about the matters under his charge , from whom he received the promise that ships would continue to be sent to Quanto to please Daifusama . Taking with him a good present , given him by the governor , consisting of a very rich and large Venetian mirror , glass , clothes from Castilla , honey , several tibores , 154 and other things which it was known would please Daifu , he returned immediately to Japon . He was well received there by Daifu , to whom he communicated his message , and that his servant Chiquiro had been well sent off by the new governor , and that nothing less than shipwreck was possible , since he had not appeared in so long a time . He gave Daifu what he had brought , which pleased the latter greatly. @# During the first days of the governor ' s administration he found in the shipyard of Cabit two large ships which were being finished to make their voyage that year to Nueva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dasmarinas , by an agreement which the latter had made with the governor ' s predecessor , Don Francisco Tello , was to go with a cargo of merchandise . The other , called the " Espiritu Santo , " built by Joan Tello de Aguirre and other residents of Manila , was to make the voyage with the merchandise of that year credited to the builders , but was to pass into possession of his Majesty on its arrival in Nueva Espana , according to an agreement and contract made with the same governor , Don Francisco Tello . Don Pedro de Acuna made so great haste in despatching both ships that , with the cargo which they were to carry , he sent them out of port at the beginning of July of the aforesaid year six hundred and two , with Don Lope de Ulloa in the " Espiritu Santo " as general , and Don Pedro Flores in charge of the " Jesus Maria . " Both ships went on their way , and in thirty-eight degrees met such storms that they were many times on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their merchandise . The ship " Jesus Maria " put back into Manila with difficulty after having been more than forty days in the island of the Ladrones , whence it was unable to depart . During this time they had opportunity to pick up all the surviving Spaniards from among those left by the ship " Santa Margarita , " among them , Fray Joan Pobre , who had jumped into one of the boats of the natives from the galleon " Santo Tomas , " when it passed that way the year before . Five other Spaniards were in other islands of the same Ladrones , but although every effort was made to bring them , they could not come . The natives brought Fray Joan Pobre and the others to the ship in their own boats , with great friendship and good will . After they had been entertained on board the ship , which they entered without fear , and after iron and other presents had been given to them , they returned without the Spaniards , weeping and showing great sorrow . The ship " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Japon , as it could do nothing else , with its mainmast gone , and entered a port of Firando , twenty legues from a station of the religious of St. Augustine , who had gone there the same year from Manila , and where also the ship bound for Quanto had entered . The harbor could be sounded i. e. , it formed a good anchorage , but to enter and leave it were very difficult , because its channel had many turns , with rocks and high mountains on both sides . However , as the Japanese natives with their funeas towed and guided the ship so that it might enter , it had less difficulty . When it was inside , a Japanese guard was placed on the ship , and those who went ashore were not allowed to return to the ship . The supplies furnished them did not suffice for all their necessities , and the price was not suitable . On this account , and because a large number of soldiers had assembled quickly at the port from the whole district , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had always declined to give them , he feared that they wished to seize the ship and its merchandise , as was done in Hurando , with the ship " San Felipe , " in the year ninety-six . He acted with caution , and kept much closer watch thenceforward , without leaving his ship or allowing his men to leave it alone , or any of the merchandise to be unloaded . At the same time he sent his brother , Don Alonso de Ulloa , and Don Antonio Maldonado to Miaco with a reasonable present for Daifusama , that he might have provision given them and permission to go out again from that harbor. 155 These men made the journey by land . Meanwhile , those on the ship were greatly troubled by the Japanese who were in the port , and by their captains , who were not satisfied with the presents which were given them to make them well disposed , but forcibly seized whatever they saw , giving out that everything was theirs and that it would soon be in their power . Fray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the ship and told the general that he had put into a bad harbor of infidels and wicked people , who would take his ship and rob it , and that he should endeavor with all his might to get it out of there and take it to Firando where he the father was living . Meanwhile he told him to be on the watch and guard to the best of his ability . As the father was returning to his house with some pieces of silk , given him on the ship for his new church and monastery at Firando , the Japanese took it away from him and did not leave him a thing , saying that it was all theirs , and he went away without it . About a dozen and a half of the Spaniards of the ship were ashore , where they were kept in confinement and not allowed to go on board again , and although the general warned them that he had determined to leave the port as soon as possible , and that they should make every effort to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only four or five of them . Without waiting any longer he drove the Japanese guard from the ship , bent the foresail and spritsail , loaded the artillery , and , with weapons in hand , one morning set the ship in readiness to weigh anchor . The Japanese went to the channel at the mouth of the harbor with many funeas and arquebusiers , stretched a thick rattan cable which they had woven , and moored it on both banks in order that the ship might not be able to sail out . The general sent a small boat with six arquebusiers to find out what they were doing , but at their approach , a number of the Japanese funeas attacked them with the purpose of capturing them . However , by defending themselves with their arquebuses they returned to the ship and reported to the general that the Japanese were closing the exit from the harbor with a cable . Taking this to be a bad sign , the ship immediately set sail against the cable to break it , and a negro , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let down over the bow with a large machete in order to cut the cable when the ship should reach it. @# With the artillery and the arquebuses he cleared the channel of the funeas there , and when he came to the cable , with the impetus of the vessel and the strenuous efforts of the negro with the machete , it broke , and the ship passed through . It still remained for it to go through the many turns which the channel made before coming out to the sea and it seemed impossible for a ship which was sailing fast to go through them , but God permitted it to pass out through them as though it had had a breeze for each turn . But the Japanese , who had assembled in great numbers on the hills and rocks within range of where the ship was passing , did not fail to annoy the ship with many volleys , with which they killed one Spaniard on the ship and wounded others . The ship did the same , and with their artillery they killed several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s passage , and accordingly were left without it . The general , finding himself on the sea and free from the past danger , and seeing that it was beginning to blow a little from the north , thought it best to venture on his voyage to Manila rather than to seek another harbor in Japon . Having raised a jury-mast 156 in place of the main-mast , and with the wind freshening daily from the north , he crossed to Luzon in twelve days , via the cape of Bojeador , and reached the mouth of the bay of Manila , where he found the ship " Jesus Maria , " which was also putting in in distress through the Capul Channel ; and so the two ships together , as they had gone together out of the port of Cabit five months before , made harbor there again in distress after having suffered many damages and losses to the exchequer. @# Don Alonso de Ulloa and Don Francisco Maldonado , while this was going on in the harbor where they had left the ship " Espiritu Santo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daifusama . The latter , upon being informed who they were , that their ship had entered Japon , and that they were from Manila , received them cordially , and quickly gave them warrants and chapas i. e. , safe-conducts , in order that the tonos and governors of the provinces where the ship had entered should allow it and its crew to depart freely . They were to be allowed to refit , and to be given what they needed ; and whatever had been taken from them , whether much or little , was to be returned. @# While this matter was being attended to , news reached Miaco of the departure of the ship from the harbor , and the skirmish with the Japanese over it , and of this they complained anew to Diafu . He showed that he was troubled at the departure of the ship and the discourtesy to it , and at the outrages committed by the Japanese . He gave new chapas for restitution of all the goods to be made ; and sent a catan from his own hand with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter , 157 and ordered that the Spaniards who remained in the port should be set free , and that their goods be returned to them . With this warrant the Spaniards left that port and recovered what had been taken from them . The ambassadors and the others returned to Manila in the first vessels which left , taking with them eight chapas of the same tenor from Daifusama , in order that in the future ships coming from Manila to any port whatever of J apon , might be received courteously and well treated , without having any harm done them . These , upon their arrival in Manila , they handed over to the governor , who gives them to the ships sailing to Nueva Espana , to provide for any incidents on the voyage. @# At the same time that Governor Don Pedro de Acuna entered upon his administration , the captain and sargento-mayor , Pedro Cotelo de Morales , arrived from Jolo with the advices and report of Joan Xuarez Gallinato concerning the state of affairs in that island , whither he had gone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The governor , on account of the importance of the matter , wished to make every effort possible , and determined to send him supplies and a reenforcement of some men , which he did as soon as possible . He was ordered to at least make an effort to punish that enemy , even if he could do nothing more , and , whenever the opportunity presented itself , to go to do the same thing in the river of Mindanao , and return to the Pintados . When this commission reached Jolo , Gallinato was already so worn out , and his men so ill , that the reenforcements only made it possible for him to get away from there ; accordingly without seeing to another thing , he broke camp , burned the forts which he had built , embarked , and went to Pintados , leaving the people of that island of Jolo and their neighbors , those of Mindanao , emboldened more than ever to make raids against the Pintados , and the islands within , which they did. @# The governor , without delaying any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panay and the town of Arevalo , in a galliot and other small vessels , to see their needs with his own eyes , in order to provide for them . He left war matters in Manila , during his absence , in charge of Licentiate Don Antonio de Ribera , auditor of the Audiencia. @# As soon as the governor left Manila , the auditor had plenty to look after , because a squadron of twenty caracoas and other vessels from Mindanao entered the islands as far as the island of Luzon and its coasts , making captures . Having taken some ships bound from Sebu to Manila , they captured ten Spaniards in them , among them a woman and a priest and Captain Martin de Mandia , and they took them off with them . They entered Calilaya , burned the church and all the town , and captured many persons of all classes among the natives . Thence they passed to the town of Valayan Balayan to do the same , but the auditor , having received news of the enemy in Manila , had it already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain and some vessels . Consequently , they did not dare to enter the town or its bay , but crossed over to Mindoro , where , in the principal town , they captured many men , women , and children among the natives , seizing their gold and possessions , and burning their houses and church , where they captured theprebendary Corral , curate of that doctrina . They filled their own ships , and others which they seized there , with captives , gold , and property , staying in the port of Mindoro as leisurely as though in their own land , notwithstanding that it is but twenty-four legues from Manila . Captain Martin de Mendia , prisoner of these pirates , offered for himself and the other Spanish captives that , if they would let him go to Manila , he would get the ransom for all , and would take it , or would send it within six months , to the river of Mindanao , or otherwise he would return to their power . The chief in command of the fleet agreed thereto , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write , to the effect that what had been agreed upon might be fulfilled , and then he allowed the captain to leave the fleet . The latter came to the city , and upon receiving his report , the auditor sent munitions , ships , and more men to Valayan than there were there already , with orders to go in pursuit of the enemy without delay , saying that they would find him in Mindoro . Captain Gaspar Perez , who had charge of this in Valayan , did not start so quickly as he should have done in order to find the enemy in Mindoro , for when he arrived he found that he had left that port six days before , laden with ships and booty , to return to Mindanao . Then he went in pursuit of him , although somewhat slowly . The enemy put into the river of a little uninhabited island to get water and wood . Just at that time Governor Don Pedro de Acuna , who was hastily returning to Manila , from the town of Arvalo , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He passed so near the mouth of this river , in two small champans and a virrey , with very few men , that it was a wonder that he was not seen and captured by the enemy . He learned that the enemy was there , from a boat of natives which was escaping therefrom , and then he met Gaspar Perez going in search of the enemy with twelve vessels , caracoas and vireys , and some large champans . The governor made him make more haste and gave him some of his own men to guide him to where he had left the pirates the day before , whereupon they went to attack them . But the latter espied the fleet through their sentinels whom they had already stationed in the sea , outside the river . Accordingly they left the river in haste , and took to flight , throwing into the sea goods and slaves in order to flee more lightly . Their flagship and almiranta caracoas protected the ships which were dropping behind and made them throw overboard what they could and work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails . The Spanish fleet , the vessels of which were not so light , could not put forth enough strength to overtake all of them , because , furthermore , they went into the open without fear of the heavy seas which were running , inasmuch as they were fleeing . Yet some of the ships of Captain Gaspar Perez , being lighter , got among the enemy ' s fleet , sunk some caracoas , and captured two , but the rest escaped , although with great danger of being lost . Without accomplishing anything else , the fleet returned to Manila where the governor had already entered , very much disturbed that things should have come to such a pass that these enemies , who had never dared to leave their houses , should have been so daring and bold as to come to the very gates of the city , doing great damage and making captures. @# Some years before this his Majesty had ordered an expedition to be prepared in Portuguese India for the capture of the fort of Terrenate in Maluco , which was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a tyrannical manner , and had driven out the Portuguese there . The necessary preparations of ships , munitions , and men were made for this undertaking in India , and a hidalgo , named Andrea Furtado de Mendoca , 158 was chosen general of this expedition . He was a soldier skilled in the affairs of India , who had won many victories of great importance and fame on sea and land in those parts , and had lately had a very notable one at Jabanapatan. 159 He sailed from Goa with six galleons of the kingdom , fourteen galliots and fustas , and other ships , and one thousand five hundred fighting men , and with supplies and munitions for the fleet . On account of the storms which he met , his fleet was so scattered before reaching Amboino that the galleys and fustas could not keep up with the galleons or follow them , and only three of them , in convoy of the galleons , reached Amboino . The other vessels put back into Goa and other forts on the line of that voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portuguese fort there was in great need , so that , while the galliots , fustas , and other vessels of his fleet which had fallen off on the voyage were gathering , and while help was coming which he had sent to ask of the fort of Malaca , it seemed best to Andrea Furtado de Mendoca to stop in Amboino , which is eighty legues from Maluco , in order to pacify the island and some towns of the neighborhood , and reduce them to the crown of Portugal . He was more than six months in this , having encounters with the enemy and with the rebels , in which he always came out victorious , and from which he obtained the desired result , and left everything reduced and pacified . His ships did not arrive , however , and the help which he had requested did not come from Malaca , and yet it was necessary for him to go to Terrenate , as that was the principal purpose for which he had been sent . Considering this , and yet seeing that he had fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of the munitions and supplies which he had brought were spent , he determined to send word to the governor of the Filipinas of his coming with that fleet , of what he had done in Amboino , that he was to proceed to attack Terrenate , and that , because a part of his ships had been scattered , and because he had stopped so many months for those undertakings , he had fewer men than he wanted and was in need of some things , especially supplies . He requested the governor , since this matter was so important and so to the service of his Majesty , and since so much had been spent on it from the royal treasury of the crown of Portugal , to favor and help him , by sending him some supplies and munitions and some Castilians for the undertaking . He asked that all of this should reach Terrenate by January of six hundred and three , for he would then be off that fort and the help would come to him very opportunely . This message and his letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Amboino in a light vessel in charge of Father Andre Pereira of the Society of Jesus , and Captain Antonio Fogoca , one of his own followers . They found Governor Don Pedro de Acuna in Manila , and presented the matter to him , making use of the Audiencia and of the orders , and making many boasts of the Portuguese fleet and the illustrious men who were in it , and of the valor and renown of its general in whatever he undertook . They asserted at the same time the success of the capture of Terrenate at that time , especially if they received from Manila the succor and help for which they had come , and which , in justice , should be given them , as it was given from the Filipinas whenever the king of Tidore and the chief captain of that fort requested it , and as his Majesty had ordered  --  and with more good reason and foundation on such an occasion. 160 @# Although Don Pedro de Acuna , from the time of his appointment to the government , had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he was in Mexico on his way , had treated of this matter with those there who had any information about Maluco , and sent Brother Gaspar Gomez of the Society of Jesus from Nueva Espania to his Majesty ' s court  --  who had lived in Manila many years , and also in Maluco in the time of Governor Gomez Perez Dasmarinas  --  to treat of the matter in his name with his Majesty ; and although he was in hopes of making this expedition : nevertheless it seemed to him best , without declaring his own desires , to aid in what Andrea Furtado asked , and even more , not only on account of the importance of the matter , but also because by thus helping , he would keep the general and his messengers , in case they were unsuccessful , from excusing themselves by saying that they had asked for help and reenforcement from the governor of the Filipinas , and the latter had not given it , and so that it might not be understood that he had failed to do so because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Acunia consulted about this matter with the Audiencia , which was of the opinion that the aforesaid reenforcement , and more besides , should be sent to the Portuguese at the time for which it was asked . When this was decided upon , they put it into execution , very much to the satisfaction of Father Andrea Pereira and Captain Fogaca . At the end of the year six hundred and two they were despatched from the Filipinas , taking with them the ship " Santa Potenciana " and three large frigates , with one hundred and fifty well armed Spanish soldiers , ten thousand fanegas of rice , one thousand five hundred earthen jars of palm wine , two hundred head of salt beef , twenty hogsheads of sardines , conserves and medicines , fifty quintals of powder , cannon-balls and bullets , and cordage and other supplies , the whole in charge of the captain and sargento-mayor , Joan Xuarez Gallinato  --  who had now returned from Jolo and was in Pintados  --  with orders and instructions as to what he was to do , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet which he would find there , and to place himself at the orders and command of its general. 161 Thither he made his voyage in a fortnight , and anchored in the port of Talangame , in the island of Terrenate , two legues from the fort , where he found Andrea Furtado de Mendoca with his galleons at anchor , awaiting what was being sent from Manila . He and all his men were very much pleased with it. @# In the month of March of this year six hundred and three , there entered Manila Bay a ship from Great China , in which the sentinels reported that three great mandarins were coming , with their insignia as such , on business in the service of their king . The governor gave them permission to leave their ship and enter the city with their suites . In very curious chairs of ivory and fine gilded woods , borne on the shoulders of men , they went straight to the royal houses of the Audiencia , where the governor was awaiting them , with a large suite of captains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they passed . When they had reached the doors of the royal houses they alighted from their chairs and entered on foot , leaving in the street the banners , plumes , lances and other very showy insignia which they brought with them . The mandarins went into a large , finely-decorated hall , where the governor received them standing , they making many bows and compliments to him after their fashion , and he replying to them after his . They told him through the interpreters that their king had sent them , with a Chinaman whom they had with them in chains , to see with their own eyes an island of gold , called Cabit , which he had told their king was near Manila , and belonged to no one. 162 They said that this man had asked for a quantity of ships , which he said he would bring back laden with gold , and if it were not so that they could punish him with his life . So they had come to ascertain and tell their king what there was in the matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome , and appointed them quarters in two houses within the city which had been prepared for them , in which they and their men could lodge . He said that the business would be discussed afterwards . Thereupon they left the royal houses again , and at the doors mounted in their chairs on the shoulders of their servants , who were dressed in red , and were carried to their lodgings , where the governor ordered them to be supplied fully with whatever they needed during the days of their stay. @# The coming of these mandarins seemed suspicious , and their purpose to be different from what they said , because it seemed a fiction for people , of so much understanding as the Chinese , to say that their king was sending them on this business . Among the Chinese themselves who came to Manila at the same time in eight merchant ships , and among those who lived in the city , it was said that these mandarins were coming to see the land and study its nature , because the king of China wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before the end of the year , with one hundred thousand men to take the country. @# The governor and the Audiencia thought that they ought to be very careful in guarding the city , and that these mandarins should be well treated , but that they should not go out of the city nor be allowed to administer justice , as they were beginning to do among the Sangleys , at which the mandarins were somewhat angry . He asked them to treat of their business , and then to return to China quickly , and he warned the Spaniards not to show that they understood or were suspicious of anything other than what the mandarins had said . The mandarins had another interview with the governor , and he told them more clearly , making some joke of their coming , that he was astonished that their king should have believed what that Chinaman whom they had with them had said , and even if it were true that there was so much gold in the Filipinas , that the Spaniards would not allow it to be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mandarins said that they understood very well what the governor had communicated to them , but that their king had ordered them to come and that they must needs obey and bring him a reply , and that when they had performed their duty , that was all , and they would return . The governor , to cut short the business , sent the mandarins , with their servants and the prisoner , to Cabit , which is the port , two legues from the city . There they were received with a great artillery salute , which was fired suddenly as they landed , at which they were very frightened and fearful . When they had landed , they asked the prisoner if that was the island of which he had spoken to the king , and he replied that it was . They asked him where the gold was , and he replied that everything there was gold and that he would make his statement good with the king . They asked him other questions and he always replied the same thing . Everything was written down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some confidential interpreters . The mandarins ordered a basketful of earth to be taken from the ground , to take to the king of China , and then , having eaten and rested , they returned to Manila the same day , with the prisoner . The interpreters said that the prisoner , when hard pressed by the mandarins to make suitable answers to their questions , had said that what he had meant to tell the king of China was that there was much gold and wealth in the hands of the natives and Spaniards of Manila , and that if they gave him a fleet with men , he offered , as a man who had been in Luzon and knew the country , to capture it and bring the ships back laden with gold and riches . This , together with what some Chinamen had said at the beginning , seemed very much to have more meaning than the mandarins had implied , especially to Don Fray Miguel de Benavides , archbishop-elect of Manila , who knew the language . Thereupon the archbishop and other religious warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look to its defense , because they felt sure of the coming of the Chinese fleet against it shortly . Then the governor dismissed the mandarins and embarked them on their ship , with their prisoner , after giving them some pieces of silver and other things with which they were pleased . Although , in the opinion of the majority of those in the city , it seemed that it was beyond all reason that the Chinese should attack the country , the governor began covertly to prepare ships and other things suitable for defense , and made haste to complete extensive repairs which he had begun to make on the fort of Sanctiago at the point of the river , and for the defense of the fort he built on the inside a wall of great strength , with its wings , facing toward the parade ground. @# At the end of April of this year six hundred and three , on the eve of Sts . Philip and James Santiago a fire started in a little field house casilla de zacate used by some Indians and negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' clock in the afternoon , and passed to other houses so quickly , with the force of the rather fresh wind , that it could not be stopped , and burned houses of wood and stone , even the monastery of St. a building standing among them . Fourteen people died in the fire , Spaniards , Indians , and negroes , and among them Licentiate Sanz , canon of the cathedral . In all two hundred and sixty houses were burned , with much property which was in them , and it was understood that the damage and loss amounted to more than one million pesos. @# After Ocuna Lacasamana , the Moro Malay , with the help of the mandarins of Camboja who sided with him , and of the stepmother of King Prauncar , had killed and put an end to Bias Ruyz de Hernan Goncales and Diego Belloso , and the Castilians , Portuguese , and Japanese on their side who were in the kingdom , his boldness went so far that he even killed the king himself , whereby the whole kingdom was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known before . God permitted this for His just judgments , and because Prauncar did not deserve to enjoy the good fortune which he had had in being placed on his father ' s throne , since he lost it at the same time that he did his life . Nor did Bias Ruiz de Hernan Gonzales and Diego Belloso , and their companions , deserve the fruit and labor of their expeditions and victories , since they were converted into disastrous and cruel death at the time when they seemed most secure and certain , for perchance their pretensions and claims were not so well adjusted to the obligations of conscience as they ought to have been . But God did not wish the Moro Malay to remain unpunished. @# When this Malay thought that he was going to get the better part of the kingdom of Camboja , because he had killed the Castilians and Portuguese , their captains , and the legitimate and natural king himself who favored them , he was more mistaken than he thought , because the disorders and uprisings in the provinces gave opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintained the saner course , to join , and avenge the death of King Prauncar by force of arms . So they turned against Ocuna Lacasamana and his Malays , and , meeting them in battle on different occasions , conquered and routed them , so that the Moro was forced to flee from Camboja , with the remaining remnant of his men , and pass to the kingdom of Champa , which bordered on it , with the purpose of disturbing it and making war on the usurper who held it , and of seizing it all , or as much as he could . This also did not turn out well for him , for , although he brought war into Champa , and all the disturbances which it brings , and caused the usurper and his men a great deal of trouble , at last he was routed and killed and came to pay wretchedly for his sins at the usurper ' s hands. @# Seeing themselves rid of the Malay , but finding that the kingdom was still disturbed , as he had left it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langara , who died in Laos , the mandarins of Camboja turned their eyes toward a brother of his whom the king of Sian had captured and taken with him in the war which he had made against Langara , and whom he held in the city of Odia , as they thought that he had the best right to the kingdom of Camboja , by legitimate succession , and that it would be more easily pacified in his presence . They sent an embassy to Sian , asking him to come to reign , and asking the king of Sian , who held him captive , to allow him to go . The king thought well of it , and , with certain provisions and conditions which he made with his prisoner , gave him his liberty and six thousand fighting men to serve and accompany him . With these he came immediately to Camboja and was readily received in Sistor and other provinces , and placed on the throne , and from those provinces he went on pacifying and reducing the more distant ones. @# This new king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sian , came to the throne by such strange events and varying chances  --  for God held this good fortune in store for him , and holds still more of greater worth , if he can carry on what he has begun  --  caused search to be made for Joan Diaz , a Castilian soldier , who survived from the company of Blas Ruyz de Hernan Goncales . He bade him go to Manila and , in his behalf , tell the governor that he was on the throne , and also what had happened in regard to the death of the Spaniards and of his nephew Prauncar , in which he the new king was in no wise to blame . He said that he recognized the friendship which they  --  Langara , his brother , and the latter ' s son  --  received from the Spaniards in the time of their troubles ; that he himself was well disposed to continue this friendship and understanding ; and he again asked the governor , if he were willing , to send him some religious and Castilians to reside at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become so. @# With this message and embassy , and many promises , Joan Diaz came to Manila , where he found Don Pedro de Acuna in the government , and treated of the matter with him . The governor thought it unwise to close the door to the preaching of the holy gospel in Camboja , which God had opened again in this way , and he agreed to do what the king asked . So , at the beginning of the year six hundred and three , he sent a frigate to Camboja , with four religious of the Order of St. Dominic with Fray Ynigo de Santa Maria , prior of Manila , at their head with five soldiers to accompany them , among them Joan Diaz himself . They were to give the king the reply to his message , in confirmation of the peace and friendship for which he asked , and , according to the circumstances which they found there , the religious were to stay in his court and advise what seemed best to them . This frigate reached Camboja after a ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the soldiers in their company ascended the river to Chordemuco , where the king received them with great satisfaction . He immediately built them a church , and gave them rice for their support , and granted them liberty to preach and christianize . This seemed to the religious to be the work of Heaven , and a matter in which a great many workers could be employed . They sent immediate word of their good reception and condition to Manila in the same frigate , after asking permission of the king that it might return . The king granted it and gave them the necessary supplies for their voyage , and at the same time sent a servant of his with a present of ivory tusks , benzoin , and other curious things for the governor , with a letter thanking him for what he was doing and asking for more religious and Castilians .

It brought news that Fray Diego de Soria , 164 of the Order of St. Dominic , bishop of Cagayan , was in Mexico , and was bringing the bulls and pallium to the archbishop-elect of Manila , and Fray Baltasar de Cobarrubias , 165 of the Order of St. Augustine , appointed bishop of Camarines by the death of Fray Francisco de Ortega . In the same ships came two auditors for the Audiencia of Manila , Licentiates Andres de Alcaraz , and Manuel de Madrid y Luna. @# The captain and sargento-mayor , Joan Xuarez Gallinato , with the ship " Santa Potenciana " and the men whom he had taken in it to Maluco in aid of the Portuguese fleet which Andrea Furtado de Mendoca had brought to assault the fortress of Terrenate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as this help arrived , Andrea Furtado landed his men , Portuguese and Castilians , with six pieces of artillery , and marched with them along the shore , toward the fort , to plant the battery . He took two days to reach the fort , passing through some narrow places and gullies which the enemy had fortified . When he had reached the principal fort , he had all that he could do to plant the artillery , for the enemy sallied out frequently against the camp and hindered the work . Once they reached the very gate of the quarters , and would have done a great deal of damage had not the Castilians nearest the entrance stopped them and pressed the Moros so hard that , leaving some dead , they turned and fled and shut themselves up in the fort . At the same time five pieces were placed within cannon-shot of it . The enemy , who had sufficient men for their defense , with a great deal of artillery and ammunition , did much damage in the camp , whereas the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short supply of powder and ammunition . Consequently what Gallinato and his men had heard , when they joined the Portuguese fleet , of the scant supply and outfit which Andrea Furtado had brought for so great an enterprise , was seen and experienced very quickly .

He embarked his men on his galleons and returned to the forts and islands of Amboino and Vanda , where he had first been , taking for the support of the fleet the supplies brought him by Gallinato , to whom he gave permission to return to Manila , with the Castilians .

Of all those through which I have passed in this undertaking , and they have been infinite , the result has been that I have learned the zeal and courage which your Lordship shows in the service of his Majesty , on account of which I envy your Lordship and hold you as master , affirming that the thing which I would like most in this life would be for your Lordship to hold the same opinion of me , and , as one that is very particularly your own , that your Lordship should command me in what is for your service. @# The help sent me by your Lordship came in time , by the favor of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives to all of us alive today . By what happened in this expedition , his Majesty will understand how much he owes to your Lordship and how little to the captain of Malaca , for the latter was partly the cause that the service of his Majesty was not accomplished . When the ship sent me by your Lordship arrived , this fleet was without any supplies because it had been two years since it had left Goa , and they had all been consumed and spent on the occasions which had presented themselves . Admitting this in order that it may not be imagined that it was on my account that the service of his Majesty was not carried out , I went on shore , which I gained , inflicting great losses on the enemy , and I placed my last trenches a hundred paces from the enemy ' s fortification . I landed five heavy pieces for battering , and in ten days of bombarding , knocked to pieces a large part of a bastion where all the enemy ' s force was concentrated . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without a grain being left with which its artillery could be loaded even once , and if I should happen to run across a Dutch squadron , of which I have little doubt , I should be forced to fight with them . This was the principal cause for which I raised the siege , when I had the enemy in great distress through hunger and also through having killed many of his captains and other men in the course of the fighting . From this your Lordship may judge of the state of suffering and grief in which I must be . God be praised for everything , since it is His will , and may He permit that His greatest enemies in these regions may become the vassals of his Majesty. @# I am leaving for Amboino to see if I can get help there , and if I find sufficient , and if there is not elsewhere in the south anything in such urgent need that I must attend to it , I am going to return to this undertaking , and I will inform your Lordship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the help which I expect , I shall go to Malaca to refit , and from whatever place I am in , I shall always inform your Lordship . I am writing to his Majesty , giving him a long account of the affairs of this enterprise , and stating that it can not be accomplished or preserved in the future , unless it is done by the order of your Lordship , and helped and increased by that government , since India is so far that it could not receive help from there within two years . In conformity with this , your Lordship should inform his Majesty , that he may be undeceived in this regard about Maluco , and I trust to God that I may be one of your Highness ' s soldiers. @# I do not know with what words I can praise or thank your Lordship for the kind things which you have done for me . These were made plain to me by Antonio de Brito Fogaca , as well as by Tomas de Araux , my servant . These are things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honor , and property on every occasion which offers itself in your service . If such an occasion should be presented to me , it will be seen that I am not ungrateful for the favors which I have received ; the greatest of which , and the one which I esteem most highly , was that , with this help , your Lordship sent me Joan Xuarez Gallinato , Don Tomas de Acuna , and the other captains and soldiers . If I were to mention to your Lordship the deserts of each and every one of these , I should never end. @# Joan Xuarez Gallinato is a person whom your Lordship should esteem highly on every occasion , because he deserves it all . In this expedition and enterprise he conducted himself with so great satisfaction , courage , and prudence , that it is very clear that he was sent by your Lordship and had fought under the banners of so distinguished captains . Consequently , I shall be glad to know that your Lordship has shown him many kindnesses , on account of his services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own account . The thing which pleased me most in this undertaking , and which is worthy of being remembered , is that , contrary to the proverb of the old Portuguese women , in the course of this war there was not one harsh word between the Spaniards and Portuguese , though they ate together at one mess . But your Lordship may attribute this to your good fortune , and to the intelligence and experience of Joan Xuarez Gallinato. @# Don Tomas conducted himself in this war , not like a gentleman of his age , but like an old soldier , full of experience . Your Lordship should greatly esteem this relative , for I trust that your Lordship may be a second father to him. @# The sargento-mayor conducted himself in this war like an excellent soldier , and he is a man whom your Lordship should regard favorably , for I give my word that the Manilas do not contain a better soldier than he , and I shall be greatly pleased if your Lordship honor him and show him very particular favors on my account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the same . In short all the soldiers , to a man , great and small , did likewise in this enterprise , so that for this reason I am under so great obligations to them that , if I were now before his Majesty , I would not leave his feet till I had heaped them all with honors and favors since they also deserve them . So for this reason I shall always be particularly glad if your Lordship confers honors and favors on them all in general . May our Lord preserve your Lordship for many years , as I , your servant , desire .

" His fleet , consisting of three vessels , " The Desire , " of 120 tons , " The Content , " of 60 tons , and " Hugh Gallant , " of 40 tons , left Plymouth July 21 , 1586 , with one hundred and twenty-three men in all , and provisions for two years . Steering a general southwest course they reached the Strait of Magellan January 6 , 1587 . In the strait they found the melancholy remains of a Spanish colony started three years before  --  Twenty-three people out of the four hundred settlers , two of whom were women . One named Hernando they took with them . This place the Englishmen appropriately named Port Famine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement , under the Spanish , some " guinie wheat , which is called Maiz . " The first capture was May 1  --  a boat of three hundred tons from Guaianel laden with timber and food . Prizes after that were thick and fast , and the vessels were generally burned after being despoiled of valuables . On July 9 , near the coast of New Spain , a ship of one hundred and twenty tons was taken , from one of the crew of which , Michael Sancius from Marseilles , they first heard of " the great shippe called The Santa Anna , which vve aftervvard tooke comming from the Philippinas . " After coasting along New Spain and California committing various depredations , among them the defacing of the Spanish churches , and various other piratical deeds , they met on the fourth of November with the " Santa Ana . " They pursued it for three or four hours and finally overtaking fought with and captured it . The fight is described as follows : @# " In the afternoone we gat vp vnto them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a volee of small shot , and presently laid the ship aboord , whereof the King of Spaine was owner , which was Admirall of the South-sea , called the S. Anna , and thought to be seuen hundred tvnnes in burthen . Now as we were readie on their ships side to enter her , beeing not past fiftie or sixty men at the vttermost in our ship , we perceived that the Captain of the said ship had made fights fore and after , and laid their sailes close on their poope , their mid-ship , with their fore-castle , and hauing not one man to be seene , stood close under their fights , with Lances , Iauelings , Rapiers and Targets , and an innumerable sort of great stones , which they threw ouer boord vpon our heads , and into our ship so fast , and beeing so many of them , that they put vs off the shippe againe , with the losse of two of our men which were slaine , and with the hurting of foure or fiue . But for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man his furniture , and gaue them a fresh incounter with our great Ordnance , and also with our small shot , raking them thorough and thorough , to the killing and maiming of many of their men . Their Captaine still like a valiant man with his companie , stood very stoutly vnto his close fights , not yeelding as yet . Our General incouraging his men afresh with the whole noyse of trumpets , gaue them the third encounter with our great Ordnance , and all our small shot to the great discomforting of our enemies , raking them through in diuerse places , killing and spoyling many . They beeing thus discomforted , and their shippe beeing in hazard of sinking by reason of the great shot which were made , whereof some were vnder water , within fiue or sixe houres fight , set out a flagge of truce , and parled for mercie , desiring our Generall to saue their lines , and to take their goods , and that they would presently yeeld . Our Generall promised them mercy , and willed them to strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; to come aboord : which newes they were full glad to heare , and presently stroke their sailes , hoysed their boat out , and one of their chiefe marchants came aboord vnto our Generall : and falling downe vpon his knees , offered to haue kissed his feete , and craued mercie : the Captaine and their Pilote , at their comming vsed the like duetie and reuerence as the former did . The Generall promised their lines and good vsage . They declared what goods they had within boord , to wit , an hundreth and two and twenty thousand pezos of gold : and the rest of the riches that the ship was laden with , was in Silkes , Sattens , Damasks , with Muske and diuers other marchandize , and great store of all manner of victualls , with the choice of many conserues of all sorts for to eate , and of sundry sorts of very good wines . These things beeing made knowne , they were commanded to stay aboord the Desire , and on the sixt day of Nouember following , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards , Aguada Segura , or Puerto Seguro. " @# During the division of the booty , a mutiny broke out , especially in the ship " Content , " but was quelled . The Spaniards , to the number of one hundred and ninety men and women , were set ashore . Ammunition and arms were left them , and the English departed : taking with them however from the Spanish boat two clever young Japanese , three boys born in Manila , a Portuguese , and one Thomas de Ersola , a pilot from Acapulco . The " Santa Ana " was burned on the nineteenth of November , and the English turned toward home . That same night the " Content " vanished and was seen no more . January 3 , 1588 , the Ladrones were reached . They had the experiences with the natives that are so often described by the Spaniards , iron being the usual article bartered by the English . The natives are described as " of a tawny colour , and maruellous fat , and bigger ordinarily of stature then the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maruellous long : yet some of them haue it made vp , and tyed with a knot on the Crowne and some with two knots , much like vnto their Images which we faw carued in wood , and standing in the head of their boats , like vnto the Images of the deuill . " January 14 , they reached the Philippines at Cabo del Santo Espiritu , " which is of very great bignesse and length . . . . and it is short of the chiefest Island of the Philippinas called Manilla , about sixtie leagues . Manilla is vvel planted and inhabited with Spaniards , to the number of sixe or seuen hundred persons : which dvvell in a tovvne vnvvalled , which hath three or foure Blocke-houses , part made of vvood , and part of stone , being indeed of no great strength : they haue one or tvvo small Gallies belonging to the Tovvne . It is a very rich place of Gold , and many other commodities ; and they haue yeerely traffique from Alcapulco in Nueva Espanna , and also twenty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bring them many sorts of marchandize . They bring great store of gold vvith them , vvhich they traffique and exchange for siluer , and give vveight for vveight . These Sanguelos are men of maruellous capacity , in deuising and making all manner of things , especially in all handiecrafts and sciences : and euery one is so expert , perfect , and skilfull in his facultie , as fevv or no Christians are able to go beyond them in that which they take in hand . For drawing and imbroidering vpon Satten , Silke , or Lavvne , either beast , fovvle , fish , or vvorme , for liuelinesse and perfectnesse , both in Silke , Siluer , Gold , and Pearle , they excell . Also the fourteenth day at night we entred the Straits between the Island of Lucon , and the Island of Camlaia . " The natives imagining them Spaniards willingly traded their food with them . At an anchorage Thomas Ersola , the Spanish pilot , was hanged for trying to inform the Spanish of the English . The following on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capul is interesting , and accords , with slight differences , with the Spanish records : @# " We roade for the space of nine dayes , about this Island of Capul , where we had diuerse kinds of fresh victualls , with excellent fresh water in euery bay , and great store of wood . The people of this Island go almost all naked , and are tawny of colour . The men weare onely a stroope about their wastes , of some kind of linnen of their owne weauing , which is made of Plantan-leaues , and another stroope comming from their backe under their twistes , Which couereth their priuy parts , and is made fast to their girdles at their nauels ; which is this . Euery man and manchild among them , hath a nayle of Tynne thrust quite through the head of his priuie part , being split in the lower ende , and riuetted , and on the head of the nayle is as it were a Crowne : which is driuen through their priuities when they be yong , and the place groweth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child : and they take this nayle out and in as occasion serueth ; and for the truth thereof , we our selues haue taken one of these nayles from a Sonne of one of the Kings , which was of the age of tenne yeeres , who did weare the same in his priuy member . This custome was granted at the request of the women of the Country , who finding their men to be giuen to the fovvle sinne of Sodomie , desired fome remedie against that mischiefe , and obtained this before named of the Magistrates . Moreouer all the males are circumcised , hauing the fore skinne of their flesh cut avvay . These people vvholly vvorshippe the Deuill , and oftentimes haue conference vvith him , which appeareth vnto them in moft vgly and monstrous shape. " @# In this island Candish , or Cavendish , announced their nationality to the natives  --  whom he had made pay tribute in " Hogges , Hennes , Potatoes , and Cocos "  --  and their hostility to the Spaniards . The natives promised " both themselues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whensoeuer hee should come againe to ouercome the Spaniards . " Their tribute money was returned to them in token of the Englishmen ' s hostility to the Spaniards . January 24 the English coasted along Luzon , and ran northwest between that island and Masbat. @# " The eight and twentieth day , in the morning about seuen of the clocke , riding at an anchor betwixt two Islands , wee espyed a Frigat under her two Coarses , comming out betweene two other Islands , which ( as wee imagined ) came from Manilla , sayling close aboord the shore , along the maine Island of Panama . Here wee rode at anchor all that night , and perceiued that certaine Spaniards ( which came from Manilla to Ragaun , to fetch a new shippe of the Kings , there builded ) had disperfed their Band into two or three parts , and kept great Watch in seuerall steedes , with Fires , and shooting off their Pieces . This Island hath much plaine Ground in it , in many places , and many faire and straight Trees doe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masts for all sorts of shippes . There are also Mynes of very fine Gold in it , which are in the custodie of the Indians . And to the South-ward of this place , there is another very great Island , which is not subdued by the Spaniards , nor any other Nation . The people which inhabit it , are all Negros , and the Island is called the Island of Negros ; and is almost as bigge as England , standing in nine degrees : The most part of it seemeth to be very lowe Land , and by all likelyhood is very fruitfull. @# " The nine and twentieth day of January , about six of the clocke in the morning wee set sayle , sending our Boat before , vntill it was two of the clocke in the afternoone , passing all this time as it were through a Strait , betwixt the laid two Islands of Panama , and the Island of Negros ; and about sixteene Leagues off , wee espyed a faire opening , trending South-west and by South : at which time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Spanish Captaine , which wee came from the Euening before , by a Spaniard which wee had taken , and willed him to provide a good store of Gold ; for hee meant for to see him with his company at Manilla within few yeeres ; and that hee did but want a bigger Boat to haue landed his men ; or else hee would haue seene him then ; and so caused him to be let on shore.
