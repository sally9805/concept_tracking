txt 1 The piper to whose lively tunes the German Empire has been dancing merrily for so many years has sent in his bill , and the nation , or the nation 's i representatives , though quite willing 1 to go on with the dancing , are by no means prepared to settle up . Prince BucLow , who has naturally been held responsible for- the entertainment and for the expense thereof , is disgusted and discouraged , and it is now fofmally announced , as it has been often predicted , that he will insist on his resignation before the close of the present I month . Whether or not this announcement is a " bluff , " as our Berlin correspondent intimated in TiinD SUNDAY TintEs. the situation is serious . As a Chancellor unable to command or contrive a majority in Parliament can not be a useful servant to the Emperor , it might be assumed that Ms resignation would be accepted , were it not that there is not at present any one in signt who can be expected to do any better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation ; ( 1 ) a rapidly Increasing expenditure far outrunning the actual income ; ( 2 ) a rapidly growing debt , from which in great part current expenses have been met ; ( 3 ) a system of taxation wholly unequal to annual requirements , and framed largely to benefit the landowners on the one hand while leaving their property largely unburdened on the other . The chief objects of expenditure have been public works , especially canals , the army and fortifications and the na.ky , and a good deal , of money has been spent=much of it wasted  --  on the various colonial enterprises , which have been very costly and only recently show any signs of paying for themselvea But , as in every other modern country , there has also been in Germany a strong tendency toward a geni eral increase in the scale of expenditures . Living has become much more costly . The old German thrift and economy are disappearing , all branches of the public service are more expensive , and the Treasury has for years been unable to make both ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most powerful and prosperous nation of Europe has been  --  for a long while in the humiliating position of depending upon the money lenders to pay Its day-by-day requirements . Naturally its credit has suffered , and it has to I pay- more for its loans than many a ' third-rate country . But the radical difficulty lies its the German system of taxation by which the burdens of the old landowning aristocracy have been lightened while the food of the people has been heavily taxed to enable the products of the land to command a profit . When the pres1 ent session of the Reichstag was opened , Prince BUELOW 'S . Government introduced a plan for the reform of taxation and the reinforcement of the national credit . It was by no means radical . It proposed to pse loans only for expenditures of permanent importance ? public works , fortifications , and a certain share of the navy . It further proposed a plan of taxation which , together with certain luxuries and semi- luxuries , subjected landed property , ac- cumulated fortunes , inheritances , &e.,; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly unable to secure a majority for his plan . The Reichstag has voted without hesitation and with practical unanimity the large sums asked for the navy , but when it comes to taxation . failure has followed failure for the luckless Chancellor . It is no wonder that he is wea'ry of his job . Meanwhile it is to be noted that the revelations as to the financial situation of Germany are calculated to offset the apparent tendency toward unlimited expenditure on preparations for war . ' ' The effect may not show- this year , but it must tell sooner or later . The dancing will slow down as the piper presses Lfaapayment of his score . As for Prince EUELOW 'S threatened retirement , theie are , to be sure , a number of possible candidates for the post , but not ene of his stature , and , as our Berlin correIspondent said yesterday , his tenure of ! office is " wholly for him to determine .                    @
