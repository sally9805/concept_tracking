To the many who do not know , it is not easy to explain the charm of the Gypsy . But what it means to the few who feel it , Borrow , long ago , left no chance of doubt . I have come under the spell . There was a time when I found my hand 's breadth of romance ? " ' mid the blank miles round about " ? on the road and in the tents . But when I look back , the centre of the group round the fire or tinder the trees was not the Gypsy , but a tall , fair man , with flowing beard , more like a Viking , ? my Uncle , Charles Godfrey Leland , without whom I might never have found my way to those camps by the wayside . He first took inc to see the Gypsies after his return to Philadelphia , in the spring of 1880 . He had already written his first books about them , was already honored as a Romany scholar throughout the learned world , and welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like best to remember him as he was on these tramps , gay and at ease in his velveteen coat and soft wide-brimmed hat , alert for discovery of the Romany in the Philadelphia fields , and like a child in his enjoyment of it all , from the first glimpse of the smoke curling through the trees and the first sound of the soft " sari-shan " of greeting . Of his love for the . Gypsies I can , therefore , speak from my vivid memory , of the old days . And as . since his death , all his Gypsy papers and collections have been placed in my hands , by his wish , I now know no less well ? perhaps better than anybody ? just bow hard he worked over their history and their language . For if " gypsying " was , as he said , the best sport he knew , it was also his most serious pursuit . There are notebooks , elaborate vocabularies. stories , proverbs , songs , diaries , lists of names , memoranda of all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . from other " Romany Ryes , " ? Borrow . Groome , the Archduke Josef , Mr. Mac-Ritchie , Professor Palmer , Mr. Joint Sampson , Mr. Hubert Smith , Dr. Bath Smart , Mr. Crofton . Nothing , I do believe , has ever united men as closely as love of the Gypsy , ? when it has not estranged them completely , ? and it happened that never was there a group of scholars so ready to be drawn together by this bond , Borrow their inspiration , as they would have been the first to admit . If the " Romany Rye " is , as Groome defined him , one , not a Gypsy , who loves the race and has mastered the tongue , Borrow did not invent him . Already stu- dents had busied themselves with the language ; already Gypsy scholars , like Glanvill 's , ? or Matthew Arnold 's h ' " had roam 'd the world with that wild brotherhood . " But they had been scattered through the many centuries since he first Gypsy had appeared in Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind on the heath , feeling the charm a the Gypsy 's life , made others hear and feel with him , till , where there had been but one Romany Rye , there were now a score , learning more of Romany in a few years than earlier scholars had in hundreds , and , less fearful than Glanvill 's youth , giving the world their knowledge of the language and the people who spoke it . A very craze for the Gypsy spread through the land . I know of nothing like it , save the ardor with which the DEbrige took root in Provence . Language in both cases ? with the Felibres their own , with the Romany Ryes that of the stranger ? led to sympathy and fellowship . There were the same meetings , the same friendships and rivalries , the same collaboration , the same exaltation even , ? only , the sober men of the North were less intoxicated with the noise of their own voices , less theatrical in proclaiming their brotherhood , less eager to make of a common study a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been ashamed to blow their trumpets in public , to advertise themselves with joyousself-abandonment . TheDilibres were proud to be Provencal ; the Romany Ryes loved to play at gypsying . And so , while the history of the Dlibrige ? probably with years of life before it ? has been written again and again , the movement Borrow started still waits its historian , thought , if the child has been born who will see the last Gypsy , as has been said , the race of Gypsy scholars must now be dying out . It is a pity . The story of their studies and their friendships , as I read it in these yellowing letters and notebooks , is worth immortalizing . Of all the little group , not one got to know the Gypsies better , loved themmore honestly , and wrote about them more learnedly and yet delightfully , than the Rye , ? the name by which they all called him , by which I knew him best . During his life he had a snider notoriety as " Hans Breitmann , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rye , for into his Gypsy books he put Inure of himself as well as his most perfect work . If his study of the Romanies began only when lie came to settle in England in 1870 , it was simply because , until then , he had found no Romanies to study . Love of them must always have been in his blood . Nothing appealed to him more than the mysterious . The passion for the strange that set him reading Pa in &sus; at an age when most boys , if they read at all , are deep in penny dreadfuls ; that gave him , as his last keen pleasure just before his death , the recovery of the Voodoo stone stolen from his hotel in Florence ; ? this passion , always so strong in him , predestined him to dealings of the " deepest " with the Gypsies ,  --  everything connected with whom is a mystery , as Lavengro told the Armenian , ? once the Gypsies came his way . The Rye ? I can not speak , as I can not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Borrow 's pretence to secret power ; he did not pose as the Sapengro , their master . Nor was there anything of the vagabond about him . I can not imagine him in the dingle with the Flaming Tinman and Isopel Berners . He would have been supremely uncomfortable wandering through Norway , or through life , with Esmeralda . He could not have passed himself off for a Gypsy with Wlislocki or Herrmann in the mountains of Transylvania , with Sampson on Welsh roads , with Borrow in Spain . It was not his way of caring for the Gypsies that was the only difference ; he cared for them no less . For him the fascination was in the message their dark faces brought from the East , the " fatherland of divination and enchantment ; " in the shreds and tatters of myths and magics that clung to them ; in their black language ? the halo jib ? with the some- Hifi hots Breda-man as Romany Rye thing mysterious in it that drew Borrow to the Irish tongue . Besides , in his religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature played a large part . It would no more have driven him into the wilderness with Thoreau than love for the Gypsy could have led him to pitch his tent in Burrow 's dingle . But it was very real , all the same , and opened his heart to the people who are at home with nature , and whom he thought the human types of this love which is vanishing . In his ears , theirs was " the cheerful voice of the public road ; " to its " sentiment " their presence was the clue ; and he believed that Borrow felt this with him . I am not so sure . For all the now famous picture of the Gypsy as the human cuckoo adding charm to the green lanes in spring and slimmer , it is a question whether nature ever really appealed to Borrow , save as a background for his own dramatic self . With the Rye , however , I have wandered often and far enough to know that he loved the wood , the sea , the roach , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And out of this love of Nature , and the people nearest to her , came the gift of which he boasted once in a letter to Borrow , ? he had always , he said , been able to win the confidence of Indians and negroes . It was natural , then , that he and the Gypsies , as soon as they met , should understand each other . I do not mean that he did not enjoy the dramatic moment when it came . He did . He liked to astonish the Gypsies by talking to them in their own language . He liked to be able , no matter where he chanced upon them , ? in England or America , Hungary or Italy , Egypt or Russia , ? to stroll up , to all appearances the complete Gorgio , or Gentile ; to be greeted as one ; and then , of a sudden , to break fluently into Romany : " to descend upon them by a way that was dark and a trick that was vain , in the path of mystery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " a game , a jolly game , and no mistake , " ? a game , worth all the philo logical discos-cries in the world , which , must say , he played uncommonly well . Everything about him helped , ? his im posing presence , his tine bead , with the long flowing beard , always towering above the Romanies ; his gestures ; ? he had an impressive way , all his own , of throwing out Inslarge hands as he spoke the magic words ; ? his earnestness , for he was tremendously in earnest in everything he did , and no Romany Rye ever " looked fixedly for a minute " into the Gypsy 's eye ? the first move in the game ? with more telling effect . To have au audience , especially a disinterested audience , added to the effect and the pleasure . " NVait , and you will see something queer , " he told the friend who was with him at the Paris Exhibition of 1878 , when he spoke to the Hungarian Gypsies . There you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end with the first breathless second of astonishment . For he could tell the Romanies their own stories and fortunes , sing them their own songs , put them up to their own tricks , every bit as well as they could themselves , if not better , and look the Gorgio all the time . " How do you do it up to such a high peg ? " one of them asked him once . " It ' s the air and the style ! " To become a mystery to L110 people of mystery was a situation to which the study of no other language could lead . And to have somebody , even a chance passer-by , see lain do it ; to force an involuntary , " Do you know , sir , I think you 're the most mysterious gentleman I ever met ! " but made his triumph complete . If at home , up to 1869 , he had never fallen among Gypsies , fate so willed it that in England he should settle first in the town of an others where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to escape , though most people there would not have known a Gypsy had they seen one . This was Brighton , middle-class and snobbish , still too dazzled by the royalty that once patronized it , to have eyes for the Romanies who , however , were always to be found at the Devil 's I tyke , but a few miles off . It was another piece of luck that chief among these Romanies should be old Natty Cooper , in Iris way as remarkable a personage as the Regent had been before him . Ile and his sister 6 ' entilla , at the right seasons of the year , were certain to be camped SODICwhere about the Devil 's Dyke , and what they did not know of English Romany was not worth knowing . Exactly how it happened I can not say , except that it could not have been otherwise , but the Rye had not been very long in Brighton before Natty Cooper was coming to him three and four times a week , sometimes every day , to teach him Romany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paspati , " the Rye wrote years afterwards to Ibbetson , a Romany Rye of a later generation . " ' When he remembered or recognized a word , or it recalled another , I wrote it down . Then I went through the vocabularies of Liebich , Pott , Simson , etc. , and finally through Brice 's Hindustani Dictionary , and the great part of a much larger work and one in Persian . " Natty had the courage , during the lesson , to face any dictionary his pupil chose to open , though how he faced his people in the tents afterwards , what language he used to them , is not on record . I have the notebooks by use , nine or ten in number , in which the results of each morning 's work were set down , and nowhere are there signs of the master playing truant . The date of each lesson is entered ; sometimes , too , the sum paid for it , and it is to Natty 's credit that there were weeks when , at the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then follows a list of the new words learned , or the old words discussed , each accompanied by its definition , its possible derivation , its variations suggested'by different Gypsies and Gypsy scholars , and its practical application . There is no question that the lessons were not all " beer and ' baccy " for Natty . But there are other entries that explain how he managed to bear the strain . Sometimes , the pupil records , " I went with my professor to visit the Gypsies camped about Brighton far and near ; " and , by the time he left Brighton , a few months later , for Oatlands Park , the open road had become the usual classroom . At first , I fancy , the Rye hoped to continue his studies by correspondence . Otherwise , I can hardly explain a couple of letters which I have found among his papers . Both are undated ; but both , internal evidence proves , came from Gypsies at the Dyke . Here is the first , of which the second is practically but a repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happy to hear you was quite well also your friend Sir i have sorry to tell you that my poor sister is very ill i do not think she will be here long i can not tell you anything about Romui Chili in the letter but if you will come down to see me i have a little more to say to you as you know where i live and if i have not at home i ham aways up on the Dike i must thank you for telling me about my MphCWS so no more from your well wisher . Hosvever , the Romany university is all outdoors , and Natty was as much at home along the shores of the Thames as at the Devil 's Dyke . Indeed , he was best known as " the Windsor Froggie , " and Windsor is not far from Outlands Park , which , in its turn , is not far from Walton Bridge and the old willow tree through which some thirty years ago  --  alas , 1 can not say how it is now ? the blue smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of Gypsies as the flag floating from Windsor Tower is of royalty . And in all the country round about ? the country of the old church towers the Rye loved , rising over fringes of forest , of ancient castles with the village at their feet , of the river and bridge in the foreground ? Gypsies were forever coming and going . By the cool banks of the Thames , by the " turf-edged way , " they pitched their smoked tents , and in the little ale-house , at the country fair , on every near racecourse , the pupil was sure of finding his I 58 II on. , Brrilmann as Romany nye Romany professor or one or more of his tutors . The notebooks now are full of the sound of running water and rustling leaves ; the sun shines in them , the rain pours . Borrow , teaching Isopel Berners Armenian , was not freer of academic traditions than the Rye , taking his frequent lesson from Matte Cooper . Certainly , nothing could be farther from the methods of Harvard or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1873 : " Went . to the Bridge , but no Matty . Went to Joshua Cooper 's tent , ? not there . Finally found Joshua out of breath , who , having just been chased by a gavmo.11 policeman , escaped by throwing away the wood he was carrying home . ' Convey , the wise it So we had a long session and a very stormy one , ? the children squalling , the ( ; ypsirs chingering quarrelling , and old atty , as Head Dictionary , shutting them all up . Finally , young Smith , Sally Buck-land 's grandson , and another came to visit , and , after praising my great generosity , got a tringrushe shilling , and departed in a boat with a jug , returning joyfully , singing cheerful ,  - -  with three quarts , which made the Sabbath sweet unto them . During all the confusion , I extracted the following . " And the following means several pages of Romany words . Or here is another entry two days later : " Malty was waiting at the gate and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting on the way Ripley and Woking . . . . We got luncheon in Woking , Malty feasting 011 cold pork and I on beefsteak , hot baked ' taturs , bread and butter and ale . " And this was the day that . " as we got on , Matty became more excited , and when , after dusk we got near the Park , he began to sing jollity , " with is gay " Diddle dumpty dun Hurrah ! " a song all about the hunger of his children and the cold in his tent ; a subject which would hardly strike any one , save a Gypsy , as something to be particularly jolly about . But , the Rye adds , " I got the following words from him , " and there are ten pages of them . " I ran after the beagles , Malty of course was on the ground . " " Out with the beagles , meeting Gypsies . " " Another cold , frosty , bright morning , we started for Cobham , " ? are examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid succession . Not even English Gypsies have outgrown the primeval fashion of expressing gratitude through gifts , a fashion they brought with them from the East . Jasper Petulengro was as ready to lend Borrow the money to buy is horse , as the wild itano in Badajoz was to throw down befo ? e him the bursting pomegranate , his one possession . And the Rye 's friends were as eager to give him something as to take from him , and , words being about all they had worth giving . and what he most wanted , words were lavished upon hi m in the daily lesson , at every chance meeting , even by trinity messenger . It is amusing in the notebooks to come across such an entry as : ? " Christopher Jones , it half - breed Gypsy , but whose mother was a full-blood ( a Lee ) , and said to be deeply learned in old Gypsy , told Cooper to ask me if I knew that water was : called the born Dural . C. Jones had much intercourse with old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize the facts in the notebooks , however acquired . But it is the entries like this that please rne , the little memoranda , scribbled in pencil , meant no doubt to be rubbed out later , but left , fortunately , as witnesses to the friendly relations between the Rye in the born kelcheina ( big hotel ) and the Gypsies in their tent by the roadside . " Write to G. Cooper , " one of those entries says ; " ask if she has seen Louisa Lee , ? tell her her mother is dead . Oliver ill . Send your love . " And the Rye , gradually , came to lie looked upon as a sort of general newsagent and letter-writer for all the Romanies in the south ; and he must have accepted the trust with good nature , or lions Breifinatut as Romany Rye Ifitt an " ever loving friend " would not have written from the tents to charge him : ? " if you should see my boy again you ' night ask him where his sister is as i should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him if you see valentine Stanley you night give my love to him and tell him i should be glad to hear from him or his Brother at Any time and you might give my kind love and best wishes to Anybody that ask About me give my kind love and best Respects to your wife and neice sir if you should see any of the Smalls again plase to tell them there is some money left them By the death of their Aunt Eliza What Was in Australia the house is to be sold in taunton and the money is to be divided among her Brothers Children . " In the midst of all this hard work , ? or pleasant play , ? or rather when he first embarked upon it , the Rye 's thoughts naturally turned to Borrow . No one could then , or can ever again , see or hear of Romanies without thinking of Borrow . And Borrow was still living , ? not the magnificent , young , heroic Borrow , inviting wonder wherever he went , whatever he did , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old apple-woman on London Bridge , or drinking Leer at a wayside inn , translating the Bible into Mant-chu or distributing it to the heathen in Spain . ( By the way , only is few years ago , I SW the sign " G. Borrow , Agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society , " high up on a house in the Plaza Mayor , in Seville . ) But it was now the old Borrow , ill natured , grumpy , living like any city man in a respectable Brompton Square , passing his afternoons at the Savile Club ; still ready , however , to pose , if we can believe Groome , who saw him in the winter of 1873 . " He posed even to me , a mere lad , " Groome says ; as he had to old Esther Fan in Yetholm , or to Colonel Napier in Seville . But of this talent for grumpiness and for posing , the Rye was agreeably ignorant . All he knew was that Ile owed the sport he eared more for than any other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Borrow 's work has had an incredible influence over me , " lie wrote in his first letter , asking for an interview . Gypsy scholars who ( Mille after Borrow might , and did , point out flaws and blunders in his work , might had fault with his want of exactness , and the meagreness of his knowledge of Romany . I tremble when I think of his rage , could he read some of the letters now lying before me . And yet , I do not think there was one of them all who did not agree with Groome in ranking " George Borrow above every other writer on the Gypsies . " " To mystify " was Borrow 's game in life , ? a game which the Rye could also play , when he held a leading hand : and it is characteristic that , between them , they should have made their short acquaintance it problem as baffling as the Romany was before they gave the world the solution . The letter , to which I have referred , published by Mr. Knapp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 , 1870 . There is a second from the Rye , dated January , 1871 , ? both were written from Brighton , ? and Mr. Knapp , keener to detect the matter of fact than the unusual , finds in it proof that during the interval the desired meeting had taken place . And yet , the only letter from Borrow which I have found among the Rye 's papers , written as if no meeting had taken place , is dated November 2 , 1871 . It is from 22 Hereford Square , Brompton , and , though not enthusiastic , is at least not discouraging from the Borrow of those days . ? I have received your letter and am gratified by the desire you express to make may acquaintance . Whenever you please to come , 1 shall be happy to see you . Truly yours , GEORG 1,1 BORROW . This might settle matters , did not the Rye state in his Memoirs and again in The y psies ? without any date , of course , 160 Hans Breihnnun but 1870 is the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that he was introduced , by chance , to Borrow in the British Museum , where , afterwards , lie again net and talked several times with the " Nestor of Gypsyism . " Itol lam as ready to dispense with exactness in this matter as in Borrow 's philology. ' the main thing is that the younger Gypsy scholar did " once see Borrow plain , " ? can not you fancy them looking at each other " fixedly for a few moments " in the approved Romany Rye fashion ? that several meetings followed , and that the Rye , so far from being disillusioned , when he later gathered into a book all he had learned ma the roads offered the dedication of The English Gypsies to the man he looked up to as master . The letter carrying the offer was directed to the care of Murray , the publisher , who assured the Rye it must have reached Borrow , and this assurance is also in my pile of letters , ? the letters that tell me the whole story of those full years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public announcement , a few days later , of his Lava-Lit . When it came to interest in the Gypsy , Lavengro drew the line at himself . But hurry as Borrow might to throw together , anyhow , the words , stories , and names collected during long years , the Rye 's book came out first . I am not sure if The English Gypsies is remembered by a public dazzled by the melodramatic Romany of fiction , and incapable of appreciating its great learning . But in it the Rye also sings the joys of the road and of the things that make life sweet to the wanderer ; it has something of the undefinable charm of the Gypsy himself ; and what the public in the seventies thought is shown by the fact that the book went quickly into a second edition . What the Romany Ryes thought , they straightway sat down and wrote to tell the author , ? Mr. Hubert Smith , Dr. Bath Smart , Crofton , Groome , Palmer , one and all . When I look at the great A letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1872 1 as Romany Rye pile of their letters , carefully preserved , it strikes me as line of the little ironies of life that the Gypsy , smoking and dream ing his own life away , should have excited his lovers to such a delirium of industry , As I read these old letters , I wonder that the rest of the world could keep on plodding at its accustomed tasks and refuse to see that the Gypsy was the only thing of real importance in the world . I wish I had space for Groome 's letters , so charming are they , written with all the seriousness and enthusiasm of youth ; be was only twenty-three or twenty-four at the time ; but they would make a volume themselves . Those from Professor E. H. Palmer show that he could be no less irresistible as a friend than accomplished as a scholar . In 1874 , he and the Rye , with the further help of Miss Janet Tuckey , were hard at work collaborating , and to read Palmer 's letters is to believe that really there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to publish them afterwards in a volume ( English Gypsy Songs ) . Between Cambridge and London , those that were written flew backwards and forwards ; getting themselves criticised with a zeal scarcely short of fanaticism . In their behalf papers were " nobbled , " ? did n't " young Fred Pollock " write for the Saturday , and did n't he know well " Leslie Stephen of the Pall Mall " ? ? " I , like you , will do my damndest to make the book go , " Palmer writes with one of his reports of tried and suggested intrigue ! " I am more on for it than even for my Arabic Grammar , which is just out , and which has absorbed almost all my thought for these two years past .

Not that the excitement is at an end .

But , during the seventies , it seemed as if not only Groome , and Palmer , and Bath Smart , and Mr. Crofton , and Mr. Hubert Smith , but everybody who sent the Rye a letter , could write of nothing but Gypsies . One day it was George Boker , then Min- I heard the story more definitely . It was told me as a great secret . Her story was of a great kinsman of the Woods who lived across the water , of great height and fabulous wealth which he held in trust for the family , and with which he would even-tally endow them ; who spoke deep Romani as they did , who knew everything , who travelled everywhere . ' You met him at Aberystwyth , ' I said . ' Anglia Chart ' , " In the year 187 ?

I replied , saying that if they would read the enclosed letter to their client she would gather something of my intentions . The enclosed letter was in Romani . " When , after tell years , the Rye , in 1879 , crossed the Atlantic again , and found Philadelphia , in many ways , transformed almost out of recognition , there were Gypsies to keep Min from feeling a stranger in his native land . It was then I got to know the Romanies . Most people in those days ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Philadelphia 's only product .

And yet , to the Philadelphian , as to Borrow , " strange things " may every day occur , for America now , as well as the British Isles , is full of the people who bring adventure to one 's very doorstep . I was young , the convent not so many years behind me , and I was carried off my feet by the wonder of it all . A quarter of a century older as 1 010 minis , when i look back to those days I still see in North Broad Street . not the chief thoroughfare " up town , - where no correct Philadelphian would be " found dead , " but the path to the freedom of Oakdale Park , where the Costelloes camped in the early spring ; the dreariest West Philadelphia suburb becomes transfigured into the highway to Bohemia and its seven castles , though to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lovells pitched their dirty little brown tents ; the old thrill comes with the thought of the ferry where we embarked for Camden the Ineffable , and the Reservoir , and , under its shadow , Davy Wharton , the truest Gypsy of them all , who slept through the short crisp October days , while Sheva , his wife , begged and told fortunes in-the town . But there was no going anywhere , on any mailer-of-fact errand , without the happy risk of adventure . If I stepped into a street car , might I not , as sometimes happened , be greeted with the mysterious sarishan from Gypsy women carrying their day 's plunder home , while all the Gorgios stared ? In my own back yard , ? good Philadelphian for garden , ? or at my own front door , might I not run into a tinker , part if not all Gypsy , sharpening the family knives and scissors ? And on decorous Chestnut Street , were there not rare , but unforgettable , visions of strange wild creatures with flashing eyes and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons . striding along on First Day morning , past the quiet groups of Friends in plain coats and plain bonnets , ? beautiful beings , such as I had never seen before , but have since on the remote roads of Transylvania ? " Do you remember , " the Rye wrote me from Florence ( in 1892 ) , referring to these old days , " do you remember Rosanna Lovell , and how we took her a dgIckerin lit fortune-telling book and brought a thousand people out to see her ; and how Val Stanley sent out every tell minutes for beer , which we drank out of a moustache-cup , ? and the great tent with the Arab brass lamp , where the beer Was carried round in a watering pot ! ? aunt the old Rom Who apologised for the want of a view or scenery , and who offered a piece of tobacco for hospitality ' " ? Wiry , Philadelphia was all adventure , a town of " strange things . " The Rye had not lost in America Lis extraordinary faculty of inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread , as in England , even to iwople he did not know . Before long , on our expeditions , we were joined by an artist ,  --  he is now my husband ; many articles , for the Century principally , coming of those days when we were fellow explorers , and , also , I sometimes think , our life for the last twenty years together . Awl , almost as soon , Gypsy bulletins were dispatched front Boston , where Miss Abby Alger watched for the passing Romany , with the keenness of Groome iu GOttingen or Palmer in Cambridge . And , as promptly , we were hearing from our Gypsy friends of two rani runs ( young ladies ) down in Delaware , beautiful , rich , and real Romanies , ? one a Lee , ? talking deep Romany , though house-dwellers . We thought them myths for a while . But they , at the right moment , materialized , at first in a voluminous correspondence , eventually in person , when the rani rani , who was a Lee to the Romanies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing the ferry with us to that Lotus Land under the shadow of the Reservoir . But what now strikes me as the most curious evidence of the hold the Gypsy had taken of people 's imagination , is the ease with which Planchettc wrote Romany for a girl I knew , who , without its help , could not , or thought she could not , speak a word of the language . R adds to the picturesqueness of these memories that Walt Whitman should have a prominent place in them . We seldom could get to Camden and home again without meeting and talking with him . Sometimes we found him sitting in a big chair by the fruit stall at the foot of Market Street , gossiping with the Italian who kept it , eating peanuts , shaking hands with the horse-car drivers , whose stopping place was just in front . Sometimes he was leaving the ferryboat as we started , or stepping on it as we landed in Camden . Sometimes we paid him a visit in his brother 's house , where he lived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ile always wanted to hear about the Gypsies , though I fancied he was not quite in sympathy with our way of seeing them . It would not have been his way . Ile would rather have come across them by chance , not by design . In the memoranda of his life , left by the Rye to may care , there are some stray notes of these meetings with Walt Whitman , and I only wish I could make others realize all that they recall and suggest as I read them . " It seems so strange to me now 1893 ? to think that I used to walk with hint Walt Whitman and take drinks with him in small publics and talk of poetry and people , and visit him in his home with Elizabeth Robins ? long ago . There were always Gypsies camped about a mile from his house , and Elizabeth and I , going and coming , . . . used to meet him and tell him all that we had seen , which greatly interested the old Bohemian . I have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm . We had no idea in those days that we were making print . for the future . But we were really all three very congenial and Gypsyish . Whitman 's manner was deliberate and grave ; he always considered or ' took ' an idea ' well in ' before replying . He was , I think , rather proud of the portrait of an ancestor which hung in the parlor of his home . . . . One day , when I found him seated on a chair at the foot of Market Street in Philadelphia , by the ferry , a favourite haunt of his , lie was admiring a wooden statue of an Indian , a tobacconist 's sign . He called my attention to ib ? not as a work of art , but as something character- I. ions Breilmonn urn Romany Rye 11 ; 5 istie and indicative of national taste . I quite understood and agreed with him , for it had , as he saw it , an art value . It was a bit of true folk-lore ... . " Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met at the corner of Sailsom and Seventh streets . He took me into a very common little bar-room where there was a table , and introduced me to several rather shabby , common looking corn , not workmen , but looking like Bohemians and bummers . I drank ale and talked , and all easily and naturally enough , ? I had in my time been bon eastpagnon with Gypsies , tinkers , and all kinds of loose fish , and thought nothing of it all . But when we came forth , Whitman complimented me very earnestly on having been so companionable , and said Ire had formed a very different idea of MC ; in short , he did not know the breadth or my capacity . I had evidently risen greatly in his opinion . When my book on the Gypsies appeared , I , knowing that it would interest him , gave him a copy , in which I had written a short complimentary poem ; and , mindful of the great and warm gratitude which he had declared regarding My brother Henry , I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original verses , though it were only a couplet , in the copy of Leaves of Grass which he had sent to my brother . His reply was a refusal at which I should not have felt hurt , had it been gently worded or civilly evasive , but his reply seas to the effect that he never did anything of the kind except for money . His exact words then were , ' Sometimes when a fellow says to me : " Walt , here 's ten or five dollars , ? write me a poem for it , " I do so . ' And then , seeing a look of disappointment or astonishment in my face , he added , ' But I will give you my photograph and autograph , ' which he did . " After I came to England , in 1884 , the same year the Rye returned , I went on some expeditions with him to see the English Gypsies ; but not many . I was seldom in London in the summer during the few years he remained i a England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly made me long to see " the road before me . " But of these few expeditions , two stand out with startling vividness in my memory , and are very characteristic of him as Romany Rye . One was to the Derby . My only experience of what Mr. Henry limes calls the " popular revel " taught me little of the English people , ? its virtue in his eyes , ? most of my day being spent with the Wanderers who could teach me more of the East . What horses ran , I do not think I knew ; I am sure I did not look on at one race ; it is doubtful if I had a glimpse of the course . My confused memory is of innumerable Gypsy tents ; of more Romanies than I had ever seen together at any one moment in any one place ; of endless beer and chaff , of which 1 an afraid I did not consume or contribute my share ; of gay bouts in the cocoanut shies ; of the Rye for the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pride over his skill in winning them ; and of the day 's wonders culminating in what , to me , was the great event of that year 's Derby . I do n't know quite how it happened . We were passing late in the afternoon a tent which somehow we had missed in the morning , and we stopped to speak to the dye and the children playing around it . Almost at once , out of the tent came a young woman . It was in the days of " water waves , " and never had I beheld such an amazing arrangement of them on any one head . They and her face shone with soap and water . A bright new silk handkerchief was tied coquettishly about her neck . She smiled , and tripped on to greet a friend . In less time than I can write it , with hair streaming , handkerchief flying , face flowing with blood , she was struggling in the arms of the other woman , both swearing like troopers . " Hold hard ! " cried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down fell the cocoanuts , and he was between the two women , his great head and beard towering above them , blows and kicks falling upon him from either side like rain , for so quickly was it done that it took them a good minute to realize they were not pommeling each other . That ended the fight . But since then , I have understood Jasper Petulengro better ! " Rum animals . . . . Did you ever feel their teeth and nails , bro-ther The otherexpedition was to the Hampton Races , where I had any one memorable meeting with Matte Cooper , who was then very old , and very drunk , too , I regret to say , but were charming ; and where wore the carnations he presented me , as , at other tournaments , maidens wore the colons of their knights . From now onward , the Rye did not see so much of the Gypsies . And yet , never at any time , not even when collaborating with Palmer , was he so immersed in Gypsy matters as wilful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gypsy Lore Society was established . There was again a perpetual interchange of letters , an agitation , a fever , an absorption . The Romany Ryes all joined forces . Old grievances were forgotten , old disputes settled , old correspondences renewed . The credit for founding this society has been given to IV . J. Ibbetson , who , in answer to Colonel Prideaux 's question in Notes and Queries ( October 8 , 1887 ) as to whether any systematic attempt had been made to collect the songs and ballads of English Gypsies , suggested ( November 17 ) that a dub of Romany Ryes be formed to collect and publish by subscription as complete vocabularies and collections of ballads in the Anglo-American dialect as might be possible at that date . ' Dm matter was taken up by Mr. David MaeRitchie , to whom , eventually , fell the work of starting the society . At first the Rye did not respond with enthusiasm . He had proposed just such a society eighteen years before , and the little band of Gypsy scholars then , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Borrow also seas ) at the ap pearance of a new intruder in their field . " llis first letter on the subject to Mr. Maellitchie from Brighton , February 26. 1888 , was rather indifferent . He agreed that there " should be a Romany society to collect what is left of this fast vanishing people , " and he was quite willing to join and pay his guinea a year , but there most he no further responsibility , while he urged a greater exclusiveness than Mr. MacRitchie , with a necessary eye to the bank account , thought possible . " I do not insist on anything , but I have possibly had a little more experience than most men in funneling or watching such Clubs , and I will therefore give reasons for admitting only men who speak Romany . If such men only join , it will give the Society a marked character . The members will be able to do something and to work . A man who do n't know Romany may pay his guinea , but of what use will he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? To publish our works ! Wiry , if our works are worth printing at all , I can find a publisher who will do it all at his own expense . Now this is a fact . Half the works issued by Societies are rubbish , which the writers could not get printed , except by influence . . . . " I should prefer a small and poor society , but a real one , ? even with gypsies in it , ? to an amateur theatrical company . Pardon rue for speaking so earnestly , but I have been so sickened by my experience of clubs in which men were taken in for their money , that I would like to be in one which was real . " His indifference was not quite conquered even when Mr. MacRitchie , early in May , wrote to offer him the highest tribute it was possible for the Romany Ryes to offer . " Crofton and Groome and myself hope that you will also become our President , " Mr. MacRitchie tells him . " Before we send a prospectus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named , and there is no one so well fitted for the Presidentship as yourself . So I hope soon to Lear that you have accepted . We propose that Mr. Crofton be Vice President , and that I be Secretary and Treasurer . Groome has kindly agreed to divide my labours ( such as they are ) , but he firmly declines to appear as Secretary  --  or in any prominent position . " Later , however , Groome did appear as editor of the Journal with ' jr . Maeitehie . " Unless you can get along with my name alone , there will be very little use in proclaiming me as President , " is the Rye 's answer on May h . " I aim out of London and England ? or expect to be ? most of the time . . . . If my name will help I am willing to let it be used . " Of course his name would help , and so tr . MacRitchie assured him promptly , and I can see that his indifference began to be shaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of Romany spelling , which I wish , for my comfort mid my readers ' , had been settles ! years before . " Let the word be henceforward written Gypsies with a y , " he wrote to Mr. AlacRitchie on May 9 . " You caused me to write it so . If it comes from Egypt ? gypsies is right . " Seriously , let its come to some agreement as to orthography . Groome writes Ill ? I write Rye after Borrow , because he made Rye known . But I do n't like the Koashty of Smart , nor the forcing Romany words into strict English form . So far as we can make Romany agree with Continental , and especially with Indian pronunciation , we really ought to do so . We had better arrange all this en . famine . We ran ' rehabilitate ' Gypsy without manufacturing , if we will only be unselfish and hartnonious . " The society , it is trite , lasted only a short time , but while it did last it kept on . to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer of 1890 came the Folk-Lore Congress in Paris , and the Oriental Congress in Stockholm , and , with them , the occasion to flaunt the scholarship of the Romany Ryes in the face of the world . To the general public . learned congresses of learned men may seem dull things , but never in the letters of the Romany Ryes . In Paris the president figured as " Directeur de a Gypsylore-Society ; " he read a paper to prove that the Gypsies have been " the great colporteurs " of folk - lore , ? a phrase Groome later applauded , expanding the theory , ? he reported to Mr. Alael1itehie , on August 1 , 1889 : ? " Yesterday was a grand day for us . As T said , it has fallen on the Gypsy Lore Society to come to the front and take all the honour of representing England , as the English Folk-Lore Society has not appeared at all in it ! . . . In the evening Prince Roland Bonaparte gave an awful swell dinner ( Roumanian gypsy musicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as President of the G. L. S. I was seated at the Prince 's right hand . . . At any rate , we have had a stupendous lift , and with energy may do much more . Lord knows that I have tried my little utmost , not without sonic effect . " .. . In Stockholm , he worked for the society no less hard , ? I leave it to his letter to explain the " but , " and to throw an unexpected side light on the ways and woes of Orientalists assembled in solemn congress : " The Swedish Oriental Congress was one hundred times fuller of incident than the Paris one . It was awfully overdone , and turned into a great Oriental Circus , ? to its very great detriment as a learned body . We were rushed about and Rited and made a great show of , ? until I now loathe the very name of banquet , " recept ion . ' the sight of banners or hurrah-Mg thousands , fireworks and processions . We all got tired or fell ill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritable , ? and then they quarrelled ! My God , how they did quarrel ! ! I kept out of it all , ? but T 8111 awful glad to get home again . " But despite congresses , despite booming , despite the tremendous interest of I 68 idans Breitinann ax Brneflny Iiyc everybody in the society , by February of 1891 the impossibility of a much longer life was realized . The Journal actually ceased in 1892 , and with it all reasons for the existence of the society disappeared . " But the Gypsy question is not played out , " Mr. ladlitehieic wrote during the last mont hs . " It has ' ea end of things to say for itself yet .. i intend pegging away at the Gypsies for a long lilac to come , though of course avoiding Gypsomania . " The Rye , when he was enthusiastic about anything , was icier to be outdone in enthusiasm by any one . Ile , too , kept " pegging away . " Before the work of the society was over , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in formation , but concerned less with the Gypsy himself than with Gypsy superstitions . He now promptly undertook a Gypsy Dec ( 1,7E01 ' 011 , and finished it , too , with the name changed to Romany Wit and 1Visikon , but never got so far as to publish it ; the manuscript lies with all his other Gypsy papers , a marvelous collection . He planned a record of the Romany Ryes of Great Britain and their work , " especially to please them , " he wrote to me at the time . But they all shrank back , afraid of the critic , and he had to give up the idea . And the Gypsy still filled his letters . He kept on writing to Mr. MaeRitchie , though at longer intervals ; he renewed the long interrupted correspondence with Groome ; he found a new correspondent in Mr. Sampson , who , when not writing of his wanderings with the Gypsies on Welsh roads , was sending his Romany translations of Heine and OmarKhayyam , and once of Gaudearaus , the Rye having long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sing it around our camp-fire in the evening , " Mr. Sampson adds . Nor could the Rye keep the Gypsy out of his letters to me . The almost in evitableending of them all is " Tiro Korn - Is Koko " ( your affectionate Uncle ) , and , wherever he went , lie had Gypsy adventures to report to me , sure of my sympathy . NOW it was at the Bagni di Lucca , where " down in the valley I met a band of Piedmoutese Gypsies . They denied being Gypsy , and did n't know a word of Romany . Indignantly pointing to the horse . I said , ' How do you call that ? ' And the answer was ' Grai . " Yes , ' gaolli and thou an mannsch roan , in adorn se a ehava , Ic me shorn o born Romani Rai ' land that is a boy , and I am a great . Gypsy gentleman . Then we got on very well . " Now it was in Geneva , and a French Gypsy woman told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small shell tied up in leather which was received with boundless gratitude . I also described eloquently the value of the shell as a bringer of bacht " luck . Now it was at Innsbriick , where , lonely , without the companionship he always craved , " I met a charming van full of Romanys three days ago , and almost cried for joy . " NOW it was at Homburg , the last place to suggest that sort of society , but , ? " I met with a real Gypsy family in a beer garden , day before yesterday , and had a gay time . " And so it went on to the very last year of his life ( the last quotation I give is as recent as 1899 ) . I have said enough , however , to show what the Gypsies meant to him all his life long , once he got to know them ; how much more his interest was than the passing " fad " he never forgave any one for calling it . He loved them as a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such good purpose that , when they have vanished forever from the roads , they will still live and wander in the pages of his books . Even if Borrow had never written , the Romany would be immortalized in The English Gypsies and The Gypsies .
