txt Something so closely resembling a. riot that it would have taken an expert to tell it from the real-thing occurred at Third Avenue and Seventy-ninth Street last night at an anti-Featherson primary meeting . During the two hours that the meeting lasted , sticks and stones , as well as overripe muskmelons , ' were thrown ; it was necessary for reserves from two police stations to be summoned , and the Police were compelled to frequently charge into the crowd and take some disturber into custody . At one time the prong became so demonstrative that hall it not been for the presence of a line of police directly in front of the platform , It would undoubtedly have overrun the stand . The meeting was one held by the Minnisink Club , the new Tammany organization of the Twentieth Assembly District , which has as a candidate for the Democratic leadership Edward V. Nicholson , a mechanical engineer . The disturbers were professedly members of the Cherokee Club , the Featherson organization , the clubhouse of which is but a block distant . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would I see that the strong-arm men , or " guerillas , " were allowed to vote . Robert Culhane , Vice President of the new club. was the Chairman of the meeting . The trouble started the minute the band stopped playing and he began to speak . Notwithstanding the fact that the crowd numbered a full 400 , there were less than a dozen policemen present . Before Mr. Culhane had finished his short speech ten more policemen arrived in a hurry . The first came from the East Sixty-seventh Street Station , and the reinforcements from the East Eightyeighth Street Station . Shower of Stones for Speakers . Culhane 's speech was not of a character calculated to create any disturbance , but , nevertheless , a shower of small stones fell on the platform , one of them hitting Daniel F. Cohalen , Chairman of the Tammany Law Committee , on the hand . The Feathersonians down in front would not let Cuihane get in a word edgewise . John O'Connell , a member of Featherson 's slub , and who , it is expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speaker a liar every- time he opened his mouth , and while the crowd surged around the platform it kept up a continual yelling for Featherson . When the police reinforcements arrived Lieut . O'Day and ten men made a flying wedge and went into the crowd after O'Connell . They got him , but the crowd which was with him put up a fight , and the whole lot of pollee , with their prisoner , were forced back on the sidewalk and up against the wall . Then fifteen of them drew their nightsticks and went at the mob , which scurried back , falling over themselves to get out of the way of the clubs . " Do n't arrest that man , officer , " shouted Cohalen from the platform . " MeCiellan 's Police Commissioner , Bingham , will transfer you to Staten Island if you do . " Apparently the police took the advice , for , followed by a good part of the mob , they took O'Connell down in front of Featherson 's clubhouse , warned him not to return , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Crowd was fairly orderly . When former Senator Marks began to speak , however , he was constantly interrupted , called all sorts of names ; and made a target for small sticks . What he said could scarcely be heard ten feet away . He asked for fair play , but the crowd did n't give it to him . " - When Featherson went to see the Mayor after ho had been removed as Dock Commissioner , the door was shut in his face , " said Marks . " You 're a liar and I 'll smash yo face ! " cried one man , and the crowd , ek up the cry and surged forward . ) Had there been no police between it and the platform the crowd would have carried out its threat . As it was the police drew their night sticks again and the crowd fell back . Colialan , when he rose to speak , got the better of the crowd , lie - called for questions , and , having facts at his finger ends which the other speakers did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Featherson , " he said , " he said that Featherson was dishonest and not fit to hold office under a Democratic administration . Now Featherson asks you to support McClellan . It 's up to you . Either you are standing for a man who is not fit to hold office or else McClellan is a liar or Featherson is no man at all to ask you to support him . " Just at this point an over-ripe section of a melon came hurtling upon the platform . The police hurried to the place where it appeared to have been thrown from , and just then another section and a few stones fell on the stand . A Shot That Told . " Talk about Murphy going outside of the organization to nominate a Governor , " shouted Cohalen , seizing the opportunity ; " look at the Police Commissioner febm Washington that McClellan has given you and who can not make the police keep order at a meeting like this . " The shot told , and for a while the crowd kept still . " Look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Four years ago he was an enrolled Republican in Buffalo . Look at the Mayor 's secretary ; three years ago he was an enrolled Republican in Buffalo . Look at the Dock Commissioner from Jersey ; look at the Street Cleaning Commissioner , who Is the Dock Commissioner 's brother . " George Schwegler , former Assemblyman , who resigned recently to become Secretary to the Board of Elections , got into action at this point . He called the speaker a liar and defied him to prove many of his statements . Cohalen went on : " You can bring In fifty strong arm men for every one you have now ; you can bring up a whole corps of guerillas , but I tell you the people of this district are going to decide this thing , and the strong arm men wo n't get a chance . " " You can bet - your life we 'll see to it that the strong arm men cast the votes , " shouted some one . The remark came from the section of the crowd where Schwegler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not made it . The disturbance kept up as long as the meeting lasted , and no speaker , after Cohalen , got much of a chance to be heard . Two or three disturbers were jerked out of the crowd by the pollee , but were let go .
