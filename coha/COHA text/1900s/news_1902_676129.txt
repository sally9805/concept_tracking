txt Undoubtedly the failure of the Government to secure the extradition of GAYNOR and GREENE amounts to a miscarriage of justice . But it is difficult for a fair-minded American to read the report of the decision of Judge CABON without having to acknowledge that the responsibility for the miscarriage rests upon our own shoulders . Assuming that the facts are as the learned Canadian Judge states them , it was wholly out of his power to return the , men to the justice of their own country without a manifest and indecent wresting of the law in favor of " international comity , " a procedure which may sometimes be necessary , but is never defensible . Indeed , the case seems to have been thoroughly and persistently bungled . The Department of Justice has no reason whatever to be proud of the agents it has employed .

They gave the Canadians the notion that what they were after was not justice according to law , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to Compound a felony . Such a procedure is with such difficulty to be distinguished from blackmail that it is no wonder the Canadian authorities and the Canadian public refused to make the mental effort necessary to establish the distinction . The whole performance has been far from creditAle to " this our Nation . " Of course , GAYNOR and GREENE admit that they are a pair of thieves . They admitted it by running away .

At present he is undergoing a , very mild punishment for his real offense ofsrnirchingthe bright record of the Corps of Engineers and making his countrymen sorrowfully admit that even a West Point education is not a complete guarantee against lying and stealing , Meanwhile , GAYNOR and GREENE are not enviable people . They are exiles and self-branded thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life in those discouraging circumstances , no matter with how much " swag " one may have managed to escape .
