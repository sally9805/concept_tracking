txt Signor ERNESTO BIONDI is rash with the perfervidness of a sculptor scorned when he attacks American architecture , sculpture , and painting in one sweeping burst of disgust . His indictment of a nation must instantly react on his own lovely land and cause one to ask whether Italy is any better off . Has Italy any sculptors , for instance , that rank with half a dozen of our men ? And was it wise for a sculptor who has nothing more ideal to show us than the " Saturnalia , " a combination of technically clever figures strung out in a line , but very far from ideal in conception and execution , to make an onslaught which was sure to force comparisons that can not result happily for his own work and that of his fellow-sculptors at home ? It may be that the Metropolitan Museum was ill-advised to have failed to carry out its contract with Signor BIONDI , and one is ready to make all the excuses possible for the chagrin he feels at the slight thus put upon him . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Saturnalia " has been exaggerated , and while it is obviously unfair to say that the group is immoral , he should make allowance for the notorious indiscutability of taste . He is right in complaining of his treatment by the Museum , but wrong in running amok through the ranks of American artists . They can stand it far better than he can . His intemperate words recoil on his own head , for in his wrath he overshoots the mark . The only thing for Signor BIONDI to do at present is to bide the time when he can exhibit the " Saturnalia " and allow the public to decide whether the inaction of the Museum was justified or not . No prejudice was felt against him , either in person or as an Italian . The Museum only acted as the Directors thought it their duty to act . It is not likely that they were swayed by any protest on the part of the Fine Art Federation ; that has never been their course . It is with them , not the American art world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of themselves .
