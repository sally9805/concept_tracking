txt The hearing to-day before Gov . Odell upon the Costello Employers ' Liability bill was remarkable both for the strong language used and for the incidents which attended it . It indicated a wide and a deep interest in the legislation . There were strong delegations present to argue both for and against the bill . Those who appeared against the bill were Attorney Charles Steckler and Attorney Franklin Pierce of New York City . Attorney W. E. Woolward of Albany , ex-Senator Wray , Abram Daly . and Rufus C. Maltby , representing the Brooklyn Bar Association ; Samuel T. Hull and George W. Alger , representing the Central Federation of Labor and the Iron Molders ' Union . and John T. Lavery , representing the Legislative Committee of the State Federation of Labor . Those who appeared in favor of the bill were James E. Clark of Binghamton , V. I. Martin of Hornellsville , J. Harris and W. C. Wish of Albany , J. J. Winters of Brooklyn , and A. N. Youngs of Oswego , representing the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers : Prof. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company ; Lewis E. Carr , counsel for the Delaware and Hudson Railroad Company ; William P. Rudd , counsel for the New York Central Railroad Company . J. St. Andrews , representing the Order of Railway Conductors , and Assemblyman Costello , who introduced the bill . RAILWAY COMPANIES ACCUSED . Mr. Steckler. who made the opening argument against the bill , said : " This is the most iniquitous piece of legislation ever enacted in this State . It is misnamed . It ought to be called a bill to deprive the people of their rights . Through chicanery and fraud , a bill which by its titre is supposed to have relation only to employers and their employes is made to affect every man , woman , and child in the State . Through the efforts of the street railway companies there has been inserted into this bill five words which affect the rights of all the people .  --  These words are ' or In any other case , ' and are used in connection with the requirement of sixty days ' notice of cause , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit is to be brought .. I challenge you to refer to any call from any source for this radical change in the law affecting recovery for injuries sustained . " Early in the session there was a bill introduced in the Assembly by Assemblyman Weekes which contained the plain , bald proposition of requiring-sixty days ' notice of damage suits . The bill was denohnced on every eWe . Mr. Weekes , when asked about it . saidehe had introduced it by request , that he did not approve of it . and ? that it would never get out of his committee Some time after that I met Mr. Weekes in the Fifth Avenue Hotel . I spoke to him about his bill . He said to me , ' You will never hear of that bill getting out of committee , but watch out ; the railroads want that legislation , and they will sneak it into some other bill before the session is over . ' A few nights before this bill passed the Senate I met the representative of one of the greatest street railroad corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me : ' It was very kind of Senator Brackett to take charge of that Employers ' Liability hill for us . ' What do you think of that ? The iepresentative of a great street railroad corporation expressing his gratitude to a Senator for helping along a bill which was supposed to extend the liability of corporations , Every line of this bill is a benefit to the corporations . Not only does it not give the employes any new rights , but it takes away from them rights which they have already . " LAWYERS OPPOSE THE MEASURE . Mr. Steckler cited many instances of the hardship which the bill would cause to persons having cause of action against corporations . He cited the case of a foreigner who might be killed in this country and whose relations might not learn of his death for sixty days after he had been killed . Mr. Steckler said if the Governor would wait a week before acting on the bill he would have before him protests from 05 per cent . of the lawyers in New York City and nearly 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing the Brooklyn Bar Association , said : - There is nothing of a legislative nature before you equal in importance to this bill . It affects people - who are not here and who can not be here . When I read in your message a recommendation for the enactment of an Employers ' Liability bill . I said . ? Thank God , there comes from the Executive of the State an impure for humanity . ' Is this to be the result of that recommendation ? This measure which takes away from the whole people rights of recovery which they now have ? Suppose the corporation plays a trick upon the person injured and he serves notice upon the wrong party , are his rights to be swept away after sixty days ? t'nder this bill an employe must give written notice if any piece of machinery is out of order . If he does n't , his rights are gone . Think of men engaged in large factories engaged in such business . The bill is so foul that it smells to heaven . It seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not heard one good word spoken for it . " Mr. Daly then read the resolutions of the Brooklyn Bar Association denouncing the bill . The resolutions set forth that it was inconceivable how , under the bill , any action for damages against an employer could ever be maintained . Attorney Franklin Pierce said there was not a line in the bill which extended the liability of the employers in any practical form . - There is one section of this law . " I , continued . " which has never been paralleled in the whole history of jurisprudence . It is the section which relates to a man wee has been made insane by reason of an injury and is dependent upon a relative to give notice of suit for hint . If a relative does not give notice for him within sixty days the injured man loses all right of action upon the recovery of his reason . Could anything more unjust than that be conceived ? You may search the laws of the world for iniquitous provisions , and you will find none that will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blackness of that . The wrongs that this bill would permit upon the weak and helpless of society would cry to heaven for reparation . " OPPOSITION BY LABOR MEN . W. E. Woolward of Albany said he spoke for 240,000 organized working men of the State in opposition to the bill . George E. Alger , representing the Central Federation of Labor and the Iron Molders ' Union , called attention to the fact that under the terms of the bill notice must be given in ten days in certain cases , or right to sue was lose He cited a supposed case of a man who was injured by a truck . If the man retained his mental faculties for ten days after the accident and died on the eleventh day without having given notice of action to the corporation , the right of his family to sue would be gone . " Your Excellency , " said Mr. Alger , " there was never a more criminal attempt to foist damnable legislation upon the people than this I would rather be charged with any crime on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author of this bill . " When Mr. Alger made this sensational declaration he turned and faced Assemblyman Costello , the reputed author of the bill . Rufus C. Maltby , Samuel T. Hull , and John T. Lavery followed in opposition to the bill . Mr. Lavery said the bill did not have the indorsement of the Federation of Labor . COSTELLO'DEFENDS HIS BILL . Mr. Costello , in opening the argument in favor of the bill , said it was due to himself to give en explanation of the origin of the bill . It was , he said , a compromise measure . It represented the result of three years ' effort to get capital and labor together upon the subject of an employers ' liability bill . " This bill , " said Mr. Costello , " was framed at the conference between Messrs . Lavery and McCabe of the Legislative Committee of the Federation of Labor , their attorney , Mr. Danaher . Prof. Cohn . Lewis Carr , counsel for the Delaware and Hudson , and William P. Rudd , counsel for the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eyck . Every line of this bill was gone over by the representative I of the Federation of Labor . If Mr. Lavery had made the objections then which he makes to-day there would have been no bill . " Mr. Costello then went over the various features of the bill . The main idea of the bill , he said . was to prevent accidents by providing for greater caution . " Who suggested putting in those words ' Or in any other case ? ' " asked Mr. Steckler . Mr. Costello said he did not care to discuss that . " Now , you want to be fair about this matter , do n't you ? " said Mr , Steckler . " Well . if you do . answer my question . Did any representative of labor suggest putting in those words ? " Gov . Odell said the hearing must proceed in order , and that Mr. Costello should be allowed to make his own explanation . Mr. Steckler could be heard again later . MR .. COLIN EXPLAINS . Mr. Colin said he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , he said , after he got into it he was gratified as a citizen at the way in which the compromises between the conflicting interests were effected . " This bill . " Prof. Colin continued , " does add to the liability of the employer . There can be no question whatever about that . This sixty-day-notice provision , about which such complaint is made ; is a perfectly proper ? rcvi-sion . Its purpose is to protect the general public by having the defect to which the accident was ' due-remedied . Is there . anything unjust in asking a person to inform his adversary that he has a cause of action against him ? That is recognized as fair dealing between Man and man . - Once this bill is on the statute books it will inevitably be extended . I am not here to advocate it . but . having taken Part in its formulation , it was due to your Excellency that I should tell just what part I did take . " Who suggested the insertion of these words ' Or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you say , you do n't know ? " " Yes , I do know , " said Prof. Cohn . " Well , you tell who did then , " said Mr. Steckler . " I will not , " replied Prof. Cohn , with a show of anger , Lewis Carr said there was nothing in the bill which justified the charge that those responsible for it were guilty of a crime . There was no reason to believe that the sixty days ' notice requirement would shut out anybody who held a just claim . The lawyers would take care of that . " Why , wherever any accident occurs , " he continued , " those lawyers swarm as eagerly to the scene as honey bees to a buckwheat field . " The people would be amazed , he added , if they knew how many manufactured cases the negligence lawyers brought . There was a limitation on recovery for fire insurance , then why not against a railroad company ? William P. Rudd , counsel for the New York Central . said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think it is only decent and fair for me to say that the representatives of organized labor agreed to every line and every punctuation mark in this bill . This bill is not what we would have , but having given my consent to it as a compromise I am here to stand by my action . " LABOR MEN SUPPORT THE BILL . A. N. Youngs , representing the Brotherhood of Engineers , said his organization wanted to bring about an understanding between labor and capital . There were two sides to every question . He thought the bill was a fair bill . J. St. Andrews , representing the Order of Railway Conductors , said his order was highly in favor of the Costello bill . J. J. Winters , for the Brotherhood of Engineers , made a speech , which was so humorous that it caused even the Governor to abandon his gravity and indulge in laughter Referring to the fact that some of those who spoke in opposition had dwelt upon cases in which the ' injured became insane , he said that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the negligence lawyers . " This bill . " he said , " will make accidents less likely to occur . In that respect it will be a blessing to the workingmen , but it will hurt the business of the negligence lawyers . " Mr Steckler was heard for five minutes in conclusion . He said that if ' Gov . Odell signed the bill he would do himself and his party more injury than by any other blunder he could make . " You will observe , your Excellency , " he said . " the significant fact that while this bill is supposed to be in the interest of labor its only advocates here are those who are paid by railroad companies , ether as counsel or as employes . All other branches of labor except railroad employes denounce it . " Mr. Steckler 's parting shot was : " Sign this bill and give an issue to your enemies ! "
