THERE exists an impression that American hospitality is in a bad way . To a certain extent the foreboding justifies itself . Any one can see that the lavish , unquestioning welcome of a primitive community to all claimants has well-nigh vanished ; it lingers only on the frontiers ; it is disappearing even from the South . In the cities , we keep our houses for ourselves and for our friends , especially our previously-invited friends . Nevertheless , among one class of Americans the tendency is for hospitality to grow freer and more diffuse . Nowhere is there a readier or  --  if one may so express it  --  more luxuriant hospitality than among very rich Americans . They fill their country-houses every summer . The travelling foreigner has some ado to save his digestion from their multitude of dinners . And the fashionable custom of always laying extra covers at luncheon for possible guests , speaks loudly for their ever-ready cordiality . Nowhere , too , is the entertaining more genuine , cheerful , or informal . Unhappily this , charming hospitality stops with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses to their friends . The rest of us are apt rather to bar them , taking down the bars only on special occasions and with due formality . We still have to give the members of our own and our husband 's immediate families bread and lodging , though no invitation have summoned them . But other people we keep civilly at arm 's length . Our transient hospitality is as rigid . We do not like to have guests on the spur of the moment . How many husbands , for instance , venture to bring a friend home with them as often as inclination prompts I Men are hospitable by nature . They enjoy unceremonious entertaining . It pleases them to display their wives and children and houses . But , commonly , their wives are of quite another mind . The luckless husband is apt to run full tilt against some sacred household ordinance of washing , or ironing , or baking , with the saddest results to the family peace . His rash and ignorant good feeling hurries him into invitations and makes him forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a day fittingly observed by a semi-fast , or that it is Tuesday , when we iron , or that a dressmaker is in the house , and all the week must be spared . But enlightenment comes soon . A succession of catastrophes teaches him a wise timidity . He grows wary through tribulation . The chances are so much against his hospitality hitting a day when no harm will be done , that he gives up asking his friends to risk them . Instead , if he lives in a large city and can in any wise afford it , he joins a club and takes his friends there . If he lives in the smaller towns , he can only gratify his sense of the obligations of good-fellowship , in a saloon , by " setting up the drinks . " Neither of these alternatives is to most wives ' taste ; but they are the popular alternatives just the same . Hospitality , then , would not appear to have waned among men ; it has merely changed its form  --  and its place . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are indefatigably hospitable ; to be a delightful hostess is part of every " great lady 's " social equipment . Behold a mystery . Here is one class of women actively promoting hospitality , and another class ? many of them the equals of the first in everything save money  --  stubbornly though silently narrowing its limits . The mystery , however , is shallow . When all is said , hospitality is a sort of barbaric virtue only half acclimated in civilized climes , and thriving best among the class that has the nearest approach to the barbaric leisure and recklessness . The barbaric welcome is fascinating , but , after all , it costs the barbarian little . The coming of a stranger is a pleasant break in a monotonous life . The barbarian has plenty of time on his hands ; generally he has a rude plenty of provision and service ; when he has not , he is too reckless of the morrow to be troubled , and shares his last crust with a stranger without dread of future hunger . Just how much improvidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ; but , certainly , most of the hospitable races have been improvident  --  which holds true with the civilized as well as the barbarians . Take the Scotch Highlander , or the Irish peasant , for example . Now , the whole tendency of industrial civili zation is to make men more provident . At the same time life constantly becomes more orowded ; compared with an Arab sheik , all we civilized people are in a hurry . So it happens that we are at once too prudent and too busy to be barbarously hospitable . The single class prwsPssing the barbaric requisites for hospitality  --  recklessness and leisure  --  is the very rich : they are hospitable . There is another reason , possibly going deeper . One result of the generally diffused ambition of Americans is a general pretence . We all hope for better things than we enjoy , and meanwhile most of us try to seem to have captured more of them than we have . This pretence is a very deadly foe to hospitality . Barbarians are comparatively free from it ; ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes " or " company manners . " The very rich resemble the barbarians , making little change in their manner of living for ordinary guests . But the average American woman is always struggling to live better before the outside world than she can before her own household . She " makes a difference " for " company . " Hence these tears . As a rule she has too few servants for the work of her house ; and " making a difference " involves additional work , which , flung on already overburdened shoulders , reacts on the servant 's temper much as it would on that of any one else . Thus she comes to dread her husband 's thoughtless hospitality , liable to light on Mondays , Tuesdays , or that awful season when the house is , as it were , recreated and goes into a preliminary chaos . In truth it is her lack of service , not her lack of kindliness , which makes her less hospitable than her rich acquaintance with the extra covers at luncheon . She has no leisure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or two or one servant as does a woman with six . The disproportion , often , between the house , the dress , the table , and the service of an Aiiierican family , especially outside the great cities , is something appalling . All over the land are women with large houses and a single maid-servant . The woman 's husband is not poor , and the house is expensively furnished . Perhaps there are three or four children . By economy and clever observation , and doing dreadful things to her back over a sewing-machine , she contrives to dress her children and herself as " stylishly " as does her richest neighbor . This is a triumph . A triumph , also , is her little feast when she opens her doors to invited friends . But at other times the labor of the household is so ingeniously parcelled out that there are no spare chinks of time or thought for idle , aimless , unrequited hospitality . Doubtless there is much to be said for this hard-working creature 's refusal to do more than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIRGINIA . NOVEMBER , 1882 . THERE are great new piers , storehouses , and coal-dumps at Newport News , and around them the dwellings of the workmen , with plenty more going up . The place has become a railway terminus , and , having deep water for ships without the annoyance of a bar for them to pass over , is to be made a ' great port . It is no longer an argument for not making a place a port that it is not one already . The age of short lines to tide-water and quick seizure of points of vantage on all our coasts has arrived . The stir at Newport News recalls that going on contemporaneously at San Diego , at the other extreme of the continent , though the enterprise there is at present not quite in the same hands . The Chesapeake &; Ohio is a " Huntington line , " just as thefts are elsewhere Gould lines and Vanderbilt lines . Huntington , President already of the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific Roads , is anxious to have a transcontinental line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , buying and leasing there , and en route establishing a thriving city named after himself on the Ohio River , he bids fair to accomplish it , and that very briefly . He will make complete connections across the Southwest , running by way of Richmond , Louisville , Memphis , and Little Rock , with his Southern Pacific Road in Texas . Newport News will be the eastern terminus at tidewater of his new short line , and , as things have gone in the past , it is difficult to see how a city can fail to spring up there . And later on , if this should be accomplished , with so flourishing a city as Norfolk on the opposite side of the wide mouth of the James , and the favorable anchorage and climate , it will be according to all precedent if many important settlements should arise all round the circle of these waters . Our train follows nearly the line of Keyes 's advance , when he moved out in command of McClellan 's left wing , keeping near to the bank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was my first visit to the country , and I confess that these war memories interested me more than anything else . There is very little actual provender for them along the way at this distance of time . I found a one-armed Virginia colonel in the train who was willing to talk a little about them , and I carried a copy of Webb 's ' Peninsula ' in my satchel , but they proved equally uninteresting . Here and there , as at Zee Hall , was a slight vestige of earthworks , gloomy mounds like beaver-dams , set between the trees of the forest along some brook or depression in the ground . It is at such points  --  a ' ravine , a morass , or petty bridge  --  that men die in war , filling up with their bodies the inequality ef surface , as in a circuit of electricity the deadly spark of havoc leaps forth most fiercely where the direct way of communication is interrupted . At quaint old Williamsburg , the seat of royal power in the colony of Virginia , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . ' There is an attractive glimpse of sundry steeples and gambrel roofs , some of which seem green with moss . The railroad does not take pains to ! go too close to its curiosities , but , after the manner of the Levite more than the good Samaritan , passes them by on the other side . It is said that the Williamsburgers , content with their traditions of two hundred and fifty years , at first ' objected to the railroad , but they are now highly reconciled to it . The face of the country can not have changed a great deal since the war . The railroad has some new stations , endowed with such names as Argenta and Oreana , which seem squite in the forest primeval . The Peninsula , in fact , has been more shunned by immigrants than some other parts of Virginia , on account of its having been early made an especial rendezvous and paradise of the colored people . They flocked into it when Butler held command at Fortress Monroe , and have never since gone away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side , scratch the ground for some small corn-patches on the large , unimproved estates , and principally , if their white neighbors may be believed , " trifle " and ' " frolic . " We met the Chickahominy , in a lake-like bend partly veiled by pine-trees , at a station called Lenexa ; then were presently crossing the battle-field of Seven Pines , at Fort Lee . It is a good fighting country this , for the tactics of regular warfare  --  level and clear but for a short scrub growth which must have come up since . There is a redoubt of red earth and the stylish new station of the railway to look at . Whoever would have realizations of the carnage of the Titanic contests hereabout , must draw them principally from his own imagination . I advanced upon Richmond with much greater ease than the predecessors we have been considering , yet I can not honestly call it a great prize to enter into the possession of . It does not correspond with preconceived ideas of the capital of a great State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should call Richmond at present a rather shabby-genteel place , though it must be remembered that a part of it was burned and rebuilt . The best hotel is a very poor one ; there are no large trees in the streets , and there is an absence in the dwellings , even those of the better class along the fashionable thoroughfares of Franklin and Grace Streets , of that air of genial breadth and comfort which has been supposed to be characteristically Southern . It is surpassed even by Norfolk in this respect . On the other hand , the modernness by which this is replaced is of the most cold and tasteless pattern . Rents are high in Richmond , I was told ; it has now its eighty thousand people , and it presents along the James River a scene of active manufacturing in the departments of iron , of flour milling and warehousing , but it needs nothing so much as either a going back to old Southern traditions in the matter of building , or a start in that modern architectural and decorative movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . I went to see Libby Prison . It is a fertilizer factory now , with an undesirable odor . There is no dungeon air about it . It is a long , stout brick building , once used as a tobacco factory , and rows of stout square posts uphold its three floors . It was only necessary to clap gratings over its windows , and there was a prison ready. - made . One could camp out there for a night or two with a pallet , or even a blanket , comfortably enough . The hardship would be in the duration of it . There are some rude checker-boards marked out on the floors on which the captives cast themselves down , and vestiges of a tunnel through which eighty of them made their way out , coming up through a horse-stable and taking to the fields . The visitor need not fear to intrude . The place has become , in connection with the fertilizer industry , one of the few show places in this poor modern America of ours , and there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , he says , some old inmate comes back to muse again upon the scene of his incarceration . They tell him all sorts of anecdotes , and he writes them down in a book , which he says he intends to have published . I resisted the temptation to represent myself as a returned veteran , but endeavored to ingratiate myself in the next most effectual way by purchasing for an exorbitant price a good-for-nothing lithograph , with which a splinter of the floor was thrown in . Belle Isle , again , is a mere bare islet in the river , with a knoll in the centre and the pier of a railroad bridge resting upon it . Hollywood Cemetery looks down upon Belle Isle . In this cemetery one of the most dignified monuments I ever saw has been erected by simply piling up a great pyramid of rough , uncemented stones , and training ivy upon it . It is to the memory of the Confederate dead . A great Confederate lies buried elsewhere , at the top of the principal slope of the place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying upon it . " Maj.-Gen . J. E. B. Stuart , " the lettering reads on the granite shaft , " Confederate States Cavalry , Wounded May 117 died May 12 , 1864 . Aged 31 years . " The oak leaves were drifting down , and thick under foot ; there were red holly berries to . be seen among their glossy dark-green leaves ; a Jacqueminot rose or two was yet in bloom , and it was very quiet there . Such fire and dash lying so still and unresisting tinder that bit of mound ! The select club of Richmond is the Westmoreland , which occupies one of the few large old houses , and manages to keep up it certain stately air , while some one or two others have but a poor existence . There is to be seen on the walls of the club a portrait of this " Jeb " Stuart , which rep ; resents him with a long sandy beard , costutned in gray , with a peculiar kind of backwoods ' dash , not unlike our own Custer in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of level road , by a reservoir , with white fences around it , and a race-track at one side for extra fast going . People go up one side of the short boulevard and down the other , and repeat . There are said to be more teams , in proportion to the population , in the place than almost anywhere else , but they are not often elegant , and the roads are very dusty . I went from Richmond to Charlottesville . There had been a spatter of snow and hail in the afternoon ; and though it passed over , so that we saw Louisa Court-House and other small stations , of which Gordonsville is the largest , and the pleasant-looking country about them , by moonlight , it was still cold . The old negro who showed me to my room at the hotel spoke of it as a good night to sleep in a feather-bed , calling my attention to the fact that I had one . I walked all over Charlottesville at once , stretching my legs before retiring , as , I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was sunk in profound slumber at half-past nine , the hour of arriving . Only a light.or two burned in some of the large brick houses which looked imposing in the dark . They were less imposing by daylight , but still comfortable . Charlottesville has made a good deal of money in its time frein tobacco . It is doing something now , also , in wine-growing . There is at one part of the town a sort of little plaza containing a rusty old yellow-washed court-house , with a classic portico and a Dutch cupola painted green . The shabby brick buildings around it had their shutters up for the most part , and seemed to be in the occupation of negroes . Jefferson once practised in the court-house . Saddle-horses were tied to the fence-posts , and rusty country lawyers with a self-satisfied air were seen going in and out cf the offices . Charlottesville contains the University of Virginia , a really charming place , without reservation , which I am glad to have seen . It is a little out of the town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the buildings a story higher than the inner . They are in red brick , profusely colonnaded with white columns , and date from 1825 . The main interior quadrangle is particularly attractive . I know of no other educational institution that has so genial a feature . A one-story colonnade , with students ' rooms behind it , broken from space to space by professors ' houses with classic porticos , borders each of two sides of a long level lawn . A third side is stopped , by a great porticoed edifice , containing among other things the library , a round-domed room within , on the principle of the British Museum . The fourth side is open , looking off upon a pleasant country and blue hills . Toward this a student was seen stealing off now and then with his gun . The university , it will be remembered , was the last pet of Jefferson in his old age . Assisted by his accomplished daughter , Mrs. Randolphrhe had the professors and students to dine with him regularly , faking them in turn , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a printed copy of some reminiscences with which an old alumnus favored the last Commencement that he made it a point to put each young man at his ease , finding some subject , as perhaps a person of importance or a family from the part of the State from which he came , about which he could talk with confidence . It is a pity that such kindly and admirable manners are not more extensively imitated . This institution of learning prides itself on having been established on the eclectic or voluntary system of studies at the very first . The usual four years ' curriculum and all " the old unmeaning titles , " as they were called , were swept away . The student was to finish his course soon or late , and he was to be simply " Graduate . " These were among the minor innovations of a man who was never afraid of anything new , who had more than anybody else to do with the abolition of primogeniture and entail and the separation of Church and State , and was once looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graduate was in time found not wholly to serve , and later there have been established Proficient ; Graduate ( of a school ) ; Doctor of Philosophy ( in a number of varied departments ) ; Bachelor of Arts , and Master of Arts , the last two not differing greatly in significance from those to which we are used . In the library hung portraits of the same Jeb Stuart I had seen at Richmond , and of Lee . " You have heard of them , " said the custodian , pointing with a thumb turned back . " Well , rather , " I could afford to reply . It is fortunate that we can both have our side in the little joke . They fought magnificently , and gave us a world of trouble , but we beat them . Mrs. Jeb Stuart , I may mention , keeps a school at Staunton  --  a notable place for select young ladies ' schools , said to  --  be chosen for the purpose on account of its healthful , mountainous situation . The lions of Staunton in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dumb and Lunatic Asylums and its refined society . I can not judge of the refined society , which did not appear on the street to any great extent , in the throngs attending a sheriff 's sale of stock at the court-house ; but the others are its lions still . The principal business street is commonplace , with that kind of commonness inhering in the cheapest of little brick buildings . I actually walked through one ward of the Lunatic Asylum , and brought away a knowledge that it is pervaded by the usual odor of chicory coffee and chloride of lime belonging to public beneficent institutions everywhere  --  which is a fuller report than was rendered by the once so much read " Porte Crayon " himself . On the way to Staunton and beyond it , in the intervals of gazing out at the striking mountain scenery of West Virginia , I found it interesting to read portions of the article of a young man published in the last number of the Virginia University Magazine . It covered all departments of life in the customary way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It quite despaired of us in the matter of art . He had had the advantage of listening to lectures and investigating the most famous galleries abroad , yet " the lamented fact must be admitted , " he said , " that the overdrawn and weird paintings of Gustave Dore , who is said to be a third-class artist of no genius , have given the writer more pleasure than the great paintings of Raphael or Angelo . . . . If , then , one who was willing to make a special study of this subject for several years , with the aid of the best advantages of Europe , was able to make such poor progress , what hope is there for the masses of our people ? " Again , in literature , " a friend of the writer , a brilliant young Englishman , a Hibard scholar , A.H . of London , etc. , held it as his opinion that , as things exist , it would be impossible for America to produce a literature of any importance . " The writer does not agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but gives it only as " the curious and interesting belief of a man of great learning and good common sense . " I do not know how much weight may attach to revelations from such a source , but this from the naive and sophomoric author , on politics , was the most entertaining of all . Touching on the corruption of the ballot , he says : " There were two alternatives offered our people : on the one hand , to suffer that blackness of chaos , the negro rule ; on the other , the corruption of the ballot . . . . It is dreadful , we admit , to have the very foundation on which our Government rests corrupt and impure ; it is pitiable to see old soldiers , who were once proud to call themselves Southern gentlemen , who were ever brave and true , fighting nobly through many battles , forgetting their former worth , and engaging in this wrong ; but that blackness , the ruin of that other alternative , were by far the worst to be dreaded . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption because we are placed between two so great evils ; . . . but we should never condemn ourselves , for here as well as elsewhere necessity knows no law . For a time this corruption was kept secret , and no man spoke about it ; now it is talked of on all hands , and is so apparent that no one takes the trouble to deny it . . . ? First , the negroes were offered inducements to come over to the Democrats , and while , through the corruption of the ballot , it was made to appear that many availed themselves of this opportunity , yet in reality this conversion has happened as rarely as the proverbial angels ' visits .
