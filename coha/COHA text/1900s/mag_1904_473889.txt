TIRING the years 1851 to 1864 Hawthorne wrote upwards of a hundred and fifty letters to his friend and publisher , W. D. Ticknor . Most of them bear dates between 1853 and 1860 , ? the years of Hawthorne 's European residence , first as American consul at Liverpool , afterwards as a sightseer in Italy , and again in England . They are written in the freest and frankest manner : a more unreserved expression of character and opinions there could hardly be . They touch on all topics , ? politics , politicians , literary acquaintances , incidents of consular life , private domestic details , social comments , international questions , the wrongs of American sailors , Lord Mayors ' dinners , his own and other persons ' books , his dislikes , likes , whims , and impressions ? an informal autobiography , in short . Ticknor , besides being Hawthorne 's publisher , and perhaps his most intimate friend , acted during these latter years of his life as his business attorney in Boston , receiving and investing his savings from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fully discussed in the letters , and a sort of jest is kept . up all along concerning the " pile " which the romancer aimed to make . Indeed , the humor of the letters is something which must ever be kept in mind by the reader , lest he be misled into accepting as sober truth the extravagances of a witty and humorous man chatting unrestrainedly and in confidence with his friend . In the aggregate , these letters give a view of Hawthorne 's nature such as has not heretofore been accessible to the public ; they will considerably modify the conventional idea of him . They were unearthed from the box in which they had lain for a generation , by the present owner of them , a few months ago , and kindly placed at my disposal . Hawthorne was acquainted with most of the intellectual celebrities of his day ; but his chosen intimates , the men he loved , were Horatio Bridge , William Pike , Henry Bright , Francis Bennoch , Franklin Pierce , and William D. Ticknor . With the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pierce , as a man , was one of the most simple , transparent , and genuine persons that ever lived . But these were the men whom Hawthorne took to his heart ; the celebrities he kept at arm 's length ,  - -  he liked , respected , admired , appreciated them , but he did not want much of their society . One of the curious features of the letters is their repeated references to good cheer and conviviality . Hawthorne , as is known , was one of the most abstemious of men in the use of all stimulants , even tea and coffee . But it was his whim ( among intimates ) to assume the swagger of a boon companion , and to profess inordinate delight in eating and drinking . He likewise draws a comedy picture of himself as an unappreciated statesman , and discusses with inexhaustible drollery his hopes and fears of fortune . " My best dress coat , " he writes , on receiving his appointment as consul , " is rather shabby ( befitting an author much more than a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigar with Driscoll " ? the Boston tailor of the period ? " I wish yen would tell him to put another suit on the stocks for me , ? a black dress coat and pantaloons ; and he may select the cloth . " When emoluments began to flow in , in Liverpool , he always accompanied his remittances with some word like this : " I suppose Barings have advised you of the deposit of three hundred pounds ; if it were three thousand , I would kick the office to the devil and come home . I am sick of it , and long for my hillside , and ? what I never thought I should long for ? my pen . When once a man is thoroughly imbued with ink , he can never wash out the stain . I wish to heaven I had made my whole pile , and were off to Italy ! . . . Redding has published a list of the moneyed men of Massachusetts . I consider myself one of them ; send me the pamphlet , for I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Secretary of the U. S. Treasury has issued a circular directing that consular certificates to invoices shall no longer be required at Custom-houses . This will go near to block my business in the head , and you will see me at the Old Corner much sooner than we supposed . For God 's sake , bestir yourself , and get everybody to bestir themselves , to restore matters to their former footing . I am not half ready to begin scribbling romances again yet . The truth is this is a devilish good office , if those jackasses at Washington ( of course I do not include the President under that polite phrase ) Will but let it alone . " " 1 . send by this mail a despatch to General Cass , " he writes , in 1856 , " on receipt of which he will feel much inclined to turn me out of office . It refers to a letter of his to Lord Napier on the subject of the treatment of our seamen , in which he displays a shameful degree of ignorance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he does not grow wiser , it will not be my fault . I have serious thoughts of writing a pamphlet , or even a book , on the subject of American seamen ; and it might be made entertaining by bringing in sketches of people and incidents that have come under my notice ; besides being a woik imperatively called for by the present state of our merchant marine . " There is a keen but not unkindly edge of criticism concerning the politicians with whom he came in contact ; he knew his politician pretty well , having studied him in the old Salem days . Buchanan , who was Minister to London at this time , had declined to respond to an appeal Hawthorne had made to him about the relief of the shipwrecked seamen and soldiers of the ship San Francisco . He afterwards met Hawthorne in Liverpool : " He has been here since Tuesday . I had the old fellow to dine with me , and like him better than I expected ; so I hope you have not found it necessary to publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made it bear lightly on him , it would undoubtedly hare made a feud between us . But he takes his wine like a true man , and loves a good cigar , and is doubtless as honest as nine politicians out of ten . But Somebody must have lied most damnably ' . " After Buchanan 's return to America , Dallas was sent out in relation to the matter of British influence in Central America : " March 15th , ' 56 . ? Mr. Dallas arrived two days ago . He seems to be a very respectable old gentleman ; but I should not take him to be an able diplomatist , and he certainly has a very difficult business to handle . Buchanan was worth ten of him , and even he made no great hand of it . " After a few weeks : " Our relations with England seem to me to bear a better aspect than for some months past . Frank Pierce never did a better thing than in recognizing Walker 's government ; it has brought John Bull to his bearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is going to back out . Crampton ought to have been dismissed more promptly ; but it is better late than never . Most people here think that Dallas will be sent home , and , I believe , he is himself uneasy . I hope he will be sent home , because it will he such a very foolish act on the part of the British government ; but I am of opinion that they will let him stay . " Later : " You see I was right in my opinion that Dallas would not be sent home . Pray do not be so hopeless about our political concerns . We shall grew and flourish in spite of the devil . For my part , I keep a steadfast faith in the destinies of my country , and will not be staggered , whatever happens . We have gained a great triumph over England , and I begin to like her better now ; Englishmen have given up forever the haughty tone they have hitherto held towards us . Give Frank Pierce credit for this ; for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two countries continued to run high , however , and brought out sharp expressions of opinion . " After all the slander against Americans , " says Hawthorne , " there is no people worthy to take even second place behind us , for liberality of ideas end practice . The more I see of the rest of the world , the better I think of my own country ( not that T like it very enthusiastically , either ! ) , and , thank God , England 's day is past forever . I have such a conviction of the decline and fall of England , that I am about as well satisfied as if it had already taken place . I will disown Frank Pierce if he backs down one inch ( but I am sure he never will ) , and I would rather sec America sink ( in which case I will come back and sink with her ) than have her give up her just rights . But there is no danger of her sinking ! I hate England ; though I love some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall be true to my country , and get on with John Bull as well as I can . The time will corns , sooner or later , when the old fellow will look to us for his salvation . He is in more danger from his allies than we are either from them or from him . The truth is , I love England so much that I want to annex it , and it is by no means beyond the scope of possibility that we may do so , ? though hardly in my time . I would far rather have it than Cuba . There are several weeks of the year when , so far as weather is concerned , I would not change the island for Paradise . I shall never take root anywhere , unless I establish myself in some old manor-house , like those I see here . The United States are fit for many excellent purposes , but they certainly are not fit to live in . Yet the advantages of living in England are concentrated in London , ? leave that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say , if Presidential elections and all other political turmoil could be done away with ? and if I could be deprived of my political rights , and left to my own individual freedom . " Hawthorne was never seriously the enemy of any human being ; but he could talk about some who bored him rather tartly at times . " Grace Greenwood sailed for America yesterday , " he writes . " I fear she has left her heart in England ; though whether in possession of a single individual or of the whole nation , is more than I can tell . Her book , I suppose , is a republication of her letters in The Era , and in that case you will not make much money out of them . Ink-stained women are , without a single exception , detestable . " Another ink-stained sister fares better . " T recollect bestowing some vituperation on female authors lately , " he remarks ; " I have since been reading Rua Hall , and , 1 must say , I enjoyed it a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; and that is the only condition under which a woman writes anything worth reading . Generally , they write like emasculated men , and are only to be distinguished from male authors by greater feebleness and folly ; but when they throw off the restraints of decency , and come before the public stark naked , as it were ? then their books are sure to possess character and value . Can you tell me anything about this ' Fanny Fern ' ? Tf you meet her , I wish you would tell her how much I admire her . " Of yet another he thinks better , and worse : " These are admirable poems of hers ; but the devil must be in the woman to publish them . It seems to let out a whole history of domestic unhappiness . What a strange propensity it is in these scribbling women to make a show of their hearts , as well as their heads , upon a bookseller 's counter , for anybody to pry into that chooses ! However , I , for one , am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison the first of American poetesses . What does her husband think of it ? " He is more genial towards men writers , his own friends especially . Longfellow published " Hiawatha " in 1856 , and Hawthorne writes : " I heard in London a strong and confident assurance that Longfellow is coming over this summer . Are there any grounds for this report ? If he cares about being lionized , let him come now ; for his reputation can never be higher , or hotter . I wish he would come . His Hiawatha ' seems to be perfectly original ? the annexation of a new dominion to our poetical territories ; and he seems to have caught the measure and rhythm from the sough of the wind among forest boughs . It puts him higher in my estimation of his originality , and I love to see him still on the ascent . It gives me great pleasure to hear of the great success of Hiawatha ' ; on this side of the water , too , it is received with greater favor , T think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gained him admirers among those who have hitherto stood aloof . Nevertheless , the following lines have been sent to me : Everybody seems to be seized with an irresistible impulse to write verses in this new measure . I have received a lampoon on myself ( in manuscript ) of as much as a hundred ' Hiawatha ' lines , some of them very laughable . " There is only one mention of Whittier , suggested by the book of his prose essays which Ticknor had sent to Hawthorne : " His book is poor stuff . I like the man , but have no high opinion of either his poetry or his prose . " And of Lowell , only this " He is very little known in England ; I take the Biglow Papers ' to be the best thing he has written . " His references to English writers are few : " I wrote to De Quincey , but received no answer , till at last a letter came from Miss De Quincey in Ireland . It seems the old gentleman has shut himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opium , I suppose ) , and all letters that go to his other address are sent first to his daughters in Ireland , and thence transmitted to him , unopened . Miss De Quincey conjectured that , from the seal and postmark , this letter might be from me , and so wrote to enquire the contents . A book , which you sent him , still remains on hand ; for his daughter hints that he opens no letters or packages , in his present mood . " . .. " I send some copies of Allingham 's poems for you to distribute to people tinctured with poetry and such nonsense . Do ask Whipple to give them his gracious consideration . There is great merit in some of the pieces . Cross - examination , ' for instance , is wonderfully pithy . I ca n't say I have read them all , for I dislike poetry . " . . . " I saw Leigh Hunt , whom I like very much , partly , perhaps , because he is half an American . I wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do for other English authors , by republishing his works . It is strange that he has not a greater popularity on our side of the water , since he possesses many of the literary characteristics which we are quick to recognize . His poetry I know very little about , and should not care . much about reading it ; but his prose essays are as fine as anything in the English language . " . . . " I saw in London , among about a thousand other noticeable people , your author , Charles Reade ? a tall , stoutish , fair-haired , light-complexioned man , thirty years old or upwards . He did not make a very strong impression upon me . I like his books better than himself ; not that I saw any fault in him , either . " . . " Mr. Monekton Milnes wants me to send him half a dozen good American books which he has never read or heard of before . For the honor of my country , I should like to do it , but can think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his description ? namely , Walden , Passion Flowers , and Up-Country Letters . Possibly Mrs. Mowatt 's Autobiography might make a fourth , and Thoreau 's former volume a fifth . The books must be not merely good , but original , with American characteristics , and not generally known in England . " Of Hawthorne 's loyalty to his friends there are many illustrations , but T must be content to give one only . Just when he had begun to get a little more money than he needed to spend , his friend Bridge happened to be in need of a loan : " My old friend Bridge writes me that he will have occasion for $3000 within two or three months ; and he wishes to borrow it of me . My relations with Bridge are of such a nature that I would lend him every cent I had , even if I were certain of never getting it again ; but this investment of the money will be as safe as any other , and therefore there is no reason why he should not have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security he may offer , or on no security , if he should offer none . " . . . " Consult his convenience as to the time , and do not let me hear of any dificulty . " . . . " I shall follow your advice as to not lending any more money , so far as I can and ought . But when the friend of half a lifetime asks me to assist him , and when have perfect confidence in his honor , what is to be done ? Shall I prove myself to be one of those persons who have every quality desirable in friendship , except that . they invariably fail you at a pinch ? I do n't think that I can do that ; but , luckily , I have fewer friends than most men , and there are not many who can claim anything of me on that score . " Bridge got the three thousand dollars , and the last of the loan was repaid after Hawthorne 's return to Concord . An interesting incident in the story is Hawthorne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of Shakespeare 's plays ; but the passages are too full for insertion here . He wrote the preface for her hook ( the publisher would publish it on no other terms ) , made the arrangements for its publication , and Paid all the bills , while carefully providing that Miss Bacon should not be made aware of having incurred this obligation to him . The book fell flat , and Hawthorne was never reimbursed . I will now make some extracts relating to his own literary work and projects . In 1851 lie writes , of the volume of his Snow Image : " I send the preface to the new volume of Tales . If a perfect copy of Major Molineux ' can not be found , I think the imperfect copy had better be sent to me , and I will rewrite what is missing . I intended that the sketch of Daffydowndilly ' should be included in the volume ; and I believe it will be necessary , in order to make up the due number of pages . It is as good as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note from Fields , informing me of his hopes of getting two hundred pounds for the Romance " ? Blithedale . " I do n't believe he will . " Ten days later : " He has succeeded in getting the two hundred pounds . It will come in good time , for I shall have to draw pretty freely . " Writing from Liverpool : " I am sure the last story in your edition of Tanglewood ends with a sentence about the departure of the Argonauts after obtaining the Golden Fleece ? Orpheus playing on his harp , and the vessel skimming over the water . I left the conclusion to the reader 's imagination . " . . . " I am glad to hear you are going to republish the True Stories . I do n't remember any corrections to he made . and would rather spare myself the trouble and weariness of looking through the book ; let it go as it is . I was delighted with Whipple 's notice of Tunglcwood . " " You put me to my trumps by asking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself exhausted on that score long ago . Nevertheless , there is Peathertop ' ? which is about , as good as any of them . Let that go in . It has just occurred to me , moreover , that in the New England Magazine , when published by Park Benjamin , many of the stories appeared which are now collected in the Twice-Told Tales ; and the publication of them was commenced with about ten or more pages of introductory matter , which , I think , will do very well to publish as an article in the Mosses . It should be separated from all extraneous stuff ( which , if I recollect rightly , can easily be clone ) , and may be called Passages from a Relinquished Work ' ? or something of that kind . believe the title was The Itinerant Story-Teller . ' There are other detached passages of mine scattered through Park Benjamin 's volumes of that magazine , and Fields would readily recognize them . Let him do as he pleases about inserting any or all of them , ? only being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely certain about . The beginning and the conclusion of the ' Itinerant Story-Teller ' are written quite up to the usual level of my scribblings . If I had the magazine at hand , I could patch up an article in five minutes ; and Fields can do it just as well , and without any trouble at all . If he has already sailed , Whipple will doubtless do it . Do not put the patched-up article at the end of the volume , but somewhere about the middle , where it will not attract so much notice . The passages from the Story-Teller ' aforesaid formed part of a work , the whole of which was never published . Do not print any more of it than will be sufficient to meet the exigency of the case ; though really , as far as I can remember , it is no bad stuff . " " October 12th , ' St. ? You speak of Em-other book from me . There is no prospect of that , so long as I continue in office . Thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now almost fill a shelf , and I hope to lengthen the list a little yet . There is the germ of a new romance in my mind , which will be all the better for ripening slowly . Besides , America is now wholly given over to a damned mob of scribbling women , and I should have no chance of success while the public is occupied with their trash ? and should be ashamed of myself if I did succeed . What is the mystery of these innumerable editions of The Lamplighter , and other books neither better nor worse l ? worse they could not be , and better they need not be , when they sell by the hundred thousand . I wish I could make a book calculated for schools . Ca n't you think of any ? " " August 1st , ' 55 . ? It will not take me a great while to get a thorough acquaintance ( as thorough as a foreigner can ever get ) with England ; for , by living as they do , I have come to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my journals ( which are getting to be voluminous ) would already enable me to give you a book which would compare well enough with Grace Greenwood 's Haps and Mishaps . But I do n't mean to publish any such book . It would bring a terrible hornet 's nest about my ears . " " Feb. 12th , ' 57 . ? In Italy , perhaps , I shall begin to do literary work again ; for I feel some symptoms of it already . " .. " As regards the announcement of a book , I am not quite ready for that yet . If I could be perfectly quiet for a few months , I have no doubt that something would result , but I shall have so much to see while travelling in Europe that I think I must confine myself to keeping a journal . Unless T return home next summer , however , I shall make a serious effort to produce something . " " March , 1859. -1 told you in my last that I had written a Romance . It still requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and filling up of vacant spaces . But I think it will be all right a month or two after I arrive , in England . T shall do my best upon it , you may he sure ; for I feel that I shall come before the public , after so long an interval , with all the uncertainties of a new author . If I were only rich enough , T do not believe T should ever publish another book , though I might continue to write them for my own occupation and amusement . I have another romance ready to be written as soon as this one is off the stocks . " ( He is speaking , first , of the Marble Faun , and then , probably , of the book which took final form as the Dolliver Romance . ) ... " I have been continually occupied with my book , which required inure work to be done upon it than I supposed . Mrs. Hawthorne ( the only person who has read it ) speaks very much in its favor ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smith and Elder have signed an agreement to publish it , and pay me six hundred pounds on the assignment of copyright . " We have been spending the summer at Redcar , the most secluded spot I ever met with , and therefore favorable to literary labor . We had not a single visitor or caller while we were there . " " Dec. 1st. ? I finished the Romance some weeks ago . By Fields ' advice , I have given the book the title of The Romance of Monte Beni , but Smith Elder , and Co. thought it not a captivating title . Their choice need not govern yours ; I should like to call it St. Ililda 's Shrine . . . Smith and Elder are determined to take a title out of their own heads ' Transformation ' / I beseech you not to be influenced by their bad example . Call it The Marble Faun . If you are in any doubt about it , ask Whipple to read the book and choose or make a title for it , ? but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1860 , Hawthorne returned to America , and settled in the old house in Concord . There were still four years of life before him , but his literary work was nearly done . The civil war and the illness of his eider daughter sapped his powers . " I doubt , " he says , in 1861 , " whether I shall ever again be so well as I used to he in England . If I had established myself by the seashore instead of in this inland town , it might have been better . It is folly for a mortal man to do anything more than to pitch a tent . I wish they would push on the war a little more briskly . The excitement had an invigorating effect on me for a time ; but it begins to lose its influence . But it is rather unreasonable to wish my countrymen to kill one another for the sake of refreshing my palled spirits ; so I shall pray for peace . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
