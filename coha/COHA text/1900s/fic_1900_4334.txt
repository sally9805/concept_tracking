A TRANSLATION FROM A SPANISH OFFICER 'S DIARY FOUND AT SAN FERNANDO DE PAMPANGA , LUZON , BY AN AMERICAN OFFICER . " It happened that we left such a hidden retirement and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on the road , more than half of which we passed in a lagoon with water up to our waists . We arrived on the seventh . " After six days of rest , on guard every other day , we embarked the thirteenth for Paranaque , where we arrived the fourteenth in the morning , and on the following day we left with rations of sea biscuit for three days , and at the end of the day we arrived at the camp of St. Nicholas , where we found encamped the Division La Chambre , which we joined . " On the eighteenth we set out with a convoy for Salitran , and after passing a whole day in the water , we had to halt , because neither the darkness of the night permitted us to go any further , nor did the fire of the enemy permit us to follow the road . " Next morning at dawn we took up the march , arriving at half-past nine . We sent away the convoy , and at one p. m. , after having eaten our ration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp , arriving at eight p. m. , with some firing . " The twenty-third we set out on the same road toward Imus , which fell after an hour firing with innumerable loss . Imus was then the center of the insurrection . The General-Coronal , who was not yet wearing his insignia , died . " On the following day we came upon the second trench of the town above mentioned , and there entered it with guns ' at rest , ' as we had promised the most excellent La Chambre . " In this last capture the division lost about forty , the greater part of them officers . " Until now the officers coming from the Balearic Islands have received no news , but some of the men have . " It is March 25th , and we have been told that the review of the Commissary is to be passed in Noveleta , which is in the possession of the enemy . " On the thirty-first of the month we left Ymus , going toward Noveleta , and without following any route we found ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco de Malabon , which is also in the power of the Tulisanes . " During the day there was some firing , and finally we found a trench , which we captured with the loss of one man . The unfortunate man was the captain from Majorca , who died from a ball which exploded , entering through his left eye and exploding in the middle of his head , so that he died instantly . I could not look at the corpse . " We slept , as I have said , in the middle of the road , and on the following day , April 1st , we fell like a plague on Noveleta , into which only one company entered with their arms in their hands , since all the rest of the column carried them ' at rest ' in fulfillment of the promise above cited . " During the firing we had the protection of artillery , and we ate our ration without breaking ranks . " The entrance into Noveleta did not cost more than a loss of fifteen Europeans , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days after it had been taken without other result than the leaving upon the field a number of the mutilated bodies of the natives , which were buried by our valiant men with respect , not for what they had been before then , but for what they represented at that moment . " On the day after taking Noveleta , the important town of Cavite was taken , which was bombarded by our marines till they saw the division coming , which had all our men except four companies , which remained defending Noveleta . " The column returned the next day from Cavite and then set out for New Cavite , where we took rations for four days of biscuit and wine , setting out the same day for Noveleta , and on the sixth the division started to attack San Francisco de Malabon , last point of Cavite Province in which there was an insurrection . This point was well fortified , and this is what was the death of them . " In an hour or seventy minutes , the enemy was dislodged , leaving more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one corpse whose head fell more than two hundred feet from its body , carried off by a ball of artillery . This picture was terrible to look at . We could not look in any direction without seeing a mass of bodies , some in pieces and others burning up as if they had been a mass of straw . " We lodged that afternoon , and night in the houses which remained standing , and on the following day set out for the suburb of San Juan , which had been abandoned when they saw that San Francisco was falling into the power of the Chasseurs . " On leaving San Francisco , we were able to salute the Flag Regiment , No. 70 , composed of natives , whose flag was now adorned with the seventh stripe of San Fernando . " In the same town was found a prisoner of the enemy and wife of the man who had been captain of the ' Guardia Civil , ' who had died there when the insurrection of San Frerelledo broke out . " We set out , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was abandoned , and in the same state was that of Rosario . Between these two points I could see the ruins of what had been the dwelling of the Augustinos , who also died at the breaking out of the rebellion . " We reached Noveleta at night-fall , and after two days ' rest , set out on the march toward Ymus ( or Imus ) , passing through Zapote and Bacoor , which important points had been taken the day after the entrance to Ymus , of the taking of which I can relate nothing , since at this time I was recovering from illness . " We reached , as I have said , Imus , passing through Zapote and Bacoor on the afternoon of the eighth , and we were there till the thirteenth of the same month of April , without having in all this time any religious ceremony , except on Palm Sunday , when we had a mass said by an Augustino ; one of those who had come from Manila to take charge of the convent , etc . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed returned to Noveleta by means of the steam of a locomotive , which was at the same time used to move the wheels to press the green cane in order to transport it from the plantation to the factory  --  refinery . " Being again incorporated in the company , we were ordered to cover the line of security established in the quarter of Piga ( ? ) , from which we were relieved on the seventeenth of May  --  birthday of His Majesty the King , Alfonso XIII .  --  and day also on which ended the term of indulgence  --  pardon  --  granted by the Most Excellent Primo de Ribera . " We were in Fananan from the seventeenth to the twenty-ninth , when , the brigade having been organized , it was divided into three columns . The second column set out for Banadero on the twenty-ninth , waiting there till the following day , when the aforesaid column , having been joined by another , which came by the way of Mount Semgay , and by another small force which had come from Bayuyangan ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time upon the ruins of Talisay , which had been taken from the insurgents last October , and later they had taken possession again of its ruins . " On the evening of the thirtieth we received orders not to set out again until further orders , and on the thirty-first we came upon the trench destined for the third column , which did not arrive in time ; and the second column , which was on the left , and in which I was , moved forward more than it ought to have done , by reason of not being able to attack in front ; and seeking the right side or flank , we fell upon the enemy without giving them time to defend themselves in the least , so that there was not more than one killed and one slightly wounded . We then united on the same ground with the first and second columns . The first had been reenforced at Cale by a section of volunteers from Albay , who are very conversant with the territory , because they are natives of this district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . The flag in the trench was set up by the second lieutenant of the second company of the Thirteenth , Don Carlos Gonzalez Lara , who is orphan on his father 's side ( ! ) , for his father had been killed by the insurgents because they had demanded from him a thousand pesos , and he replied that he did not have them there , and then they cut his throat . " About two o'clock p.m. , we took up the march toward Bayuyangan to see what had happened to the two companies which from there were to go to Talisay , and which they had not effected , the same as the column Sarralde , which came by way of Mount Semgay , which was not seen until they had taken their position , and which had brought us more than fifteen hundred Tulisanes , which had been presented to them on the road . " The two companies from Bayuyangan did not show themselves either , because of the narrow passes of the road they had met with resistance and by taking another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they might have escaped ; which did not suit us , because in this way they would have fired upon Bayuyangan , and it might be that the reserve force might not be present ; the rest would be too few to defend the fort . " At night we arrived at Bayuyangan , and I was to see again the land watered by the blood of my captain and friends . " In memory of my captain mentioned , in building and dedicating the fort , they named it after him  --  Yena  --  as being the same place where he died . " From there we went out the next day , tearing down all the trenches we found on the way . We passed through Banadero . We went on and entered gloriously and victoriously into Yananan , from where , after three days , we were detailed to the two small forts at Cale , where we are very comfortable . " I have just learned that I have been promoted to the honorable position of first lieutenant . " " COUGAR " DALY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not extended two days till he was duly installed as " dog-robber " for Lieutenant John Buestom , the most handsome , soldierly-looking , and intensely despised officer in the  --  th " Foot . " Buestom  --  or " Bues , " his enemies called him  --  must have had liver complaint , for his temper was always riled like stagnant water full of crawfish ; and when Captain Bobson left the company for a few weeks to go on a hunt up the St. Joe River , the " non-coms " resigned in a body , every man of them , so hot did he make it for them during that brief period . As for the batch of recruits , fresh from the drill-sergeants and bulldozing of the recruiting rendezvous , they deserted by platoons and sets of fours , for the life with them was unbearable . Had the " Old Man " Bobson remained away a few days longer , he would have had no one of his company  --  the one pride of his life  --  to greet him upon his return , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service since George Washington was a " lance jack , " and who swore that all the damned " shave-tails " in the Army could not drive him out . Many hard things were said of Buestom , but not half that could have been told and yet save one 's reputation for veracity and secretiveness . Among the things he could not keep were his word and servants . Not even would a Chinaman attend his many wants . His last effort was a big Manchu from northern China ; and he had no more than been installed and began his work with the usual celestial energy , till in rushed " Bues , " as savage as a bear , and gave him more instructions in a minute than the frightened menial could have executed in a month . To cap the climax , he taught poor " Chino " to stand at attention , and ordered him to ever thus stand when in his august presence . This was more than the faithful fellow of the pigtail locks could stand , so he made it known in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no dalmn sloder . " And he slipped into his pajamas and was gone . Then came a long series of soldier servants  --  " dog-robbers "  --  but none could endure him for more than a day or two , and seldom got their pay for that . The complaints were all similar : " He asked me to bathe his mangy dog ; " or , " He ordered me to stand at attention when rocking the damned cradle , so precious are his ' brick-top brats ' ; " or , " She , " for Mrs. B. was not angelic , " wanted me to fan the flies off her ring-tailed cat while that animal chose to nap ; " and so they ran . Thus they growled and quit their places , usually without giving notice . Then Private Jones , Brown , Smith , or whoever the offender might happen to be , endured his turn of torture and calling-down when at drills and other duty till there was a fresher victim on whom this choleric officer could wreak his vengeance . Now came " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odor of stale beer and " twofers " on his seven-dollar " cit " suit marked down to five ninety-nine , which was hanging in the orderly room , and which he was sure to don when on " old guard " pass and sober ; but Daly was like all soldiers in one respect  --  he always got drunk in uniform . Daly , indeed  --  as true a Dutchman as ever bore an Irish name . Daly , he of the " ingrowing face " ; " kidney-foot " Daly ; Daly , the man " wid his chist on his back , " were just a few of the " handles " he enjoyed . It was Archie Fettin , lately of the Queen 's Own , but now a " buck " private in Uncle Sam 's service , who aptly said : " Daly , tek off yer bloomin ' ' ed and put it on facin ' t ' the rare and ye 'll hev as foine a brace an ' as smaart ' perance as any non-com ' n the Quane 's Guayards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Daly , he could not follow Fettin 's advice , and must content himself with his dromedary " set up . " The company non-commissioned officers were disgusted with him , for the company enjoyed the reputation of being the best drilled in the regiment , but here came this hopeless recruit to muddle the rear rank at parades and walk on the heels of his front rank man . Corporal Self , the meanest martinet in the outfit , drilled him till his tongue was hanging out , and then reported to the captain : " Sir , there 's slight hope fer thet spalpeen o ' a rakroot Daly , fer th ' more sittin ' up ixercise I giv ' ' m th ' bigger th ' lump on ' is schloping shoulders . " Daly , the newest recruit in the regiment , now " dog-robbing " for " Bues , " and excused from cook 's police , room orderly , guard , fatigue , and , in fact , everything except drill , and he would have been relieved from that had he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him more cordially than the devil despises a Christian who refuses to black-slide . A man with the slightest hint of spirit would have resented their insults , heaped so lavishly and frequently , but he was as impervious to the names , epithets , growling , and swearing as a duck 's back is to water . Rising in the morning long before reveille , he noiselessly slipped out of the barracks , always carrying his shoes in his hand till away from the quarters , and then went to Buestom 's house and began his day 's work by building fires , preparing the bath , and assisting in the cuisine . He never ate his meals with the company  --  always served himself in the kitchen or back yard of his master . Master ? Yes ; for a more menial slave was never sold from the block . When nothing else to engage him , he had his orders to take the mangy dog out for a walk  --  and what a dog ! What breed ? Just dog  --  the yellow kind . His comrades always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constitutional . " But that same dog was Daly 's only friend , and he no doubt enjoyed his society . Then came the great railroad strike , and the tie-up of the mails . The regiment was ordered out to open up the roads . To everybody 's delight , Buestom remained behind to take care of the post ; but a greater delight was when Daly asked to go with his company in the field , for now he would get more than his share of duty to make good the work thrown on his comrades while he was excused from everything . The " non-coms " were " laying for him . " When it came to choosing tent-mates , Daly was left a widow , for even Rassmussen the Swede  --  " Rouse mit ' em der sweet "  --  the worst reprobate that ever wore a uniform , refused to pair with him ; so he hied himself to the nearest escort wagon and slept under it . They marched past miles of obstructed railroad track to Patterson , where the switches were crammed full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of clearing the tracks went on for many days , till finally they were cleared , and a train made up to take the first mail through that had passed since the strike began . Soldiers were everywhere  --  on the tops of cars , on the platforms , inside , on the tender ; and riding on the cow-catcher , loaded rifles in hand , were Archie Fettin and " Cougar " Daly . This heavily guarded train sped on at a lively rate , through tunnels , over cuts and fills , coughing a continuous challenge to the groups of strikers gathered along the way to watch it pass . On it went . The soldier-engineer , taking courage from the docile attitude of the strikers , pulled the throttle wide open , while the soldier-fireman was heaving coal into the fiery furnace , even though the steam was at the time " blowing off . " The giant machine leaped forward like a spurred stallion , easily making fifty miles an hour . Daly and Fettin were holding on like grim Death , for the track was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new one . A bad curve was just ahead , but the speed was not slackened . Like a racing horse on a small track , the engine struck it and leaned toward the inner circle , but an instant later straightened up and flew on its way . Just as the curve was turned , a few hundred paces ahead , stood a small group of tramps . Seeing the train , they hastily broke and ran for the timber along the edge of the right-of-way , but not before one of them hurriedly stooped and placed something on the track , A hundred eyes were on him , and as many rifles were instantly raised to fire , but Daly was the first to pull the trigger , and the man fell backward down the enbankment , bearing with him that which he had endeavored to place on the rail . In firing , Daly was compelled to let go his hold , which kept him on the train , and he lost his balance and fell forward , crushed into an unrecognizable mass beneath the wheels . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had melted in the presence of death , went tenderly to their duty of gathering up poor Daly 's remains . The tramp had been shot fairly through the head , and he had died holding in one of his clenched fists a deadly bomb , which , but for the presence of mind and quickness of action of the despised recruit , would have sent every soul on the train into eternity . The next day the Rocky Mountain Daily Eagle contained this Associated Press report : " The late Private Daly , of Company E ,  --  th Infantry , who was crushed beneath the first train out of Patterson , Mont. , while firing at Antonio Bressi , the anarchist , was from New York City , where he has a mother and younger sisters and brothers dependent on him for support . His right name was Leonard Dresel , and the name Daly seems to have been assumed when he entered the Army to conceal his identity . There was no apparent reason for this , as he has an excellent reputation for honesty and industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain no employment elsewhere . He worked for officers of his regiment in order to make additional money that his brothers and sisters might remain in school . " Antonio Bressi , who died from the deadly aim of Daly , was a noted anarchist leader , prominent in the Coeur d'Alene riots a few years ago , which were so promptly quelled by the  --  th Infantry . It is believed that for this reason he endeavored to blow up the train , for it is known that he is not in sympathy with the striking railroad men . " A week later Company E was paid , and that night a money order payable to Mrs. Catharine Dresel , No.  --   --  Baxter Street , New York , for $150 , left on the east-bound train . In the little cemetery at Fort Meredith there is an elaborate granite monument bearing the inscription : " Private Patrick Daly , Co . E ,  --  th Inf . He gave his life that others might live . Erected by his comrades . " A DYING SPANIARD 'S REQUEST An auxiliary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infantry and a mountain battery of artillery , was formed at Calumpit , on the Island of Luzon , to ascend the left bank of the Rio Grande , and to form a junction with Lawton some distance above . This expedition was accompanied by two gunboats belonging to the " mosquito fleet , " and one launch used to tow the cascoes , or native freight barges , bearing an extra supply of rations and ammunition . This was in May , 1899 . I was provost-marshal of this expedition . When we first entered a town or city , after capturing it , it was my duty to find out what buildings contained valuable property , and immediately place a guard over them , in order to prevent the place from being looted . Large warehouses containing immense quantities of rice , sugar , silks , pina cloth , and other things equally as precious , were frequent finds . They had to be guarded . We met with but little resistance on this expedition till we reached the town of San Luis , about twelve miles up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artillery , ably assisted by the little " pepper-boxes " afloat , soon put our dusky enemies to flight ; and we marched straight into town , with colors flying , over trenches , barricades , and other obstructions hastily thrown in our way . Among the largest stone buildings of San Luis was the " tribunal , " or public house , something after the style of our town halls , with the difference that it is always open for strangers , who cook , eat , and sleep in it . Among other useful apartments , it had a cell , probably used as a " jug " into which the native policemen ran the over-exuberant youth who was guilty of imbibing too freely of his cherished " vino , " or the head of the family for the non-payment of taxes , or allowing his water buffalo to play in his neighbor 's yard . Previous to the occupation of the town by the Americans , this dungeon-like cell had been occupied by Spanish prisoners , who were held by Aguinaldo 's army . When I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our arrival , I saw one of as sickening sights as any person ever beheld . This dungeon , or cell , was about ten feet high , the same in width , and about fifteen feet in length . Through one small grated window passed all the light that ever cheered this ante-chamber of hell . The door leading into it was in a dark corner , and when one was on the inside , he scarcely noticed whether it was open or closed . By the aid of a lighted candle I saw the rock floor scantily covered with coarse rice straw , flatly mashed by the emaciated bodies of the Spaniards who had slept upon it . A few articles of Spanish uniforms , tattered and torn , were strewn about . In the cracks of the walls were hordes of vermin . Filth was present everywhere in its most germ-bearing form . In the center of the room were a few live coals and over them a quart cup about one-third full of boiling rice  --  probably the entire meal for the six doomed prisoners whose home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of the room and opposite the window was a raised platform , eighteen inches high , made of rough boards . This was covered with dry blood , and in the center was a large , quivering pool of clotted gore , which had not more than an hour since coursed through the veins of its owner . Above this platform , a little higher than the height of the average native , was the dangling end of a rope , freshly besmeared with the life-blood of a recent victim . On the plain white wall was the newly made print of the murderer 's hand , who had wiped the warm crimson fluid of the sufferer from the blood-stained hand which held the throat , while the other , with the deadly bolo , severed the head from the trembling body . Everywhere were evidences of a recent , horrible murder . A trailing streak of blood led from the platform toward the door and faded when the street was reached . I diligently looked for some last message from the victim or victims . The walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles of the dying , and armies of pests traveling aimlessly over the cold , bare surface . The plain , rough boards told nothing but that the life had passed from many a defenseless soul while hanging over them . But these boards were not nailed down , I turned one over and looked beneath , but all was darkness . The candle was lowered to the bottom . Nothing was to be seen but great dried pools of blood that had leaked through the cracks above . One stone looked as though it had been recently disturbed . I tried it , it was loose . When raised from its resting-place , I saw a small roll of paper lying beneath . There was nothing more . A further search revealed nothing . The gory board was replaced and I gladly walked out of this chamber of horrors , bearing with me the piece of paper . Reaching the light , I unrolled it . It was dimly written . Evidently a bullet had been pointed and used as a pencil . The greasy sheet had been torn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter Sunday was written in Spanish : " To the Americanos : " If my body is here when you make your entrance into the city , give me a Christian burial . I am to die because I refuse to fight you . My five companions have taken arms against you in order that they may not die by the hands of the Tagalos . I prefer death to fighting in the Filipino Army . " Francisco Delgado . " The trail of blood showed me that his body had been carried out and probably thrown into the river . We could not perform his last request . BENITO . " A-a-a-hum ! " " What 's that ? " was the waking remark made by Captain Randolph Sever , as he slowly turned over on his back to face the owner of the voice which had so dimly penetrated the dreamless slumber resulting from a twenty-four-hour tour on outpost duty . He struggled with his sleep-laden eyes and succeeded in opening one , with which he looked at the intruder , but , on recognizing the Colonel 's orderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posture , and proceeded to rub open the other optic ; meanwhile repeating his former question , but this time assuming a manner more in keeping with the dignity of his rank . " Sir , the Colonel presents his compliments , and asks the Captain to step over to regimental headquarters . " Having delivered his message , he saluted and disappeared , leaving his weary superior to gather himself into a more military appearance as well as frame of mind . Sever looked at his watch and found that he had slept for just forty-eight minutes and fifteen seconds . He mentally berated the whole outfit . " Stepping over to regimental headquarters " meant a walk of a mile and a half through the relentless hot sun of a tropical country ; for the dotting of an " i " or the crossing of a " t , " which had carelessly been overlooked by both company commander and clerk . Then would follow the hair-splitting Colonel 's permission to step back again . The  --  th Infantry , arriving at Manila late in the spring of 1899 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outskirts of the city , and was now participating in the nocturnal fights of the interior . It had been at San Fernando de Pampanga for a little more than a month and both officers and men showed the wear and tear of sleepless nights and tropical climate , which tested the hardihood of the stoutest constitution among them . With temper yet ruffled , Captain Sever retraced his steps to his bamboo hut . When he arrived there , he found three of his brother officers in possession . With that hearty and genial tone of good-fellowship which is only used and felt between men who have passed through hardships together , and know the true worth of each other , they greeted him . He confided to them the cause of his unusual exertion after a trying night on outpost duty , and wearily dropped himself onto some ammunition-boxes , which were serving the purpose of a chair . The talk naturally turned to the condition of affairs , but argument waned for lack of an opposing side  --  the unanimous opinion being that the " gugus " did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sever arose , walked over to a native bed , and began cleaning his revolver , occasionally glancing toward the enemy 's lines . Finally he said : " Say , Parsons , I wish you would reach up in that cracker-box above your head and hand me my glasses . " Lieutenant Parsons was a long , lank fellow , who never exerted himself any more than was absolutely necessary , so he simply unwound one of his arms , which was twisted around one of the posts of the bed , and blindly felt above till he found the article desired . Handing them to Sever , he indifferently asked : " What 's going on over there ? " Without replying , Sever took the glasses and looked intently at the " gugu " trenches . Having satisfied his curiosity , he returned to his work of cleaning his " six-shooter " ; then answered the almost forgotten question : " Oh , nothing , I guess ; only I thought I saw a ' nigger ' running . Its such an unusual sight to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' especially when the sun is beating down like it is now , unless something is after him  --  looks like there might be something up . " Parsons reached over for the glasses , got up , and walked to the door ; but before he raised them to his eyes , he casually glanced to the right and stopped , saying : " Hello ! here comes the ' old man 's ' orderly , ' lickety split . ' " He had scarcely finished his favorite expression , " lickety split , " when the orderly had ridden up , dispensed with the courtesy of dismounting , but hurriedly began : " The Commanding Officer directs that officers get their companies out at once , and proceed to the north outpost line . Messenger just in with information that the Filipinos are swarming over our outposts there . " He had no sooner delivered his message when the sounds of a few stray shots in the direction named were heard . Sever , Parsons , and the other officers , experienced campaigners that they were , swiftly buckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on the company parade-grounds shouting to their men  --  the few , who had not already turned out . Most of them had heard the message as it was given the officers , and had hastened to their huts , not waiting for instructions , warned their comrades of the impending fight , and again appeared with rifle and belt . " Forward , double time ; march , " and Captain Sever was off with his company  --  superb fighting machine  --  for the line of battle . The fire was now rapidly increasing . What at first sounded like a few heavy drops of rain on a tin roof was now an incessant shower . On went the gallant company . Stray shots crashed through the thickets to the right and left of them ; struck the earth in front and near them , throwing up great quantities of debris ; others , singing their death-song , passed uncomfortably close to their ears . The outposts were now in sight . Some of them had been killed ; others , wounded , were bravely striving to repress groans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against many . The natives were pouring down on the little handful of men like a great avalanche . The sure and deadly aim of the Americans alone served to impede the over-powering onslaught . Reenforcements arrived none too soon . Just as the insurgents , intoxicated on " vino , " beaten and sworn at by their officers , began a mad charge on the decimated ranks of the " Yankees , " Sever had finished the deployment of his men in battle formation , and was ready to receive them . Meanwhile , other companies arrived and were strengthening the lines to the right and left . Then began those destructive American volleys  --  one following another in quick succession . No flesh and bone could live under such fire . The more advanced of the charging column were now within a few feet of the outpost 's trenches ; but here they wavered . Vacancies occurred in their ranks like the falling of grass before the blade . They hesitated . Their officers rushed wildly to and fro , excitedly waving their swords , shouting in their twangy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief halt ; then the line broke , and a surging , terror-stricken mass of humanity trying to escape from this disastrous fire was all that was left of that hopeful army of insurrectos who but a moment before were so near experiencing the exhilaration of victory . Word came down the line to cease firing . A moment later the expected charge was sounded by the Colonel 's bugler . Up rose that khaki line , and , with that terrorizing American yell , swept like a whirlwind across the fields in pursuit of the flying natives . It was just another of the many victories . The fight was now over . The enemy was pursued for several miles beyond the limits of the American lines , losing many in killed and wounded . Most of the troops were withdrawn . Captain Sever with his company was detailed to search the field for killed and wounded . The outposts returned to their stations , and there was nothing but the faint groans of the wounded , and the presence of the dead , to tell that but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined armies . Sever and his men had just started on their humane duty , performing it with that tenderness and earnestness which the brave alone show to those in their power , when his attention was attracted by a low moan in the tall grass near by . He stopped and listened . Another half-suppressed groan was heard , apparently coming from the cogonales to his left . He parted the grass . There , lying in a pool of his own blood , was a Filipino soldier , frantically endeavoring to conceal himself and smother further groans . The expression on his face was a mixture of fear and pain . Seeing that he had been discovered , he put out his hand as if to ward off a blow . It was evident that the boy  --  for such he looked to be  --  thought he would be murdered on the spot , or at least unmercifully dealt with . The officer spoke to him in Spanish and assured him that no harm would befall him , but that he would receive every kindness and attention . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed the American to gently bear him to a more comfortable place in the open . After a few moments ' rest , the sufferer opened his eyes and beckoned Sever to draw nearer . His whole expression had changed from hatred and fear of his rescuer to that of implicit confidence . In good Spanish he told that he had been wounded when they had charged the " Yankee " line , but , having heard of how heartless and cruel his enemy was , he followed his retreating and panic-stricken comrades till so weakened from loss of blood he could go no further . Knowing they were being hotly pursued , he crawled into the cogonales , hoping to escape the eyes of the hated Americans . Sever arose to seek a surgeon . The old look of terror returned to the wounded native 's face , and he reached out his skeleton-like hand as if to hold him , and implored : " No , Capitan , do n't go ; the ' medico ' may not be so kind as you , and I might die before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The brave and sympathetic officer then said : " Let me get some of my men who will carry you to the hospital . I can not remain longer nor do I wish to leave you . " The wounded Tagalo looked wistfully into his face and feebly murmured : " Will you do something else for me ? " The Captain hesitated for a moment , apparently wondering what the request could be , then gave a nod of assent , and stooped to listen , bending closer and his interest increasing as the suffering fellow struggled with his narrative . It ran : He was called Benito Gonzales , and he had been forced to take up arms by the insurgent authorities . He had a sweetheart named Juanita Tarinto , who had at the opening of the war taken refuge in a convent in Manila . He wished to send her his " anting anting " ( his good luck charm ) , and some little money he had saved before the war began . Would the Capitan take charge of these things and deliver them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken care of , he closed his eyes as if in great pain , a moment later a smile passed over his face , and he knew nothing more . Just then the regimental surgeon approached , and Sever called to him . They gently removed the clothing from the boy , and discovered that he had received a frightful wound in the side . They carefully and tenderly placed him on a litter borne by two Chinamen , and sent him to the town , some distance back . After this futile attack of the little rebels , the days passed with the same monotony that existed before . Captain Sever , hearing nothing more of Benito , sent the remembrances given in his care to his wife in Manila , with instructions to deliver them to their rightful owner . Mrs. Sever had no difficulty in finding the dusky lass , and , after gently breaking the painful news to the lovely girl with sorrowful-looking eyes and beautiful jet black tresses , offered to lend her any assistance she might need . Grateful for the kindness , and anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon domiciled with the " Senora Americana , " as she was pleased to call Mrs. Sever . One morning , after several fatiguing days on reconnaissance duty waist-deep in mud and water , Company E , of the  --  th Regiment of Infantry , like a lot of rollicking school-boys on a holiday , were indulging in numerous sports outside their huts in the street . The spirit of the soldiers was contagious  --  even the native venders seemed to feel the reaction . Their voices , usually so harsh and unpleasant , had a more cheerful ring as they cried their wares ; and the customary stoical expression of their black faces had actually given place to a bearable smile , by this atmosphere of good humor and fine spirits . The always-busy commander of Company E , Captain Sever , was engaged with delayed papers and reports , and was writing with an energy seldom seen in that enervating country , when he was interrupted by a bold native at his elbow crying : " Huevos , leche , mangoes , lucatan . Quiere , Capitan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you wish , Captain ? " ) The Captain turned abruptly , and was about to reply with usual American brusqueness , but was halted by the broad smile and unusual intelligent look of the invader of his privacy . As he studied the face trying to recollect where he had seen it before , the expression changed for one of disappointment . Then did he recognize in the strong and athletic figure before him the shrunken and emaciated one he had seen borne off the field of carnage , but four short weeks before . " Hello , Benito ! where did you come from ? " he began , and offered a friendly hand to the native ; continuing , " You do n't look much like the chap I found in the cogonales , trying to hide from me a short time back , beyond the north line . I thought you 'd moved from this land of strife , lizards , and mosquitos , and staked out a claim in the celestial regions . Did not know you at first . You must have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how you look after undergoing a month of American cruelty . " He ran on in this train , not giving the dusky soldier-merchant a chance to answer , but all the time studying the face and taking in every line of the splendid specimen of a Tagalo before him . Benito was taller than the average of his tribe . His muscular limbs showed a strength and athletic training that would be the envy of any Yale man or West Pointer . His back was as straight as the proverbial ramrod and as supple as the leaf of the cocoanut palm . His eyes were brown , and fairly danced with good nature and intelligence . They were frank , too , an unusual thing with a native . All in all , he was a perfect model of the physical man in bronze . He placed his tray , laden with the luxuries he had cried , on a box near by , and seated himself in such a natural and easy manner , making himself so perfectly at home , that Sever 's feeling of surprise at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unusual familiarity of a Tagalo toward a hated " Yankee . " But he was to find out that this compatriot of Aguinaldo was unusual in many ways . After talking over his experiences at the First Reserve Hospital at Manila , Sever asked his guest what he intended doing . Benito replied that his future was undecided . While in Manila he had seen Juanita , and they had decided that he should seek the Capitan and ask his advice . That was how he happened to be peddling along the line . " You do n't intend to return to the army again ? " asked Sever . On receiving an emphatic negative answer , the Captain continued : " How did you happen to cast your fortunes with the insurgents in the first place , and why were you so terror-stricken when first discovered after you had been wounded ? " Benito 's answer to this double query was lengthy , but in effect he said : His father had been a captain in the Corps d'Elite , Aguinaldo 's body-guard , during the Filipino insurrection against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the designs of the Americans , he continued in the service after the Spaniards had been driven out . During the outbreak against the Americans on February 5 , 1899 , he was killed . Shortly afterward he received word that he must take his father 's place . He knew what it meant to refuse to enter the insurrectionist service after having once been notified . Fearing assassination should he refuse , he at once joined his father 's regiment and was given his father 's company . His regiment gradually fell back into the interior as the Americans advanced . Nothing but tales of brigandage , rapacity , and cruelty were heard of the actions of the enemy . Driven beyond San Fernando de Pampanga , Aguinaldo established his headquarters at Tarlac , and determined to make a final stand ; here taking oath that he would take the city of San Fernando inside of a week or lose every man in his command in the attempt . Then followed the attack in which Benito was wounded . From what he had heard , he expected the Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken alive and afterward subjected to the cruelty of the " Yankee " soldiery , or sold as a slave and shipped to the States . Now he had seen with his own eyes the benign attitude of his former enemy . His connection with the rebellion had ended . Sever offered to employ him as his valet . The beaming fellow arose , bowing obsequiously , and replied : " As you wish , Capitan . " From that moment his bearing and actions changed from those of a friend to those of a servant . Benito proved a model valet . His master 's wants were anticipated ; his shoes looked more like mirrors than prosaic foot-gear , and his clothes were always neatly pressed and immaculately clean . The culinary was not neglected . It was soon noised about the regiment that Sever was the best groomed and fed officer in the Division . Then came the time when the wily little rebels cut the railroad and telegraph communications , and there was no intercourse with Manila . The morning after this occurrence there was noticeable the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other edibles on the streets of San Fernando . This always meant an early attack . To Sever the most ominous thing was the disappearance that night of his trusted valet , Benito . But he refused to believe that he had turned traitor ; he vowed the native would duly appear in time . Early that evening orders came from regimental headquarters to strengthen the outposts , especially those of the north  --  the point always the object of attack of the insurgents . The south line was reenforced by Captain Sever 's company alone . He arrived there about dark , and soon made a careful disposition of his men , personally superintending the placing of each man . Then came that extreme darkness known only to sentries on posts in tropical countries . While not expecting an attack from the south , Sever 's men were nevertheless vigilant . Their gallant commander refused to lie down , but groped about in the darkness amid interminable underbrush , through banana grove and bamboo thicket , over rice-paddies and briery hedges , instructing and reassuring his men . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling his way back to the company rendezvous , he was startled by the sounds of the footfalls of a galloping horse in the direction of the city , which were rapidly drawing nearer . He at once knew its import . There must be something serious . Orderlies were not sent out at that hour of the morning unless the cause was pressing . He retraced his steps toward the main road leading to the city and down which the now rapidly approaching horseman was coming . Of a sudden the whole sky to the front was lighted as if traversed by the fiery darts of an electric storm . Then came the sounds of volleys fired at close range , and the crashing of the bullets as they struck near . He ran toward his men , shouting words of command . A few returned the fire as best they could , but it was too late for that kind of fighting . The insurgents had crawled to within a few feet of the outposts , by a given signal began a murderous fire , then , whipping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a death-struggle ; a hand-to-hand combat ; a few against many . This mere handful of Americans bravely wielded the bayonet and clubbed with the rifle , but the odds were too great . Sever arrived on the scene of action with flashing eyes and set jaws , determined to die with his men . In an instant he was surrounded by a half-dozen grinning natives , brandishing their shining knives in his face . He fought like a madman , effectively using his revolver , but it was an uneven fight , and he fell by a heavy blow which barely missed his head , landing on his right shoulder and sinking deep into his body . He sunk heavily to the ground . Another boloman raised his weapon to administer the final cut which would end his life , but his raised hand seemed fixed in that position . There was another struggle  --  this time native against native . Benito appeared just in the nick of time to save his friend 's life . Hundreds of feet were now heard coming from the rear . Plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into ditches , came the yelling " Yankees . " The tide of battle turned . The insurgents who had broken this weak line and were pouring in toward the city heard that awful and unexpected " Yankee yell . " They halted . A moment later there was a clash that lasted but a second . Sweeping everything before them , the reenforcements changed the fortunes of the fight . The next day Benito visited his severely wounded master at the hospital . It was then that the Captain learned that Benito had overheard some Filipino venders inside the city drop a hint of the proposed attack . That night he set out to learn the details if possible . He arrived at the rebel lines safely , unrecognized and not suspicioned . He soon learned the plan of attack by hiding near a group of officers who were discussing it . He started back to inform his master of what he had learned , but was apprehended when trying to recross the Filipino lines . Charged with being a deserter , he was closely watched that night and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the confusion incident to the preparations for the battle , and made for the Americans as fast as his feet could take him , arriving in town at about one o'clock in the morning . Searching for the Captain , he could not find him . He then reported what he knew of the plans of the fight to Lieutenant Parsons , and learned from that officer the whereabouts of Sever and his company , and ran with all his might to warn him , for it was rapidly nearing the hour for the murderous onslaught . Parsons , after listening to Benito 's story of what he had learned while in the enemy 's camp , immediately started a mounted orderly to the Colonel . That worthy hastily dispatched a warning messenger and reenforcements to Sever . The rest has been told . A month later Sever was carried up the gang-plank of an army transport , on his way to the United States to recover from his wound . Benito was by his side . When the deck was reached , he took his master by the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his fine , dusky face as he said : " Adios , Capitan . " The American officer struggled to make a reply , but there was something in his throat which prevented him . The two remained clasping hands for a minute , then Benito turned and slowly descended to the " lighter . " Benito and his wife had urgent invitations to accompany Captain and Mrs. Sever to " God 's country , " but they chose to remain in their native land . THE ARMY MULE . That republics are ungrateful , Is adage old as sin ; That only he who has a pull Can rake the chestnuts in ; And he , the faithful , honest heart , Who meekly bears his humble part , Is often dubbed a fool . Oh , Dewey gets a mighty praise , And everywhere they shout And yell for Schley until they raise Their very livers out ; Of rank and file much praise is heard , But then you never hear a word About the Army Mule . He calmly bears his heavy pack , And twists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gunny " sack , When corn has " gang a-glee " ; But for his patient , loving ways No annals speak a word of praise Of that poor Army Mule . He nobly marched where bullets fell , With calm and even tread ; And when he heard the bursting shell , He only shook his head ; And at his post he nobly stood To help the boys what e'er he could , That faithful Army Mule . ' Neath burning sun of Cuba 's isle , He brought the train along , To furnish Shatter 's men the while They sang the " rifle song " ; And but for him supplies were vain ; They must be brought through sun and rain , By that same Army Mule , In Luzon where the Army moves , The festive Mule is nigh ; Too slow the pokey carabao proves , For Yankee soldiers fly ; In heat or cold , in wet or dry , In mud or dust , they can rely On the true Army Mule . He brings relief to sick and well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell , His glory shall not pale ; And here a monument we raise , A tribute to the worthy praise Of the American Mule . But first and foremost of them all , In duty or in danger ; With biggest ears and loudest call , And to fatigue a stranger ; The first on Santiago 's brow , And in Luzon the friskiest now : Oh , that 's the Missouri Mule .  --  W. S. Platt . COMEDY AND CARNAGE . The " Sky Pilot " and the " Dutch " Corporal .  --  The Mule that Sounded the Charge .  --  " Bull's-Eye " Kelley and the Fire-Bug . War , with all its horrors , laconically described by General Sherman as hell , is not without its comedy . The marching through rain and mud ; camping in marshes ; digging in trenches , using the bayonet for a pick and the meat-ration can for a shovel ; wading rivers by day and sleeping exposed to the elements by night , are all sandwiched with numerous mirthful incidents . Soldiers , above all people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to make merry and laugh over the most trivial matter . Even the horrors of battle are unable to quench the spark of gaiety ever present in the make-up of a " Yankee Doodle " soldier . There are even times when comrades are lying about dead and dying , and the missives of death yet speeding by , searching for new victims , or to penetrate the quivering form of the already wounded , that something occurs to bring forth peals of laughter . THE " SKY PILOT " AND THE " DUTCH " CORPORAL . During the mobilization of the Army at Tampa , Fla. , at the outbreak of the Spanish-American War , an orthodox minister enlisted as a private in one of the infantry regiments . On the 6th of June came orders to break camp and prepare to go aboard transports for the invasion of Cuba . The railroad facilities from Tampa to Port Tampa , where the transports were waiting , were not equal to the emergency . Traffic became more or less clogged , and it was early the next morning when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early part of the night the men were gathered in groups , some playing " shuffle the brogan , " others busy at " nosey poker , " while the greater part of them were smoking their pipes and telling yarns , or stretching their weary limbs on rolls of canvas , or on the bare ground asleep . The orthodox minister appeared worried . He was walking to and fro in an aimless manner like a headless chicken . After having paced backward and forward past a pile of mess-chests several times , each time sizing it up , he suddenly began to mount it , planted himself on the very pinnacle , and with a fog-horn voice began a patriotic harangue . Long , hair-raising , and Spanish-scalping sentences rolled from his lips like crude petroleum from a five-inch pipe . Each inflammatory oratorical flight was dramatically climaxed with the words , " For it is sweet to die for one 's country . " The sleeping ones restlessly turned over , rubbed their eyes , and opened their ears to this wonderful address . The entire regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all were inspired with the oft-repeated words , " For it is sweet to die for one 's country . " This regiment was one of the first to land in Cuba , and took a prominent part in the attack on El Caney . Its position during this fight , for many hours , was within a few hundred paces of the famous " stone block-house , " in a sunken road , and was suffering heavily . Along about two o'clock in the afternoon matters began to look blue  --  even a general officer who had fought in many hard battles of the Civil War , and spent the best years of his life combating the Indians on the frontier , was overheard to mutter to his adjutant that he was " afraid we 've bitten off more'n we can chew . " There was not a cheerful face to be seen . Men with grinding teeth were soberly looking Death in the face . Sir Orthodox was burrowing his face into Mother Earth in a wild effort to shield himself from Mauser bullets . A German corporal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . As the corporal , better known as " Dutch , " was burrowing his face in the mud , an idea struck him , and , like all Teutons , he must make it known . He raised his head and looked up and down the line of prostrate soldiers till his eye fell on the flattened figure of the minister . In a voice that could be heard the full length of the regiment , he bleated out : " Say , dere , Sky Pilots , id aind so schveet to died for vonce countries , and id ? " The effect was magical . Amid this scene of carnage and death a wild yell of merriment went up that brought courage to many weakening hearts , and Caney had fallen before the men had ceased to laugh at the joke on the preacher . THE MULE THAT SOUNDED THE CHARGE . He was a Colonel with enough dignity to rule the universe , but he knew no more about music than a pig does of navigation . With his regiment he was slipping up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement  --  orders were given in whispered tones by tiptoeing orderlies . The men were holding their bayonet scabbards against their legs to obviate screeching and rattling , and every effort was made to minimize the sounds of a marching body of men . The Colonel with the battalion on the right had arrived within charging distance of the insurgent trenches . It was the pre-arranged plan for all the companies to arrive on this line before the general advance would be made . When all were ready , the charge would be sounded by the Colonel 's bugler . The battalion with the Colonel was all ready for the bloody charge . Not knowing if the companies of the other battalions had arrived , the impatient commander sent his adjutant , mounted on a native charger , and his bugler , mounted on a Missouri mule , down the line to investigate . When all was in readiness , the adjutant was to have the bugler sound the charge , when the whole khaki-clad line , like a thousand demons , would set up that awful , " gu gu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unwary Tagalos with cold steel . The adjutant and his bugler found that the companies on the left were yet some distance to the rear . The former , while waiting for the companies to come up , dismounted to tighten his saddle-girth , while the latter busied himself looking for some signs of life in the enemy 's trenches not two hundred yards ahead . His mule dropped his head in a dozing attitude . He suddenly appeared inspired , raised his head high in the air , looking toward the insurgent lines . Then , with a grunt , as if of satisfaction , elevated his chin , began working his huge ears backward and forward in a pumping motion , and set up a long-drawn " A-w-e ye ! a-w-e ye ! a-w-e ye ! a-w-e ye ! " in threatening tones , which sounded through the midnight air for miles around . The faithful animal had not finished his challenge when the deep voice of the Colonel rang out completely drowning it , giving commands for the charge . He flashed his saber , and gallantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of dusky soldiers  --  he had heard the mule sound the charge . It was a brilliant victory . The town fell with but a single American casualty  --  that casualty left the bugler without a mount . " BULL'S-EYE " KELLEY AND THE FIRE-BUG . Where is there a soldier whose name is dry on the muster-rolls who has not heard of " Bull's-Eye " Kelley ? Kelley gained his enviable name of " Bull's-Eye " by having spent twenty-two successive seasons on the target-range without ever making a " bull's-eye . " As a reward for long and honest service  --  not for marksmanship  --  he was warranted a sergeant , and went with his regiment to the Philippines . While the regiment was doing garrison duty at one of the interior towns in Luzon , it was constantly harassed by the little rebels . One dark night in June they made a determined effort to drive the Americans out . The regiment had run short of officers , so this night Kelley was in command of his company . He was a strict disciplinarian  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to him as the " Duke of Ireland . " The night of this attack his orders were to keep his men lying flat on the ground and perfectly quiet . There was to be no talking , whispering , coughing , or smoking ; or , as Kelley himself expressed it , " no nothin ' " would be allowed . All sorts of insects , including lightning-bugs as big as incandescent lights , were singing and flying about , causing the men to put their hands and faces through a most unique series of gymnastics . The rebel fire was becoming alarmingly effective . Although they knew nothing of the location of Kelley 's company , yet stray bullets coming that way had already hit two of his men , instantly killing one of them . He suspected that something was betraying his position . Looking down the line , he was horrified to discover what was unmistakably a man smoking . Flushed with anger , he shouted louder than his instructions would have permitted , " Hie there , me man ! put thet cigaroot out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , ye insultin ' divil of a rekroot , put out thet cigaroot , " stormed the enraged Kelley . In reply came the low , mourner's-bench , meek voice of a South Carolina recruit : " It hai n't a cigaroot , Sergeant ; it 's a lightnin ' - bug as big as a search-light on ' Pin-Head ' Hebb 's mustache . " The undaunted Kelley was not to be beaten thus , but sternly commanded : " I do n't give a dom what ' t is , put it out . " HOW I SAW AGUINALDO . An Army Officer 's Curious Experience in Luzon.  --  A Tight Place and a Close Call . It was during the early part of the month of June that my company was doing outpost duty on the north line at San Fernando , one of the largest inland towns on the Island of Luzon . We had been on the south line , but on the morning on which this incident took place , were directed to relieve a company of another battalion of the same regiment on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the morning ; so early that it was impossible to distinguish a man from a high stump at a distance of 100 feet . The lay of the land was new to me ; I had n't the slightest idea of the contour of a foot of the ground to be covered by my company . After getting my men properly stationed along the line , guarding a front of about 1700 or 1800 yards , I took an old , reliable sergeant with me and proceeded to reconnoiter the territory to my front , and to make a rough sketch map , showing on it what I could of the Filipino trenches and their outposts . We started just as the sky began to turn a deep red in the east , and the " chuck me " chameleon , the harbinger of the early dawn , began his morning challenge . Our progress was very cautiously made through the cane-fields , banana groves , and bamboo jungles , halting and investigating the slightest noise , the rustling of a leaf or the breaking of a twig not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance and then the Sergeant . When we passed through cane-fields we found the plowed grounds but little less than marshes , for the rainy season had just begun with torrential showers . Our bodies were soon soaked to the skin , for the leaves of the cane and banana stalks were burdened with water . The cane was a trifle higher than our heads , and the wide-spreading leaves of the banana hid the sky from view . After wading and splashing along toward the Filipino lines for about 1400 yards , we suddenly and very unexpectedly came upon a well-traveled road , fringed with bamboo on either side , with quite a stretch of open ground beyond , in which was lying at the farther edge , the trenches of our enemies , which seemed to be at the time swarming with dusky soldiers preparing their morning meal . Believing ourselves not have been observed , we withdraw a short distance from the bamboo fringe into a banana grove , a position that afforded us concealment as well as an opportunity to make observations of the position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was busy making copious notes and my maps , while the Sergeant , with my field-glasses , was making most wonderful discoveries of masked batteries and gas-pipe cannon , when , all of a sudden , a cavalcade of insurgent officers , followed closely by a large body of foot soldiers , appeared down the road to our left , where there was a slight curve , not more than 200 yards away . What were we to do ? At that short distance from our open-eared and alert rebellious fellow-citizens , we could not beat a precipitate retreat , or an orderly one , without disclosing our presence ; and that fact once known to this body of armed men meant almost certain death , or worse , to be taken prisoners by this half-savage band . We held a hasty council of war in whispered tones , and decided to hold our ground till the danger passed . It was but a moment till the little steeds and their haughty riders were directly in front of us , not fifty paces away , and , to our intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the first ray of the rising sun resting full upon them , seventeen horsemen , officers , and just back of them about 5,000 infantrymen , all within a stone 's throw of us . What made our position all the more precarious , the infantry was standing at a " rest , " and were , as all soldiers do when first halted , looking in every direction in search of something  --  an enemy , fruit , a stray porker or a fowl . Our chances of being discovered were becoming momentarily greater . We could plainly see them , so naturally , if they would but look in the right direction , they could see us . What may not five hundred busy eyes discover ? The danger of the mounted men seeing us was not so great , for they had discovered something interesting in our lines and were active with their glasses looking over our heads . Sixteen of these officers were dressed in light blue uniforms of some thin cloth , wide-brimmed sombreros , russet leather leggings , and clanking sabers dangling by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trappings of their horses were enough to make the eyes of a militia major snap with envy . The other officer , who rode at the head , and the recipient of the most obsequious attentions , a man about middle age , with close-cropped hair , small restless eyes , and somewhat lighter complexioned than the average inhabitant of those far-away tropical islands , wore a neat-fitting uniform of khaki cloth over his diminutive body , and a helmet of the same color upon his well-shaped head . His mount was a beautiful dapple gray Filipino stallion , some larger than the average-sized native animal , and much more gorgeously caparisoned than the charges of the other officers . This pompously equipped commander wore at his left side a most handsome saber , and on his right he carried a revolver and field-glass case . The foot soldiers were of the famous Corps d'Elite , Aguinaldo 's body-guard . We knew them by their bright red uniforms . Where Aguinaldo goes , there they go also . They are his constant attendants . They were , of course , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so interested at the sight of this picked regiment of Tagalos , of which we had heard so much , that we almost forgot our danger , and actually raised our heads higher in order that we might have a better view of them . Just as we were craning our necks and straining our eyes to their utmost capacity , we were suddenly brought to a realization of our terrible danger by the officer in khaki dismounting , throwing the reins to an orderly , and advancing to the edge of the bamboo just in front of us . Like a flash the others followed him , and stood at attention just in his rear , gawking and peering in our direction . This was a trying moment for us . There stood the flower of the Filipino Army , facing two almost helpless servants of Uncle Sam , and , for all we knew , were deciding our fate , for they were discussing some important subject in the Tagalog tongue , all of which was Sanscrit to us . Our hearts were in our throats and kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we been discovered ? Were those snapping , half-savage eyes now resting on us , and was the mode of our death being discussed ? We knew not . Our faces were being pushed in the mud till our ears were begrimed in our mad efforts to conceal ourselves . We felt it would be but a matter of seconds till our hides would be perforated with Mauser bullets , or we would be bound , hand and foot , prisoners of a revengeful enemy . Their talk became excited . Something was being discussed with great interest and moment . The suspense was awful . Minutes passed as hours . Our skins would cringe when the thought of a volley liable to be fired into our bodies at any moment occurred to us . Would they never leave ? Their conversation warmed . The khaki-clad officer said a word , and then they faced about , reentered the road , and passed down it out of sight , one officer alone remaining with the foot soldiers , who gave some directions to the orderlies , and the horses were led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud-besmeared faces . The infantry , still looking and chattering in the twangy language of their tribe , were holding their ground . We heard the officer in command say something about " aqua " in Spanish , then a few words of command followed . They instantly came to the " attention , " moved forward till the center of the column was opposite us , wheeled to the right by fours , and stacked their arms . " Aqua " ; that meant water . We knew they would soon break ranks and go some place , we knew not where , to replenish their water-bottles . So far , then , we had been unobserved . But we remembered that just a few yards to the rear of us , and in a direct line from our enemies , was a rippling stream of crystal water . We exchanged looks . Oh , what looks ! The Sergeant 's expression was awful , and I knew mine to be none better . Here they came ; 500 of them were moving toward us . Was it too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " We were about to rise and make a wild dash for life , when a sharp blast of a trumpet was sounded to our front . All stopped in their tracks . Another trumpet-call  --  a rush to arms . The officers came tearing back and remounted . We waited for the volley that was to send our souls into eternity . That we had been discovered we were sure . Boom ! A loud report from our rear . It was unmistakably a cannon shot . An instant later a shrieking shell passed over our heads and tore its way through a stone sugar storehouse , 100 yards ahead , rending demolition everywhere in that vicinity . The officers madly spurred their diminutive mounts in a wild effort to secure speed . Off they rode at break-neck rate over rice-paddies and small ditches in the direction of the bamboo thickets beyond the open . But the infantrymen remained steadfast ! They kept their close formation , facing us . I ventured to raise my head a trifle higher when I noticed the Sergeant putting his face through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as muscular as his brawny arms . His struggle was in vain ; he could not help it  --  he sneezed , not once , but twice , and once again . Five hundred ears pricked up , and as many pairs of eyes were thrown upon us . It was but a second till a dozen rifles were raised to as many shoulders , the muzzles all pointing in our direction . As a last effort to save our lives , I yelled to the Sergeant to follow , and started a disorderly retreat toward our lines . Boom ! Was it a volley ? No , another shot from the cannon . The shell struck between our enemies and ourselves and exploded . The sky was filled with everything . We looked back over our shoulders , but could not see the red uniforms for flying debris . An instant later we heared a crying , screaming , terror-stricken mass of humanity breaking through the bamboo on the farther side of the road . We halted . There they went , over dykes and ditches . All organization had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next shot from our artillery . Now we were safe , and sauntered lazily back to the company , giving our hearts an opportunity to resume a normal state of affairs . When we reached our lines we found that a recruit battery of light artillery had come out from the city that morning for target-practice . An experienced non-commissioned officer fired the first shot , which hit the sugar warehouse , the target . A recruit gunner fired the second , which , falling short , saved our lives . They knew nothing of the presence of the Filipinos or of my little reconnoitering party . The next day our native spies reported that Aguinaldo and his body-guard had come down from Angeles early the morning before , but had immediately returned . I laughed when I heard this report , for I knew the circumstances . The dapper little officer in khaki was Aguinaldo , and this is the story of how I saw him .  --  Sunday Globe-Democrat . WHAT THE WOUNDED SAY AND DO . An American Officer 's True Stories of our Latest War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No two men behave alike when hit in battle . There is just as much difference in their actions as there is in the behavior of the members of a volunteer fire brigade at a country-town conflagration . The look of the mortally wounded is nearly always the same . There is always that deathly pallor that creeps over the face , and that fixed stare  --  horrible look of resignation  --  that tells so plainly that all is over with the unfortunate soldier . A few instances will serve to give a general idea of how the victims of the messengers of death receive them . On the 1st of July , a company of regular infantry , in reserve , was lying flat on their stomachs in a sunken road , a few hundred yards from the stone block-house of El Caney , Cuba . The men were under a terrific fire , but were not allowed to reply to it , for ammunition was growing scarce . For hours they remained in this position . They began to get restless and to shift about . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , for the bank of the road was sufficiently high to afford security . Curiosity occasionally got the better of a man , and he would poke his head above the embankment and peer in the direction from which the bullets were coming . In the company was a large , muscular German , who had early become restless and curious to see what was transpiring . He would occasionally break out and swear because he was not given a chance to fire at the hated Dons . Of a sudden he ripped out a choice lot of the best in his vocabulary , raised his head above the bank , and shook his huge fist at the line of sombreros to be seen just above the Spanish trenches to the right of the block-house . Ping ! ping ! thud ! " Was n't that an awful sound ? " a dozen soldiers chimed . There is no other sound produced that can be compared with it . It stands alone for all that is sickening and horrible . All knew that some one had been hit . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tones of death , to his comrade at his side : " Wipe the blood off of my face ! " It was his last words . He drew his knees to his chin in the agonies of death , turned over on one side , burrowing his face in the mud , and died without a groan . A Mauser had hit him squarely between the eyes . A short time later a sergeant of one of the companies of the same regiment moved a few yards forward , trying to get a pot-shot at some Spanish sharpshooters who were snugly perched in the spreading tops of some royal palm trees , and were hitting some of our men . He sighted one and had his rifle to his shoulder , taking a fine bead , when all at once the rifle fell to the ground and his hands dropped helplessly by his side . He coolly faced about and walked toward the rear , his arms dangling like pendulums , not even so much as muttering a word . One of his company officers asked him what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hit , " and continued on his way to the dressing-station in the rear . He was shot through both shoulders  --  a serious wound , but he recovered . About an hour after the German was killed the same company was ordered to take a position farther to the right . They walked along , goose-fashion , single file , moving by the right flank toward their new position . Next to the last man in the rear was a corporal , a new man , just a few months in the service . Biff ! ping ! bang ! went the deadly missiles . One struck a man 's rifle-barrel , cutting it almost in two . Another split the stock of a gun in a man 's hand . Then one struck the recruit corporal 's left arm , passing through the biceps . With an expression of great surprise he for a moment stood still , saying nothing . His eyes began to dilate , and then of a sudden he threw his fowling-piece high in the air , grasped his left arm with his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gait , yelling so as to be heard above the din of battle : " I 've got it ! I 've got it ! I 've got it ! " The last that was seen of him that day he had " it , " and was taking " it " to the rear with him . On San Juan Ridge , July 2d , just as Chaffee 's brigade had reached the crest , they were ordered to lie down and intrench , using the bayonet as a pick and the hands for shovels . A dashing young fellow of one of the companies on the right of the line was some distance in advance of his fellows when the halt was made . Instead of falling back on the line with the other men , he stopped where he was . One of the officers shouted at him several times to fall back , as he was in danger of his own men shooting him , but he did not hear . The officer then walked down to where he was , grabbed him by a leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had but started when he felt the man 's whole body quiver , and he flopped himself over on his back , saying as he did so , " I 'm done for . " Some of the men came to the soldier and assisted the officer to carry him to a place of security . With a bayonet one of the men cut off his clothing , when a Mauser hole was seen just above the heart , where the bullet entered , passing through his body and coming out between the shoulders , near the spine . The man said no more at the time . His wounds were bound by sympathetic hands . All except the wounded man returned to the firing-line . The Spanish fire was heavy , and kept up for four hours , occasionally a soldier dropping out , wounded or killed . When all was quiet , the officer and one of his soldiers returned to see if the young man were yet alive . They found him sitting against a small tree . His first words were : " Bill , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just about the time this man was wounded a man in the next company on the right suddenly threw down his bayonet , jumped to his feet , paused for a second or two , looking in the direction of the Spanish trenches , then threw both hands to his breast , saying , " I 'm hit . " He turned about and walked into the dense thickets of cactus and Spanish bayonet , and was never seen nor heard of again . He undoubtedly crawled far back into the heavy tropical growth and died , where the vultures claimed him . One of the coolest men who ever received a wound was an infantryman at San Fernando , in the Island of Luzon , on the 16th of June . The insurgents made a determined effort to retake the town early on the morning of that day . They opened up simultaneously from every quarter , and the kind and variety of missiles used would be beyond the wildest expectations of that sweet-throated midnight serenader , the Thomas-cat . Out of an old smooth-bore cannon they threw railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobble-stones . From their Remingtons they shot large cubical and irregular-shaped lead slugs . One of these struck this cool man high in the right groin , deeply imbedding itself . The pain must have been excruciating , for the man was terribly lacerated . He hobbled to his company commander , saluted , and asked permission to fall out and lie down , as he had been hit . He was lying near a road where his comrades passed to and fro during the entire fight , but no one heard a word or a groan out of him unless he was spoken to . During the same fight , in another company of the same regiment , a battalion sergeant-major was ordered to take two squads and proceed to a point about 400 yards down the Angeles Road , where there was a small trench , and defend it . When about half-way down , one of his men , a green " rookie , " received a severe wound in the leg . The Sergeant endeavored to start him to the rear , with a man to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to the front with his squad would do . He loaded and fired with the other men till the fight was over . This man was recommended for a medal of honor by his captain .  --  From Leslie 's Weekly , of December 9 , 1899 . THE FLIGHT OF " FATHER TIME . " A Case of Mistaken Identity . Captain C. was what soldiers call a " fussy " officer . He was constantly prying into matters that concerned him but little , and wasted his energies in performing duties usually within the province of a corporal . In fact , he would march a " set of fours " to dinner . In a fight , however , his soul enlarged , and he was ever to be found at the front directing his men , and doing much to atone for sins committed during less exciting moments . Always in the van , his long , gray whiskers gently flowing in the breezes , his sword drawn and pointing toward the enemy , suggested to the men the pictures they had seen in almanacs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among themselves , he had no other name . In August , 1899 , his company was at Angeles , in Luzon , and was entrenching on the outskirts , for the pesky little " niggers " were constantly threatening and frequently attacking the place . The Quartermaster Department hired a lot of Macebebes , who had offered their services , to do the harder part of the work of trench-digging , for the men were exhausted by an arduous and exacting campaign . One bright morning about two hundred of these laborers were put to work a short distance to the front of the trenches under construction , to cut away a dense growth of cane , and open up a field of fire toward the enemy . The faithful fellows jumped into the work with a vim seldom seen in that country , slashing to the right and left with bolos , machetes , knives , hoes , scythes , and a variety of other edged implements , felling the large cane stalks with great rapidity . " Father Time 's " company was just in rear of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the insurgents , who hated a Macebebe even worse than a despised Americano . The usual activity in the cane-field was soon discovered by the festive little rebels , who promptly proceeded to pour volleys into the place where the cane was so mysteriously disappearing . The unarmed Macebebes stood their ground for a moment , but when the Mauser bullets came whistling uncomfortably close , and one of them had been slightly hit , they could stand it no longer , but , with an unearthly yell of fright , they broke for the rear like a herd of stampeded cattle . A regular race of mad men . When the firing began , the soldiers threw themselves upon the ground as flat as pancakes . The Captain was busy writing in a nipa palm hut a few hundred yards in rear . He rapidly buckled on his equipment and " took up the double time " to join his men . As he neared the trenches he raised his head to look for his company . Not a soldier was in sight . As he stood in wonderment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing ajar and the inmates escaping toward him . Two hundred black devils , every imp of them screaming and yelling at each leap forward , were coming for him , armed with bolos and other death-dealing weapons , to mince him in a thousand pieces . He knew his men had been massacred to a man . He alone remained to face this mass of uncivilized warriors eager for every drop of his blood . No general ever more quickly decided upon a definite maneuver , or put one into execution with a more fixed determination than this veteran officer , hero of three wars , decided to decrease the distance between himself and the main body of his regiment in town . Two miles over muddy roads and rice " paddies " is not an easy march for a young man , but when a valiant gentleman of sixty summers covers the distance at a forced-march gait , without a halt , a record has been broken . When " Father Time " learned that not a man of his company had been hurt , he was pleased ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macebebes , hopelessly stampeded , for a blood-thirsty enemy , had to be broken to him gently by the Colonel . CAMP ALARMS  --  FALSE BUT STARTLING . The Red-Headed Recruit and the Cuban Dog .  --  The Charge of the Hospital Corps.  --  Private Timmons and the Carabao . In the face of his reputation for undaunted courage and dashing deeds of valor , the American soldier has at times allowed himself to become frightfully alarmed and on the eve of being panic-stricken , when taken unawares . He soon collects himself , however , and is ready to meet all emergencies , let them come from whatever source they will . Even the old " vet " may lose his head for a moment or two , and find some difficulty in establishing his equilibrium . The Yankee soldier is ever ready to obey his officer , and if the latter will but keep his wits , order may be restored out of hopeless demoralization . The Civil War was replete with camp alarms , some of them of the most ridiculous type ; and our war with Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tropical countries , with their dense growths of vegetation , myriads of crawling creatures , and hair-raising sounds , form a replete field for alarms , which are usually started by frightened sentries on lonely outposts . THE RED-HEADED RECRUIT AND THE CUBAN DOG . One of the most notable alarms that occurred during the campaign about Santiago was within two miles of the " Stone Block-House , " at El Caney , on the night before the attack on that place . The brigade that did the hardest fighting there , and that had been in advance the greater part of the time from the landing at Baiquiri , received orders late in the afternoon of June 30th to move forward and take a position within easy striking distance of El Caney , and to there rest on arms for the night . The march began at dusk , and , by a long , circuitous route , ended at 12 o'clock midnight at an open field , which the guides said was within two miles of the nearest Spanish position in the town . The march , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , by men as silent as mice , was a tiresome one . All were glad to hear the word passed along in low whispers to quietly lie down , retaining arms and equipment , and bivouac for the night . The silence of death prevailed . The long line of dark figures on the open field , silhouetted against the star-lit sky , and the stillness that reigned , reminded one more of stereopticon views thrown upon canvas , than of the presence of eighteen hundred fighting men , stealing upon their prey . It was not a minute after the whispered command to lie down was given till all except a few selected for duty on outposts had stretched their weary limbs on the dewy grass . The outposts were placed around the main body , some few hundred yards distant , most of them in the direction of the Spanish lines . The command was soon asleep . There was the usual number of disturbed dreamers , and occasionally the snorer would burst out in loud and long-drawn tones , only to be promptly kicked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited from indulging in his nightly practice , and soon there was a long mass of sleeping humanity , not a sign of wakeful eyes to be seen . As sudden as the flash of lightning the woods in the direction of the Spanish lines was filled with yells , screams , and the heavy falling of feet in rapid retreat . The brigade sprang to its feet as if each man had been lying on a stiff spring and the whole touched off simultaneously by the pressing of a button  --  every man with loaded and cocked rifle in hand . Then began the low , mumbling sound of a suddenly aroused camp . The efforts of the officers who had kept their heads to keep it down were fruitless . It was a long line of buzzing sounds like the swarming of bees . But the screaming and yelling continued and grew nearer . Shouting at the top of his voice at every jump , " They 're coming ! they 're coming ! " tall , lean , red-headed , and hatless , the recruit sentry came by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-starved Cuban dog , playfully pursuing him , soliciting some of the hardtack in the recruit 's haversack . It was near dawn before complete order was restored . Many eyes were opened by that alarm raised by the panic-stricken recruit that never again closed till closed in death . THE CHARGE OF THE HOSPITAL CORPS . The campaign in the Philippines against the wily Tagalo has been replete with false alarms , owing to the prowling and sneaking nature of the enemy , and the unearthly noises made by the animals of that sun-scorched and water-splashed country . There is a line of trenches and block-houses around the city of Manila , the average distance being about two miles out from the suburbs . This was called the " firing-line . " On first arriving from the United States , regiments were sent out to occupy a part of this position , to recuperate from the long sea voyage aboard crowded transports , and at the same time help maintain the line of defense around the city . Most of the newly arrived regiments were filled up with recruits with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded the opportunity to get these men in shape for field-service . This line of defense was the theater in which was acted the comedy of the war . Here is where occurred the most foolish alarms and at the same time some serious ones . There is one famous charge ( ? ) that occurred in a newly arrived regiment , which was spending its first night on the Island of Luzon in these trenches . It is known as the " Charge of the Hospital Corps , " and promises to be handed down in army tradition . The gallant leader of this daring advance was a young surgeon , recently appointed to the regular establishment as a battalion pill-dispenser . His command consisted of three privates and an acting steward of the Hospital Corps . Arguing that he was fighting a savage enemy , not a party to the Geneva Convention , and consequently would not recognize as non-combatants the wearers of the red cross , he succeeded in having a requisition honored by the ordnance officer for five big forty-five caliber " six-shooters , " with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gallant following were tickled with their toys , and flourished them most dangerously during the day , vowing death and destruction to any thousand Filipinos who would dare to face them and their death-dealing weapons . The doctor , or " Pills , " as the men called him , established his battalion hospital in a ravine in a break in the trenches . It was a lonesome place . Night came on , and the corps men retired to sleep their first night on Luzon 's soil ; but their sleep was not easy . Visions of gore and midnight slaughter passed in review before their drowsy eyes ; and just as a black-faced little rebel had them by the throat and was plunging a great long knife into their vitals , they would awaken with a start , feel under their heads for their fire-arms , to reassure themselves , pat the trusty weapon a time or two , call it " , gaunt-looking fellow , who his comrades said had a head that would fit in a regulation full-dress helmet , could stand the nervous strain no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bamboo and cogonales into his little " tepee " were more than he could stand . He had listened to them in his mind , enlarged , multiplied , and magnified them in his own imagination , till he was sure the whole insurrectionist army was quietly , inch by inch and foot by foot , slipping down upon him . Up he jumped , revolver in hand , gripping the handle and gritting his teeth , and proceeded to investigate the sounds . Approaching within a few yards of a thick bunch of trees not far in front of the hospital tent , he halted to listen . Yes , they were there beyond all doubt . He could almost see them crawling toward him ; a hundred dusky demons upon all fours , with long , glistening , razor-edged knives held between their shining teeth . They must be stopped . With a loud voice , trembling with fear , he challenged : " If you 're an American , for God 's sake say so , or I 'll shoot . " The noise made no reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valiant " Pills " landed on his feet in the middle of his tent , rallying his men , and was soon leading them to the attack . Bang ! bang ! biff ! bang ! rang out the loud-mouthed Colt 's revolvers . A moment later the Krags began to pop to the right and left , the alarm traveling up and down the line with lightning-like rapidity . Soon six miles of grim-looking rifle muzzles were pointing toward the innocent nothing to the front , a volley occasionally resounding through the midnight air at an imaginary enemy . Dawn found " Pills " searching the field of battle for dead and wounded . He discovered numerous bullet-holes in his tent and medicine chests , made by 45-caliber balls ; and , lying near the place where the gaunt , hungry-looking corps man first fired upon the enemy , he found poor " Paterno , " Company E 's monkey mascot , with a short and bloody tail , that member having been lost in the battle  --  a penalty for his nocturnal perambulations . PRIVATE TIMMONS AND THE CARABAO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , when stationed in a temperance community , was a mighty good soldier . True to his steel , he met death in the general advance from San Fernando , in August , 1899 . He was one of those jolly , good natured fellows who can sit in the mud and crack jokes , and sing standing in water to his arm-pits . And what is better , he possessed the happy faculty of imparting his exuberance to his long-faced , homesick , and downcast fellow-privates . His temper was as smooth as a becalmed sea , and seldom was it that a ripple passed over the smooth surface . There was just one word in the soldier 's vocabulary that would disturb him , but this word never failed to bring on a typhoon . This innocent yet magic word was " carabao , " the name of the water buffalo , the beast of burden that formed the American " cracker line " in the Philippines before the introduction of the ever-faithful mule . This is how it came to have such a terror for poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " firing-line , " and his company furnished twelve men daily for the " lunette , " a kind of detached bastion about 800 yards in front of the line in the direction of the enemy . This was a lonesome detail . Just twelve men to man an isolated little fort , the enemy known to be in great numbers not more than four or five miles away . It came Timmons ' turn to go on this duty for , the first time . The detail , in command of a sergeant , marched out at sundown and relieved the men who had been on the previous twenty-four hours . The old guard turned over its orders and at the same time reported having seen some armed " gugus " in the direction of the Mariquina River , which ran in front of the " lunette " about a thousand yards away , the intervening space being an open rice-field . The old guard marched off and the new one on , throwing off their blanket-rolls and making themselves as comfortable for the night as possible . But two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigilant . Night came on as black as the enemy they were fighting , and with it all the breath-stopping and hair-raising noises that the myriads of flying and crawling animals of that war-ridden country produces . There was the " vantriloquest " bird , gifted with a voice that is the essence of all that is frightful and hideous in sounds  --  forty demons running amuck and coming your direction . In painful harmony was the low , deep tones the " chuck me , " whose vocal cords are tuned after the left end of the key-board of the pipe organ . Then there were slimy lizards , chameleons , tree-frogs , scorpions , and wonderful bugs , all with voices peculiar to their families . There were lightning-bugs as big as jack-o ' - lanterns , and tarantulas with round and velvety bodies , and a spread of legs that would cover a frying-pan . All this and the known presence of a sneaking enemy was enough to test the nerves of veterans , so its effect on recruits can easily be imagined . Timmons ' time to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who called himself an old " vet , " because he had served in Cuba , went on with " Tim , " as his comrades called him . Their turn began at midnight . The Sergeant , who had posted them , was soon lying down taking a non-commissioned officer 's sleep  --  one eye closed , the other on the qui vive . Both sentries were on the alert . Many suspicious noises came to their ears , and imaginary murderous-looking " niggers " were seen lurking in the grass , behind rice-dykes , and lying crouching on the ground . If " Tim " discovered something that he was certain was a death-dealing boloman , he would tiptoe over to Jones and hold a council of war . That worthy  --  the old " vet "  --  would dispense nerve-soothing whispers in his ears , and he would return to his post a less nervous " rookey . " The time dragged wearily on , and finally arrived when they were about to be relieved . The blackest of the night was on . Jones left his post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . " Tim " was now alone . A slowly moving figure loomed up before him not fifty yards away . Then came the sounds of heavy tramping feet . The sounds were rapidly drawing nearer . There , before his dilated eyes , dimly outlined , and within pistol-shot , was the enemy in great numbers , who would soon close around the little garrison and murder them to a man . What should he do ? His orders were strict about giving undue alarms , but if he wasted a moment longer , there would be no time for defense . If he left his post to arouse his comrades , the enemy would rush upon them . No . He would give the alarm by firing and one dead Filipino would be the result of it . He nervously raised his rifle , took deliberate aim at the advancing figures , and fired . There was a sickening thud , a heavy fall , and low , deep moans . The men were aroused and manned the fort . The Sergeant ordered a general fusillade . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there till dawn . The first light of day revealed , lying in a great pool of his own blood , " Big Bill , " the bull buffalo that drew the headquarters water-cart , who had been out grazing that night . AN ENCOUNTER WITH BOLOMEN . A True Narrative of a Personal Experience in the Philippines . By a Lieutenant of Infantry . The organized bands of Filipinos known as bolomen are so called because their principal weapon is the long , broad-bladed , vicious-looking knife called the bolo , with which they do their deadly work . They make many boasts of their prowess and skill in taking human life , and one of their proudest feats is to sever the head from the body with a single blow . Our men in the Philippines who are on detached duty , or who for any cause are away from their commands , are frequently attacked by these men . As a rule , bolomen do not carry rifles , although many carry revolvers when they can get them . Their work is to kill at short range . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their victim , strike him a deadly blow , and then beat a quick retreat to their own lines . Many of the insurgent officers and soldiers carry bolos , but the genuine bolomen are an organized body belonging to Aguinaldo 's army , who have as distinct a work to do as the different branches of our own service . Their work is solely to surprise the unsuspecting outpost , officer or soldier , to dispatch him and run away before the deed has been discovered . Their feats are commonly committed in the darkness of the night Then their cat-like tread serves them well . Stealing noiselessly along through banana groves and bamboo thickets , cane-fields and cogonales , they approach within a few feet of their intended victim and lie for a few moments watching him as a snake eyes a defenseless bird . During the months of June and July , 1899 , my regiment was doing duty at San Fernando , about forty miles from Manila . The companies of the regiment took turns on outpost , going on this duty every fourth day and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which they went on post . This gave the companies two nights in houses in town and two on the line out of every four . My company did duty on what was known as the north line , extending from San Fernando a full mile toward Angeles . The entire distance was an almost impenetrable jungle of bamboo and banana trees , intertwined and interwoven with vines , thorn-bushes , and many other forms of tropical growth . To the front was an immense cane-field , with a " paddy-field " beyond . The cane was from five to seven feet high . Along this deep fringe of bamboo and matted undergrowth , and near the edge next to the cane-field , our pickets , or Cossack posts , as they are properly called , were stationed at distances ranging from one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty yards apart , one corporal and six privates at each post . On the tenth of July my company went out in reserve , and early in the morning relieved the company there on the outpost line , Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots with the insurgent pickets . Most officers when in command of companies on this duty visit their sentries some time during the night , in order to reassure their men , and to see that they are well-instructed and on the alert . I have always followed this practice . I started on a tour of inspection at about 9:30 , visiting first the post on the railroad on the left of the line , then taking the other posts in succession down toward the right It had rained in torrents for several days , and wide , deep pools of water had formed everywhere along the way . Because of these pools , I was wearing high-topped rubber boots . Shortly after ten o'clock I arrived at the next to the last post on the line , which was about two hundred and fifty yards farther on . Between these two pickets was the most dense growth of bamboo trees and banana stalks to be found in that neighborhood , and the entire distance was a continuous chain of diminutive lakes . There was a path leading through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drizzling . The immense spreading leaves of the banana and thickly matted foliage of the bamboo formed a canopy that shut out every trace of light . No dungeon was ever darker than this path . Notwithstanding the gloomy surroundings caused by the death-like stillness , the darkness of the night , the water dripping from the overhanging vegetation and completely saturating my clothes , my occasionally colliding with a thorny shrub , or tripping over a low-hanging vine , I was in excellent spirits . I groped along the cave-like way , humming in a low tone " The Girl I Left Behind Me , " and had reached a point about midway between the pickets . Then , although I could see no one , I suddenly became aware of the presence of a human being . I stopped as if I had been struck dead , and strained my eyes . There , just in front of me , near enough for me to grasp with my hands , I saw the dim outlines of a short , thick-set man . Was he one of my men ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post at that time of night . Should he be discovered in such an act , the penalty for his crime would be death . " Hello ! Who are you ? " I said . There was no answer from the man ; instead , I saw his right hand quickly strike out from his shoulder , and the flash of a glistening blade . I threw up my left hand , and our wrists met in heavy collision ; but his blow was stronger than my ward , for I felt a sharp sting in my face just below the left eye , and a moment later the warm blood trickled down my cheek . With my left hand I grabbed his wrist just below the thumb and gripped it like grim death , but he was not to be beaten thus . I felt the sinews of his wrist rise , and the grinding of the muscles , and then the same stinging sensation that I had felt in my face I now felt in my wrist . I could count the cuts as he made them  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist and hand , and then the blood began to run down my forearm , as our hands were elevated . This occupied but a second of time . He raised his left hand , and I saw another flash . What it was I knew not , but I immediately grasped his wrist and tried to force this hand behind him . Before I could do so , he fired , and the ball passed through my left boot-leg . The muzzle was so close to me that the force of the powder almost threw me to the earth . I ground my teeth in a desperate effort to force his hand behind him . My left hand , cut and bleeding , still held his right . Now forcing the fight with the revolver , he tried vainly to raise it and shoot me in the body . Throwing my whole strength on my right arm , I succeeded in forcing back his revolver hand . At this he began to shoot at my feet . The first shot missed , but he immediately followed it with another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been hit with a club , and grew numb . Four more shots came in quick succession . One of them  --  which I can not tell  --  struck the same foot and broke the bridge , as I knew from the immediate loss of strength in that member . Now all was quiet . We stood with our heaving chests touching . I felt his breath in my face , and his heart palpitating against my breast . There was a lull in the battle . I felt safe , as far as the revolver was concerned , for he had emptied that , but the deadly knife was still poised over my head . My life depended entirely on the strength of my wounded hand and wrist , which were holding the knife away from my throat . Now I remembered that bolomen never travel alone . That he had comrades within a few feet of me , who were trying to distinguish between us , so that they might be sure that their knifes should enter my back instead of his , I was certain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the cold steel enter my body . It was time for me to force the fight . My right foot was badly wounded , but the knee was yet unhurt . With this I struck the man a blow in the abdomen , and quickly followed it with another . It was evident that he was weakening . He again made a desperate effort to free the hand which held the bolo , but my endeavor to keep him from succeeding was greater . I drew back the right leg as far as I could , doubled up the knee , and , with all the strength that I possessed , drove it again into his abdomen . The effect was marvelous ; his muscles relaxed , his struggles grew feeble , and his breathing was badly interrupted . This was the decisive part of the fight , and I grasped the opportunity . With all my might I threw him from me . He fell among the bushes , and was lost in the blinding darkness . I drew my revolver from the scabbard , and fired in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was answered by a cry which told me he had been hit . At this moment I heard the twigs breaking and the leaves rustling behind me . Like a flash I faced about and fired at the approaching figures  --  my assailant 's fellow-bolomen . The effect of the shot was to cause a heavy rustling and the sound of many feet in rapid retreat . I had been careless enough to come into this jungle with but two loads in my revolver , and these had been fired . When I began to reload , my right foot gave way and I fell . Lying on the ground , I loaded and fired again . The groans of my wounded enemy were getting farther away , and the sounds finally died in the direction of the Filipino line . I hobbled to my nearest outpost , where one of the men bound my wounds , and later I received the attention of a medical officer . I believe myself to be the first American soldier to live to tell the tale of his fight with bolomen.  --  From Youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILL . " A Midnight Reconnaissance in the Philippines . " Carabao Bill , " from his dress and manner , might be said to be a typical United States Army officer . His figure would probably fall short of the standard , but he was no less strong and healthy than his brother knights of the sword . His strength was more to be compared to that patient animal after which he was nick-named , the mighty carabao , but he lacked the grace of form and dignity of bearing that the average wearer of shoulder-straps in Uncle Sam 's army is supposed to possess . The soldiers said he waltzed like a cow and walked like a camel  --  moving one corner at a time  --  which was indeed a graphic way of describing his movements . William Van Osdol was his name , and he was a second lieutenant in the  --  th Infantry . After several months of hard service in the Philippines he earned for himself the unenviable sobriquet of " Carabao Bill , " because his awkward movements , ox-like strength , and slow but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed our " cracker line " that that name could not but suggest itself . In Cuba he served as a sergeant in one of the regular infantry regiments . He was the proud possessor of a bayonet scabbard , several times punctured by Mauser bullets , which he had worn in the charge up San Juan Hill . It was for " gallant and meritorious conduct " during this fight that won for him the recommendation for commissioned rank ; and it was but shortly after he had returned from fever-ridden Santiago , when in the hospital at Montauk Point , that the much-coveted document , making him an officer in the United States Army , reached him . Van Osdol was a born fighter . The set of his lower jaw and the quick snap of his light blue eyes left nothing to be guessed at on that line . While he was not a picturesque nor dashing officer , yet his heavy growth of fiery red locks was ever to be seen in the front of the fight and seldom under cover . An Irish corporal , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The sorril-topped lootenint hai n't brains ' nuff to git scart , " but this was not true . While not a man renowned for brilliancy of intellect , yet he was a level-headed thinker whose judgment was always good on minor matters . He was frequently selected to conduct scouting expeditions where good " horse sense " and nerve were much more expedient than a superabundance of gray matter abnormally developed with theories of fine tactics and maneuvers . When the  --  th Infantry , to which he belonged , was doing duty at a convent some fifty or sixty miles from Manila , on the Manila and Dagupan Railroad , the Tagalos gave the usual annoyance . Their threatenings and feeble attacks came mostly from the west , but as the rainy season approached the torrential showers soon flooded that vicinity , so they changed their base of harassing to a village of bamboo and nipa palm huts on the further side of a river running parallel to the American outpost line on the south , about five thousand yards away . The intervening ground was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tall grass , and occasionally a bamboo jungle . The rebels had no sooner occupied this new position , than they began to entrench , take possession of the huts , and make themselves comfortable in other ways , giving promise to make matters lively for our troops the rainy season . They were frequently reenforced , greater activity was seen among them , and their boldness was unprecedented . Some days , when the tropical sun was beating down its sweltering rays , and our men were seeking every vestige of shade , the pesky little Filipinos would suddenly emerge into the open rice-field , deploy into line of skirmishers , and advance in a most threatening manner toward the American lines . The outposts would become alarmed and call for the regiment to support them . Out the companies would rush at double-time , amid swearing and sweat . When the deployments were made and all was ready to receive the dusky foe , he would suddenly face about before he had approached within effective rifle-range . The regiment 's orders were to hold the convent ; consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits . One morning during the latter part of July , 1899 , it was observed that there were no signs of the festive " gugus " in the accustomed place . No smoke ; no outposts ; no soldiers in short white pants and wide brimmed sombreros . This was an unusual thing  --  for , while Aguinaldo 's men were never known to hold a position against the mad attacks of our boys in blue , the voluntary abandonment of their works was an unheard-of proceeding . Treachery , or the same thing , Filipino strategy , was strongly suspected . They were playing some game , and the senior officer at the convent determined to learn the trump . Just as the shades of evening began to gather , on the day when the Tagalos made their mysterious disappearance , " Carabao Bill , " who was in command of his company on outpost , and had it quartered in a church which had once been held by the natives and abandoned under pressure , turned out his men to do the daily police . While he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shirking his duty , and had just been adding to his reputation for such , a battalion adjutant , a tall and handsome fellow with a slight partiality for legs , came dashing up on a native pony . His knees were bent and elevated toward his chin in order that his pedal extremities might not collide with the frail limbs of his steaming mount . Owing to the shortness of his stirrup-straps , he dismounted rather ungracefully , but soon gathered himself into military shape and smartly saluted " Bill , " saying : " Sir , the Commanding Officer presents his compliments and directs that at twelve o'clock to-night you take a non-commissioned officer and fourteen privates of your company and make a thorough reconnaissance of the grounds between here and the enemy 's position on the south , and determine if possible their whereabouts , strength , and probable intention ; and report to him immediately on your return . " His message delivered , the dashing young officer remounted and rode rapidly back to headquarters . Van Osdol slowly ran his freckled fingers through his auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his first sergeant to report to him . That worthy of multitudinous duties immediately appeared and received orders to arrange the detail for the reconnaissance duty . The night was blindingly dark . There was a density to the darkness that almost excluded the penetration of thought . The mind could pass no farther than the immediate vicinity . Since the sun had set a thick layer of clouds had lined the canopy of heaven , veiling the winks of the brightest stars and the benignant light of the moon . Sergeant Schriner , with soldierly punctuality , reported with the detail just as the sentry over the rifle-stacks at the church called in a subdued voice the hour of twelve . The little party promptly started on its hazardous mission , feeling its way through the matted bamboo jungles fringing the station  --  the officer leading , the sergeant and men following in " goose formation , " single-file ; each keeping in touch with the person before him . The advance was slow , for during the day the border around the place was almost impenetrable  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night to try men 's souls . Bolo parties frequently lay in ambush in these places of perfect hiding , and suddenly pounced upon the unsuspecting Americanos , and cut them to pieces before a hand could be raised in defense . Or there was the possibility of receiving a volley at close range ; for it was known that at night the Tagalos invariably approached nearer our lines . Since they had so mysteriously disappeared during the day , there was a strong probability that they would take up a new position that night . Where , no one knew . Lonely huts , amid vines and bamboo , that had been deserted when the place fell into our hands , were frequently passed . A half-starved dog , that had refused to follow its master from home , set up a mournful howl that tended to chill the marrow in the bones . The very silence was appalling . The breaking of a twig was as the discharge of a rifle . The lightest footfall resounded in the distance . To the party it seemed their shoes were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a hard struggle with Nature 's obstacles , and many halts to locate and determine the cause of suspicious noises , the little band finally emerged from the dense undergrowth into an open field . Almost simultaneously with the entrance into this open space there was a slight break in the clouds , and through the crevice the moon and stars gave sparingly of their light . The men were now deployed into line of skirmishers , and moved slowly and cautiously forward . There was just sufficient light to cause the imagination to see an enemy behind every rice-dyke or bunch of grass . The advance was made to within 150 paces of the river , when a halt was made . A vague outline of the village and trenches could be seen . Someone saw the dim figure of a rebel sentry . All eyes were turned on the spot , but he remained as fixed as the stars . Van Osdol decided to go alone to investigate the trenches and village , for in doing this there would be less danger of detection . The Sergeant remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , with revolver in hand , went on his way toward the river . His advance was slow  --  only a few feet at a time , then he would stop , lower his head to the ground , and listen intently . Now the trenches loomed up before him not more than fifty yards away . He strained his eyes in effort to see some signs of a living occupant , but nothing save the fanning of the giant leaves of the banana , and the waving of the tall grass under the gentle breeze of the south wind , was seen to move . There was reigning the stillness of death  --  that awful omen of lurking danger . A few feet further he wormed his way , now crawling on all fours . Just in front of him was a foot-bridge across the river , made of a single stringer of poles and a hand-rail with which to balance the body . Over this bridge he began to cross . Not more than two short steps were taken when he heard a low , whistling sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-rail , and listened , as fixed as a statue . The whistling was repeated ; this time nearer , but the direction indefinite . Was it the signal of an alarmed sentry , or was it one of the many nocturnal noises which the Island of Luzon produces ? Another low whistle  --  this time nearer ; then the speaking of that instinct that tells us of the presence of human beings in the blackness of the night . He slowly faced about . There within four feet of him , crouching upon the ground near the water 's edge , was a man with a rifle in his hand . Quick as a flash he threw the muzzle of his revolver in his face  --  remembering his surroundings , he never fired or uttered a word . Struggling between a whisper and a low talk , breathless through , fear , came the words of Private Holmes : " For God 's sake , do n't shoot , Lieutenant ; it 's me . " The officer lowered his revolver and beckoned the man to draw nearer . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that the men left behind had seen a number of moving figures in the village and trenches , not twenty-five yards away from where they were then crouching ; and that he had been sent to warn his officer of his danger . Here is where it tried the steel of " Carabao Bill . " The two kept their positions , scarcely daring to breathe lest they be heard . A plan of operations soon formed in the mind of the resourceful young officer . He whispered to Holmes to return and have the Sergeant hold his men in readiness , with magazines filled , for an emergency should he need them . Before Holmes had covered half the distance between the Lieutenant and the men , there was the sound as the cocking of a rifle ; a second later came the flash and sharp report of a Mauser . True to his training , the soldier fell to the ground and lay motionless . By the light of the flash Van Osdol saw the black face of the Filipino sentry who had fired . Soon began that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone produces . The shrill commands of the little officers in frantic endeavor to steady their men , the patter of many shoeless feet , the breaking of rifle-stacks , and the clanking of bayonets and swords , made a medley of camp music that was hideous to hear . The alarm was soon quieted . The aroused men returned to their sleep , and soon all was again quiet . The sentry who had fired at Holmes made loud and emphatic assertions in the twangy language of the Tagalo of having seen something at which to fire , but he was disbelieved , his belt removed , deprived of his rifle , and another man put in his place . This was pleasant for the squatting American officer on the bridge to behold . After patiently waiting in deep suspense for more than half an hour , he noticed the substituted sentry stand his rifle against a tree and sit down . A moment later his head fell forward and he was asleep . Determined to learn more of the enemy 's position and strength , " Carabao Bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the edge of the trench , a few yards to the left of the sleeping sentry . Here he made a rapid survey of the insurgent camp and position . Hundreds of them were lying stretched in sleep behind the shelter of the earthworks . His mission accomplished , he slowly turned to the unconscious sentry , thinking to secure the Mauser rifle as a trophy of the trip ; but he had no more than grabbed it when the man awoke with a start , and , like a flash , whipped out a shining bolo . Before the native had time to use his weapon , " Bill " raised the rifle above his head , and , with a powerful blow that resounded through the midnight air , sent him reeling over the trench among his slumbering companions . Then , with a shout that would tend to raise the dead , he began to empty his revolver into the rapidly awakening rebel soldiers below . Quick-witted Sergeant Schriner had no sooner heard the blow of the rifle and the shout of his commanding officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order for a charge ; and this small band of Uncle Sam 's men rushed like demons , screaming and yelling like maniacs , toward the little bridge  --  then over it , and began to pour an awful , close-range fire into the confused mass of humanity beyond the trench . The effect was magical . The drowsy enemy , taken unawares , routed and disorganized , beat a disgraceful retreat . In vain their officers tried to make them stand ; but the thought uppermost in every man 's mind was how to get to a place of security in the quickest possible time . In less time than it takes to tell it ; there were no Filipinos on the scene of action , excepting the dead and wounded . The number of these , considering the darkness of the night , did credit to American marksmanship . The sound of retreating feet was occasionally broken by the reports of a poorly directed volley by a few of the bolder characters , who had the rare nerve to halt and fire at the audacious " Yankees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taken a well-fortified position held by at least one thousand Tagalog . The victors sat down on the bank of the river to talk and laugh over the adventure . Meanwhile , the terror-stricken followers of the misguided Aguinaldo were being rallied by their officers beyond the range of fire . They were now aware of the inferiority in numbers of the Americans . To capture and hold the enemy 's works was not a part of Van Osdo 's instructions . Now realizing this , he decided to return and report . The men were called together , and the start began for the return . But the bridge ! In their wild advance over that frail structure it had been so shaken that it had fallen into the river and was washed away . The stream was full to the banks and too deep to wade . Not a third of the men could swim it with their arms and accouterments . The rebels were every minute drawing nearer and intensifying their fire . They were truly between fire and water . There were no boats to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raft of bamboo poles . On came the howling , revengeful , murderous black devils , frenzied by their recent defeat by this inferior party . The leaders were frantically waving their swords over their heads , and shouting words of encouragement to their men ; offering rewards to the first to reenter the trenches . Our diminutive army was now on the defensive . They leaped into the ditch and began to take pot-shots at the more daring of the rapidly approaching mass , determined , to hold the place or die in the attempt  --  indeed , there was no alternative . They succeeded in arresting the van . The enemy in turn sought shelter and began a fire that had results , for two Americans were soon rendered hors de combat ; the trench not affording as good shelter from the side from which the insurgents were approaching as on the other side . This long-range duel kept up for many minutes . Ammunition grew scarce and was finally exhausted , Van Osdol alone retaining loads in his revolver . From the slackening of the American fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and again began a mad rush for the trenches . Nothing remained for the bold little band to do but to meet them with the point of the bayonet and sell their lives at a precious price . The unhurt members of the detachment rallied around their gallant leader with bayonets fixed . Now the foremost of the wildly rushing horde was within a hundred yards . A brilliant thought struck Sergeant Schriner . He ran forward , grasped a Mauser near one of the rebels who had fallen when the trenches were taken , undid the belt of the lifeless owner , buckled it around his own waist , and returned to his comrades . All followed his example . With their own arms and ammunition the advance of the blood-thirsty enemy was again checked . With the newly acquired arms and ammunition the brave little band inflicted a decided injury to their would-be slayers . Now every shot was expended with the greatest caution . Again the American fire slackened , and again the stubborn insurrectos rushed forward . At last the recently acquired belts were emptied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rending the air with their hideous screams , the twice-checked enemy came madly on . Once more the defenders rallied to meet their death together . On a sudden the yells seemed a hundred times multiplied , and from the rear as well as front . Had they been surrounded ? To the rear the shouts were rapidly drawing nearer , but it was not the sharp and broken yell of the Tagalo  --  it was the familiar " Yankee yell " ; that invincible , " gugu " - terrorizing " Yankee yell . " Five hundred brave defenders of the stars and stripes had heard the first firing , when the trenches were taken , and immediately started to the rescue of their comrades . Upon his return , " Carabao Bill " reported that he found the enemy . " PATERNO , " THE DISGRACED MASCOT . Ostracism in Monkey Society . There is a certain analogy between the Chinaman 's pigtail and the prehensile appendage of that very astute little animal , the monkey , for the proud possessors of either of these grotesque physical adornments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That there are reasons to believe that the tail of the monkey is his credentials to the polite society of his race the following incident will serve to substantiate : One day in May , 1899 , when one of our infantry regiments which had been ascending the Rio Grande , in the Island of Luzon , in pursuit of the wily and festive Filipino , had halted to rest , it was decided to have an exhibition of company mascots . Each company had a monkey  --  an even dozen of them all told . There were " Pat " and " Mike , " who proudly wore strips of billiard-table cloth about their necks ; and " Aguinaldo " and " Paterno , " named respectively for the leader and brains of the Tagalo insurrection . " Aguinaldo " wore with dignity a little tin sword by his side that one of the men of his company had made from a salmon can , while " Paterno " looked gay and world-wise in a ballet skirt ingeniously contrived by a company tailor from a bit of red mosquito-bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some distinguished military commander to whom they were supposed to bear some facial resemblance . The show was a decided success . Every contestant put aside his work-a-day tricks , and performed those only that were intended for gala days . " Aguinaldo " was a sure winner from the first , for he had learned to draw his sword , wave it dramatically over his head , cheer for a few seconds in monkey talk , then break and dash to the rear . " Paterno " was an easy candidate for second honors . He gave a giddy dance and looked coy . But " pride goeth before a fall . " It was decided to let the mascots have a social gathering . They were brought into a ring formed by grinning soldiers . All went well for a moment or two . They grinned , caressed , and made merry . Just in the very heights of the ecstacies , a playful young monk , that had been exchanging " sheep 's eyes " with " Paterno , " in a fit of playfulness made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was none . The news spread like the incoming of " amigos " after the capture of a Filipino town . A damper fell upon the meeting . All scorned the maimed fellow with that frosty bearing that a reigning belle bestows upon a promising debutante , or the monkey family toward their tailless fellow-monks . The disgraced animal begged and entreated for further notice , and a renewal of the general good time that had been so unceremoniously ended by the recent discovery , but his solicitations were in vain  --  none condescended to again notice him . With " Paterno , " patience at last ceased to be a virtue . Knowing that the playful young monk who had made the discovery caused his downfall , he looked for a moment at that guileless-appearing creature . The expression of his face rapidly changed from a look of entreaty to that of ferociousness . With a vicious bound , he pounced upon his enemy , clawing , tearing , and biting . The other members of this solemn gathering simply separated the belligerents , none daring to do harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle , " Paterno " withdrew from the crowd . In the melee he had lost his skirt . He looked long and pitifully at his fellow-mascots who had so suddenly turned against him . Great teardrops gathered in his eyes and trickled down his hairy cheeks . Raising his head , he spied a bamboo thicket in the distance . With a wild yell , he sprang through the line of sympathetic soldiers and made for the jungle . Company E had had their last sight of " Paterno , " their tailless monkey mascot.
