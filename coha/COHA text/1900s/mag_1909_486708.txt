" After all , " says an able and effective writer in the Contemporary - Review , " thoSe who want Socialism want it because they want liberty , because they are tired of being crushed and thwarted in a confused and planless world where men and peoples struggle and die without knowing for what they struggle or why they live . " The sentiment is fine , and it undoubtedly underlies the attitude of the finest and highest spirits among those who to-day range themselves More or less completely on the side of Socialism . But what assurance have they that any socialistic reconstitution of society would furniah that basis of life which they crave ? What reason have they to think that , in the new world they dream of , men would be penetrated with a knowledge of " what they struggle for and why they live " ?

That no such foundation exists to-day , Socialist enthusiasts have no difficulty in showing ; but that any change in social arrangements will bring about a state of things in which men will know a whit better than they now do " for what they struggle and why they live , " none of these writers gives us the faintest reason for believing . Men may be happier or less happy ; they may be better or worse ; but the meaning and purpose of life will remain , just as it has always been , a mystery illumined only by the inward experiences of each individual .

The typical Socialist Is set aglow by dreams of the beauty that might be breathed into the lives of all men if only the conquests of science and invention were properly utilized for the broadening of every man 's horizon , the enrichment , of every man 's opportunities ! , Tolstoy sees hope only in the abandonment-of all the vanities of learning and art , , all the endless deVelopments of scientific progress , and in the devotion of mankind to the pursuit of the simplest duties and the cultivation of the simplest virtues . The ordinary Socialist holds that when progress has done her perfect work , all mankind will be emancipated , asa fortunate minority now are , from the dull pressure of exacting toil ; and , he assumes that this freedom will carry with it true felicity . Tolstoy believes that only in the common performance of homely tasks is the salvation of men to be found .

That science is not only vain , but harm= ful ; that its development has been but part of the exploitation of the poor by the rich ; that the only true science is that which teaches man " how to live true to conscience , before God , his appointed term of life " ? these familiar Tolstoyan doctrines are , of course , set forth . " People need only cease to believe in the science introduced by force and by rewards , and not study it , but keep to the one free science " of right living , and the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself . " How purely this belief of Tolstoy 's as to the future is an net of faith , may , perhaps , be best inferred from a single instance . He has been bitterly denouncing the desire of any workingman for education , based upon the deceitful plea that this education will be used in the service of the people ; what really happens , he says , is merely that one of the oppressed becomes one of the oppressors . The poor he describes as " the half-naked , half-famished , dirty , never-resting , illiterate men , made dependent for life by poverty , who work sixteen hours a day for two rubles a Week . " And - it does not seem to occur to Tolstoy ; - that it is only in Russia , where- . popular education is unknown , that even the most extravagant agitator would dream of so describing the condition of the working masses ; nor that the superiority ' of the state of the people in countries in which modern ideas of science are:predominant has any bearing on his notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialist millennium centres , as does Tolstoy 's , upon the thought of a fundamental - harmony running thrOugh the whole life of society and giving to human existence a significance to- which , , under present conditions , it can ' lay nol claim : But whether such ' harmony , as is aimed at in either case , supposing it attainable , would truly satisfy the longings of hUman nature is a question on which either gives us little help .

And this once admitted , what becomes of the arraignment of the present condition of society because it does not give life an absolute meaning , does not enable men to know " for what they struggle and why they live " ? BOOKER WASHINGTON 'S GREATEST SERVICE . The remarkable success of Booker T. Washington 's latest speaking-tour in the South emphasizes again his usefulness to the whole country . In this role as an interpreter of one race to another , pleading for harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patriotic service which it would be hard to overestimate . One of the foremost white educators now at work in the South exclaimed on hearing of the details of Mr. Washington 's recent trip through Tennessee : " Now I believe there is going to be a revolution in the South in favor of the negro . " Of the fifty thousand Persons who , it is estimated , attended his meetings , nearly one-half were white ; and in every case he was received with an enthusiasm which would have turned the head of any less balanced and sagacious leader . Lest we be accused of exaggeration , we would remind our readers that Judge Floyd Estill , at Winchester , Tennessee , introduced Washington the negro , once a homeless and destitute wanderer , as " a fine type of the true Southern gentleman " ; that Judge J. Ti . Price , another typical Southerner of high position , classed Booker Washington with the first President , with Thomas Jefferson , Madison , and Monroe , Lee , and other Virginia worthies , as among that State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steen of the Circuit Court introduced him with these words : We believe that as the patriarchs of old were inspired by God to lead their people out of darkness into light , to guide them on the right road to right living and suc-cess , - so he who is to speak to us to-night is inspired to lead his race to higher , better things . But his message is not for you alone It is not alone for this city or this State By helping you he helps us ; by helping you he helps every man , woman , and child in all this broad land of ours . All of this is enough to make any man accustomed to the ravings of the ordinary Southern office-seeker , or firebrand lecturer of the Tillman order , rub his eyes and ask whether a revolution is not actually at hand . Yet these compliments to Mr. Washington and his work were received with the heartiest approval by thousands of earnest white listeners . Still , this turning to Mr. Washington by such men of prominence ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South coming to the ? front Men like the judges we have quoted have come to- see that if the races are to live in peace and comfort , the negroes who are progressing , who are laboring in Mr. Washington 's - spirit , must ' be sustained and upheld . More and more , - too , men , of standing are bound to recognize the obligation the South owes to the negro . Speaking at Brownsville in Mr. Washington 's presence , Judge John R. Bond of the Tennessee Circuit Court said : " I was born and reared here in the South , and have associated all of my life with negroes . I feel that as a Southern whiteman I owe a debt to the negro I can never repay . " His gratitude was specially for the way in which the negroes protected and cared for the white women - and children who were left at home during the war . But there is even a higher and more sacred obligation than that  --  the duty at caring for a backward race because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man who would injure a defective or crippled child must be an outcast from society ; the time will come when all nations will take a similar attitude towards those human beings who are handicapped , particularly if , as in the case of our negro , their plight is largely no fault of their own . To this quiet but ever-present appeal the true Southern gentleman is bound to respond , because he has a heart , because essentially he believes in fair play , and because he is an American . Further proof of this lies in the space given to Mr. Washington 's trips in South Carolina , in Virginia , in Mississippi , and in Tennessee , by the newspapers of those sections The Tennessee press has yielded to Mr. Washington its first pages and reported his speeches in full , even where the proceedings called for four or more columns . At Charleston , last winter , the prominent editors joined the Mayor in welcoming the colored orator ; in Tennessee the editors have sat upon his platforms . More than that , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructing its correspondents to bear down as lightly as possible upon negro crime and to say as much as possible about negro strivings for betterment . The Nashville Banner is another journal that is doing its best to be Just to the negro , and trying not to lay undue stress upon the crimes of the rascals who disgrace their race  --  just as there are plenty of white men who do the devil 's work . The Columbia State has also long battled for fair play ; recently it has incurred unmerited criticism for denouncing the unjust punishment of a negro because he was a negro . TO come back to Mr. Washington , the greatest service he can render to-day is plainly not at Tuskegee , and not at the White House conferring as to appointments , but on the stump in the South . His bearing and popularity enable white men to speak out freely where it would sometimes be difficult to do so if the negro endorsed were less well known . Public opinion is far more dreaded in the South than in the North ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom and habit than anywhere else in this country , for social ostracism is more quickly brought to bear . Let him who doubts this read Walter Page 's new novel , " The Southerner . " The reason why the educator we have quoted sees a revolution coming is because Southern men everywhere are beginning to break away from the conventions , even the terrorism , which have kept them silent heretotore . At any rate , Mr. Washington is to-day a great interpreter and leader . This must be recognized , whether one agrees with him in all his views or not . It is just fifty years since the death of John Brown ; who could have thought in 1859 that a colored man in 1909 would have so won the gratitude and esteem of the nation ? THE ENGLISH CRISIS . Thoroughly iscounted as last week 's vote in the House of Lords had been , it yet came at the end with the sense of a great historic event . It marks the imminence of a vital change in the English Constitution . Say what one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . They have laid rude hands on a Money Bill . This is an act which all the text-book writers , of whatever party , and a long line of statesmen , whether Liberal or Conservative  --  including among the latter Lord Salisbury and Mr. Balfour himself  --  have declared to be beyond the competence of the upper chamber . Constitutionally , we are in the presence of an indubitable revolution . The Lords have the legal power to throw out the budget , in the sense that without their consent , and the King 's , it can not become law , but the constitutional doctrine is firmly established that they have no longer the right to withhold their consent to a money bill which has passed the Commons , any more than has the King . From the standpoint of the English Constitution , the Lords are wholly and hopelessly in the wrong . If that Constitution were written as ours is , and enforceable by a suit in a Supreme Court , there can be no doubt that the action of the Lords would be declared null @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not only unwritten , but fluid and changeable . The English court of last resort is the English democracy . This is shrewdly recognized by the terms of the motion adopted by the Lords , namely , that they would not accept the budget until it had been passed upon by the people . Thus the aristocratic house would seek to appear more democratic than the Commons . But it may be retorted that this semblance of deference to the democracy is a sham . The Lords profess to appeal to the mass of voters , but in reality they are acting in a way to deprive one-half the voters of the effectiveness of their ballot . That is to say , Liberal votes will not hereafter count , in the matter of taxing , if a per- . manently Conservative and non-elective House of Lords may reject any taxes of which it does not approve . The Sort of referendum on the budget which the Lords are blandly proposing is only a half-way thing . It is logically and politically necessary to go further . The electors will pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond this year 's budget ; and will , they sustain the Liberal party , make it certain that sweeping guarantees against . meddling ; by the Lords will be exacted . This , then , is the far-reaching question which will soon be passed upon in a , general election . From it , the House of Lords may emerge , either with its powers enlarged and its prestige enormously enhanced , or so discredited that it will remain in the English system as little more than a gilded nullity . Yet we must be on-our guard against exaggerating the crisis by taking it for granted that the English will suddenly become doctrinaire and apply root-andbranchmethods . Walter Bagehot publicly thanked God that his countrymen never mixed logic with their politics , and we may be sure that they will not  - -  begin to do so overnight . Extremists on both sides will prophesy dire things in the course of the impending cam-paign : - but'it may well prove that the ingrained English moderation will not " permit violent extremes in either , direct tion . On the-one hand , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , of a single-chamber government driven into wild Socialistic excesses . But no electioneering oratory will persuade sober Englishmen that anything like that can result . The other picture is of an hereditary House of Lords , emboldened by its great triumph , if the Conservatives win , setting itself up haughtily above the Commons in all matters . But that is also too lurid . Mr. Balfour himself , if he were to become Prime Minister again , might easily be the first to read the overweening Lords a severe lesson , and to threaten them with all kinds of pains and penalties if they thought to ignore or over-ride the wishes of the directly elected representatives of the people of England . It is evident , too , that this practical English ' good sense will be applied to the immediate problem of the financial confusion caused by the rejection of the budget . This has been called " chaos , " and it might easily be made so by the Ministry . With the failure of the budget , all the annual and increased taxes collected since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered by ' a suit at law . Their total amount the Economist reckons at more than 8250 , - 000,000 ; and there would also be the rest of the fiscal year to provide for . To raise this large sum by a loan or Treasury . Bills would be awkward . But the Government has already notified importers of tea that the tea duties will surely be validated , and it is reported that the income tax will go on being collected without protest . It might be thought good tactics for the Liberal Cabinet to make the financial situation created by the Lords appear as bad as possible ; but the leaders of a party which stands for good order and sound finance do well to show that they are prepared to do everything in their power to minimize the disturbance . Liberal hopes and the Liberal cause do not depend upon inflaming men 's minds about disordered finances . The coming contest-is one into which the Liberals will enter unitedly and with high spirit . They could not have asked better ground on which to fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Power : As Lord , Morley is reported to have said in - private , whatever the Government under 1 took to do seemed to be unpopular . Bye , elections were running ' against , them heavily . But the budget and the conflict with the- Lords have changed the whole face of the political sky . Where the election prophets were saying a year ago that the Liberals were certain to be severely beaten at the next general election , they now-forecast a Liberal majority  --  though , of course , much reduced from that of 1906 . Whatever the outcome , the struggle will be of intense interest because such great issues and momentous consequences are involved . The thrilling watchwords which the Liberals n , ow have at their command have not echoed in England since 1832 . Americans have special reason to follow the political battle with eagerness , since it is certain that the high debate on popular rights and on taxing accumulated wealth can not fail to have a powerful influence in this country . We in the United States shall soon have these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHILDREN . We Americans are wont to assent , shamefacedly enough , to the reflections made by foreign criticism upon our conduct of the business of parentage . Our children are seen and very much heard , they are ill-mannered , conceited , insubordinate  --  tyrants of the household . Their chief hope , not , to be sure , of good manners , but of decent citizenship , lies in the curiously strict discipline provided by our public-school system . Confessing our individual inadequacy , we appoint a formidable pedagogue whose duty it is not merely to teach the young idea how to shoot , but to teach the young will how to submit . Later , the business is taken up by experience  --  by the exactions of business and social life . In the end our children turn out much better than we have any reason to ex- - pest , much better , certainly , than we deserve . As individuals , we have done what we could to make nuisances of them . ? - In some such guise we must see ourselves as others see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a totally false presentment ? , There is , no doubt , a tit for tat . Our feebly good-natured handling of children is , we may- retort , due our acceptance of ' children as the staples of domestic life . ! Among other peoples , it ' seems to us that- they are oftenett regarded as neeessary'hut ' inconvenient incidents The English child of ? the betted clasS , aswe see him in fibtion , is pretty strictly confined to the nursery and the playground until the Wished-for hour arrives of his dismissal to the public school . At intervals his " gov'nor " recognizes his existence with a pat on the head , a platitude , or a fiver . And his memories of childhood are touched with dreamy visions of " the mater " in a ball-gown momentarily ( and not without sentiment ) inspecting her safely dormant offspring as she passes to the real business of life . This sort of casual acquaintance between parent and child does not seem to exhaust the possibilities of the relationship. - We flatter ourselves that the American child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look askance at the importation of the foreign method among our " best people . " But we confess certain misgivings as to our own wisdOm . It is to be hoped that the alien observer may have noted a cheering sign or two of late , as , for example , our growing sentiment against the Comic Supplement . This offence has become so extreme as actually to bring itself home to our nostrils . But the source of it , the root from which it springs , and which it brings to a horrid efflorescence , is perhaps less generally perceived . Much nonsense has been put forth about the regulation of children 's reading . This is a late day to attempt a rigid censorship of an urchin 's literary acquaintances , and as for leading him , there is probably no method better than that of our grandfathers  --  to turn him loose in a mans library and let him taste its strong fare . For the rest , any normal boy ought to relish the absurdities of the dime novel , and any natural girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale . Blood-curdling adventure is as necessary to the diet of the one as sugary romance is to that of the other . Even the watery pap provided by the average Christmas book or in the pages of the ordinary children 's puldication , probably does little harm if less good to the adolescent morale : But we have a class of writers " for youth " whose influence is really demoralizing . It is their postulate which the Comic Supplement develops to the point of nausea . We mean that order'of scribbling parasites who'make a business of flattering children into the belief , or the " working hypothesis , " that they are wiser and better than their elders . Honest parent , do you know why your boy likes Horatio Alger ? Did you ever read " Do or Dare , " or one of itS congeners ? If so , you realize that a large part of the charm lies in the superiority under all circumstances of the youthful hero . His father , or guardian , or employer , is a grown man , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little of each . The boy himself , from the first page , is exhibited in the enviable act of doing or daring , his elders at every possible turn . There is no danger for him in " sassing back . " No shingle is ever permitted to fall upon his sacred person ; he is immune from all the ills that a mortal puerility is naturally heir to . In short , he is the kind of fellow a fellow would like to be . The same bauble of triumphant adolescence is dangled before the fancy of the girl reader . We have been moved to these remarks by chance contact with a new story by a popular writer for girls . The heroine has always been downtrodden by a heartless and stingy mother . We have the advantage of admittance to the scene at the moment when the worm turns . After the first few pages we , . have nothing to fear for . the daughter , who thereafter has everything her own way  --  a selfish , vain , saucy little prig , greatly admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not hesitate to describe her as " living the Golden Rule . " It is hard to believe in the honesty of the purveyor of this sort of commodity . We do not see that he is to be distinguished in kind from those notorious offenders who are guilty of the red and yellow enormities of the Comic Supplement . GOOD LETTER-WRITING . " Authors , my altogether dear woman , ca n't write letters . At best they squeeze out an essay now and then . " James Rus-sell Lowell wrote to this effect precisely forty years ago , in addressing Miss Nor-ton ; and he added : " They are thinking of their punctuation , of crossing their is and dotting their i 's , and can not al-together forget themselves in their cor-respondent , which I take to be the true recipe . " . The assertion of - fact is true enough : the writer of good books is not necessarily a good letter-writer . He is even apt to . be , like Dr. Holmes , only " a very good correspondent as a reader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted to quarrel . The best letter-writer does not forget himself in his correspondent : he leaves it to his correspondent to do the forgetting . And while on the subject of rules for letter-writing , let us not overlook James Howell : " A Letter or Epistle should be short-coated , and closely couch 'd ; a Hungerlin becomes a Letter more handsomely than a gown . " Such recollections come to one who reads Lafcadio Hearn 's " Japanese Letters " in the current Atlantic Monthly , with an introduction* by Elizabeth Bisland . " Great letter-writers , like other artists , " observes Miss Bisland , ' must needs have the original birth-gift ; but this gift , to ripen to complete fruition , requires certain fostering circumstances . " Some loneliness of character or of condition is one of these " fostering circumstances " : either shyness , or a lack of ease in oral expression , or want of sympathetic companionship . " Madame de Sdvigne and Lord Chesterfield were both reported stiff and dry in conversation , " says Miss Bisland ; " FitzGerald was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to others for intimate intercourse ; and the same was true of Thackeray . Stevenson 's long exile made his pen his best means of fellowship . " All this is not pure theory . To expect the ordinary " literary man " to write letters is , commonly , much like expecting the carpenter to spend his holidays ( as Gautier expressed it ) " planing boards for the fun ? of it . " He demands a special provocation , an eloquent incitement . Such an incitement or inspiration was Lafcadio Hearn 's . " His shyness was extreme , " as one testifies who ' knew him well . " ' His life , from his nineteenth year , was a ' sojourn in foreign lands . Without family ties for twenty years , those ties , when formed in middle age , bound him to aliens in race and tongue . ' He attained to a greater intuitive knowledge of the Japanese than it has been given to other Occidental men to have . Yet he never so mastered the language as to be able freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children .. " I 'm writing , " he told Professor Chamberlain of the Imperial University , in one of the newly published letters , " just because I feel lonesome . . . . However , if I can amuse you at all , you will forgive me . " Forgive him ? One may easily answer for Chamberlain as to that . What is more , it is easy to pity him , that subtle colorist and etcher : The illusions are forever over ; but th memory ' of many pleasant things remain3 . I know much more about the Japanese than I did a year ago ; and still I am far from understanding them well . Even my own little wife is somewhat mysterious still to me , though always in a lovable way . Hearn is not , we think , one of the greatest English letter-writers , although some of his letters written from New Orleans shake us in that opinion . Certainly his letters have always a fascinating subject-matter ; it was his to live in strange places , to read strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , to be treasured as no other writer 's since Edward FitzGerald . In it , one finds the same vivid color and flexible craftsmanship with - which we made acquaintance in his tales of old Japan , and in his essays and travel-. sketches . When other letters were published , three years ago , we called his touch ' ' magic , " and we reiterate the word . Nor was he writing for the public : only out of his great love , for friends , and out of his pitiable loneliness . Here was one letter-writing author unpreoccupied with his punctuation ; one whose thought went farther than the " crossing of his t 's and dotting of his i 's . " And yet , in him , we have one of our rare writers with an artistic conscience : a faculty that we have lost in this era of " virile " style , masking a literary anemia.
