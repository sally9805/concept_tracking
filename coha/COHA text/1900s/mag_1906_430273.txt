 | TRAINING the sluggish blacks into a unified army of workers , officering them , distributing them ; weeding out the unfit whites , disciplining the rest to honest and intelligent effort ; reorganizing the wretched makeshift of a railroad ; patiently unraveling the tangled incompetence of the commissary ; deciding technical questions about dams , locks , and excavations ; superintending the building of new wharves , machine shops , a dry dock ; solving problems of water supply and sewering ; forever on the tramp , busy about a thousand things , is the Chief Engineer , John F. Stevens . The mastery that his personality has already won over his force is the most significant fact to note in our progress on the Isthmus . He is the one man to grapple the task who has had the broad view , the National view ? who has made driving , ordered work the inspiration of the day . And his character is the best pledge we have that now at last the Canal is going to be built quickly and well , to stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a monument of American practical efficiency . A tall , broad-shouldered man of fiftytwo , with gray eyes steady in an open , swarthy , mustached face , he looks squarely at you while he talks with a boy 's frankness . He is deliberate , forcible , intense , yet , except upon a reminiscent evening , speaking little . There is in him something of the canny Maine Yankee , something of the pushing pioneer of the plains . His day 's work ' is so promptly despatched that he is never a single letter of it in arrears . He is never in a hurry , and can give an hour almost any time to a man with legitimate business ; yet of his twelve daily working hours he can never spare five minutes for a trivial thing . Ever since the winter when he was tamping ties in Texas at $1.10 a day , he has made his own way , and he has done it by prodigiously hard work and an infallibility of common sense that amounts to genius . After his twenty years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Northern , James J. Hill , its shrewd builder-president , said of him : " He is the most capable engineer in railroad construction that I have ever known . He is always in the right place at the right time , and does the right thing without asking questions about it . " But reputation does not count for much with the hard-headed engineers and mechanics on the Isthmus . They judge a man by what they see themselves . What they saw in the new " Chief " they liked from the first . There was no condescension , no airs of authority about him . He never used a special train ; the ordinary " local " or " freight "  | suited his convenience , and the " brains car " was suddenly a thing of the past . He brought no cronies down to fat jobs . The men he personally selected for positions had a way of proving their ability ; and every man he discharged , by nearly common consent , deserved dismissal . He was a hard taskmaster , but he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no part of the line that he did not cover repeatedly on foot . " Take a spy-glass , " runs one of the jokes of the Isthmus , " and up or down the road you 'll see Stevens striding over the ties . " He went into the kitchens unannounced ? " not his way to hunt ducks with a brass band , " said a fireman to me ? and saw that the same dinner was served him that the men were eating . If anything was wrong , the manager heard of it . Other acts told the men his character . First , there was the instant veto he put on the proposal to build an expensive residence for the Chief Engineer at Ancon . Panama and the swirl of its official social life were not for him . He chose to go to the heights of Culebra to live , that he might be on the ground where his most important work lay . And it was not long before some one in the Building Department told how he had blue-penciled the plan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had " no more style than the Chief 's hat . " Every day each mess had a new story to hear of him , and it always had its significance . Encouragement for the man who does things , reproof for the dodger of responsibility , were the frequent burden of the tale . A carpenter had been ordered to build some sheds at Gorgona . He wrote back to Stevens to say that there was some old French equipment in the way , and asking what he should do . Stevens scribbled on the bottom of the letter , " Wait till I have a free Sunday , and I 'll come down and move it for you . " His rebukes are always bluff , but there is usually a note of kindness in them . Here is what he said to a young engineer who gave him an unasked-for report on a difficult job that had been set him : " You are not hired to advise me how your work can be done . You are hired to do it . You may make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are equal to your work . And remember this : There is only one mistake you can make that will be absolutely fatal with me , and that is to do nothing . " These things give the spirit of the man . Admiration and confidence have followed respect until it seems that Stevens has inspired the personal loyalty of every one on the Isthmus . And this is not only because he is square and human ? the plain American citizen . It is based above all upon the conviction of his supreme practical ability . Men have seen his careful , rapid reorganization of a vast force , motleyed with some hundreds of Jacks of all trades and none . Among those who have " made good " under Stevens are a dentist turned gang foreman , a hotel-keeper , a hospital steward , a tattooed lion-tamer , a stenographer . They have seen put in charge of the work at last a man who is capable of grasping the thing as a whole , who knows by instinct what he can neglect , finds fit men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Colon to Panama , feel that he knows all that is going on . And so there has grown up a confidence that Stevens will meet every difficulty as it arises , and , foreseeing everything , providing everything , finish the Canal ( a lieutenant of police made the comparison ) as Lord Kitchener carried his military railroad across the Nubian desert to Khartum , surmounting all the great obstacles of the way and completing it on the very day that he had set months before . Balzac makes old Pere Goriot say that for a man to succeed in life he must get his aim right , and then drive for the mark like a cannon-ball . Stevens has certainly infused intensity into the work . He is insisting upon longer hours and harder labor than the Government exacts of its employees anywhere else in the tropics . He has made his men understand that there is a great deal of lost time to be made up ; for the days are not long past when nobody worked but the ants and the typewriters , and the foremen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  | page deleted  | tion , occasional lack of confidence and loyal support both from superiors and inferiors . There is certainly a unanimity of engineering opinion about him , and it unites in praise of his professional ability . So far , at least , in cordial approval , the Division Engineers ? Maltby , Sullivan , Gerig , Holcombe , and Dauchy ( who is now retired ) ? are all glad to be quoted . The Chief Engineer , as is his wont , was emphatic : " Mr. Wallace is one of the ablest engineers in our country , and his work here was what I would have expected of him ? earnest , clever , and thorough . You can make that as strong as you like ! " Progress under the Chief Engineer is now sane and orderly ? rapid , but no longer feverish . There is high average team play , " and this because there is a strong and responsible head . Our conciliatory policy toward the Panamanians is a less serious drawback here than elsewhere , for within the Zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a very hampering condition in Panama , . where its 390 policemen ? the whole city has less than 25,000 inhabitants ? seem especially set to hinder the work of paving . We justify the laying of this very expensive brick roadway on the ground of sanitation . In reality it is a municipal improvement almost purely for the benefit and convenience of the Panamanians . Yet they will arrest a foreman if his hose bursts , peremptorily close an open street to a sand-cart , and put the driver in jail if he tries to cross an open lot . But there are worse obstacles than these . One is inefficient men . There are skilled workmen enough of most sorts , but good foremen , locomotive engineers , and steam shovel men are still urgently needed . In the lack of them the best of the poor material that offers must be used , and the work suffers . A portentous difficulty for the Canal builders is the cumbersome and obstructive direction of the work from Washington . The lack of actual firsthand knowledge of affairs on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing-stock of Panama . And the bungling and delays of Washington produce something between resignation and despair on the Zone when supplies fail to come . Here is an instance : A contract for 500 box freight-cars was awarded on the 9th of last June ; a guarantee of shipment within four months was required of the contractor . In a little more than ten months between sixty and seventy had arrived ! The traffic of the railroad has increased more than fifty per cent . within the last year ; and for the want of these freight-cars much of the labor of transportation is doubled , perishable goods under tarpaulins are monopolizing the Commission 's new flat dumping-cars , and more or less serious trouble results every week . Where lies the difficulty ? The Chief Engineer himself does not know . Perhaps even more irritating is the red tape . Mr. Stevens has done some brave slashing at it , but the system remains . In its essence it is the Government system , with army modifications introduced by the Walker Commission , and a few independent additions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads and great construction companies detest the delays , the extravagance , the stupidity of the Government method , Even the routine phrasing of correspondence , with its " I have the honor to report , " revolts them . It 's a government of clerks ! " one of them angrily told me . In a case of which I have copies of the papers , a carpenter had to make a regular written application to his superior for permission to put a saw-cut through a ten-foot board , though he would have had authority to use two boards five feet long ? the exact needed length ? if he could have found them in his racks . Such an instance is extreme , and merely serves as an index to the excesses of the system . But take the story of an ordinary requisition . Suppose some lead pipe is called for and is out of stock . Following the rules , the printed form is filled out ; five copies of it are made , signed , and distributed to the proper offices . Washington in due course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months for delivery . Two weeks usually pass between the day of shipment in New  | York and the day of unloading in Colon . Then , if a length of pipe is wanted at Ahorca Lagarto , the same process of requisitioning with signed copies in quintuple must be observed , and , with the present state of inefficiency of the railroad , perhaps two more weeks wasted in waiting and sending out tracers and inquiries . The master mechanic in one of the largest shops on the Zone told me that he could not get a bolt without signing his name twelve times . As much of this as is required by law can not be avoided , but practical men believe that a full half of the red tape could be dispensed with , and a full half of these delays saved . Depressing and unsettling is the uncertainty as to the type of the Canal . A decision matters little as far as most of the present work is concerned . That must be done , whatever the type . And it is untrue that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I asked him about the rumor and he answered : " Now that I have put my hand to the plow , it 's not going to be taken off unless somebody pulls it off . " Congress has already had several months for deliberation , and , a decision is very much needed , if equipment proper to the plan adopted is ... to be ordered in time to save further months of delay . Above all , it is needed to put heart into the men , and to give them a goal set clearly before their eyes . The old idea of a nsformable canal , which the framers of the Spooner Law had in mind , has been wholly abandoned . In almost their only unanimous decision , the Board of Consulting Engineers condemned it as impracticable , and it is no longer discussed on the Isthmus . The contest is between sealevel and lock canal , and all the engineers here ? I know of no exception ? are almost passionate advocates of the lock and dam plan . They can not believe that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way : A sea-level canal would be likely to cost , by the Chief Engineer 's estimate , at least $150,000,000 more than a'lock canal . Three-quarters of the extra excavation would be through rock ? most of it rock under water ? with increased possibilities of mud slides , such as that which plunged into the Cut last winter . No one can tell even approximately how long the work would take . Once finished , the Canal would be so narrow a ditch ? thirty-nine of the forty-nine miles two hundred feet wide or less ? that traffic through it would be exceedingly slow ; for , when two ships were to meet , one of them would have to tie up at a station on the bank to let the other pass . And silting mud would be so grave a matter that a fleet of dredges working constantly from one end of the Canal to the other would almost certainly be necessary . Not a single one of these objections can lie against the lock canal . Twenty miles of it , mostly through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rover wide , and twenty-three miles more would be from three hundred to eight hundred feet wide . Ships could pass each other rapidly . The necessary occasional dredging would never be an embarrassment to traffic ; and there are probably no serious surprises in store . The lock and dam plan alone would satisfy the desire of our people to have the Canal quickly completed for the advantage of our commerce and of our National defense . And the most heartening thing about it is the hope each man will have to see the work through for himself , and not handed down for another generation to finish . Go where you will on the Isthmus and talk with mechanics and clerks and engineers . Some , as they understand the problem , will lay stress on one thing , some on another . But in the end for every one of them this alternative of choice stands clearly forth : A speedy and practical plan approved by the men on the ground who have mastered the patient work of drills and surveys ? a plan to rouse something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a long and hard hill . Or , the blind imposition of a task interminable , vague , half-studied , perhaps impossible . The task is gigantic as it is . The Great Cut already seems a canon , but there must still be taken out of it a mass of earth and rock equal to fifteen times the cubic contents of the Pyramid of  | Cheops . The steam shovels must still go 140 feet below the lowest point where they are delving to-day . It is as if the new giant steamer Amerika were buried there and our excavation had only just laid bare the top of her highest mast . Nearly half of all this spoil of Culebra , or its equivalent , must be used to rear the mountain darn of earth at Gatun . At Gatun , too , the duplicate flight of three locks will be built , requiring the greatest mass of masonry ever laid together since the days of the Egyptians . To supply the material for this , 125 car-loads of concrete must be shoveled into place from the mixing platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Great Pyramid rises nearly to the height of the Washington Monument , spreads over thirteen acres , and took the labor of one hundred thousand men twenty years for its building . The finished locks of Gatun will measure more than half its vast bulk , and stand for one of the great wonders of the modern world . It is the work at Gatun , not the Cut of Culebra , that is the hard task before us ? so the Chief Engineer holds . " , Doing your very best , how quickly can a lock canal be built ? " I asked him . " I do n't like digging dirt with a pencil , " was his answer , " but here 's a guess : The dams and locks on the Pacific side of the Isthmus we shall easily finish before the rest of the work . And Culebra is not our longest job . Our nine shovels took out of it 240,000 yards last month . With our full equipment we shall be able to handle a million yards a month and something over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years ; add fifty per cent . for breakdowns and the delays we shall have from the rainy seasons , and you will have the Great Cut excavated in six years . But the Gatun dam and locks will take at least eight years of hard work , unless we install electric light and use night shifts of laborers . Give us the order to do that and the authority , and we could probably finish the Canal in seven years . " " Would contracting the work hurry the end of it ? " " That is one of the usual advantages of employing a contractor . To be practicable , the entire work should be offered for bids in eight or ten different divisions " ? the old French company had seventeen contractors and over forty sub-contractors ? " but there is a danger in the contract proposal . If Congress makes the letting of the work obligatory , the door will be open to the biggest scandal of our day . We should preserve the right to reject bids unless the lowest bidding price is less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We now have very exact figures and know precisely how much it costs us per cubic yard to excavate every kind of material at every part of the Isthmus . " " Would an earthquake damage your locks ? " " There is little chance of it . They are to be so massive that they would suffer less from a shock than the masonry dam up the Chagres , which must be used for a sea-level canal . But earthquakes are unknown on the Isthmus . In an old ruined church in Panama an engineering impossibility that they call a flat arch spans the nave . How it stands at all is a mystery . Certainly an earthquake would bring it down ; but it has held its place unshaken for more than two hundred years , and I think that is proof sufficient that we need not fear earthquakes . " " But when all your work is over and done , and the waters of a 110-mile lake are thrown against your earthen dam at Gatun , can you be sure that it will stand ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think of the dimensions of the dam we have planned . At water level it is to be 374 feet thick . At the base it will be over half a mile through . A dam built as we propose to build this one is just as solid as any mountain that the Lord ever made of the same material . A pressure of eighty-five feet of water could no more carry it away than you could push over Gold Hill with the flat of your hand . " He pointed across Culebra Cut , and Gold Hill looked like the square-set Gibraltar as it towered over the chasm that goes to the lowest point in the continental divide between the Arctic Ocean and Tierra del Fuego .
