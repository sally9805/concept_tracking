WHEN we turn to Egypt , we meet with a consecutive record of i , man covering some seven thousand years . The scribes of the times of the pyramids looked back as far to the beginning of the kingdom as we look back to Charlemagne , the founder of modern Europe . Although recent Babylonian discoveries have challenged the primacy of Egyptian civilization , yet there is not by any means the same continuity of record in Mesopotamia as there is in Egypt . But the Egyptian record by no means passed unchallenged . A couple of generations ago it was the fashion to deny that anything could be certain before the Greek historians . Then , when the mass of contemporary records of the earlier times compelled attention , it was gvndginglyallowed that the older history might be followed just as far as we could prove it . But nothing was much believed in before the pyramid - builders , about 4000 B.C. , and writers put down the first three dynasties as a tissue of fables of a semi-barbarous time , for which no reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sceptical world , the Iasi two years have brought to light the actual posessions of these earliest kings . Name after name has been proved to be founded on fact , the successive order of the whole of the first dynasty has been proved , and of other kings before and after that . We now familiarly handle the royal drinking-bowls of these sovereigns , once so shadowy and unreal ; we know precisely all their changes of taste and of work , and deal with Mena , Zer , or Pen as fluently as we do with Louis Quinze or Louis Seize furniture . We even know what was going on in every generation for some two thousand years before that time , far more than the later Egyptians themselves knew . It is the cemetery of the royal tombs at Abydos , and the treasures of gold and ivory and beautiful stones which were left there , that have placed us face to face with the beginning of history . The oldest record of human history is the statement that ten kings reigned at Abydos in Upper Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united kingdom of the whole land , and is counted as the first king of the first dynasty . Even of these earliest kings we now have four of the tombs and the objects which belonged to them , nearly 5000 years B.C. , and their names are given as Ka , Zeser , Narmer , and Sam . Of two of these kings monuments were found three years ago at Hierakonpolis , in Upper Egypt ; but it is only now that we can appreciate their historical position . The most distinctive of these earliest scenes ( Fig. 2 ) is that of King Narmer smiting his enemy ; this is carved in high relief on a large slab of slate , together with other scenes on each side . The labors of these early kings were both in the subjugation of the various tribes to regular government , and in the subjugation of the land to regular cultivation . Thousands of captives are recorded side by side with irrigation-works in which the king took part . These kings were the real founders of the great state which was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet the figure-head of history has been Mena , their successor , who founded the new capital , Memphis ? practically the present Cairo ? and is credited as starting the first dynasty . His tomb was found some four years ago in tipper Egypt , though not understood at the time ; and now from the tombs of his age at Abydos found this spring an abundance of small objects with his name is brought to light . One of the most complete is an ebony tablet ( Fig. 3 ) , which is one of a large class of such records which were buried in the royal tombs . The exact purport of them is not yet settled . In the top line are the royal name , " born of Osiris , " two sacred boats , and a shrine of the goddess Neit in a sacred enclosure . In the second line , a man making an offering , a bull running in open country with2. - KINCi NAHM11-2 SM-11.NCi HIS ENEMY a net in front to catch him , and a shrine with a crane on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three boats on a river , and sortie fortified islands . At the base is a line of inscription , which is not yet understood . As all these tablets have a hole in one corner , it appears that they were tied on to offerings placed in the tomb ; and they probably record the amount offered for the benefit of the king 's ka , or ghost , from various sources . Another strange object ( Fig. 4 ) was a bar of gold with the name of King Mena engraved on one end . The bar is curved , and roughened with regular crosshatching on two parts . The use of it is still quite unexplained . But it seems to have been made with great care , and of exactly one unit of gold in weight-210 grains , or nearly half an ounce . But the most surprising discovery of all was that of the gold jewelry of the next reign , that of Ring Zer . While we were clearing out this royal tomb ( Fig . I ) a workman noticed a piece of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , seen in the upper part of the view ; he did not pass it by as worthless , butor palace . This bracelet has a history in itself . The turquoise plaques bear a much more archaic and lumpy form of hawk than the gold pieces , and they show signs of having been worn alternately with large beads . From the style , like that of Mena , they were made probably at the accession of King Zer . Later the looked in at one end and saw a lump of gold . Now ordinary human nature , and still more Arab nature , puts in a finger and hooks out a lump of gold when it can . But our workmen are far too well trained to do that , and so the arm was laid down again till we could see it . After reporting it the piece was brought intact to our huts , and that evening an hour or two was spent in opening it up carefully , and recording how everything was placed ; lastly weighing the gold , and giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered the oldest group of jewelry known in the world ( Fig. 5 ) , the four bracelets of the queen of King Zer , about 4700 B.C. , some 2000 years earlier than any other jewelry thus far identified . The finest bracelet ( Fig. ( 3 ) is formed of alternate plaques of gold and turquoise , each surmounted with the royal hawk , and panelled to imitate the front of the tombhawks in gold were made in the more advanced style , to form a bracelet with the turquoise . All the pieces were numbered , with lines on the bases , sloping for one half , straight for the other half , of the bracelet . Four turquoise and five gold pieces were lost , and so the eighteen of each were reduced to the present numbers . The next bracelet ( Fig. 7 ) is curiously built up . The centre-piece of gold appears to be copied from the seed-vessel of a desert plant . On either side are beads of turquoise and gold , and lastly a large amethyst ball of deep color . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides are braids of gold wire and thick hair plaited together , here seen on edge ; and the fastening of this , as of all the other bracelets , was by a ball and loop . The other two bracelets are perhaps sufficiently seen on the arm shown in Fig. 5 . One has various beads in the form of an hour-glass , alternate gold and amethyst , with larger rhombs of turquoise in gold caps . The other bracelet is of spiral beads of gold and lapis lazuli , with small turquoises between . The most astonishing point about these is the perfection of the soldering of the gold . In no case can the joint be detected with a magnifier , either by color or excess . And the only proof that soldering was used is in the inside of the ball buttons , where a wire shank is joined in , and evidently not hammered in one piece . The wire is of course all hammered out , and not drawn , as modern wire is . The chances against this jewelry having been preserved seem almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early times , and holes broken in the walls in search of hidden treasure , After that the queen 's body was found , and broken up , and one plunderer thrust this fragment of the mummy into the hole in the wall , while probably returning to secure more in the scramble . Then the tomb was cleaned out , and a shrine of Osiris built in it about 1400 n.c. , which was frequented constantly for a thousand years , every visitor passing within a few feet of the treasure . About 500 A.D. the Copts utterly destroyed the shrine , and the other royal tombs ; yet the arm lay untouched . Again , three years ago , a French explorer turned out the whole place in search of valuable objects , but his workmen neglected the arm , which they must have seen . Time after time it would have seemed impossible that such valuables could escape , lying openly in the wall ; yet our thorough search was thus most unexpectedly rewarded . We have now laid hands on the turning-point in the development of Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archaic and tentative ; even the earlier work of his reign is of the old character . But during the fifty-seven years that are assigned to him a rapid crystallization took place , and at the end of his reign the forms are practically identical with what continued for more than 4000 years later . This sudden fixation of the final forms is what is also seen in Greek art , where the interval of forty years between the Persian war and the Parthenon sufficed for the step from archaic work to the highest perfection , after which all else was but a gradual decay . The vigor of this early carving is seen in the cutting of the name of the next king ? Zet ? on a beautiful stone drinking-bowl . The abundance of vases cut in hard stones is astonishing in these royal tombs . Some : five hundred different forms have been drawn from the fragments remaining , besides hundreds of other bowls that are duplicates . The materials are of all kinds ; many cups and howls of rock-crystal occur ; some are of obsidian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porphyry , metamorphic rocks , basalt , serpentine , slate , fine colored marbles , alabaster , etc , tombs arc yet ? unknown ; but pieces of stone bowls of each of these kings were found in the tomb of their successor , King Perabsen , of about 4370 B.c . By the side of his tomb lay two great tombstones of syenite bearing his name , surmounted by the figure of the god Set , was afterwards hammered out by worshippers of Horus . The tomb is different in form from those of the older dynasty , and has no graves of the domestics around it . Of the next king one of the great tombstones yet remains perfect . Although about five feet high , it was strangely overlooked in the search made here by the French four years ago . It is cut in hard white limestone , and bears the king 's name , Merneit , " beloved of the goddess Neit . " Each of the royal tombs had two large tombstones bearing the king 's name , set up at the place of offerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private tombs of all the court and domestics , which were placed around the royal tomb , were each marked with a lesser tombstone about a foot in height , showing the name and often the titles of the deceased . The fifth king of the dynasty was perhaps the most splendid . His tomb was larger than all before it , and paved with slabs of pink and gray granite , the oldest such use of stone . No stone building is known for some two centuries after this time , all the early structures being of brick and wood ; and in general there is a decadent touch in the latter part of this dynasty . But of Den we have the finest piece of carving of that age , in high relief on the side of a large jar of alabaster . The three remaining kings of the first dynasty have left abundant fragments of inscribed stone vases and clay sealings of great wine-jars . Altogether the impressions of two hundred different seals of officials are known , each giving names , titles , and some insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second dynasty we find a blank of three reigns of which the Probably next after this is the first stone-built chamber , that of King Khasekhemui , around which were long series of brick chambers for funeral furniture and offerings . Here , most unexpectedly , a few relics of the former richness yet remained . In one place lay seven stone vases , with gold covers tied down with twisted vold wire . One vase is cut in bright red carnelian , the others in hard white marble . Near these were two gold bracelets , formed of a plain band of the metal beaten hollow . Bowls of diorite , of syenite , and of copper also remained , with axes of copper and large knives of flint . In one place a whole dinner service in thin beaten copper lay all together ? a dozen dishes ? and over a hundred models of tools , etc . One prize ( Fig. 8 ) also lay yet unnoticed , the royal sceptre , nearly complete . It is formed of cylinders of rich red surd , held together by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with seven gold bands at intervals in the length of twenty-nine inches . The handle end is lost ; but this is the only ancient sceptre known before that of Tarentum ; four thousand years later . The two ends of this sceptre are shown together in our illustration , the slenderness in proportion to the length making it impossible to exhibit the whole . Later than this , to the beginning of the third dynasty , belong the royal tombs of King Neter-khet and Selthern-nekht , which were discovered this year a few miles to the north of Abydos . The former tomb had eighteen chambers in it , sixty feet underground ; it contained hundreds of pieces of alabaster vases . Much of these things will also pass over to America . The . work of excavation by the Egyptian Exploration Fund and the Egyptian Research Account is supported on both sides of the Atlantic , and those who receive the volumes on the royal tombs of Abydos and on . Hierakotipolis will see more fully the details of all the discoveries . A few notes may be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The royal tombs are nearly all built of brick , in most cases with a timber lining to the chamber , sunk in the ground , and originally roofed over with beams , matting , and sand . They lie about a mile behind the celebrated temple of Abydos , just below the desert hills . Plundered anciently , they were next elaborately destroyed by the fanaticism of the Copts , and were again ransacked for saleable antiquities about four years ago . Yet the great mass of fragments of ancient work and inscription had been thrown aside by ignorant workmen , and on my searching it with a carefully trained staff of natives we succeeded in unravelling the whole history of the period , and restoring the entire view of the civilization of five centuries in order . The historic results are as follow : Of the names in the first dynasty all but one can be identified in the same order in the list drawn up more than three thousand years later by King Sety T. on the walls of his temple at Abydos , and most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? those after the dash ? are in all cases those which were copied and corrupted into the forms in which we find them so long after . This history , we must remember , was as old in the days of the Exodus as the Exodus is in our time . Hence the only wonder is that the Egyptians had kept alive their history in this manner through so many changes and convulsions of the government , age after age . The solid reality of the very earliest parts of the history is now placed beyond question by these discoveries , and we know far more about the civilization of these oldest known kings than we do about our own Saxon kings of England .
