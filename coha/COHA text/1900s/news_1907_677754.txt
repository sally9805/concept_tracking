txt We learn that the Lumber Trust " is to be the next foe with which the Administration will measure swords , " in the effort to preserve the forests and abolish monopoly . We have it on Mr. GA.aFisLie 's own quoted words . This ' is interesting for several reasons . In the first place , the Lumber Trust is the most intangible of all these capitalistic monsters . Its proportions rival Standard Oil 's , yet there is no corporate . entity to attack , and no one rich malefactor could be sent to jail with the same happy result as might follow the incarceration of HARRThtAN or ROCKEFELLER . The nerve centre is thought to be in the brain of Mr. WEYER . HAUSER , who somehow seems to know at what price many independent concerns will sell their lumber . There is not known to be any community of ownership , as in the case of the Railway Trust , nor any holding company , as in the case of the Northern Securities ; nor any corporate device whatever , like the Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything except a gentlemen 's agreement , followed by a remarkable unanimity as to tie worth of what the gentlemen concerned have for sale . If such facts constitute a conspiracy , and it is proved , there can be no doubt about its illegality and punishability . Men have been sentenced to jail for it in Ohio , which makes it all the greater wonder that the Federal Government - is moving instead of Wisconsin , around - whose lakes and all through the upper reaches of the Mississippi ' River region the trust is said to have its chief centre of activity . No one , of course , would say a word in defense of the proposition that owners of lumber might agree to sell certain quantities for certain prices , on the analogy of associations to compel so much pay for eight hours ' work . There is no way to compel a man to work if he wo n't , but there is , or is thought to be , a way to compel a man to sell what you , want at your own price . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to an agreement with a buyer is exploded . The Lumber Trust , therefore , is doomed  --  unless , that is , it shall appear ' that legislation regarding prices is go . ing , too far , as is appearing regarding the statutory regulation of railway rates . Old-fashioned people . might eay . WAX the way.to get cheap lumber is the same as the way by which copper and iron are being cheapened , that is , by not taking them until the price is made right . There is no such cheapener of prices as accumulating stocks , not even the fixation of prices by law . ' If the lawful price is too low , the goods will not be produced , and nobody can be compelled to sell what he does not possess . Those who want cheaper lumber would be in a still worse case if the Lumber Trust should strike , and leave its timber uncut . Every one who wants cheaper lumber will be encouraged by Mr. GARFIELD 'S announe4ment , undeterred by such academic considerations as these .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
