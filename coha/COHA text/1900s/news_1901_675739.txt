txt Five persons were killed and over forty were seriously injured in a collision between two electric cars which were racing for a switch at forty miles an hour from opposite directions near here this afternoon . The scene of the accident is a point about two miles out of Greenbush , on the line of the Albany and Hudson Railway . The point where the cars met on the single track was at a sharp curve , and so fast were both running and so sudden was the collision that the motorman had no time to put on the brakes before south-bound car No. 22 had gone almost clean through north-bound car No. 17 and hung on the edge of a high bluff , with its load of shrieking , maimed humanity . One motorman was pinioned up against the smashed front of the southbound car with both legs severed and died instantly , while the other one lived but a few minutes . Fully 120 men , women , and children formed a huge , struggling , shrieking pyre .. mid , mixed with the wreckage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men extricated themselves , and began to pull people out of the rear ends of the bwo cars , and almost every ' one taken out in this way was badly injured . The scenes were heartrending . The few women and children who had escaped injury and death were hysterical , and added their cries to the shrieks of the dying and mutilated . Men with broken arms and bones , dislocated joints , and bloody heads and recce tried to assist others who were more helpless . Help had been summoned from East Greenbush and vicinity , and in a little time the bruised mass of humanity with the 1 mutilated dead were loaded on extra cars and taken to Albany . There ambulances and physicians had been summoned and the Post Office was turned into a morgue and hospital . As fast as the physicians could temporarily treat the wounded they were taken to their homes or to the hospitals in carriages or hospital ambulances , CAUSE OF THE ACC/DENT . With both motormen killed , it was hard to get at the real cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wee caused by an attempt of the south-bound car to reach a second switch , instead of waiting for the north-bound at the first siding . The cars weigh fifteen tons each , and are the largest electric cars built , but so frightful was the crash that both cars were torn almost to splinters . Both were filled with Sunday pleasure-seekers returning from the recreation grounds that the new railway had just opened . The south-bound car left Albany at 4:30 o'clock and the accident occurred at 5 o'clock . The cars on the line were running at switch headway , that is , as a car reached a siding switch it was suposed to wait until another going in the opposite direction passed . The motorman- of the southbound car reached one of the switches , but seeing no north-bound car decided to take chances and go on to the next . It was at the curve between that the two cars met . Among the passengers on the south-bound car was Deputy Superintendent Howard J. Rogers of the State Department of Public ! Instruction , and his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son and daughter , all of whom were slightly injured , with the exception of the daughter . A PASSENGER 'S STORY . Speaking of the accident , Mr. Rogers said : " My recollection of what happened as the cars came together is rather vague . We were proceeding southward at a very rapid rate of speed , our car being well fjlied with Passengers , including many women and children . Fortunately , my wife , my chile dren , and myself were seated in the rear of the car . The car , I should say , accona. modated between 75 and 100 persons . The accident occurred after we had passed a switch , beyond which was a curve ' where the track skirts what appeared to be an embankment . We did not seem to lessen in speed as we neared this curve . There was absolutely no warning , so far as my memory can recall , before the crash came . As we dashed around the curve , the cars met with terrific force . The experience was something awful . With the velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated fairly plowed the entire length of the other vehicle before it lost its impetus . " The crash of the cars was succeeded by one of the most awful scenes I have ever witnessed , and by the shrieks and groans of the wounded men , women , and children that lay scattered about the 1 tracks or bruised amid the debris . Mrs. , Rogers , our two children and myself were hurled toward the front of the car over the seats and thrown into the aisle beneath a mass of debris , in which were buried dozens of other passengers . " I have no recollection of how we manre aged to free ourselves from the wreckage . All of us but the boy , however , were able to help ourselves . He sustained a broken leg and had to be dug out . My wife had several cuts on the face , and I am slightly scratched . Our little girl escaped without injury . We attribute our good fortune to 1 the fact that we were seated at the rear of the car . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not say . It was said=-that our motorman ought to have waited on the switch for the down car , but that for some reason he concluded to take the chance a reaching the next switch .

THE WOUNDED ARRIVE AT ALBANY . Telephone calls were sent from the scene Of the wreck to this city , and about fl o'clock , when the first car arrived , loaded with injured , a crowd of several thousand people was massed about the Albany terminus of the road at the foot of State Street , and so great was the anxiety to learn if any relatives or friends were among the killed or injured that it was some time before the car could be unloaded and the sufferers cared for . One of the saddest incidents of the disaster was the death of Maude HeDoer of Round Lake . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Barry of Troy . and Mr. Barry 's father . When the crash came she was crushed to death almost instantly . Near her , pinned in by the broken wreckage , lay her sweetheart . Frantically he tried to reach her , his own agonies from internal injuries forgotten . Finding he could not move . he appealed to his father , who was extricating himself , but the girl was dead . On the way to the city in the car he pleaded with those attending him to let him die and join his sweetheart . He will probably obtain his wish , for his injuries are pronounced fatal . The Albany and Hudson Road is the longest road operated by the third-rail system In the world . It is the first of what it was announced would be a system of electric lines connecting Albany with New York City .

Immanuel Church , Flatbush , Welcomes Dr. Moment 's Return  --  Congregation and Pastor Said to be in Contempt of Local Authority . Apparently in defiance of the Brooklyn Presbytery the Rev. Dr. Alfred H. Moment , who was suspended by that body some time ago , preached yesterday in the Immanuel . Presbyterian Church , Flatbush . This action on the part of Dr. Moment and the church 's consent to it places both , it Is said , in contempt of the local Presbytery . It is thought likely that the Presbytery will take some action with regard to the matter at its meeting to-day . The belief obtains that it is the purpose of Immanuel Church to secede from the Presbytery and enter upon a new course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The church is apparently disposed to stand by Dr. Moment as against the Presbytery . This much was evident yesterday , when only words of approval of his course were heard among the members of the congregation . The little church on East Twenty-third Street was well filled at yesterday morning 's services . When Dr. Moment mounted the pulpit platform he found there several vases filled with cut flowers , from members of the church . Those who attended the services in the expectation that Dr. Moment would say something in relation to his trouble with the Presbytery went away disappointed . Dr. Moment merely prayed that there might ' be " harmony in the Church " and that the General Assembly of the Presbyterian church . in session at Philadelphia , might be rightly guided in what it did . After the services Dr. Moment declined to say anything about his further plans or to discuss the trouble with the Presbytery . He is to preside at the weekly prayer meeting of the church on Friday evening , when , it is expected , something relative tG the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , Two of the members of the Judicial Commission of the Presbytery . when seen yesterday , said that the condition of affairs was that both the minister and Immanuel Church had placed themselves in contempt of the Presbytery . Dr. Moment is said not to have complied with a request of the Presbytery to return his call to Immanuel Church . UPSET A WEDDING PARTY . Carriage and a Madison Avenue Trolley Car Come Into Collision . A carriage which contained a party of three , on its way to a wedding in Tuxedo Hall , Fifty-ninth Street and Madison Avenue , was overturned by an electric car at Fifty-eighth Street and Madison Avenue shortly after Q o'clock last evening . No one was seriously hurt , although members of the party and the driver were bruised and cut . Those in the vehicle were Fir. and Mrs. Morris Jacobs of 1,447 Broadway , Brooklyn . and David L. Getz of the same address . The carriage was proceeding west , on Fifty-eighth Street , the intention of the driver , George Miller ? of 155 North Third Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A north-bound electric car neared the corner simultaneously with the carriage . Both were going at a good rate of speed . Miller saw the impending danger , and quickly tried to stop his horses . Owing to the slippery state of the pavement , however , he was not successful , and the car struck the forward left wheel of the carriage , overturning it . Miller and Mr. Jacobs were removed to the Presbyterian Hospital in an ambulance . The driver had a scalp wound and Mr. Jacobs a contusion on the right hip . After treatment at the hospital both left for their heroes . Mrs. Jacobs anti Mr. Getz escaped with no very serious hurts . The motorman of the car was taken to- the East Fifty-first Street Police Station . The marriage of Hugo Frudenthal and Rose Alexander was to have been witnessed by the party that met with the accident SUNDAY DANCING UNDISTURBED . For the first time in several weeks Sunday dancing was carried on yesterday without interference by the police in Waldron 's dance hall , at West One Hundred and Tenth Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coney Island , " although several of Capt . Sehmittberger 's wardmen were in evidence . Few dancers , however , put in an appearance , probably on account of the stormy weather . Capt . Schmittberger did not put in an appearance all day , and , judging from this , Mr. Waldron said , it meant a victory over the police . " I do not bear any hard feeling against Capt . Sehmittberger , " he said , " as I think that he acted under orders each time that be raided my place . And as for Commissioner Murphy , I am of the opinion that he merely made a mistake .
