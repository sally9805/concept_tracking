Among the dramatis personce of earlier novels of character , there are usually four distinct types , ? the hero and the villain , the heroine and the feminine contrast , often designated by critics as " the foil . " The villain of either sex has largely lost his identity in more recent fiction , ? a demise deeply mourned in clever essay by Miss Repplier and Mr. Lang . In current fiction , the hero and villain are sometimes indistinguishable to a casual reader , even when the author intends a subtle moral contrast . The modern villain has become a psychic and ethical study , not a plain criminal ; he seems merely one reflex of this unstable and speculative Zeitgeist . We have few sharp contrasts like those of past fiction , ? Parson Adams and Blifil , Nicholas Nickleby and Squeers , Captain Dobbin and the Marquis of Steyne , Earnshaw Hindley and Heathcliff . A similar metamorphosis has taken place in the relations of heroine and foil . Perhaps more marked still is the change in the heroine herself . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opinion-shunning girl , has been succeeded by the athletic , efficient woman " with a purpose . " She may incidentally study the mirror , not that she may become a mere joy to her lover 's eyes , rather that she may find more potent means of " wielding power . " Clarissa Harlowe , Anne Eliot , Amelia Sedley , bear scant resemblance to their younger heroine-sisters , Diana Warwick , Marcella Boyce , Glory Quayle , and Isabel Carnaby . While the earlier heroines were largely of one type , these later women are as diverse and paradoxical as the phases of modern life . They differ radically in personality , accomplishments , tenets of faith , but they are all self-reliant , brave , alert women . In earlier Victorian character-novels , the author 's ideal woman was in marked contrast to a weak or unwomanly foil . Charlotte Bronte , revealing her own reserve and submerged passion in her heroines , Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe , humbly serving boorish , selfish men , found foils in the type hated by her , ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charlotte Bronte 's  | heroines had Agatha 's lowly aspiration , " Command was service ; humblest service done By willing and deserving souls was glory . " George Eliot , like Charlotte Bronte , reflected not alone her ideals for women but much of her own personality in her heroines . All her great novels contain two antithetical women . Maggie and Lucy , Dinah and Hetty , Romola and Tessa , Dorothea and Rosamond , Gwendolen and Mirah , ? they pass two by two in memory ! And these heroines , with their strong intellectual ambitions , their spiritual doubts , their renunciations and their sufferings , ? are progressive revelations of their creator . The foils from Hetty to Rosamond represent the women of mental or moral weakness . All George Eliot 's women had throbbing emotional natures : her words on Dorothea have wide application , ? " All Dorothea 's passion was transfused through a mind struggling towards an ideal life ; the radiance of her transfigured girlhood fell on the first object that came within its level . " Thackeray kept two distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose adroitness and wit command our admiration , despite her defective moral sense , was a defiant contrast to Amelia . Becky Sharp had two sisters of milder adventurous trend , ? all names begin with B , ? Beatrix and Blanche . Beatrix is a wonderful creature , " whose eyes were fire , whose look was love , whose voice was the sweetest low song " ; Blanche Amory , foil in " Pendennis , " was embodiment of sentimentality and sham , who declared , If I can not have emotions , I must have the world . " These foils are so much more alluring than their contrasting heroines , Amelia , Isabel , and Laura . Thackeray chose some apt , correlative epithets for Laura which well describe his heroines as a class , fair and open , kindly and pious , cheerful , tender , and true . " With all these virtues , how uninteresting they are beside the clever , selfish , slightly wicked foils ! Is it a silent comment upon the changing morals of the present that his foil ? attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because his master-touch of delineation is far more skilful and potent in the complex studies of life ? Mr. George Meredith , with his long service to literature and his wealth of women-characters , represents both the older and the later types of heroines and foils . " Rhoda Fleming " and " Richard Feverel " present women of the past ; gradually the novelist evolved his chosen heroine , ? a woman of intellectual power . Mark his statement , " A woman of intellect is as good as a Greek statue . " Diana , Clara , Cecilia , with their mastering wit and poise and cognizance of state affairs , represent an extreme Amazonian type of women , whose counterparts are existent to-day in England and America . In " Rhoda Fleming " the antithesis is strongly marked between the perverse , strong Rhoda , and her weaker but more attractive sister , Dahlia . In " Richard Feverel , " the heroine is environed by a group of varied women , ? the hypochondriac Clare , the boyish Carola , the faddish , strong-minded Lady Judith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her maxim , " Kissing do n't last ; cookery do . " Racial traits have been media for contrasts . In earlier fiction Hawthorne thus compared Miriam and Hilda . In the same way Mrs. Ward found a foil for the thoroughly English Dora in the French Elise , though for purposes of testing David Grieve she added a moral insecurity to the keenness and charm of her foil . Peculiar training and inheritance also afford this novelist careful character-studies , in the intellectual , graceful Laura at Bannisdale and her foil Polly Mason , with her " fringe of hair " and her " crackling lemon-coloured gloves . " George Gissing has given modern fiction some matchless women-characters in his powerful realism . In the volume with the apt title , " The Odd Women , " the author has drawn with subtle irony the purposeful , independent Rhoda , propagating the gospel of woman 's emancipation , yet , with her " lofty mission , " she is still an erratic , jealous woman . Mary Barfoot is the wise character who says to the misguided heroine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for women , one must keep one 's womanhood . " In recent American fiction the strongly distinctive girl , with national spirit , has her foil in the woman of foreign education and standards . Thus Mrs. Atherton emphasized her heroine , Lee Tarleton , in " American Wives and English Husbands . " Again , in " Good Americans , " Mrs. Harrison portrays the home-bred , earnest Agatha , versus Sybil with foreign focus and customs . American women are of such varied types that they defy any exclusive classification . Some novels and contes content themselves with one or two distinctive portraits , while others are overcrowded with dissimilar characters , yet all possess the distinctive traits of the American woman , ? alertness , adaptability , ambition , force . Miss Wilkins and her co-workers have depicted the old-time New England woman with a " conscience , " which was sometimes a misnomer for obstinacy , and her foil in the weak  | sentimental " spinster , " with a latent poetic faculty . Miss Pool had a wider range of character than the other New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine contrast between the strong , loyal , wise heroine Olive and her rival , the vain , coquettish Isabel Keating . Mr. Howells has as sure a grasp of American womanhood as he has of other phases of national life . Provincial Lydia Blood was his pioneer among the self-reliant , sensible , unpolished American girls who have been given stronger development in Cynthia Whitwell , at " Lion 's Head , " and Clementina , the ? Ragged Lady . " With coeval progression he has depicted his " Gallery of Nervous Women , " from crude , high-strung Marcia Gaylord to Louisa Maxwell , whose jealous caprices retarded and complicated " The Story of a Play . " Can we deny that both types are truly representative of modern American women ? Mr. Hopkinson Smith has photographed a delightful quartet of American women in " Caleb West . " With characteristic chivalry he has made each a heroine ; Mrs. Leroy and Helen Shirley of society life are no more real and individual than simple , kindly " Aunty Bell " and pathetic little Betty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by in fiction . In " The Story of an Untold Love " she stands in the shadow , Donald 's mother , the home-wrecking , ambitious type . Miss Lilian Bell , who has an acute vision of modernity , has made the prominent character in " The Underside of Things " an American woman of strong yet unlovely nature . A vivid realism and morale commingle with the satire on Mrs. Copeland 's nose , a " Code of Public Morals " : " After one critical look at her nose you knew why , when she sent a sick friend a potted plant , she asked her to return the pot , or , if she sent her jelly , she asked her to return the glass . " Of quite dissimilar type is the woman physician , Dr. Isabelle Herrick , made attractive by Mr. Garland in " Rose of Dutcher 's Coolly . " Of all American novels presenting vivid contrasts , none surpass Mr. Warner 's sequential studies of city-life . The conception of Carmen Eschelle , who , as a girl , was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive very near the edge , " with her subtle evil influence in " A Little Journey , " her moral apathy and legal crime in " The Golden House , " and her culminating ambition and downfall in " That Fortune , " forms a vivid and forceful charactersermon . In each book she acts as foil to a woman of pure , noble character . She can exert a malign influence upon Margaret in the first story , but she finds resistance in the loyal reliant Edith Delaney of " The Golden House . " Perhaps her best contrast is in the last sequel , in the character of her own pure , steadfast daughter , Evelyn . Mr. Warner is always keen in his satire upon the vacillating tendencies of the " new woman . " In " That Fortune " he finds Celia Howard " a type of the awakened American woman , who does not know exactly what she wants . . . . She ... is distracted by the many opportunities . She has no sooner taken up one than she sees another that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are strong physically as well as mentally . They are not alloyed to " enjoy poor health " in modern life or current novel . A desire for vital , salutary , health of body and mind characterize the woman of to-day , and these qualities appear in her fictitious portrait . The marvellous vigor and endurance of Helen Sherwood , the editor-heroine in " The Gentleman from Indiana , " impart a freshness and charm to a story that lacks many qualities of structure . A recent lecturer divided the modern woman into two categories , ? " the woman who thinks and the woman who feels . " Each class , with restrictions , has furnished material for novelists . If Richardson , Dickens , and Thackeray were disposed to apotheosize feeling and caricature intellectual cravings , George Eliot , George Meredith , and Mrs. Ward have canonized the woman of intellect and purpose versus the sentimental and rhapsodic type . In the evolution of educated womanhood , however , brain and heart must keep apace ; the woman who approximates an ideal heroine for a representative novelist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her foil , seldom now in very sharp antithesis and varied in traits , is the woman who " thinks , " or schemes , to the detriment of healthy emotions ; or , on the other hand , she is the woman who " feels " without the exercise of trained mind and poised judgment .  |
