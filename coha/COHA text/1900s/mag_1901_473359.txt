AMONG all the affluents of the royal Loire , no sister stream leads you in more fascinating ways than the little river Indre . Here you find yourself in an enchanted region , untrodden by the great army of tourists . One of the most bewitching of its hidden haunts is the little chateau of La Motte Feuilly . Driving through an ancient avenue , and passing through the entrance tower , we faced the chateau proper , which , with all its loveliness , is still a melancholy place , for its owner resides there infrequently , and the vacant rooms are oppressive in their silence . Fascinating in itself , the spot is doubly so from the romantic interest which lingers like a perfume in the lonely rooms . A mystery hinting at tragedy haunts the darkened corridors , and is only half explained by credible history . Charlotte d'Albret dazzled no one by her intellectual or by her physical charms , though . she was good and gentle . She was a princess , indeed , but of a petty mountain kingdom , neither greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the simple provincial girl to win such a man as Cesar Borgia , that embodiment of manly beauty , of fastidious taste , of superb arrogance , of unlimited ambition , and of every known Crime ? I recalled the occasion of his coming to France , ? that it was to bring from his father , Pope Alexander VI. , the hull of divorce so ardently desired by Louis XII. , which released that monarch from the marriage into which he had been C111 ? No 617 ? 72 forced at fifteen by Louis XI. , and left him free to wed Anne of Bretagne , whom he had long loved . Charlotte d'Albret was among the Queen 's maids of honor on that spring morning of 1499 when Cesar made his famous entry into Chinon , captivating all beholders by his magnificent prodigality . Seventy lackeys in gorgeous liveries and thirty mounted gentlemen elegantly - bed ight preceded him , escorting the two palfreys bearing the coffers which contained the King 's divorce and a cardinal 's hat for George Amboise . Last of all came Borgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold . Louis was glad of heart that day , and he wished not only to express his gratitude for the boon which the Pope had conferred upon him , but also to attach Cesar Borgia to the French interests in the coming Italian campaign . The duchy of Valentino and a pension . of twenty thousand livres were the golden links in the chain which the King trusted would bind the Borgias , while Charlotte d'Albret , Louis 's cousin , became the clasp to make the bargain seem one of affection as well as of policy . But Cesar was never true to any man or woman or cause . He left his bride in France and returned to Italy at the head of eight thousand French soldiers , whom he used to secure his own ambition , the Kingship of Romagna . By treachery or by cruelty he took Ferli , Cesere , and Pesaro from his brother-in-law Sforza , Rimini from Malatesta , and Faenza from Manfredi . He obtained soldiers from the Duke of Urdeleted material the air as the tapestry was unrolled . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangings , and they shed their feathers in the same way , so that a naughty page cried out that the angels were moulting . " " And so it was in this bed that Charlotte d'Albret met her death , poisoned by her perfidious husband ? " " Madame , I know not how many persons that child of the evil one may have schemed to poison with his diabolical tapestries . I only know that his wife was innocent , and that the hangings injured no one . A letter came with the tapestries from Cesar Borgia , telling his wife that they were for her own bed , he professing anxiety lest the dampness of the castle , encompassed as it is by the river , might breed miasma ; and he begged her most lovingly to draw the curtains close , and to fancy that the Madonna was wrapping her warm and safe in the white softness of her mantle . " The deluded lady was overjoyed by this proof of her husband 's affection . She had this room refurnished and made the finest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it stands there , and I am told that the coverlet was crimson velvet sown with golden stars , with the Bourbon lilies and the great bull 's head of the Borgia : : in the centre . But she would not allow any one to sleep here , nor would she lie in that bed , she swore , until her dear lord came back to share it with her . Years went by , but though the room was undisturbed , no moth ever burrowed in those tapestries , no spider darkened the window with its web , no fly buzzed on the pane , no mouse nibbled through the wainscot , and no cricket chirped upon the hearth , and these little creatures of the good God shun the room to this day . Has not Madame observed that save when we are talking the place is as still ? as still as death ? I threw open the window when we came in , but the humming-birds that are so thick about the honeysuckles , and that glance in and out of the other rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has all the curiosity of a human being , will not cross the sill ; and does not Madame detect a faint suffocating odor as though something had just been carried through the room ? Look you , Madame , how stupid the fates are . C ? sa.r Borgia should have come , and should have slept in this room alone . I often think I could have made a better ending to the story . But when his poor lady heard that he was with her brother , and like to return at last to France , she was wild with happiness , and wrote him how she had kept the tapestries for him , and he replied , It is well ; let no one use them till I come . ' " He never came . Madame knows how he died , fighting the enemies of France . Charlotte d'Albret rejoiced more over his honorable death than for any act of his false life . When she knew that she was dying , she was happier still . He could not come to me , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dead body in state under his tapestries , for at last we shall be together . ' So they dressed her in her bravest , and placed her on that bed , with the lilies of France on her pall and an Annunciation lily in her hand , and they wrote to the Queen . She came , for Charlotte d'Albret and she had been girls together ; and when Anne de Bretagne knew all that I have told , she would not accept her friend 's bequest , but caused her coffin to be lined with the tapestries , which had been her dearest treasure , and herself lapped them about the little body , tired out with such long waiting . And so they laid the wife of Cesar Borgia in her tomb in the cathedral of Bourges , covered warm and safe from the grave-damp in the Madonna 's mantle and the downy wings of the angels . " " That is not all the story ? " I said at last , for Maricinthe had closed the windows and was leading the way to the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever opened ? " Maricinthe crossed herself . " It was during the Revolution . Yes , Madame , that madness born in Paris penetrated even into such out-of-the-way corners as Berri , and the nobility fled before it , while the rabble rifled their chateaux , vio- ? Med their tombs , and scattered the dust of the aristocrats to the winds . But when they broke open the tomb of Charlotte d'Albret , and turned back the tapestries which had wrapped her for three hundred years , they found her body as perfect as when it was buried , and her face far fresher and fairer , for all the traces of sorrow and age were gone , and it seemed as young as on her wedding morn . The impious ones fled before that miracle , not daring to take so much as a jewel from her finger . Pious people came in the dead of night and replaced the coffin in the tomb , and the broken lid upon the top as one sees it to-day ; but before they wrapped the tapestries again about her form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the Madonna had lost her ermine mantle ; and they comprehended that the arsenic which was intended to cause her death had kept her fair body from corruption .
