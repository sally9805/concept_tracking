This article , by M. Constant , the celebrated painter , is intended as a brief introduction to the extensive collection of Victor Hugo 's original drawings and paintings . Those who know the works of this master-poet and novelist will be surprised by the power and wealth of his imaginative production in another field , and it gives us pleasure to lay before our readers some remarkable examples from the vast collection placed at our command . M. Constant 's article is comprehensive in its scope , and thus refers to many examples of Victor Hugo 's artistic work not presented in this number , Some of these will appear in a later issue , with comment by M. Paul Meurice , the chief custodian of Victor Hugo memorabilia . In the mean time several drawings are here reproduced not directly mentioned by M. Constant ? THE EDITOR . THE word artist is not usually re- garded as descriptive of Victor Hugo in its technical sense , that is to say , in relation to his imaginative sketches , executed during the evenings and the wakeful hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to that crown of art , that stamp of peculiar beauty , which distinguishes the thought of every man of genius , whether its expression be written , spoken , or drawn . In this general sense Victor Hugo was a great artist ; but he was an artist in a special sense as well , when he took up his pen deliberately , and abandoned himself with heart-felt enjoyment to portraying poetic landscapes , or to making weird silhouettes of feudal castles , with strokes of the pen . And when ink seemed tohim too feeble for his original conceptions , he heightened his imaginations , as some one has said , by the use of caf ? au la it . He availed himself of all means for the expression of his descriptive thought , for the presentment of his dreams . No instruction was needed to enable him to represent a tree , a house by the way-side , or a prospect of distant hills encompassed with clouds . It is no stretch of imagination to say that these sketches or souvenirs of nature recall the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remind us of Calint and of Goya ; and the larger compositions in the style of " Burg de la Croix " might bear , not unworthily. the signature of Turner . To be convinced of what I say it is only necessary to spend a morning aL the house of Paul Meurice , the life-long friend of Victor Hugo , who was together with Vacquerie ? the great man 's confidant , and the executor of his last wishes . But VietOr Hugo was the solitary example of a writer of genius capable of expressing in drawing the scenes of which he wrote , and for this reason heunderstood our art , not only as a connoisseur , but almost as a professional artist . It is remarkable that we find men of genius who are accomplished word-painters possessing absolutely no comprehension of painting ; and this ignorance is sometimes manifested very plainly in their writings . How does it happen that they see Nature only through the medium of books , and fail to comprehend the , interpretation of her by a painter upon canvas ? One is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were possible , did not write some technical observations on painting . He was , however , better employed . He amused himself in the twilight at Guernsey by tracing the flying forms of the tempest in the spray dashing upon his atingly at the sun than Victor Hugo ; and no great lyrist has ever led us to greater heights , or nearer to the gods . The hand of the master in artistic genius may be seen in his drawings as in his books . Let us look over this remarkable collection and notice briefly some of his exquisite sketches . An Outline of Fortification. ? This is a souvenir of the Rhine , in which the reality of vision is wonderful ; it might window-panes , with the sea gleaming white amidst the blackness of the surrounding night , or in some dismal fortress surmounted by a gibbet . All this was expressed in the romantic taste of his earlier life , which was imaginative to excess , and overstepped the border-line between dream and nightmare . At the present day we employ a different method : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel sensations , and , in default of experience , this method is not without value . But strong souls are invested with power to raise themselves above the sickly puerilities , and the real or imaginary disquietudes of art . No poet has ever gazed more undevihave been drawn from nature ; the dominant perspective is absolutely perfect in its optical illusion . The foreground is occupied by a ruined , crumbling tower , rising erect in a soft and melancholy light , amidst the loneliness of a vast plain enveloped in shadow ; far off in that shadow , gleaming like a sword blade , flows the great German river , feeding the moat surrounding a fortress of robbers ? birds of prey whom the approach of night finds always on the alert while the last pale rays of a wintry sun gleam upon its battlements . Don Gebraldiablos. ? A romantic jocund fancy . Is this the devil pears disguised in Don Cesar de Torquemada. ? A sinister heap of whitened bones , towering under an inky sky . By this means , no doubt , Torquemada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by main force , and in despite of God , A Deserted Thoroughfare . ? A shapeless tract of land , enclosed by wooden barriers ? a disreputable corner of the suburbs , gloomy and dangerous ; to the The Cock. ? One actually hears him crow . His feathers quiver , straight from his crest to his spurs ; he calls the Dawn , which seems to wait upon entreaty , or to be asleep . Ali , that cock ! Rembrandt would have made an etching of him , and Millet as well . A Fantastic Castle. ? This is a marvellous gothic conception . The sky is wonderful in tone and weird in shape ; right a paved way , where the paving-stones are executed with a patience truly Japanese ; farther off is the outline of walls in a back silhouette ; and on the horizon , under a murky cloud , lies Paris ; the sun ( or is it the moon ? ) passes across the storm-ridden sky , in which the fading orb seems to have forever lost its way . Gustave Dore himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa ne possessed a hand equal in power ision as clear and stern . He only ve'created such a sky.on the near side of a moat is the town in ruins , crumbling under the ravages of time , and desolated by all the scourges of earth and heaven . It grovels at the foot of a castle fit for Beelzebub , which threatens itself to overwhelm the ruins that surround it at the first onslaught of the tempest . Tempestuous Weather. ? Clouds bursting with rain ; an immense wave , uplifted by the wind , erects its crest and falls backward , breaking on a sea-wall , the outline of which seems to mingle with the horizon ; and amidst the fury of the heavens and the raging of the sea appears a life-boat . Farther on is a very small sketch , no larger than one 's hand . It represents the moonlight seen through a screen of trees . The execution is of rare accuracy ; in fact , it is nature itself . A Little Water-Color. ? On a sea-green background a steamer moves before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's self to be at sea . The sketch is washed in broadly , with justice of tone and of values . It could not have beenbetter executed by a professional watercolorist . The Castle of the Cross. ? Richness and precision of detail , manner , color , effect , all are here . The sky is heavy , lowering , and charged with moisture ; the clouds are sweeping across it in long black rifts . The castle , built on piles and colossal in size , rises erect above the smooth waters of a lake , in which can be seen the reflection of its crumbling walls and discrowned turrets . A tottering bridge , fearful to behold , with disjointed stones falling asunder , serves as an entrance to a town of demons . It is a town dead as those which we might expect to find could we reach one of the extinct worlds revolving in space , or in our pallid neighbor the moon . When a nightmare takes us by the throat in the darkness , stifling and overwhelming us ? when we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is by a bridge such as this that we are forced to escape , and in so doing we awaken . But at the entrance to this bridge stands a cross , and this cross is a masterpiece of gothic architecture , of artistic execution , of decorative imagination ; it . might have been designed by a goldsmith of the tenth century . Glance for a moment at The Light-house , at The Wreck , and at The Octopus ? the famous Octopus , the marvellous Octopus , which plays so large a part in the manuscript of the Toilers of the Sea . Look at the souvenirs of Belgium . The blackness of the manufactories , the blazing furnaces of this land in flames , the entrance to the craters of the infernal thing called . Progress , the cities of the Cyclops . Observe the Japanese work upon the frames ; it is the pastime of an amateur worker in ebony . Victor Hugo carved furniture as Louis XVI . turned locks . Turn to the three light-houses of the Man who Laughs ; to Morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that humorous series of pen caricatures entitled Gavroche Dreaming , Gavroche in Distress , a Little Comforted , Gavroche a Flatterer , Gavroche Envious , A Vocation awakening to Itself , As a Shipwrecked Bourgeois made King amongst Savages . These are playful and grotesque sketches which the illustrious grandfather executed with his mighty hand during winter evenings in his ehimney-corner , at the entreaty of Jeanne and Georges , who nestled at his side . This was the sweet hour when the great man gave himself up to the pleasures of his home . All these works , whether charming , powerful , graceful , or terrible , reveal to us a creator of incredible imagination , possessing by instinct the technique of an experienced artist , one who might , per-haps , have been as great as Delacroix or Gericault , if his genius had not led him to select the pen as a more forcible means of expression ? that golden pen with which the manuscripts of Notre Dame de Paris , of Ray Bias , of Les Alis4rables , and of La Legende des SiOdes were written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having all the arts at its command , but in especial that one which approached nearest to his poetic visions , and by means of which he could express a second time in a different form , and without being too remote from the original thought , the subjects of which he had already written . In short , Victor Hugo in all his sketches comes near to being a master among masters . Salvator Rosa , Callot , Goya , or Delacroix might have signed more than one of these . The master of drawing who loses , alas , by comparison is Gustave Dore . His invention , brilliant and prolific as it is , has not the compass , the power , the audacity of Thigo 's ? for the mark of the beast is everywhere met with upon his ink-stained papers , sometimes raging , sometimes laughing , but always evidencing a violent romanticism , where the pencil is as revolutionary as the idea . Victor Hugo belonged to a period when men were permitted to reach the stars . How instinct with life , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1830 , that epoch in literature which succeeded the military epoch of Napoleon . Was not the struggle occurring between Romanticists and Classicists at that period an echo from the battle just fought ? Some there were who , moved by the spirit of revolt , loved life withpassion ; others , governed by the spirit of tradition , would have imprisoned life itself in a pedantic and frigid frame . Then followed the clash of swords , and the mightiest of these was wielded by Victor Hugo . The havoc wrought by that Durandal was profound , and through the space thus cleared by the hand of Roland , between Classicists and Romanticists , the philosophic spirit of the second half of the century glided in , preserving still a little of the Biblical poetry of Renan , of the living psychology of Balza ? , of the penetrating analysis of Taine . The year 1830 will stand above all things else for a revolution in art , for an era of lyric enthusiasm . But gunpowder remained in the air ? minds were inflamed , and eloquent words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed like a whirlwind across those who wrote , who painted , or who modelled . Delacroix inscribed his name upon the " Convention Invaded , " Turgres depicted Homer , Gros celebrated Napoleon . Gericault represented the terror of battle-horses , and Rude sculptured the singing of the " Marseillaise " on the stones of the Arch of Triumph . And all this has now passed away with the worship of greatness , each having its own stormy apothesis.
