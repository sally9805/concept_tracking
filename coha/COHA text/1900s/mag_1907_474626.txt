THE ancient Greeks were surprising ? ly modern , and the classical scholar is often reminded of the words of the Preacher , that " there is no new thing under the sun . " That socialistic and communistic theories and experiments in the ancient world appear first in va ? ried forms in Greece should excite no surprise . Greece was the source and home of most ideas . And , just as many of the latest views of the nebular theory and evolution are now discovered to have been held and propounded by Greek phi ? losophers five or six hundred years be ? fore our era , and then to have been for ? gotten , so many of our newest social and political notions were discussed and tried more than two thousand years ago in Athens or in Sparta . Such ideas had no place in the early empires of Asia , where the king bore the same relation to his subjects as the head of a family to his slaves , nor in the kingdom of Egypt . To whom was Pharaoh responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make bricks without straw ? Or under what obligations did Xerxes stand to the people of Persia ? The Oriental ruler was the state . The situation was such as it is at present in Asia Minor , where the Sultan may or may not be pleased to command the con ? struction of roads or bridges . Under such a government the people may grieve and groan , as did the children of Israel in Egypt , hint without influences and help from other lands they are not likely to develop communistic theories , and cer ? tainly can not make communistic experi ? ments . Left to themselves the subjects of an Eastern despot would simply ex ? change one master for another . Rome often receives the credit of being the main and original source of our prin ? ciples of law and government . Men are fond of saying that just as we owe ourscience and art to Greece , so we owe our governments to Rome . But although the precise relation of Roman to Greek con ? stitutions and laws has not yet been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know very well , much more is due to the Greeks than was formerly thought . The Greeks were not only fond of hearing and telling " some new timing " ; they made all manner of political as well as physical and mechanical experiments , and had as large a variety of political as of philosophical theories . Who ever knew of so many original and independent philosophical systems elsewhere as were evolved in Greece ! And where else were so many scientific principles observed and estab ? lished ? Mr. Freeman , the historian , has made familiar the Greek experiments in fed ? eral government . The Achiean League , of the third century lee. , is the first of his great Federal Commonwealths , of which our country is the fourth , and he de ? clares that " probably no two constitu ? tions , produced at such a distance of time and place from one another , ever presented so close a resemblance as that which exists between the constitution of the United States and the constitution of the Aclwan League . " Mr. Freeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of independent city common ? wealths , the land where the system reached its fullest and its most brilliant development , and the land where its good and its evil results may be most fairly balanced against each other . " Clearly , Greece furnished good soil for the ger ? mination of the seed of political and social theories . The governments of Greece were not all formed on one or two models , like the ordinary city and state governments of North America . The philosopher Aristotle , " the master of those who know , " made a collection of the constitutions of more than one hun ? dred and fifty different states , some of which , like Athens , had had eleven or more different kinds of government ; and we have reason to believe that in the little country of Greece there existed as many and as large a variety of political constitutions as exist to-day on the con ? tinent of Europe . Never elsewhere was a like opportunity offered for the presenta ? tion and maintenance of so many polit ? ical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old saying is not altogether wrong , that the ordinary citizen of Athens was more intelligent than the ordinary member of the British House of Commons . As in the present century , no form of government was sacred simply because it had been inherited from re ? mote ancestors . Change was readily ac ? cepted , in the indefinite hope that it might prove a change for the better . The small states of Greece were so isolated by their positions , often being walled of from their neighbors by moun ? tains , or separated by arms of the sea , that their political experiments had an unusual degree of independence . In this independence they were supported also by the proud spirit of rivalry which existed among them . In the details of its constitution and laws , Athens , for example , seems to have borrowed little from Thebes or from Sparta . Aristotle 's great collection of ancient political constitutions has been lost , ex ? cept for the " Constitution of Athens , " which was restored to the modern world from an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are preserved as quotations . Of the constitutional his ? tory of most of the states of Greece , lit ? tle is known in the way of a connected story . But the ancient historians give us many hits of evidence on such points , and thousands of inscriptions , mostly dis ? covered in recent areleological research ? es , afford contemporary evidence with regard to many details . Of Sparta , Plutarch presents in his Life of Lycurgus such a familiar account of the reforms ascribed to that law ? giver as to make the story quite a com ? monplace . Every schoolboy knows that the Spartan men had common " messes " in time of peace as well as on campaigns of war ; that no Spartan was allowed to CXV. ? No 690. ? 1 1 8possess treasure of gold or silver , their ordinary money being of iron ; that the magistrates directed the exposure on the mountains of any infant which was so deformed or siek/y that it was not likely to prove a strong citizen ; and that in every way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in honor before that of the family or the indi ? vidual . For the common weal the true Spartan was ready at any time to under ? take any service or to submit to any privation . The Spartans did not discuss - nor publish their theories , however , nor trouble themselves about the basis of their principles , nor did they make many experiments , ? they being fond neither of much talk nor of innovations . They stood together not so much because of their principles of government as be ? cause of their elan spirit . The reader must observe , however , that the Spartan principles held only for the ruling class ? the " peers . " When their ancestors took possession of the country , they reduced the former owners of the land , and in particular the " Helots , " to the position of serfs . Reserving a considerable part of the territory for the common use of their flocks and herds , they allotted the rest in equal shares to the families of the " peers , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to till this land , and thus to furnish subsistence for the true Spartan families . Thus . each Spartan citizen could give himself unreservedly to the service of the state , and in general this meant either serving in the army , or preparing for war by exercise which would both train him for battle and keep him in the best physical condition . Not being al ? lowed to possess silver or gold , and being closely limited in his freedom of leaving the country , while at times all strangers were expelled from his land , the Spitrtan was not stimulated to engage in com ? merce or manufactures . In principle , the Spartans had neither poverty nor riches . They suffered no want , yet they knew no luxury ; the ordinary food of the best of them ? the " black broth , " which had a great name in the ancient world ? was more like to oatmeal porridge than to any other viand which often appears on our tables . The subjects of the Spartans , living in their country , shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless often were the owners of more material wealth than the Spartans themselves possessed , while they also were liable to suffer from the woes of poverty . To most of us , Athens represents Greece , and this not unfairly . The tribes and states of Greece differed wide ? ly in spirit and in culture , as well as in government ; but , after all , as compared with their neighbors , the Greeks may be classed together , and at Athens was found the very essence of the Greek spirit . An epigram ascribed to the greatest of ancient historians calls Ath ? ens the " Hellas of Hellas . " There was found the widest scope for the untram ? melled development of the individual , yet with a demand for subordination to the collective will , since all were bound to ? gether by a strong common interest . These two impulses , each with unusual force , met at Athens , and the result was not a homogeneous social compact , but one of great variety . Perhaps no other city was ever so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ac ? cident of wealth or poverty so slightly affected the relations of men to each other . No honorific titles were cus ? tomary there , either . The small boy of the street might address the chief general simply as " Pericles " or " Themistocies . " Cliques existed then as now , but the social circles were not so exclusive . This was clue partly to the seclusion of women , but chiefly to the fact that the life of the citizen was in the open air . The young men were constantly meeting on terms of equality in their gymnastic exercises and in their military service , and the older men were brought together frequently at the town meetings , the sessions of the Senate of Five Hundred , the many public festivals , and in the courts . Since the ordinary jury consist ? ed of five hundred citizens , and not sim ? ply all suits of the Athenians but also those of their subject-allies were to be tried at Athens , the service as juryman. then was much more important than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had little influence on politics . " Trades-unions " did not exist at Athens until after her glory had passed . Of Athens , fortunately , we know more than of any other Hellenic city , thanks not only to its writers , but also to its very numerous records on stone . Early in the sixth century before our era , not very long after the beginning of the strictly historical period in Greece , affairs in Athens were in a had way , and the wise Solon deserves the credit of bringing harmony out of discord . The poor were virtually enslaved to the rich , we are told ? having borrowed money and pledged their own persons , or members of their families , as security . As a mem ? ber of an old family , but of very moderate wealth , Solon had the confidence of both parties , and was chosen absolute arbi ? trator and lawgiver . The poor had de ? manded a new division of the land . This was not granted by Solon , but he allowed the repudiation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or Seisach ? theia , as it was called ? and freed the land from mortgage , while he allowed the payment of other debts in what amounted to a debased currency . Solon also enacted sumptuary laws , which were intended to lessen the social distinctions between the rich and the poor . No wom ? an , for example , was to have an elaborate trousseau , nor to take a large trunk with her when she went on a visit , and no funeral or sepulchral monument was to he very costly . A contemporary of Solon in Corinth attempted to restrain any of his people from spending more than his income , but the Athenian lawgiver did not undertake such a regulation . The burdens of the government at Athens in general were borne by the well-to-do . The poor citizen paid neither direct nor indirect taxes . No article that he used had paid tribute to the state . The house in which he lived and the land which he tilled , if his own , were not taxed . The importation of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid nothing which corresponds to the modern imposts on tea , coffee , sugar , and tobacco . The Athenian state in certain respects was primitive and simple , leaving much to the initiative of the individual , while in other matters more responsibility was assumed by the government . Most of the questions and cries of modern socialism did not exist for the ancient Athenians . Natffrally , ? for they had no telephones or telegraphs , postal or express service , railroads , trolley-cars , or even cabs or omnibuses . They had no " public car ? riers , " and had no regulated civil service . Their streets were not lighted by night ; as in London a few centuries ago , a torch was needed if a man left home on a dark night . The state had no banks , but set its stamp on the silver which served as the ordinary money . The supply of water for the city of Athens was under the care of government officials , but this water was not brought to every man 's door , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious period of the city 's history we know little of what was done for the water-supply , and this supply must have been unsatisfactorily small , though nat ? urally much less is wasted , and thus much less suffices , when it must he brought in jars from the fountain than when it can be drawn directly from a faucet . The first extensive plan for the supply of water for the city of Athens seems to be due to Solon 's younger con ? temporary , the " tyrant " Pisistratus , who brought water from the upper valley of the flissus to the market-place , where it flowed in a stream . No great improve ? ment on this was made until the days of the Roman rule . Athens never had such a bounteous supply of good water as imperial Rome enjoyed , and , until the Romans conquered Greece , had no great public baths . Nothing is said of underground sewers in Athens in Hellenic times . For the most part , certainly , the drains were above ground , as they were until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set on the throwing of filth and rubbish into the streets , but the comedies of Aristophanes afford suf ? ficient evidence that the streets often were not cleanly . The peace of the city of Athens was committed to public sentiment and private citizens , to a degree which would astonish us in any modern city of about 200,000 inhabitants . In all the hundred extant Attic orations which deal with cases before the Athenian courts , no reference appears to an arrest as made by a police official . The Athenian constable seems never to conduct to prison a dis ? orderly citizen , nor to stop a hand-to hand conflict between two parties . If any arrest was to be made , the individ ? nal citizen , with or without the help of his friends or chance comers , was obliged to arrest the man who best the citizen might go to a public office and ask a magistrate to accompany him to the scene of a misdemeanor . No police patrolled the streets . And if an assault , a theft , or a murder was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discovering the criminal and bringing him to trial and punishment . Any cit ? izen might bring such a prosecution , but in general this duty was left to the in ? jured person , and if he could not or would not prosecute , the offence went un ? punished . The state had no prosecuting attorney . If the popular assembly , the town meeting , desired the punishment of an offender , it would appoint a special commission for the purpose of conduct ? ing this prosecution . Most offences which we regard as crimes against the state were to the Athenians simply wrongs to an individual . The courts themselves were in many respects only branches or committees of the popular assembly . Just as the quelling of any turmoil was left to the private citizens , so also the quenching of any fire or conflagration was accomplished by those who were most interested , without enlisting the aid of any specially trained men or partic ? ular equipment . The chief duties of those who might be thought to correspond to our police commissioners seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flute-girls , who served as musicians at private entertainments , to determine the disposition of refuse , to gee that walls did not encroach on the limits of the streets , that windows look ? ing on the street did not open outward , and that no balconies were built over the public way . No public benevolent institutions were known at Athens for the good of the afflicted , no hospitals or retreats for the sick or insane , and no schools for the blind or dumb . Doubtless , as in very much later times and in ' Western coun ? tries , much suffering was not alleviated , which might have been avoided , but the sympathetic personal help of neighbors and friends did much which now is ex ? pected of the state or of institutions . No benevolent corporations seem to have existed in early Greece , although " mu ? tual benefit " societies were common . The city had a physician , or physicians , but of his work little is known . We may assume that he cared for the sick poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensary practice is not dear . If the Athenians had no public parks , this lack was not so painfully felt by them , since in addition to unimproved common land , often about shrines or tern-pies , there were groves or fields , which really were open for the enjoyment of the people , under no stricter limitations than were reasonable . The summit of the Acropolis itself , with its temples and statues , had little grass and few trees , but was of beauty and grandeur surpass ? ing our praise . The gymnasiums also , outside of the city walls , afforded open places for the refreshment of men . In such gathering-places , Socrates often held converse with his friends , and from the Platonic dialogues we learn that rhetor ? ical and philosophical lectures often were given there . Indeed , two of the great schools of philosophy ? both that of Plato and that of Aristotle ? were named for the two gymnasiums in or near which their sessions were held , the Academy and the Lyceum ? words very familiar in modern life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public use of the citizens , the climate calling for a shelter against sun and rain which should not interfere with the free passage of the breezes . Education was under the control of the state , though no public schools were pro ? vided by the city of Athens . Aristotle declared that the statesman 's art should determine what studies should be pur ? sued , and how far . Public sentiment re ? quired a father to care for his son 's edu ? cation , and apparently one who neglected this duty was considered to be an un ? natural parent , and had no claim for support in old age by this son . The children of a citizen who died in battle were adopted by the state , and were edu ? cated as well as supported until they came of age . The government at Athens , as we have seen , left to the initiative of the indi ? vidual much care which is accepted by modern states , but it took great pains to provide for the supply of food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not provide food for so large a state as Athens became in the fifth century before our era . The diplomacy of the state was ever alert to form relations which would foster the bringing of grain to Attica , whether from the region of the Black Sea , from Egypt , or from Sicily . No product of the soil but olives and olive-oil might be exported from Attica , and no Athenian ship was al ? lowed to carry wheat or barley to any other port than that of Athens , under heavy penalties . If an Athenian capital ? ist lent money on a cargo of wheat to be carried from the Black Sea to Cyprus , he could not recover his loan by a suit in an Athenian court , for such use of his money was illegal . Pains were taken to satisfy foreign shipmasters at Athens , both by fixing heavy penalties for any wrong done to them , and also by provid ? ing special courts to settle promptly all disputes in which they were interested . And when the grain had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made by the trader ? appointing death as the penalty for any combination to raise the price of grain , ? and govern ? ment inspectors watched closely to see that the grain was of standard quality , that the measures were of the proper size , and that the price of bread was not too high as compared with that of grain . If the Athenians had no free public libraries , yet they had a freer oral inter ? change of thought than is often practica ? ble now . They had no public museums or art-galleries , but in and on their tem ? ples they had such works of sculpture as the world had not seen before , and such as have not been wrought since their time ; their public porticos were adorned with great paintings , and at their festivals were given as prizes vases which are the pride of modern museums . If they had no free public concerts on summer evenings , nor displays of fire ? works on the Fourth of Inly for the amusement of the people , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic contests , mag ? nificent pageants , torch-races , and lyric and dramatic performances of the high ? est order , and from these festivals no citizen was excluded . The city provided the entrance-money for the theatre in or ? der that all might take part in what was to them a religions function . Athens was a " very religious " city , according to the Apostle Paul . No other state in Greece had so many festivals , and certainly none other celebrated its holidays and holy days with such magnificence of pomp . Scholars hare estimated that in each year about two thousand men and boys took part in the choral dances at Athens , in almost a hundred choruses . The primitive character of the Athe ? nian government is seen clearly in the manner of its provision for the festivals which have been mentioned , which were directly under the control of the state . The city-state of Athens had no registry of the land and other property held by its people . No " assessors " in the mod ern sense existed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a year the exact amount of his property or income , and to pay taxes accordingly . In early times the govern ? ment had been maintained by the co ? operation of the citizens , each being ex ? pected to render service as a soldier in time of war , and as a magistrate when called to this office . If a man had no horse , clearly he could not serve in the cavalry . If he had no shield and spear of his own , he could not serve with the heavy-armed troops ? the hoplites . In such a case he must provide a bow , or at least a sling , and do what he could in his country 's cause . At times we hear of well-to-do citizens providing equip ? ments for their poorer neighbors , that a brave man and good fighter might have a place in the more important arm of service . But the state provided no horses for its cavalry , and when it gave a full equipment of arms to a soldier 's orphan son on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not as a government . In lieu of regular annual taxes , the rich Athenian citizen was called to render irregular , extraordinary services , called liturgies . For example , though the dramatic performances were under the control of one of the chief officers of state , he determined no details and ex ? pended no money for them . At the great festival of Dionysus , or Bacchus . each spring , in addition to comedies , there were presented plays by three tragic poets ? in general each poet giving three tragedies and a kind of farce , called a satyr-dramu . The works of each poet were assigned to some rich citizen , who was bound not merely to secure the proper chorus , to have it trained , to pay the actors , and to provide the necessary cos ? tumes and scenery , but also to attend to all other details of the presentation of the plays . The expenses of such a chorus would not be less than the equivalent of three or four thousand dollars in our time , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided each year . Not all , however , were so expensive as those for tragedy . On the other hand , the citizen who was called to pay the expenses of taking a chorus to the festival of Apollo at Delos , or conducting a " sacred em ? bassy " to the Istlnnian Games at Cor ? inth , might have to pay a larger sum than the tragic chore gu s . The spirit of rivalry was so keen that these services were rarely performed in a perfunctory manner . A man of any ambition would be eager in these matters to do more than his rivals , and to present the best trained and equipped chorus . In case one was called upon to perform such a service when he had already done his full share , he might ask some other cit ? izen to take the service , and demand an exchange of property if this other citizen claimed that he was not so well able to bear the burden as was the man who was first selected . A similar law to that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or ships of war . Each ship was assigned each year to the care of some citizen , who had charge of it . Not that he was expected to be its navi ? gating officer , but he was required to . be with the ship and to keep it in order for service . This trierarch also was filled with the spirit of rivalry , and tank pride in securing the best crew and in main ? taining the highest discipline , so that the admiral might select his boat to be the " flag-ship " of the fleet . In degenerate days the citizen who was called to be trierarch not infrequently hired another to do his work , but this letting of the service was never respectable . The trier arch also might call another man to perform the service , and demand an ex ? change of property in case of refusal . The cost of building the ships of war , in the palmy days of Athens , was borne not by her citizens , but by her allies and tributary states , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defence of Greece , and later , when they wished for independence , found that the ships for which they had paid could constrain their allegiance to Athens . The necessary expenses of the Athe ? nian state in early years were not great , the expenses of war being borne for the most part by the soldiers themselves , their ships being built with tribute-money , their religious festivals being in charge of different citizens in turn , and the state as such bearing no charge for schools , libraries , parks , fire department , or police . In those days no man received pay for service as magistrate , nor for any other work done for the state . Grad ? ually , however , the principle of compen ? sation was introduced , and we are told that their fees for service as jurymen and for attendance on town meetings were an important part of some men 's income . These fees were small enough , however , as they seem to us . At most the citizen might receive a drachrne , amounting to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about equal to our dollar , for attendance at the popular as ? sembly , for which some had to come several miles from their homes . For service as juryman for a day the Athe ? nian would receive at most what would be equivalent to half a dollar now . The higher officers of state similarly re ? ceived what would correspond to a dollar a day in our time ? not enough to tempt to a luxurious life . The difference between the compensa ? tion of the chief magistrates and that of the jurymen seems to modern readers to he very slight , but it has many analogies in ancient Greek life . In the army of Greek mercenaries which the younger Cyrus led against his brother Artaxerxes , King of Persia , the captain received for pay and rations just twice as much as the common soldier , and the general just twice as much as the cap ? tain . And the architect of a temple onthe Athenian Acropolis received only twice the pay of the ordinary stone ? cutter . Evidently no great money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were expected to live in much the same style . In the great century of the history of Athens ? the century of Marathon and Salamis , of Themistocles and Pericles , of JEschylus and Sophocles , of retinue . and Phidias ? while the city Was erecting the most beautiful temples for the gods , no private man seems to have had a dwelling much more mag ? nificent than his neighbors . We do not hear of the architect of the Parthenon as invited to design a house for Callias or for any one else . Athens possessed silver-mines at Lau ? rium , on the southern promontory of Attica , and these were of real importance on two occasions . They supplied the bullion for the coinage of the city at the time when Athens was rapidly gaining commercial supremacy in Greece , in the sixth century before our era ; and early in the next century the income of these mines , instead of being distributed to the citizens , as was proposed , was wisely diverted by the influence of Themistocles , and used for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have vanquished the Persians at Salamis . The government prudently retained pos ? session of these mines , and rented them to citizens , who kept many slaves at work in them , with a large profit . The writer of a treatise on the Revenues of Athens , which has come down to us under the name of Xenophon , proposed an elab ? orate scheme for the purchase of slaves by the city in order to work these mines . calculating that the income would suffice to support the citizens , so that no one but slaves need work . But this plan was not adopted , and in the next century the mines became less valuable . In times of special need , the Athe ? nians could use the money received as tribute for the common defence , and stored on the Acropolis , or even might borrow the gold mantle from the image of the goddess Athena and treat it as bullion . For the purchase of supplies and the hiring of mercenaries in time of war , the citizens naturally were ex ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so regulated that they might fairly be called taxes . If war was imminent and troops were to be raised and equipped , with help of those who could not otherwise do their full part in the war , extraordinary gifts were called for , just such as were familiar to town meetings in America at the out ? break of the civil war . A rich man at Athens , the reader may see , had abundant opportunities to bear the burdens of the state . Public senti ? ment at Athens and Athenian ambition being what , they were , many a rich man paid heavier taxes than would be re ? quired by any modern system . The orator Isocrates declared that he had ex ? pended far more on the city than on his family . A similar claim was often made before a court of justice , the speaker asking sympathy on the ground that he had become a poor man from the pos ? sessor of wealth because of his expen ? ditures for the city 's ships of war and her public festivals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had but two talents remaining . These patriotic expenditures were the chief outlet for ambition on the part of rich young men who had no special powers as leaders of the people . Reference has been made already to the Athenian state 's accepting the care of the orphans of the men who fell in battle . Cripples or other helpless per ? sons , with property less than what would amount to about $300 now ( but which might bring eighteen per cent . interest ) , might receive from the state a small pit ? tance ? a third or a half the wages of an ordinary man ? a sum sufficient to support life only in a warm climate . In the times of the Peloponnesian War , when the country folk were driven with ? in the city walls , public works were un ? dertaken , largely for the purpose of providing employment for the people , and at one time the state supported 20.000 people . The most famous of all literary presentations of a scheme for a com ? munistic state is Plato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be friends , and , as friends , are to have all things in common ? nut only property , but wives , ? and women are to have the same rights and duties as men . The life of the Platonic state is much more strictly regulated than is generally sup ? posed , however , and it is far from being such a " free-love " community as was known in America half a century ago . Of all the Platonic rulers , an extraordi ? nary degree of self-control is required , and how far his peculiar laws are to be applied to farmers , mechanics , and trades ? people , Plato himself does not say . At least a dozen years before Plato completed his Republic , or about 390 B.C. , the comic poet Aristophanes presented what seems a travesty of some of its salient ideas , in his Women in the Pop ? ular Assembly , or Eeclesiansm . Aris ? tophanes was not a reformer , but a con ? servative , and the chief interest of his play in this connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the proof that nearly four centuries before our era such communistic schemes were so much talked about that the audience would consider the satire timely . This play assumes that several plans had been presented to the public , and were in the air , to the end that each citizen should render service to the community ac ? cording to his ability , and should re ? ceive from the community according to his need . To undertake to state the influence which the communistic elements in Athenian life had upon the extraordinary development of Athenian art and lit ? erature in the fifth century before our era would he very dangerous . But any reader may see that the artist and the dramatist were not stimulated by any material rewards or prizes . ' Esc/33 ' 1ns had no income whatever , so far as we know , from his plays , and , as we have seen , the architect 's pay was only twice that of the stone-cutter . The sources of the glory of Athens in the age of Pericles have not been discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements , and the common life at Athens was full of suggestions and stimulus .
