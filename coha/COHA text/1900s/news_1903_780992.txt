txt An owl Which , flew in by a window and perched on the foot of her bed frightened a woman to death in Gouverneur Hospital last night . The woman was Mrs. Elizabeth Forschleischer , forty-one years old , of 349 Madison Street . It was about 8 o'clock when she lay in bed on the top floor , a window near the end of her bed , looking out on the river where the moon was rising , very large . A shadow seemed to cross , the moon , and something hurtled through the window , and alighted at the foot of her bedstead . The creature was awesomely weird-=she had never seen an owl before  --  and the terrified patient uttered a blood-curdling shriek . In an instant the room was in an uproar . The other patients half rose in bed to see what was happening , and the entire staff of doctors , nurses , attendants , matrons , and help of the hospital rushed to the top floor . Mrs. Forschleischer was found terribly agitated , and a nurse and doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The owl meanwhile had flown to the lintel of a window , near the ceiling , and " towhoo-ed " and spread his wings . He was a foot high . A consultation ' was held . Dr. Emily Dunning , the woman ambulance surgeon , suggested a ladder ; Dr. Batchelder , the house surgeon , a pole ; Dr. Horowitz , dousing him with water , and other suggestions were made hurriedly . It was decided to try the pole . A long curtain pole was secured by Mr. Helliken . The bird hooted at him as he made the first lunge , but the second came too close and the owl set out for the other , end of the room . He hit the wall a dozen 4 times in his flight , banged his head . and body against bedsteads and clothing and wall projections , and finally clung to a door lintel , somewhat higher than he had been before . Most of the women patients were terribly frightened , and the nurses had to reassure them , but some laughed at the fun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bird went on unavailingly . Half a dozen failures with the pole and the caustic comments of doctors , nurses , and patients led lir . Milliken to give up in disgust . Miss Weyer , the head nurse , and Matron Stowers then tried it , but the owl clumsily , although successfully , eluded their pokes at him . He led them a chase all over tile ward , while some patients screamed and others laughed heartily , Then Dr. Horowitz wanted his suggestion of turning the hose on the owl taken liP . " You see , " he said , " if you wet his wings he ca n't fly . " This was deemed incontrovertible , and a huge syringe was trained upon the owl by Dr. Horowitz and an assistant . " Fire , " cried Dr. Horowitz , and a pail of water was discharged at the bird . It came nearer hitting the nurses than the owl , struck the wall , splashed all over it , showering pictures , bed clothing , some patients , and the floor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head . The owl did not move . There was a tacit understanding that the plan had proved such a failure that it should not be repeated . Then Mr. Batchelder said chloroform was the only thing that would subdue the bird and bring the excitement to an end . He tied a piece of gauze to the end of the curtain pole and dipped it in chloroform . The owl was clinging for dear life ' to a picture frame , which swung to and fro under his weight - and frightened him more than the pursuers did . The chloroform , with great Precautions , - was pushed near him . He gave a loud " to-wheo " of disgust , and once more flew away , clumsily banging against a dozen things in a flight of six- feet and alightingorra winelovriedge. ? Again the chloroform was gingerly shovea toward him " Nice birdie , " said Dr. Batchelder , coaxingly . " Pretty bird ; smell o ' that . Go to slee-ee-eep , birdie . " But the owl was off again , like an aeroplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the head in his awkward flight . Here 's what 'll do the trick , " said Dr. Dunning , coming in with a waste paper basket tied to the end of a pole . Another chase began , and all made attempts to ca tch the owl in the basket , as a child would catch a butterfly in a net . The doctors and nurses upset pictures , tables , glasses , and chairs , bumped against walls and beds , and made ineffectual dabs at the bird . Then by mutual consent and initiative the entire hospital staff got sticks and clubs and tried to hit the owl . He flew this way and that , banging against everything in the room until he flew into the kitchen . There he was cornered , a stroke brought him to the floor and Miss Weyer captured him . He was put under the waste paper basket and fed on stewed prunes , which he seemed to like . The doctor intends to keep him .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
