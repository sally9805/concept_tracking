txt The talk about renominating Gov . Hues and making the campaign for lac upon the issue of race-track 511412:Ming suggests laborious days and anxious nights for those Republican Senators who voted against the Anti- . Gambling bills . That sense of logic , coherence , and consistency that ought Id reside somewhere in every well-organized mind would be palsied by the attempt to imagine a Republican constituency ' voting for Gov . HUGHES because of his firm purpoSe to stop gambling , and at the same election voting for the recreant Senators who had baffled him . As well vote for a free-trade President and a standpat Congressman , or insist upon a " wide-open town-afterclecting a Prohibition Mayor . We do not know whether Mr. CASSIDY , Mr. GR.ATTAN , and Mr. Wn.cox desire another term in the Senate , but if they are in the field this talk . must give them pain . The easiest way out , of course , is for themto shift sides at the special session and vote for t . e bills . Mr. PARSONS may have had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke of running Mr. HUGHES again . Coming over to the support of the bills would be furthe7 commendable as a proper - moral act , though we are not certain that this consideration would have weight with the Republican Senators who managed the tie vote . At any rate , the opponents of the prospective measures have to reckon with Gov . Huonms . He has made a great many speeches on the gambling-issue , and they are all effective . The man who keeps at it is sure to make an impression upon the public mind if his cause is just . The complete justice of the Governor 's cause is testified to by the inability of anybody to make answer to his arguments . There is the Constitution , with its express mandate that the Legislature shall pass appropriate laws to prevent the sale of lottery tickets . poolselling , bookmaking " or any other kind of gambling " in the State of New York . On that rock the Governor stands , and is impregnable . No responsible man can seriously say a good word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has made so many speeches upon the issue , and has made them so well , that he has the people with him . As against the obstructive Senators of his own party he would be pretty certain to have the votes and the approval even of their own constituents . There is another consideration that gives force to the suggestion that the Governor be renominated . Neither the country nor his own State went wild over his name when it was put forward for Presidential honors . But it would be a pretty good name to have on the ticket this Fall when some other Republican is to run for the Presidency . We presume the Republicans of New York could put forward no other candidate who would command the strength Gov . HUGHES commands . His general record in the Executive office would help him , and upon the gambling issue he would be stronger than anybody else . The people like him , too , for the enemies he has made . Owing to their opposition some of his work is unachieved . Some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason he might be persuaded to re " consider Ms known intention not to serve again .
