txt The Senate Committee on Interoceanic Canals to-day ordered a favorable report on the Nicaragua Canal bill as it passed the House . There were only five members of the committee present at to-day 's meeting . A motion was made to report the bill , and without debate the vote was taken , Senators Morgan , , Harris , and Turner voting in the affirmative and Senator Hanna in the negative . Since the passage by the House of Representatives of the bill there had been a struggle over it in the Senate committee . A portion of the committee desired either to kill the bill or hold it back until after the Hay-Pauncefote treaty should be out of the way . The chance for a report on the bill hung upon the decision of Senator of Oregon . who was counted first by one side and then by the other . The committee consists of . nine members , so that when - the one doubting Republican made up his mind to- vote for a report , it became the will of the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanna has been opposed to the attempt to pass a bill , while the United States has not settled the question as to the validity of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty , and he has represented not only the President , but the Department of State in assuming that position . The opposition takes the view of the supporters of the bill in the House that they do n't care much about treaties , anyhow , and as this is an inconvenient treaty , it will do just as well to kick it over as to resort to the practice of effete Eastern nations and denounce it formally before violating it . The fact that the bill is reported does not necessarily signify that it is to be passed before adjournment . That fact has been determined upon , although the decision . which needs only to take the form of a joint resolution , may assume some indication of delay in case the Clark case is not disposed of . A leading Republican Senator said this afternoon that the Clark case would be disposed of before adjournment , " if it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Clark of Montana want the Nicaragua Canal they need only to hold up the Canal bill and the Clark case together to escape being sent home empty . Should a vote be reached on the Nicaragua bill , there can be little doubt what will happen to it unless there has been a great change of opinion since Jan. 21 , 1899 . On that day the bill substantially like that before the Senate was passed without a roll call . Senator Vest objected to the passing of such an important measure without a quorum present , and upon his remonstrance the vote was reconsidered , the roll was called , and the bill was passed by a vote of 48 to U. Mantle ( Rep. ) and Smith ( Dem. ) were among the negative voters on that day . The affirmative vote was made up of thirty-one Republicans and seventeen Democrats , most of whom are now in the Senate . With such support as this behind the bill , it would be possible to get up at any time and force it to a Vote without much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines resolution is to be disposed of before the appropriation bills are finished , and the warm weather admonishes members of both houses that convention time approaches . But it is not considered at all certain that the President would approve the Nicaragua bill if it goes to him before the Hay-Pauncefote treaty is disposed of in some way . A Senator on the Foreign Relations Committee said that he could not see how the President could commend a treaty for ratification which proposes to construe the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and then approve a bill which discredits the Clayton-Bulwer treaty as of no account one way or another . " The bill and the treaty are diametrically opposed to each other , " said he . " The President can not approve both . He has approved the Hay-Pauncefote treaty . It Is incredible to imagine that he would now sign a bill that flies in the face of the old treaty and the proposed new settlement of the meaning of it . "                  @ @ @
