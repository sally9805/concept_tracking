 | IN 1857 , when the writer was already established in business , he learned by the failure of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company how to face difficulties that are apt to confront us on the occasion of almost every panic . lie drew in current bills some money from a Williamsburgh Bank and $100 in gold from the Bank of New York . When subsequently almost every financial institution this side of the Rockies closed its doors , the writer would play chess in his office with his clerk , while his distracted neighbors chased the fleeting shadows of ephemeral bankers . Wampum had been discarded ; Clearing House certificates had not yet been invented and coin was scarce . The circulating medium consisted of notes issued by banks in different parts of the country , some under guarantee of a safety fund held by States , others by so-called " free banks . " While the former generally passed at their face values , bills of the latter , named also " wild cats , " ranged , according to their redemptive qualities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount . The possibility of their being presented for payment never troubled the banker 's mind when he stamped them " Payable at his Counter , " and forwarded them for circulation . An inquisitive New York broker once ventured to send his clerk with a satchel full of such bills to a town in Illinois ; he found a log cabin on a prairie road , with a sign of the bank over the door and a " cashier " the only occupant . The " cashier " expressed profuse regrets that the President happened to be in Chicago and that he had taken the cash box with him . At the outset of the panic of 1857 , the remaining institutions of that class became insolvent . The bills of almost all banks , even those of doubtful value , were counterfeited . Thompson 's Bank Note Reporter , published bi-monthly at No. 2 Wall Street , New York City , carefully described all detected counterfeits and quoted market prices for all discredited money . After the business man , who would rather dispense with Bible and Prayer-book than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his receipts  | and obtained the endorsement of a responsible person to every doubtful bank-note , he went at 2.30 p.m. to his broker to change the uncurrent for current money , as his bank would receive only the latter . ' Credit was expensive in 1857 ; the writer knew traders who had to pay for a single day 's accommodation as much as one per cent . Merchants who would not submit to the hardship of such usury failed to meet their engagements ; manufacturers were obliged to discharge their workmen and close their mills when their customers defaulted . The fare to Chicago was reduced to $5 , yet the cars were empty ; we rarely met on the way a traveller who was not a deadhead . Almost every road passed into receivers ' hands ; at one time railroad obligations other than receivers ' certificates were not recognized . The writer , on one of those gloomy days , was agreeably surprised by the invitation of a friend to join him in a glass of wine . We went to Delmonico 's , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while Longhi uncorked a bottle of his best , friend Andrew unfolded a letter to explain the whimsical reason for his good cheer . In the conventional terms of the times the letter simply announced the insolvency of another firm . As this closed the long list of his debtors no other failures impended to disturb his mind . We celebrated his deliverance , and drank to a speedy resumption of this and of the numerous debtors who had preceded him . Prosperity revived sooner than we anticipated . A large number of the merchants who failed in 1857 were able to resume in 1858 ; by the credit we extended to deserving customers we laid an early foundation for a long-continued good business . That short panic had been caused by premature expenditure for railroads built to develop new territory . Colonists could not be induced to settle along their lines as fast as promoters expected , and Western merchants had been more lavish than prudent in granting long credits to newcomers . When the crops were gathered and gold from California and from Europe began to pour into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forgotten . The attempted secession of the Southern States caused the commercial crisis of 1860-61 . Southern merchants had always been slow in meeting obligations . Then they came to consider it treason to pay any Northern creditor who failed to sympathize with the slaveholders ' cause . One of these , a New York merchant , was induced personally to go  | South to collect his outstanding accounts . As money was unobtainable he took rosin , cotton or any commodity he could get instead , and , by a sloop chartered at Wilmington , N. C. , he consigned this merchandise to New York with instructions to store on arrival . After his Southern claims were thus secured this ardent patriot stumped the Carolinas and Georgia for freedom , until he was himself deprived of it . Mistaken for a Northern spy he lingered for some time in Southern dungeons . When finally liberated he returned to New York and found his Wilmington cargo in his Brooklyn warehouse . The rosin he accepted for a dollar was worth forty , while Sea Island cotton , which cost him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although these prices were paid in depreciated money the small cargo realized a large fortune . The first expense of our Civil War was defrayed by the sale of Treasury notes drawing high rates of interest ? some at twelve per cent . per annum . Specie payments were first suspended in December , 1861 , by the banks , then by the Government . But the premium on gold was unimportant until Secretary Chase , moved by his aversion to usury , had the legal tender law enacted . It provided for notes which the Government issued for supplies , but which it did not agree to redeem in coin . When it came to be understood that the acceptance of these bills had been made obligatory not for present indebtedness alone , but also for past pledges , even for those that had been incurred at gold values , the premium on gold rose rapidly and a corresponding increase in the prices of commodities followed . It might have been more economical either to pay more interest or sell bonds below par . Our supplies would have cost less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase soon atoned for this error when he established the National Banking system . While he intended only to make a market for United States bonds , he created the best banking organization the country has ever had . The writer had confidence in the ultimate success of the Union , but he recognized that his liabilities ? duties on his imports and debts contracted to pay for them ? were payable in gold . For this reason he converted the greater part of his assets into gold and kept for it a special account in his bank . When he sold foreign merchandise for currency he engaged coin for the equivalent , and was satisfied with the commission so earned . A majority of his competitors tried , by speculating on a fall of the premium , to increase the five per cent . they might have gained . When , instead of falling , gold rose , they lost generally more . After the acute stages of the crisis had passed , fluctuations in the premium by which the metallic value of our currency was measured , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confi- dence . As long as our success was doubtful the premium rose until it reached 100 per cent . Public opinion foolishly blamed " copperheads , " as the Southern sympathizers were designated , and induced Congress , in 1863 , to prohibit , under heavy penalties , public dealings in gold . When the Exchange was closed , bullion dealers realized as much as 200 per cent . premium over the counter at private sale . But the scare was of short duration : the law was repealed with greater alacrity than it had been enacted . On the reopening of the " coal hole , " as the gold exchange on the southeast corner of William Street and Exchange Place , New York , was called , the premium fell . Yet it remained above a hundred until the news came that Sherman had captured Atlanta . Even then the soreheads continued to doubt They offered , during the evening session of the Exchange , to take all the gold in the country at 200 per cent. , and were obliged to accept contracts for more than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country has been almost entirely created by railroads is generally appreciated ; but few realize that the inception and early maintenance of some roads have ruined more than one generation of projectors . The years of prosperity that followed the Civil War encouraged a vast expansion of railroads , including lines which intended to compete with the established trans-continental business of the Union Pacific . The Northern Pacific Road had obtained grants for 47,000,000 acres of the public lands ? more than all the other roads in the country received together . It was financed by Jay Cooke , whose success in placing war loans had inspired the public with more confidence than any other banker enjoyed . But when he was suspected of having issued on this road more of the seven-thirty bonds , planned in imitation of the first successful Government loan , than he had agreed to issue , the sale of the bonds stopped . Being involved also in other Western roads Jay Cooke failed , and the panic of 1873 was precipitated . Failure of other bankers and of large merchants followed , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of merchandise , could be realized only at a sacrifice . The writer was able to take advantage of this opportunity . Buying drafts some five per cent . below par he used them to discharge his foreign indebtedness before it matured and recouped some losses he sustained by the insolvency of his customers . When subsequently the Union Trust Company could not borrow a million on the credit of the Lake Shore Railroad and was compelled to suspend , the crisis became intensified .  | The rapidity with which securities fell made the customary provisions for margins nugatory and scared brokers out of their wits . The bears realized that without recuperation nobody would be left to carry out contracts or to whom to make deliveries . Ender the circumstances , discretion seemed to be the better part of valor . Believing the measure would calm the excitement and restore confidence , brokers consented to close their offices and the Exchange . But neither the closing nor the reopening of the Exchange brought the expected relief . Instead of rising in response to the general desire prices continued to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few investments which the writer was able to make from his savings paid good returns , and are worth four times as much now as they were then . As customers were slow in coming to him the writer went to them . It required efforts in those days to run a business so that it paid expenses . During this crisis , real estate retained its value better than on previous occasions . When , in 1857 , Mr. E. needed funds to finance the erection of his Fifth Avenue Hotel , he called on the Trust Company , where lie kept an account , with plans of a triangular lot opposite , to offer it as security . They decided to lend the money to Mr. E. on his personal credit , rejecting the toothpick , as , according to its shape , his lot was named . The handsome Flatiron Building has since been erected on the disdained gore and the proud Fifth Avenue Hotel opposite is being demolished . When Fort Sumter surrendered some haughty " fire-eaters " predicted that grass would grow in Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at one time a third of the commercial buildings on lower Broadway in New York City were to let . The bankrupt tenant of a brown stone front on London Terrace was ineffectually urged by his landlord to remain free of rent ; he could get a better house for taking care of it . In 1873 , when " runs " on savings banks alarmed the public , Mr. B. , the careful president of one of the most important of these banks , found that bonds in which thirty per cent . of his money had according to law been invested were not available ; but the Mutual Life Insurance Company took his mortgages to an extent sufficient to satisfy the demands of his depositors . Values of productive realty near the business centre of any large city may temporarily decline , but they gradually recover and often rise beyond former values . Mortgages sold with the guarantee of responsible companies have become safer assets than almost any other investment , and are preferable to stocks and bonds of any industrial enterprise . Owners of well-conducted manufacturing establishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of a  | division of their interests , limiting , simultaneously , their liability to their respective allotment . Advantages of the conversion , the rentabilit combined with the facility of a transfer of these shares , found favor and imitators among owners of less prosperous concerns ; gradually they led to the formation of some fraudulent corporations . In Europe the " Griindungschwindler " flourished temporarily after the Franco-Prussian War . In this country they existed before that time , and they continue to prey on a gullible and covetous public at every favorable opportunity ; the avaricious promoters expect to realize much more than the actual value of the property . By lavish promises , glib schemers have induced substantial men to subscribe and reputable brokers to quote stock in companies that sometimes have no asset other than the impudence of their solicitor . Some financial institutions have admitted such stock as collateral for part of a loan at printed prices . When the first disturbance compels a withdrawal of the quotation the issue is often recognized as a swindle and the projector who has pocketed his commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the writer has discovered an effective antidote against the promoters ' wiles . He answers their recital of the golden opportunities they offer with the simple retort that he has more money than he needs already . A glaring example of dubious methods was furnished by managers of the old Cordage Company . They incorporated at fictitious values one ropewalk after another . Of the millions ostensibly paid to control the market a portion may have been alloted for dividends made , to establish a fictitious market value for the stock . Nobody ever discovered what became of the rest of the money . An exposition of this fraud precipitated the panic of 1893 . The real cause was the withdrawal of foreign capital . which had been frightened by the agitation for the free coinage of silver When industrials began to tumble , the writer , requested by an old crony to lunch with him at the Lawyers ' Club , was surprised to find his wealthy friend pressed for margins he could not furnish . He received numerous messages through the club 's waiters before the roast was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' phone after every glass of wine we raised to our lips . G. had temporarily assisted the writer when his Southern customers refused to pay in 1861 . So we first obtained a respite from the importunate brokers , and then a promise of the money to pay them for the stocks they carried . On the night of that same day , as member of an Entertainment Committee , the writer attended the ball given to the Spanish Princess Eulalia , and forgot the crisis . He was reminded some weeks later , at the  | Plankington Hotel , of its existence , when a Western friend described the drastic means some Western men employed to recoup deposits lost by the " run . " Amongst others a German brushmaker had withdrawn from his bank $500 . Safe deposit vaults being unavailable he hid the money in his bed ; but fear of robbers preyed on his mind until he found no rest on his couch nor comfort at his meals . When the banker heard of his dilemma he conceived the idea of pretending at midnight to burglarize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on his bed , revolver in hand , and carried his fortune back to the bank in the early morning . He was glad when the officers ended his worry by the reacceptance of his account . An amateur band of burglars was then organized , other whilom depositors were seared so as to follow the brushmaker 's example , and money became easy in that bailiwick . To relieve the poor , many of whom were out of employment during the winter of 1893 to 1894 , the writer joined a citizens ' committee , formed under auspices of the " Christian Alliance . " Members were expected to purchase tickets at the rate of $5 a hundred and distribute them gratis to applicants for charity . Each ticket entitled the bearer to a square meal in the basement of No. 170 Bleecker Street , New York City . As member of this committee the writer frequently convinced himself of the quality and quantity of the food furnished by Mr. Milbury , the agent . After a visit to kitchen and cellar he sat down on stools in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them a large bowl of fragrant steaming stew , a chunk of sweet bread and a cup of good coffee . Some of those supplies were furnished gratis , others at extremely low prices ; everybody was glad to help , by timely charity , the starving poor to good food . Ambitious struggles for the ownership of productive railroads have often disturbed our finances , but not all have resulted in advantage to the stockholders nor in benefit to the public . Any audacious pirate can buy or borrow in an easy money market shares enough in almost any road he desires to control . Before the annual election these shares are transferred , so that the filibuster can elect himself or subservient friends . When placed in power he finds complaisant auditors who will juggle figures so as to demonstrate that the earning capacity is greater than the book value of the property would indicate . New bonds and stocks , to satisfy the new owner 's greed , are accordingly issued . But it takes time for a road to earn money enough to make " capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanderbilt in this way obtained control of the New York Central Railroad . After doubling the stock  | he paid eight per cent . per annum instead of six per cent . on the increased capital . But roads do not all pass through a country equally prosperous ; not all presidents administer the property entrusted to their care as well as did the Commodore . Modern dilutors may keep some cream , but they are apt to sell , when they get it , the skim milk for what it will bring . When we examine rules which govern corporate elections abroad we find that stockholders who fail to exhibit a certificate of stock dated at least six months prior to the election can not vote . While this provision brings persons who have a real interest in the property to the polls , there are other rules which insure a representation in the board by a minority of the stockholders . Any new issue of stock in well-established corporations is in certain cases subordinated to existing issues . A revaluation of watered securities of our railroads , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilutions , would injure innocent holders who bought shares without knowing their antecedents . The inflation following the overproduction of gold had engendered a reckless speculation in railroad shares until incomes from the best issues were reduced to a three per cent . basis . When the Government reappraisal threatened the values in March , 1907 , market prices began to decline . But the crisis chiefly affected persons who in proportion to their means had borrowed too much money . Others were scarcely ruffled ; the Wrest laughed at Wall Street . Even speculators whose holdings were not too onerous went into new alluring ventures , and consented to pay out high rates of interest , when by the deal they expected to gain still more . The crisis of March might have had no worse consequence than a proper adjustment of values if suspicion of the conduct of our banks had not been engendered . When banks stimulate deposits by the promise of interest , and when , after agreeing to return such deposits on demand , they lend a large portion on time , they expose themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank reserves prescribed by our laws fail to make any provision adequate for such transactions . Beyond the Government debt of ninety million consols held by the Bank of England it can not issue a five-pound note for which it has not five gold sovereigns in the vault . Like the conservative merchants who conduct the business , it never fails to meet its engagements . Something more than the possession of money and the ability to make it is expected from European bank managers . Banks are established there to promote industry and commerce , not to foster speculation . A hank director can not qualify until he deposits an adequate number of shares , which his  | hank holds in escrow as long as he remains in office . He draws an annual salary for his services , to which a percentage of the profits is added . For any malefeasance detected by stockholders he is fined and may be imprisoned . In this country the possession of $1,000 worth of stock qualifies any man to become director of almost any bank . He is elected on the recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cringing subordinate colleagues . By the proxies they solicit and generally obtain , they control every election . When the writer once attended in person the annual meeting of stockholders in a large bank , he was treated with scant courtesy , and was made to feel that he was considered an intruder . Few professional directors ? " guinea pigs , " as Lombard Street calls them ? give proper attention to all the corporations they agree to serve . Some allow the use of their distinguished names to designing managers who tolerate no interference and invoke no help until they come to grief . The writer considers it a duty to give careful thought and to use as much vigilance in the interest of a corporation lie helps to direct as lie does to further his own affairs . For mistakes he has made he has had himself to suffer . The writer obtained from his bank recently , at four per cent . per annum , cash for his business paper , while he could have borrowed at the same time the money on the pledge of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial paper is discounted in London at a lower rate of interest than is charged for collateral loans . On the Continent such paper passes from one bank to another and is credited in the accounts they keep with each other at the current bank rates . Our banks hold this paper in their vaults until it matures . It becomes available only in times of distress . Then protective bank associations , called Clearing Houses , which were so employed here first in 1860 , help all the members they find solvent by the joint assumption of their secured liabilities . They issue for seventy-five per cent . of their commercial paper and other good assets Clearing House certificates for the payment of which the associations become liable . These certificates are used in the East to pay the obligation of one bank to the other ; in the West they have been divided into bills of small denominations , which have served to relieve the existing currency famine better than the tokens facetiously named " shinplasters " of yore . By the new Emergency Curreney Law this system may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to National Bank Associations outside of Clearing Houses .  | Shares of some influential banks were coveted by designing speculators , until they barely netted one per cent . per annum on ruling prices . How their possession might be abused has been demonstrated in New York by a group of three daring men . The father of one of them happened to be a valued friend of the writer 's , and a citizen of the highest standing in Brooklyn . When his son graduated with honors from the Columbia School of Mines , the writer was consulted as to the chances of his success in Western mines . We related , as an illustration , our experience with an Arizona mine we had been fortunate enough with some friends to acquire some years ago . We hardly had begun to exploit a rich vein when it was wrested from us by the brutal intrusion of men who broke into our shaft with a larger number than we could muster , and who , armed with pickaxes , drove our miners out , taking forcible possession of our property for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be persuaded to join us in a legal contest , we were compelled to abandon to our despoilers the possession of a mine worth millions , and to accept in full satisfaction the trifle we had spent on the development . Young Z. , who had the courage of his convictions and his father 's purse to back them , tried his fortune and succeeded beyond his most sanguine expectations . As he had a Senatorial bee in his bonnet he did not follow our advice to remain in the Western field , but came East with the avowed intention to increase his fortune and let others share it , perhaps . As he could not sell at his valuation a sufficient number of his shares , he conceived the idea of trying to corner them . To carry out his purpose he bought , with borrowed funds , a controlling interest in the Metal Bank , had himself elected President , and used the bank 's money to pay for shares , by the possession of which he expected to " boom " the market . But the metal cheapened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell to ten dollars , the bank 's entire reserve was absorbed by the difference . Of two confederates who , by their influence with other banks , had assisted Z. , on condition that he helped them to " boom " their schemes , one made a specialty of steamboats , the other of ice plants ; both shared with Z. the same discomfiture . The present New York State law forbids State banks to take more than a tenth part of the capital stock of any other bank either as collateral or for investment : a similar law if extended to National Banks would have made Z. 's transaction impossible . In consideration of the assistance they render each other , members of the Clearing House investigate the affairs of any other member whose actions arouse suspicion . When the disastrous speculation in those mining shares became known in October , 1907 , the New York Clearing House  | forced all offending directors to resign , before it consented to assist the implicated banks . Under the magnetic influence of Charles ' 1 ' . Barney , the Knickerbocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,200 , and the dividends increased from eight per cent . to fifty per cent . per annum . But a considerable part of its deposits of sixty millions was advanced on property that at the time had no ready market value . As soon as the Bank of Commerce realized the situation , it refused to clear for the Knickerbocker ; when this influential institution was compelled to suspend , the panic spread over the country . The manifold effects startled the community . It goes without saying that speculators were the first to suffer . One of the plutocrats whose property had shrunk some twenty-five millions in March became desperate when October pared a few millions more from his cherished estate . IIe lay hopelessly down to die , and his heirs found that he left about twenty millions only , instead of the fifty they expected . When ordinary " millionaires " reached the end of their liquid resources they sold their autos and discharged their servants . So many took the first opportunity to pass out of existence , that conservative life insurance companies were compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses of the large operators could be kept secret ; ashamed of their holdings , they spoke of them in whispers only . But toward the end of 1907 it became impossible to hide their perplexity . During a short trip across the ocean by a member of that triumvirate of " sehlemils " who expected to rule the market with the bank shares they acquired on instalments , an inquisitive sheriff broke into his divers strong boxes and found in them all together $100 worth of available assets . This " Captain of Industry " claimed the control of corporations capitalized for a hundred millions ! When their margins became exhausted the demeanor of some arrogant gamblers began to soften . As soon as they were recognized as highfliers only small orders were accepted from them with diffidence . They may resume their old games if they are successful ; but if they fail the second or third time , they will be relegated to the circle of " lame ducks . " If they want to indulge in their proclivities they must resort to " bucket shops , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw doors of many financial institutions besieged by depositors he was reminded of similar scenes in bygone days . Impatient men with the same anxious faces were again kept in line by the same patient police . Some were solicitous enough to pay premiums for ad- vanced positions and had time to regret their folly when they found that in spite of scandalmongers the bank resolutely declined to suspend . Keen brokers watched the hoarders who were successful in drawing money and followed them to their safe deposit vaults ; they persuaded them there to part , in consideration of a premium , with their currency for checks . Some employers paid to these sharks as much as four per cent . premium for their payrolls . When the premium dwindled and finally disappeared some of those brokers lost more than they previously had gained . When interest rose to 100 per cent . per annum , railroads and other industrials , that found difficulty before the panic to sell their notes , could borrow none at all , and many of them were compelled either to discharge their employees or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharged men became anxious to return to Europe , so that it became difficult to transport them . The laborers who remained had to be satisfied with the employment capital could offer . For the first time in years many of them began to realize that the pilot was essential to navigation as much as the motive power . The paucity of commercial failures in the face of compulsory retrenchment has demonstrated that American merchants who confine themselves to legitimate business are worthy of confidence . Of the security which the New York Clearing House accepted for certificates during the panic , more than seventy per cent . consisted of commercial paper , which was all paid as it matured . Speculators and politicians may look upon present conditions according to their respective interests ; with bounteous harvests in prospect and the evident return of confidence , prosperity can not be far distant . A courageous man need have no fear of a panic unless his hunger for gold ( " : 1 uri sacra fames " ) leads him to incur debt which he is not certain at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he can enjoy a quiet life and is more likely to command credit than his venturesome neighbor . We have drawn more gold from abroad during 1907 than on any previous occasion . About a hundred millions were needed to take the place of the hoarded money ; this vast amount was obtained without difficulty . In consequence of these drafts our panic has been grievously felt in the remotest parts of the globe : but at the same time it has demonstrated the financial strength of the country .
