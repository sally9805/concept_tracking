Illustration : " SHE PULLED A BOOK FROM HER POCKET AND BEGAN TO READ . " PREFACE . It was love for others which made Amy Kaye make use of the first opportunity which offered , even though it was an humble one and she was handicapped by ignorance . But having once decided what course was right for her , she followed it with a singleness of purpose and a thoroughness of effort which brought a prompt success . The help she was to others was no small part of this success . For in an age of shams and low ideals the influence of even one sincere girl is far-reaching ; and when to that sincerity she adds the sympathy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , this influence becomes incalculable for good . It is the author 's hope that the story of " Reels and Spindles " may aid some young readers to comprehend and make their own this beauty of simplicity and this charm of sympathy which are the outcome of unselfishness .

CHAPTER I. A BYWAY OF THE ARDSLEY . The white burro had a will of her own . So , distinctly , had her mistress . As had often happened , these two wills conflicted . For the pair had come to a point where three ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a path she knew , to stable and supper . Amy wished to follow a descending road , which she did not know , into the depths of the forest . Neither inclined toward the safe middle course , straight onward through the village , now picturesque in the coloring of a late September day . " No , Pepita . You must obey me . If I 'm not firm this time , you 'll act worse the next . To the right , amiable beastie ! " Both firmness and sarcasm were wasted . The burro rigidly planted her forefeet in the dust and sorrowfully dropped her head . Amy tugged at the bridle . " Pepita ! To  --  the  --  right ! Go on . In your native Californian  --  Vamos ! " The " Californian " budged not , but posed , an image of dejection . The happiness of life had departed ; the tale of her woe seemed pictured in every hair of her thickly coated body ; she was a broken-hearted donkey . Amy Kaye was neither broken-hearted nor broken-spirited , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . The air was delightful . She pulled a book from her pocket and began to read . In five minutes she was so absorbed that she had forgotten Pepita 's little mannerisms . After a while the " Californian " moved her head just enough to gain a corner-wise glimpse of a calm and unresponsive face beneath a scarlet Tam ; and evidently realizing that she had become a mere support to the maid who owned her , uttered her protest . " Bra-a-ay ! Ah-umph ! Ah-umph  --  umph  --  mph  --  ph  --  h ! " Amy read on . Pepita changed her tactics . She began to double herself together in a fashion disconcerting to most riders ; whereupon Amy simply drew her own limbs up out of harm 's way and waited for the burro 's anatomy to settle itself in a heap on the ground . " All right , honey . " Then she resumed her book , and the beast her meditations . Thus they remained until the rumble of an approaching wagon caused the now submissive animal to rise and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridle , and found that she might now ride whither she pleased . " Is it so , beloved ? Well , then , that 's right ; and when you do right because I make you , it is one lump of sugar . Open your mouth . Here . But , Pepita , when you do right without compulsion , there are always two lumps . Into the forest  --  go ! " Pepita went . Suddenly , swiftly , and so recklessly that Amy nearly slid over her head . " Very well ! What suits you suits me . I 'm as good a sticker-on as you are a shaker-off . Besides , a word in your ear . It would be quite the proper , story-book sort of thing for you to try and break my neck , as a punishment , since I 'm almost running away . " Though she had always lived within a few miles of the spot the girl had never before visited it . That she did so now , without knowledge of anybody at home , gave her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was fascinating . True , she had not been forbidden , simply because nobody had thought of her wandering so far afield ; yet the habit of her life had been such as to make anything out of the common seem strange , even wrong . " However , since I 'm here , I 'll see what there is to see and tell them all about it afterward  --  that is , if they will care to hear , " she ended her remark to the burro with a sigh , and for a bit forgot her surroundings . Then she rallied , and with the spirit of an explorer , peered curiously into all the delightful nooks and corners which presented ; not observing that the road grew steadily more steep and rough , nor that Pepita 's feet slipped and stumbled , warningly , among the loose stones , which were so hidden by fallen leaves that Amy could not see them . Along the sides , seasoning at convenient intervals , were rows of felled timber , gay with a summer 's growth of woodbine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amy was an artist 's daughter . At every turn her trained eye saw wonderful " bits " of pictures , and she exclaimed to Pepita :  --  " If father were only here ! See that great rock with its gray-green lichens and its trailing crimson tendrils ! Just that on a tiny canvas , say six by eight or , even , eight by twelve , how it would brighten mother 's room ! " The " Californian " kicked the leaves impatiently . She had no eye for " bits " of anything less material than sugar , and she had long since finished her one lump ; she was tired of travelling in the wrong direction , with her head much lower than her heels , and she suddenly stopped . It was quite time . Another step forward would have sent them tobogganing into a brawling stream . With a shiver of fear Amy realized this . " O-oh ! Oh ! You knew best , after all ! You would n't come till I made you ; and now  --  how shall we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burro had already pricked up her ears . There was a shout from somewhere . Amy managed to slide off and fling herself flat against the slope . When she tried to climb back to a less dangerous spot the twigs she clutched broke in her hands and the rocks cut her flesh . The adventure which had been fascinating was fast becoming frightful . " Hil-loa ! Hil-l-loa ! " Clinging desperately to the undergrowth , she managed to move her head and look down . Far below in the ravine somebody was waving a white cloth . " Hilloa , up there ! " She was too terrified to speak ; yet , after the salute had reached her several times , she dared to loose one hand and wave a returning signal . " You  --  just  --  hold on ! I 'll come  --  and get  --  you ! " As " holding on " was all that either Amy or Pepita could do just then , they obeyed , perforce ; although , presently , the burro had scrambled to a narrow ledge , whence she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to herself , she would doubtless have found a way into the valley . They clung and waited for so long that the girl grew confused ; then tried to rally her own courage by addressing the " Californian . " " It 's so  --  so absurd  --  I mean , awful ! If that man does n't come soon , I shall surely fall . My fingers ache so , and I 'm slipping . I  --  am  --  slipping ! Ah ! " Fortunately , her rescuer was near . He had worked his way upward on all fours , his bare feet clinging securely where shoe-soles would have been useless . He approached without noise , save of breaking twigs , until he was close beside them , when Pepita concluded it was time to bid him welcome . " Br-r-r-ray ! A-humph ! A-humph  --  umph  --  mph  --  ph  --  h ! " The climber halted suddenly . " Sho-o ! " Also startled , Amy lost her hold and shot downward straight into the arms of the stranger , who seized her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up to ? Ca n't you wait a minute ? " Then , with a strong grasp of her clothing , he wriggled himself sidewise along the bank to a spot where the rock gave place to earth and shrubs . " Now catch your breath and let her go ! " The girl might have screamed , but she had no time . Instantly , she was again sliding downward , with an ever-increasing momentum , toward apparent destruction , yet landing finally upon a safe and mossy place ; past which , for a brief space , the otherwhere rough stream flowed placidly . She caught the hum of happy insects and the moist sweet odor of growing ferns , then heard another rush and tumble . But she was as yet too dazed to look up or realize fresh peril , before Pepita and the other stood beside her . " Sho ! That beats  --  huckleberries ! " Amy struggled to her feet . She had never heard a voice like that , which began a sentence with mighty volume and ended it in a whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh fear . " He looks as queer as his voice , " she thought . She was right . His physique was as grotesque as his attire ; which consisted of a white oilskin blouse , gayly bordered with the national colors , trousers of the most aggressive blue , and a helmet-shaped hat , adorned by a miniature battle-axe , while a tiny broom was strapped upon his shoulders . " Huh ! pretty , ai n't I ? The boys gave ' em to me . " " Did  --  they ? " " Yes . You need n't be scared . I sha n't hurt you . I 'm a Rep-Dem-Prob . " " Ah , indeed ? " " Yes . I march with the whole kerboodle . I tell you , it 's fun . " It was " Presidential year , " and Amy began to understand , not only that the lad before her was a " natural , " but , presumably , that he had been made the victim of village wit . She had heard of the " marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her rescuer was made up by fragments from rival political uniforms . " Yes . I 'm out every night . Hurrah for Clevey-Harris ! " " You must get very tired . " " No . It 's fun . I drag the gun carriage . That 's on account o ' my strength . Look a ' there for an arm ! " And he thrust out his illy proportioned limb with a pitiable pride . " I see . But now that you 've helped me down the bank , will you as kindly show me the way home ? " " Never slid that way before , did you ? Only thing , though . I 'll show you all right if you 'll let me ride your donkey . Funny , ai n't she ? Make her talk . " " I think she 's very pretty ; and you may ride her , certainly , if she will let you . " A puzzled and angry expression came over the youth 's face as he looked toward the burro , who had already begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ardsley . " Make her talk , I say . " " She 'll do that only to please herself . She 's rather self-willed , and besides  --  " " Who do you march with ? " " March ? March ! I ? " " Yes . " " Why , nobody . Of course not . Why should you think it ? " The lad scrutinized her dress and gazed abstractedly upon the white " Californian . " Just then , a " parade " was the dominant idea in the poor fellow 's limited intelligence . Amy 's simple white flannel frock , with its scarlet sash , and the scarlet cap upon her dark curls , suggested only another " uniform . " The girls with whose appearance he was familiar were not so attired . Neither did they ride upon white donkeys . Yet a donkey of venerable and unhappy appearance did nightly help to swell the ranks of the country 's patriots , and the beast which he knew enjoyed a sort of honor : it drew an illuminated " float " wherein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask that ? " again demanded Amy , now laughing ; for she had just imagined what her mother 's face would express , should her daughter become a part of a " parade . " " Oh ! because . " Pepita now took share in the conversation . " Br-r-rr-a-y ! Ah-huh-um-umph ! Ah-umph  --  u-m-ph  --  ah-umph  --  umph  --  mph  --  ph  --  h-h-h ! " she observed . Never was a remark more felicitous . The lad threw himself down on the grass , laughing boisterously . Amy joined , in natural reaction from her former fear , and even the " Californian " helped on the fun by observing them with an absurdly injured expression . " She is funny , I admit ; though she is as nothing compared to her brother Balaam . If you like that kind of music , you should hear their duet about breakfast time . Which is the shortest way to some real road ? " " Come on . I 'll show you . " " Thank you ; and , you are so tall , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just there ? They are so very , very lovely I 'd like to take them home to put in father 's studio . " " What 's that ? Where 's it at ? Who are you , anyhow ? " " Amy Kaye . " " I 'm ' Bony , '  --  Bonaparte Lafayette Jimpson . Who 's he ? " " My father is Cuthbert Kaye , the artist . Maybe you know him . He is always discovering original people . " The speech was out before she realized that it was not especially flattering . Her father liked novel models , and she had imagined how her new acquaintance would look as a " study . " Then she reflected that the lad was not as pleasing as he was " original . " " No . I do n't know him . He do n't live in the village , I ' low ? " " Of course not . We live at Fairacres . It has been our home , our family 's home , for two hundred years . " " Sho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need n't get mad , if it has . I ai n't made you mad , have I ? I 'd like to ride that critter . I 'd like to , first rate . " Amy flushed , ashamed of her indignation against such an unfortunate object , and replied :  --  " I 'd like to have you ' first rate , ' too , if Pepita is willing . You get on her back and show me which way to go , and I 'll try to make her behave well . I have some sugar left . That turning ? All right . See , Pepita , pretty Pepita ! Smell what 's in my fingers , amiable . Then follow me , and we 'll see what  --  we shall see . " " Bony " was much impressed by Amy 's stratagem of walking ahead of the burro with the lump of sugar held temptingly just beyond reach . For the girl knew that the " Californian " would pursue the enticing titbit to the sweetest end . Yet this end seemed long in coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the water 's edge , through bogs and upon rocks , over rough and smooth , with the bluff rising steeply on their right and the stream preventing their crossing to the farm lands on its left . But at length they emerged upon a wider level and a view that was worth walking far to see . Here the lad dismounted . He was so much too large for the beast he bestrode that he had been obliged to hold his feet up awkwardly , while riding . Besides , deep in his clouded heart there had arisen a desire to please this girl who so pleased him . " Hmm . If you like leaves , there 's some that 's pretty , " he said , pointing upward toward a brilliant branch , hanging far out above the stream . " Yes , those are exquisite , but quite out of reach . We can get on faster now ; and tell me , please , what are all those buildings yonder ? How picturesque they look , clustered amid the trees on the river 's bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancied that a squirrel could not have climbed more swiftly ; for , glancing up , she discovered the witless youth already upon the projecting branch , moving toward its slender tips , which swayed beneath his weight , threatening instant breakage . Below him roared the rapids , hurrying to dash over the great dam not many yards away . " Oh ! how dare you ? Come back  --  at once ! " " Scare you , do I ? Sho ! This is nothing . You just ought to see what I can do . Catch ' em . There you are . That 's prettier than any . Hello ! Yonder 's a yellow-robin 's nest . Wait . I 'll get it for you ! " Amy shut her eyes that she might not see ; though she could not but hear the snapping of boughs , the yell , and the heavy splash which followed . CHAPTER II . THE MILL IN THE GLEN . " Hi ! ducked myself that time , sure ! " Amy ventured to open her eyes . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given her , stood her strange new acquaintance . His hand still clutched the scarlet branch with its swinging nest that he had risked his safety to secure , nor would relinquish for so trivial a matter as a fall into the water . " You  --  you might have been drowned ! " " But I was n't . " " I should have felt that it was all my fault ! " she exclaimed , now that her fear was past , growing angry at his hardihood . He stared at her in genuine surprise ; all the gayety of his expression giving place to disappointment . " Do n't you like it ? They always build far out . " " Oh , yes . It 's beautiful , and I thank you , of course . But I want to get home . You must show me the way . " " Make the donkey carry ' em . " " Very well . " So they piled the branches upon the back of the dumbly protesting " Californian , " Amy retaining the delicate nest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like ' em , does she ? " " Not at all . Idle Pepita likes nothing that is labor . But I love her , even though she 's lazy . " " What 'll you take for her ? " " Why  --  nothing . " " Wo n't swop ? " " No , indeed . " " Why not ? " " Oh ! dozens of ' whys . ' The idea of my selling Pepita ! For one thing , she was a gift . " " Who from ? " " My uncle Frederic . " " When ? Where ? What for ? " " Oh ! what a question asker . Come , Pepit ! Tcht ! " Shaking her body viciously , but unable to rid herself of her brilliant burden , the burro started swiftly along the footpath running toward the distant buildings , and over the little bridge that crossed just there . Both path and bridge were worn smooth by the feet of the operatives from the mills , which interested Amy more and more , the nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare outing among the hills where her home lay , she had caught glimpses of their roofs and chimneys , and she remembered to have asked some questions about them ; but her father had answered her so indifferently , even shortly , that she had learned little . Seen from this point they impressed her by contrast to all she had ever known . There was a whirl and stir of life about them that excited and thrilled her . Through the almost numberless windows , wide open to the air , she could see hundreds of busy people moving to and fro , in a sort of a rhythmic measure with the pulsating engines . As yet she did not know what these engines were . She heard the mighty beat and rumble , regular , unchanging , like a gigantic heart of which this many-storied structure was the enclosing body ; and she slowly advanced , fascinated , and quite heedless of some staring eyes which regarded her curiously from those wide windows . A discontented bray and the touch of a hand upon her shoulder suddenly recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a steep stairway , and was face to face with another stranger . " Beg pardon , but can I be of service to you ? " " Oh ! sir . Thank you . I  --  I do n't know just where I am . " " In the yard of the Crawford carpet mill . " " Is that the wonderful building yonder ? " " Yes . Have you never seen it before ? " " Not at near hand . I am here by accident . I was lost on the river bank , a long distance back , and a strange lad helped me so far . I do n't see him now , and I 'm rather frightened about him , for he fell into the water , getting me this nest . He does n't act just like other people , I think . " " No . Poor ' Bony ' ! He has run up into the street above us , yet even he knew better than to have brought you just here , " and he glanced significantly toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wrong ? I 'm very sorry . I 'll go away at once , when I 'm shown how . " Gazing about , her perplexity became almost distress ; for she found herself shut in a little space by buildings of varying heights . Behind her lay the difficult route over which she had come , and on the east uprose a steep bank or bluff . Against this was placed a nearly perpendicular sort of ladder , and this steep stair was the only visible outlet from the ravine . The gentleman smiled at her dismay . " Oh , that is n't as bad as it looks . I fancy you could easily climb it , as do our own mill girls ; but this pretty beast of yours , with the fanciful burden , how about him ? " " I do n't know . She might . She 's right nimble-footed  --  when she chooses to be . " " So ' he ' is a young lady , too ? Well , I have great faith in girls , even girl donkeys , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly be a way out ; if not up the bank , then through the mill . By the by , if you 've never visited such a place , and have come to it ' by accident , ' would n't you like to go through it now ? I 'm the superintendent , William Metcalf , and am just about to make my rounds , before we shut down for the night . I 'd be pleased to show you about , though we must first find a safe place where we can tie your donkey . She looks very intelligent . " " Oh , indeed , sir , she is ! She 's the dearest burro . She and her brother Balaam were sent to my brother and me from California . Her name is Pepita , and I am Amy Kaye . I live at Fairacres . " At this announcement the gentleman looked as if he were about to whistle , though courtesy prevented . He bowed gravely :  --  " I 'm very glad to know you . If you 'll excuse me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie the burro . " He soon returned , bringing a leather strap . " We 'll fasten her to the stair , but it will be better to put these branches on the ground . Having them on her back frets her . " " Thank you . You 're very kind . " Pepita did not endorse this opinion . In the matter of tying she gave them all the trouble she could , and allowed them to depart only after a most indignant bray . Her racket brought various heads to the windows , and the visitors were as much of interest to the artisans as themselves were to Amy . She followed her guide eagerly , too self-unconscious to be abashed by any stare ; and though he had shown many strangers " over the works , " he felt that explaining things to this bright-eyed girl would be a pleasanter task than ordinary . " I like to begin all things at the foundation , " he remarked , with a smile , " so we 'll go to the fire-room first . " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge spanning the race , which deep , dark watercourse immediately caught Amy 's attention . " How smooth and swift it looks ; and so black . Is n't that man afraid to stand there ? " indicating a workman stationed upon the sluice gate , engaged in the endless task of raking fallen leaves away from the rack . " Oh , no ! not afraid ! The work is monotonous , but it must be done , or there 'll be the mischief to pay . Now , here are the fires . " A soot-grimed man approached the door of the furnace room , and respectfully touched his forehead to his superior , then glanced toward Amy . " I 'm afeared the little lady will soil her pretty frock , " he remarked , with another pull at his forelock . " Thank you for thinking of it . I 'll try to be careful , " she answered , tiptoeing across the earthen floor , to stoop and peer into the roaring furnaces . " I should be afraid it would burn the whole place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " " Yes ; they 're doing prime to-day . We takes care of the danger , miss . But hot ? Well , you should ought to be here about midsummer , say . Ah ! this is n't bad , is Sure ; it 's a good one . Steady , an ' wages regular . Good day , miss , you 're welcome , I 'm sure , " he concluded , as she thanked him again for opening the furnace doors and explaining how it was he managed the great fires . " Now , the engine room ; to see the object of all that heat , " said Mr. Metcalf . " If only Hallam were here ! " exclaimed Amy . " Is he your brother ? " " Yes . Oh ! it all seems just like fairyland ; even better , for this is useful , while fairyland is merely pleasant . " " Then you deem useful things of more account than pleasant ones ? Hmm ; most young ladies who have visited us have seemed afraid rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It frightens me , too , and yet  --  I like it . The power of it all awes me . " " Well , your enthusiasm is certainly agreeable . " Nor was he the only one who found it so . Even the usually silent workmen in the fireproof storehouse , where the bales of wool were piled to the ceiling with little aisles of passage between , were moved to explanation by the alert , inquiring glances of this dainty visitor . So she quickly learned the difference between Turkish and Scottish fleeces , and remarked to her guide on the oddity of the sorted ones , " that look just like whole sheepskins , legs and tail and all , with the skins left out . " In the scouring room she saw the wool washing and passing forward through the long tanks of alkaline baths ; and in the " willying " house her lungs were filled by the dust that the great machines cleaned from the freshly dried fleeces . Indeed , she would have lingered long before the big chute , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four stories and the apartment where began its real manufacture into yarn . Mr. Metcalf took her next to this top floor ; and though the deafening noise of the machinery made her own voice sound queerly in her ears , she managed to ask so many questions , that before she again reached the ground floor and passed outward to the impatient Pepita , she had gained a clear general idea how some sorts of carpets are made . " And now , Miss Amy , that our little tour is over , I 'd like to hear what , of all you 've seen , has most impressed you , " said Mr. Metcalf , kindly . " The girls . " " The  --  girls ? In the spinning room ? " " Everywhere ; all of them . They are so clean , so jolly , and  --  think ! They are actually earning money . " " Of course ; else they would n't be here . Does it strike you oddly that a girl should earn her own living ? " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a fleeting glimpse of them . There 's a deal of reality in their lives , poor things . " " Why ! Are you sorry for them ? " " No ,  --  and yes . They have n't much leisure , and I dare say that you are an object of envy to every mill girl who has seen you to-day . " " Oh ! I hope not . I liked them so . It seems so fine to really earn some of the money which everybody needs so much , just by standing before one of those ' jennies ' and doing what little they did . They laughed often , as if they were glad . Nobody looked sorrowful , so I do n't see why you pity them . " " It may be misplaced , for , after all , they are happy in their way . I do not think it is always the best way ; still  --  Why , here 's ' Bony . ' Well , young man , what mischief 's up now ? Do you march again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " Best wait till you 're invited , " suggested the superintendent . The lad said nothing , but kept on tying into a compact bundle all the branches heaped upon the ground , and to which he had made a considerable addition during Amy 's inspection of the mill . He had begged a bit of rope from the office in the street above ; and when he had secured the boughs to his satisfaction , he slung them across his shoulder . " Come on . I 'll pack ' em for you to where you live . " He seemed none the worse for his fall into the water , and Amy laughed ; not only at the readiness with which he constituted himself her assistant , but also at Pepita 's frantic efforts to ascend the steep stairway . " Thank you . But if we can get her up there , above , she can carry the stuff herself . I can walk , when I am told the road . " " Up she goes she ! " shouted the startling Lafayette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stick he held . Astonished , Pepita leaped to escape the attack and landed her forefeet upon the fourth stair . " Hi ! There you be ! You 're a regular Rep-Dem-Prob ! Up you go  --  I tell you ! " " Oh ! you dreadful boy ! " exclaimed Amy , and tried to take the stick from the fellow 's hand . " Do n't . He is n't hurting her , and she is going up ! " laughed the superintendent , as the burro made another skyward spring . But his merriment suddenly ceased . The " Californian " could use her nimble feet for more than one purpose . She resented the indignity of her present position in the only manner possible to her , and when a third prod touched her dainty flesh , she flung one heel backward , with an airy readiness that might have been funny save for its result . CHAPTER III . FAIRACRES . " How dreadful ! Is he killed ? " cried Amy , pale with fear . For the indignant Pepita had planted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tormenting her , and had knocked him backward from the stair . During a brief time he lay , dazed by the blow , with a trickle of blood rapidly staining his features . " Wait . Do n't get frightened . There may not be much damage done . That boy has as many lives as a cat . I 'll see to him , " returned Mr. Metcalf , quietly . With a strong , kindly touch , the gentleman helped the unfortunate " Bony " to his feet ; whereupon , the lad flew into a fearful rage and started up the ladder , in pursuit of the burro . His movement roused Amy also to action , and she followed him so swiftly that she reached the top , and the broad road there , almost as soon as he . Before then , however , he had caught up a barrel stave , which happened to be lying in a too convenient spot , and was belaboring Pepita with all his might . The latter , after her ascent of the steps , had remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own demure manner and evidently considering that she had quite properly adjusted matters . Amy succeeded in reaching them just as the third blow was descending upon Pepita 's flank and by a deft movement arrested the stroke . The stave flew out of the lad 's grasp , and his astonishment at her strength cooled his anger . " Do n't you strike her again ! You shall not . Are n't you ashamed of yourself to beat a helpless creature like that ? If you are still able to act so  --  so brutally  --  you ca n't be much hurt . I was terribly frightened and sorry , but now I do n't care . She served you just right . " Then the red Tam dropped on the burro 's neck and a torrent of affectionate words was poured into the creature 's indifferent ears . " Sho ! Huckleberries ! She 's drove my teeth clean down my throat ! " slowly ejaculated the youth . This was about half true . One tooth had been broken out by the blow upon the lad 's jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these wounds gave him a startling appearance , and when Amy looked up a shudder of repellent pity ran through her . Then she seemed to see her mother 's gentle face and , conquering the aversion she felt , she pulled out her handkerchief and began to wipe the discolored , ill-shapen lips of the half-wit . He submitted to the operation in amazed silence . Even Mr. Metcalf had nothing to say , though he watched with keen interest the outcome of this little transaction . " There . If I had some water , I could do it nicely . I 'm sorry you were hurt . But do n't you ever strike my Pepita again ! Next time she might kill you . It was her only way of defending herself , for she has n't sense like you  --  " Regarding the imbecile face before her , Amy 's sentence ended in confusion . Nor did it add to her comfort that the unhappy fellow now began to weep in a whimpering sort of way , that might have suited a spoiled child of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suffer so terribly ! Oh ! I am so sorry ! " " There , my dear Miss Amy , let it pass . This is only one of ' Bony 's ' charming habits , " said Mr. Metcalf , smiling derisively . " He has rather outgrown his age . Have n't you , lad ? Well , it 's all right . I 'm sorry for you . You 're sorry for yourself ; and our young lady here is sorry for us both . Come . Brace up . Be a man . What would the ' boys ' think of you , in this uniform , crying ? Eh ! " " Huh  --  huh  --  huh  --  huh-h-h ! " responded the natural . " I 'm going home , Bonaparte . Good night . Thank you for the leaves . Mr. Metcalf , will you tell me the nearest way , please ? " Amy picked up the fallen bundle of boughs , which the superintendent had brought with him from the yard below , and laid them upon Pepita 's back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still too beautiful to lose . " The gentleman directed her , courteously escorted her through the gateway , which bore another of those prohibitory " No Admittance " signs , and watched her walk briskly away , thinking what a bright feature of the landscape she made . " Not a beautiful girl , by any means , yet one of the most wholesome , honest , and engaging ones who ever stepped foot within this old mill . Odd , too ! A Kaye . I wonder if she will ever come again to what , if all had gone as was expected , might easily have been her own great property . Well , that was pretty to see : the way in which she wiped the face of poor ' Bony . ' The lad grows sillier every day , it seems , and the ' boys ' are making him worse by their nonsense . Where is he now ? I 'll have a talk with him and try to keep him out of the parades . They are not good for him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponed ; for there was " Bony " already far along the road toward Fairacres , following doggedly in Amy 's footsteps , though she repeatedly assured him that she could manage quite well without him and preferred to be alone . " No , I 'm going , " he asserted ; and when she could not dissuade him , she gave up trying to do so and led him to talk of himself  --  his most interesting subject . So that , by the time they had come to the front of the old mansion , she knew his simple history completely , and her pity had almost outgrown her aversion . " See , Cleena ! Cleena Keegan ! See what I have brought ! " The shout summoned a large woman to the door , who threw up her arms with the answering cry :  --  " Faith , an ' I thought you was lost ! Whatever has kept you such gait , Miss Amy ? " " Oh ! adventures . Truly , Cleena . Real , regular adventures . See my leaves ? See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Bonaparte Jimpson . " " An ' a curious spalpeen that same , " casting a suspicious glance over the youth 's strange attire . " I 'm Bonaparte Lafayette Jimpson , " he explained gravely and , to Amy 's surprise , timidly . " The mischief , you be ! An ' what 's Napoleon Bonyparty 's gineral 's pleasure at Fairacres , the night ? " " Cleena , wait . I 'll tell you . Yes , you will have time enough . The train is n't due till after six , and they 'll be a half-hour longer getting home from the station . Sit you down , Goodsoul , just for one little bit of minute . The scrubbing must surely be done by now . Is n't it ? " " Humph ! The scrubbin 's never done in this dirty world . Well , an ' what is it ? Be quick with you ! " Amy coaxed the old servant down upon the doorstep of the freshly cleaned kitchen , whither they had now gone , and speedily narrated her afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scrubbub , that he must have a fine feast of the best there is in the house . Besides , " and she pulled the other 's ear down to her lips , " I 'd just like to have father see him . He is n't pretty , of course , but he 's new . I wonder , could he pose ? " " Pose , is it ? " groaned Cleena , with a comical grimace . " Pose ! Sure , it 's I minds the time when the master caught me diggin ' petaties an ' kept me standin ' , with me foot on me spade , an ' me spade in the ground , an ' me body this shape , " bending forward , " till I got such a crick in me back I could n't walk upright , for better ' n a week . Posin ' , indeed ! Well , he might . He looks fit for naught else . " " Pooh , Cleena ! you know it 's an honor . But , come now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Will you help me ? " " Will I what  --  such truck ! No , me colleen , not a help helps Cleena the day . " " Oh , yes , you will . I 'll bring the step ladder and hand them to you , while you put them over the doors and windows . We 'll make the place a perfect bower of cheerfulness , and if our dears , when they come  --  Oh , Cleena ! they may need the cheerfulness very much . " However , it was not Amy 's habit to borrow trouble , and she ran lightly away , calling to the boy on the porch :  --  " I 'm going to put Pepita in the stable . If you 'd like to see her brother , you can come with me . " " Sho ! Ai n't he black ! " exclaimed " Bony , " as they led Pepita into the great stables and he discovered Balaam . Amid ample accommodations for a dozen horses , the two burros seemed almost lost ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were still most roomy and comfortable . " Why , huckleberries ! It 's bigger ' n the mill sheds . And only them two . Will he swop ? " As he asked this question the lad pulled from his pocket a miscellaneous collection of objects , and invitingly displayed them upon the palm of his long hand . " No , I think not . I fancy we are not a ' swopping ' family . But I must choose some name for you besides that dreadful ' Bony . ' Bonaparte is too long . So is Lafayette . Let me see . Suppose we make it just ' Fayette ' ? That is short and pleasant to speak , and I like my friends to have nice names . Would you like it ? " " Bully ! " " Why  --  why , Fayette ! That does n't sound well . " " Sho ! Do n't it ? One all black an ' t' other all white . Hum . " " Br-r-r-ray ! Ah-umph  --  h-umph  --  umph  --  mph  --  ph  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , so noisily and uproariously that the burros brayed again ; and they kept up this amusing concert until Amy had brought each an armful of hay , and had directed her companion where to find a pail and water for their drink . Then they returned to the house and beheld Cleena in the dining room , already mounted upon the step-ladder , trying to arrange the branches with more regard to the saving of time than to grace . But she made to the picture-seeing girl a very attractive " bit . " Indeed , Cleena Keegan was a person of sufficient importance to warrant a paragraph quite to herself . She was a woman of middle age , with a wealth of curling , iron-gray hair , which she tucked away under a plain white cap . Her figure was large and grandly developed . She wore a blue print gown , carefully pinned back about her hips , thus disclosing her scarlet flannel petticoat ; both garments faded by time and frequent washings to a most " artistic " hue . Upon her shoulders was folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as she stood , poised among the glowing branches , with the dying sunset light touching her honest face to unusual brightness , she was well worth Amy 's eager wish :  --  " Oh , Cleena ! That father were only here to see and paint you just as you are this minute ! " " Humph ! It 's meself 's glad he is n't . " " Why ! That 's not nice of you , Goodsoul . Yet it 's a great pity that a body who is such a ' study ' in herself ca n't fix those branches a bit more gracefully . You 're jamming the leaves all into a little mess and showing the stems ! Oh , Cleena , I wonder if I ca n't reach them . " " Truth , it 's meself 's willin ' you should try . Belike I 'd be handier at the pullin ' them down nor the puttin ' them up . " With head erect she descended from the ladder , and stood , arms akimbo , regarding the results of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic , " and at Fairacres anything inartistic was duly frowned upon . " Faith , it 's not the way the master would do it , I see that , but  --  " Before either she could finish her sentence or Amy mount the ladder , Fayette had run to its top and stood there rapidly pulling from the wall the branches Cleena had arranged . Thrusting all but one between his knees , he fastened that over the window-frame so deftly and charmingly that Amy clapped her hands in delight . " Oh , that 's lovely ! Try another  --  and another ! " He obeyed . His vacant face flushed with a glow of enthusiasm equalling , if not exceeding her own , and even Cleena spent some moments of her rarely wasted time in watching him . Her own face had again become a " study , " yet of a sort to provoke a smile , as her gaze roved from his handiwork , over the length of his ungainly person , to rest upon his bare and not too cleanly feet ; then travelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rightful position in the social scale . Her thought might have been thus expressed :  --  " His foot 's heathen . His head 's the same . His clothes  --  they 're the heathenest of all . I 'd disdain ' em . But , arrah musha ! The hand of him ! The master himself could n't better them fixin 's . " Then she hastened to her kitchen , and soon the appetizing odor of a well-cooked meal was in their nostrils , and the two young decorators realized that they were very hungry . " There , that will do . It is perfect . Thank you ever and ever so much , Fayette . " " Shucks ! " " Now I 'll light the candles . I always do when the people are coming home from town . They go there quite often ; at least father does , though mother has n't been before in months . The candles are terrible extravagance , Cleena says , but they 're so pretty . " Fayette carried away the step-ladder , then returned to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daintily spread table . She had bordered the white cloth with some of the most dazzling-hued leaves , and when the wax tapers threw their soft radiance over the whole charming interior , poor Fayette felt his weak head grow dizzy and confused by the beauty of it all . He dimly realized that he was in a new world , which soothed and appealed to his clouded nature as did the birds and the flowers . That impulse , which he could neither express nor understand , which sent him so constantly into the woods and solitudes , was gratified now . This was as delightful as his favorite pastime of lying upon the grass and gazing upward into the sunlit sky . " Sho ! It 's pretty . I like it . I 'm glad I come . I 'll stay . " Amy had almost forgotten him . " Yes , of course you 'll stay till after supper . I 'll  --  " But a shadow fell across the threshold of the still open door , and looking up she saw a stranger ,  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly from herself to the youth near the big fireplace . There followed an instant of mutual and frowning recognition between these two ; then Fayette disappeared through an inner doorway , while the newcomer remained at the entrance , his hat in his hand , and an assumed suavity in his manner . Yet there was still a note of anger in the tone with which he observed :  --  " I have called upon business with Cuthbert Kaye . Your father , I presume . Is he at home ? " " Not yet . He went to the city , yesterday , with my mother and brother . I expect them back on the next train . Will you come in ? " " Yes , thank you . I 'll wait . " He accepted the great chair Amy rolled toward him , and let his gaze slowly sweep the cheerful apartment . Yet he knew it by heart , already , and his face brightened as he saw how little it had been changed since these many years . Apparently not one of its quaint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time had but added to the remembered charm of the place . Even the chair into which he sank had a familiar feel , as if his back had long ago fitted to those simple , comfortable lines . The antique candelabra  --  how often had he watched his grandmother 's fingers polishing them to brilliancy . But the girl was new . The only modern thing , save the freshly gathered leaves ,  --  which also seemed but a memory of his childhood ,  --  to remind him of the present and the errand upon which he had come . " She 's Kaye , though , to the bone . Dark , crisp hair . Those short curls are like a boy 's . Her eyes are the Kaye eyes ; and that toss of her head , like her great-grandmother come to life again . All our women had it . Ah , well . If things  --  hmm . " The visitor became absorbed in his thoughts , and his wandering gaze came home to rest , seemingly , upon the tips of his own boots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered . " Alanna ! But this is a smart decent piece of work , now , is n't it ? " At this sudden and derisive remark the gentleman looked up . " Oh , ho ! You , is it ? " " Faith an ' it is . An ' likin ' to know what brings you this gait . " " Keep a civil tongue in your head , woman . I 'm not to be put off this time by any false stories . Here I am , and here I shall stay until I see your master . " Steadily and silently confronting one another for some seconds , they measured each other 's wills . The unwelcome guest was not sure but that the woman would lift him bodily and fling him out of doors . She looked ably strong and quite minded so to do ; but , after a further reflection , she appeared to change her mind as well as her tone . " Hmm  --  yes . There 's no irreverence meant . Come in by , to the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books a plenty . Leave the master be , like a gentleman now , as you was born , till he eats his meal in peace . A body can bear trouble better on a full stummick nor an empty . Come by . " To his own amazement , the caller rose and followed her . He told himself he was a simpleton to have left the cheery supper room and the certain presence of the man he wished to see for an hour of solitary waiting in an unknown place . " Library . " There had been none in his grandmother 's time . But he knew it well  --  from the outside . A detached , strong little building , of hewn stone like the mansion ; one of Cuthbert Kaye 's many " follies . " Planned with a studio on the second floor above the spacious book room on the first . Well , it made the property so much the more valuable . Yes , after all , he would better visit it while the coast was clear . " Sure , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his time . Here an ' above . You was never in the paintin ' study , now was you ? " she asked suggestively . " No . " " Alanna ! An ' you two of the same blood ! " " Hmm  --  yes , of course I 'll go , since I 'm here . " So he followed her up the graceful staircase , with its softly covered steps , and into a room which rumor said was worth travelling far to see ; and though thus prepared , its half-revealed beauty astonished him . " Well , it is a fine apartment . It must have cost a power of money . And  --  it explains many things . " " Money , says you ? It did that , " echoed Cleena , with a pious sigh . " Yes , yes . I suppose so . It 's rather dark , however , for me to see as I would like . Is n't there a lamp here ? " " Lamp , is it ? Askin ' pardon for forgettin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master have left in this place . If one comes , indeed , ' t is himself brings it . Forby , on occasion like this , I 'll fetch it an ' take all the blame for that same . It 's below . I 'll step down ; " and she departed hastily , leaving him alone . CHAPTER IV . HALLAM . As the stage from the railway station rolled up to Fairacres , Amy was waiting upon the wide porch . She had put on her daintiest frock , white , of course , since her father liked her to wear no other sort of dress ; and she had twisted sprays of scarlet woodbine through her dark hair and about her shoulders . Before the vehicle stopped , she called out eagerly :  --  " Oh ! how glad I am you 're here ! It 's been such a long two days ! Are you all well ? Is everything right , mother dearest ? Did you have a nice time ? " The father reached her first , remarking , with a fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , with that open doorway behind you , with the firelight and candlelight , and  --  Ah ! did you speak , Salome ? " turning toward his wife . " The man is waiting , Cuthbert . Has thee the money for him ? " Mr. Kaye fumbled in one pocket , tried another , frowned , and appeared distressed . " Never mind , dear . Hallam can attend to it . " But the crippled lad had already swung himself over the steps upon his crutches , and the artist remarked , with a fresh annoyance :  --  " He must put it in the bill , Salome . Why always bother with such trifles ? If one could only get away from the thought and sound of money . Its sordidness is the torment of one 's life . " Mrs. Kaye sighed , as she paid the hackman from her own purse , then followed her husband into the house . His face had already lost all its expression of annoyance , and now beamed with satisfaction as he regarded Amy 's efforts to celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Truly , very beautiful . Why , my darling , you 'll be an artist yourself some day , I believe . " " The saints forbid ! " murmured a voice from the further side the room , where Cleena had appeared , bearing a tray of dishes . Nobody heard the ejaculation , however , save Hallam , and he did n't count , being of one and the same opinion as the old serving-woman . All the lad 's ambitions lay toward a ceaseless activity , and the coloring of canvases attracted him less than even the meanest kind of manual labor . Nor did Amy share in her father 's hope , though she loved art for his sake , and she answered , with conviction :  --  " Never such an one as you are , father dear . " But all this while the daughter 's eyes had been studying her mother 's face , with the keen penetration of sympathy , and the whispered advice :  --  " Be especially gentle with Hallam to-night , my child , " but confirmed the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallam showed no need of consolation as he sturdily stumped across the room and exclaimed , cheerfully enough :  --  " Fetch on the provender , Goodsoul . We 're all as hungry as bears . What 's for us ? " " What should be ? save the best rasher of bacon ever blessed eyesight , with tea-biscuits galore . For second course  --  My ! but that pullet was a tender bird , so she was . An ' them east-lot petaties would fain melt in your mouth , they 're so hot-foot to be ate . " " The pullet ? Not the little brown one you have cared for yourself , Cleena ? " " What for no ? Eat your victuals askin ' no questions , for that 's aye bad for the appetite . " Both Amy and Cleena knew , without words , that this last city trip had been a failure , like so many that had preceded it . Once more had the too sanguine father dragged his crippled son to undergo a fresh examination of his well-formed though useless limbs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time the authority was of the highest . A European specialist , whose name was known and reverenced upon two continents , had come to New York and had been consulted . Interested more than common by the boy 's fair face and the sweet womanliness of the mother , the surgeon had given extra attention to Hallam , and his decision had been as reluctantly reached as it was final . " Only a miracle will ever enable him to walk . Yet a miracle may occur , for we live in an age of them , and nothing seems impossible to science . However , in all mortal probability , he is as one dead below his knees . My lad , take your medicine bravely and be a man in spite of it all . Use your brain , thanking God for it , and let the rest go . " " That 's an easy thing for you to say , but it is I who have to bear it ! " burst forth the unhappy boy , and was at once ashamed of his rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic physician . The return journey had been a sad and silent one , though Hallam had roused at its end with the sort of bravado that Amy had seen , and which deceived her no more than it did any of the others ; but she loyally seconded his assumed cheerfulness , and after they had gathered about the table , gave them a lively description of her afternoon 's outing , ending with :  --  " For , mother dear , you had n't said just where I might or might not ride , and I 'd never seen the carpet mills , though I now hope to go there often ; and , indeed , I think I would like to work in that busy place , among all those bright , active girls . " Then her enthusiasm was promptly dashed by her father 's exclamation :  --  " Amy ! Amy Kaye ! Never again say such a thing ! Let there be no more of that mill talk , not a word . " Mr. Kaye 's tone was more stern than his child had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , more gently :  --  " But I am interested in that silly Bonaparte . I almost wish you had kept him till I came . " Amy happened to glance at Cleena , who had warned her not to mention the fact of the strange gentleman calling ; nor had she known just when Fayette went away , though she supposed he had done so after so suddenly leaving the dining room . " Why , Goodsoul , you are as beaming as if you had found a treasure . " " Faith , an ' I have . Try a bit of the chicken , mistress , now do ; " and she waved the dish toward the lady , with a smile that was more than cheerful . " Well , Cleena , it 's heartening to see anybody so bright . The work must have gone finely to-day , and thee have had plenty of time for scrubbing . No , thank thee ; nothing more . Not even those delicious baked apples . The best apples in the world grow on that old tree by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress , with another half-suppressed sigh . As she rose to leave the table , she turned toward her husband :  --  " I hope thee 'll soon be coming upstairs , Cuthbert . " It was noticeable that Cleena paused , tray in hand , to hear the answer , which was out of common , for the old servant rarely presumed upon the fact that she was also the confidential friend of her employers . " Well , after a little , dear ; but , first , I must go over to the studio . " " Arrah , musha , but , master ! The painting 's all right . What for no ? Indeed , then , it 's the mistress herself needs more attention this minute nor any picture ever was drawed . " " Why , Cleena ! " exclaimed the lady , in surprise . Such an interference had never been offered by the devoted creature to the head of the house . " Asking pardon , I 'm sure ; though I know I know . I 've lighted a fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure for the comfort of both that yous make yourselves easy the night . " " That 's true , husband . Do leave the picture till morning . We 're all tired and needing the rest . " Always easily persuaded where physical comfort was at stake , the artist acquiesced , and with his arm about his wife 's slender waist he gently led her from the room . Cleena heard him murmuring tender apologies that he had not before observed how utterly fatigued she looked ; and a whimsical smile broke on the Irishwoman 's face as she cleared the table and assured the cups and saucers , with a vigorous disdain , that :  --  " Them two 's no more nor a couple of childer still . But , alanna ! Never a doubt I doubt there 'll be trouble with old Cleena when the cat leaps the bag . Well , he 's in it now , tied fast and tight . " Whereupon , there being nobody to see , the good woman executed a sort of jig , and having thus relieved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't for naught Miss Amy fetched a simpleton home in her pocket . Sure , I scared the life clean out of him , so I did , an ' he 'll stay where he 's settled till he 's wanted , so long as I keep fillin ' his stummick with victuals like these . Will I carry a bit o ' the fowl to the lib'ry  --  will I no ? Hmm . Will I  --  nill I ? " Having decided , Cleena passed swiftly from the house into the darkness and in the direction of the distant library . Meanwhile , up in the little chamber which had once been their nursery and was still their own sitting room , Amy had drawn a lounge before the grate , and , after his accustomed fashion , Hallam lay upon it , while his sister curled upon the rug beside him . But she did not look at him . She rested her chin in her palms and gazed at the dancing flames , as she observed :  --  " Even a king might envy us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't it sweet and woodsy ? and so bright . I 've gathered bushels and bushels of them , while you were away , and we can have all the fun we want up here . So now  --  ca n't you just begin and tell , Hal dear ? Part of it I guess , but start as you always do : ' I went from here  --  ' and keep right on till you get back again to me and  --  this . " She purposely made her tone light , but she was not surprised when her answer was a smothered sob . Indeed , there was such a lump in her own throat that she had to swallow twice before she could say :  --  " No , darling , you need n't tell one word . I know it all  --  all  --  all ; and I ca n't bear it . I wo n't  --  I will not have it so ! " Then she turned and buried her face in the pillow beside her brother 's , crying so passionately that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair until she grew ashamed of her weakness and looked up again , trying to smile . " Forgive me , brotherkin . I 'm such a baby , and I meant to be so brave ! If I could only take your lameness on myself , and give you my own strong , active legs ! " " Do n't , Amy ! Besides , how often have you said that very same thing ? Yet it is n't any use . Nothing is of any use . Life is n't , I fancy . " Even the vehement Amy was shocked by this , and her tears stopped , instantly . " Why , Hal ! " " Sounds wicked , does n't it ? Well , I feel wicked . I feel like , was it Job or one of his friends ? that it would be good to ' curse God and die . ' Dying would be so much easier than living . " The girl sprang up , clinching her brown hands , and staring at her brother defiantly . " Hallam Kaye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare ! Suppose God heard you ? Suppose He took you at your word and made you die just now , this instant ? What then ? " Hallam smiled , wanly , " I wo n't scare you by saying what then , girlie . If He did , I suppose it would all be right . Everything is right  --  to the folks who do n't have to suffer the thing . Even the doctor  --  and I liked him as much as I envied him  --  even he preached to me and bade me not to mind , to ' forget . ' Hmm , I wish he could feel , just for one little minute , the helplessness that I must feel always , eternally . " Hallam was dearer to his sister than any other human being , and the despair in her idol 's tone promptly banished her anger against his irreverence . She went down on her knees and caught away the arm with which he had hidden his face , kissing him again and again . " Oh ! there will be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . It would n't be right , that anybody as clever and splendid as you should be left a cripple for life . I wo n't believe it . I wo n't ! " " How like father you are ! " Amy 's head tossed slightly , and a faint protest came into her eyes , but was banished as soon because of its disloyalty . " Am I ? In what way ? and why should n't I be ? " " You never know when you 're down nor why you should n't have all that you want . " " Is n't it a good thing ? Would it help to go moping and unbelieving ? " " I suppose not . Anyway , it makes things easier for you and him , and so , maybe , for the rest of us . " The sister dropped back into her favorite attitude upon the rug and regarded her brother curiously . " Hal , you 're as queer as can be , to-night . Seems as if there was something the matter with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Do n't call the poor man hard names , girlie . He was fine , and I was impertinent enough for the whole family . Only , I reckon he was too high up to feel anything we could say . But there is something . Something I must tell you , and I do n't know how to begin . Promise that you wo n't get into a tantrum , or run and disturb the little mother about it . " " Hallam Kaye ! Do I ever ? " " Hmm ! Sometimes . Do n't you ? Never mind . Sit closer , dear , and let me get hold of your hand . Then you 'll understand why I am so bitter ; why this disappointment about my lameness is so much worse than any that has gone before . And I 've been disappointed often enough , conscience knows . " Amy crept up and snuggled her dark head against Hallam 's fair one , remarking , with emphasis :  --  " Now I 'm all ready . I 'll be as still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What other dreadful trouble has come ? Is it a grocery bill , or Clafflin 's for artists ' stuff ? " " Something far worse than that . " " What ? " " Did you ever think we might have  --  might have  --  oh , Amy ! I ca n't tell you ' gently , ' as mother bade  --  all it is  --  well , we 've got to go away from Fairacres . Its not ours any longer . " " Wh-a-at ? " cried the girl , springing up , or striving to do so , though Hallam 's hold upon her fingers drew her down again . " I do n't wonder you 're amazed . I was , too , at first . Now I simply wonder how we have kept the place so long . " " Why is n't it ours ? Whose is it ? " " It belongs to a cousin of mother 's , Archibald Wingate . Did you ever hear of him ? " " Never . How can it ? " " I hardly understand myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something about indorsing notes and mortgages and things . Big boy as I am , I know no more about business than  --  you do . " " Thanks , truly . But I do know . I attended to the marketing yesterday when the wagon came . Cleena said that I did very well . " " Glad of it . You 'll have a chance to exercise your talents in that line . " " But , Hal , mother will never let anybody take away our home . How could she ? What would father do without his studio that he had built expressly after his own plan ? or we without all this ? " sweeping her arm about to indicate the cosiness of their own room . " Mother ca n't help herself , dear . She was rich once , but she 's desperately poor now . " " I knew there was trouble about money , of course . There never seems to be quite enough , but that 's been so since I can remember . Why should n't we go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mother 's want of the place , anyway ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know him . I hate him unseen . " " So do I. Still , if he 's a cousin , he should be fond of mother , and not bother . " " Amy , we 're all a set of simpletons , I guess , as a family , and in relation to practical matters . " " ' Speak for yourself , John . ' " " That is n't all . There 's something  --  something wrong with father . " " Hallam Kaye ! Now I do believe you 're out of your head . I was afraid you were , you 've talked and acted so queerly . I 'm going for Cleena . Is your face hot ? Do you ache more than usual ? " " Do n't be silly . I 'm as right as I ever shall be . Listen . I found it all out in the city . Father had gone to some exhibition , and mother and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A gentleman called , and I never saw anybody look so frightened and ill as mother did when she received him , though I knew it was n't about me . She had n't hoped for anything better in that line . She called the man ' Friend Howard Corson , ' and he was very courteous to her ; but all of a sudden she cried out :  --  " ' Do n't tell me that the end has come ! I ca n't bear both sorrows in one day ! ' And then she looked across at me . I smiled as bravely as I could , and , Amy , I believe our mother is the very most beautiful woman in this world . " " Why , of course ; and father 's the handsomest man . " " Certainly , " agreed the lad , with rather more haste than conviction . " Well , what next ? " Before the answer could be given , there burst upon their ears an uproarious clamor of angry voices , such as neither had ever heard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Hallam groped blindly for the crutches he had tossed aside . CHAPTER V. A KINSMAN OF THE HOUSE . " It 's from the library ! " reported Amy , who had first reached and opened the window . " I ca n't make out anything except  --  yes , it is ! That 's Fayette 's voice . Hear that croak ? " " The foolish boy ? Here yet ? " " So it seems . I 'll go and find out . " " Wait . That 's Cleena talking now , and another voice , a man 's . What can it all mean ? " Amy ran down the stairs and out of the house so swiftly that she did not observe her father following with almost equal haste . Behind him sped Mrs. Kaye , far more anxious concerning her husband than the noise outside . " Slowly , Cuthbert . Please do take care . Thee must not hurry so , and I hear Cleena . She 'll look out for everything . For my sake , do n't run . " Hallam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment the entire family stood in silent wonder at the scene before them . Two men were wrestling like angry schoolboys ; and the light from a lantern in Cleena 's hand fell over them and showed the distorted face of " Bony " in one of his wildest rages . His contestant was gray haired and stout , and was evidently getting the worst of the struggle . The library door was open , and it seemed as if the half-wit were trying to force the other backward into the building . One glance revealed something of the situation to Mrs. Kaye , and , as the wrestlers paused for breath , she moved forward and laid her hand upon the old man 's arm . " Archibald , what does this mean ? " The low voice acted like magic . Fayette slunk away , ashamed , and the other paused to recover himself . But his anger soon returned and was now directed against the astonished woman herself . " Mean ! mean ? That 's for you to say . Since when has a Kaye stooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rat in a trap ? A pretty greeting and meeting , Cuthbert , after all these years ! " he cried , turning next toward the artist , with indignant contempt . But the object of his wrath scarcely heard what he said . His own eyes were fixed upon the ruined panel of his beautiful library door , and he caught up the lantern and peered anxiously to learn the extent of the disaster . The wife again answered , as if speaking for both :  --  " Archibald , no . Whatever indignity thee has suffered , none of thy kin know anything about it or could be parties to it . Thy own heart must tell thee that ; and now explain what it all means . " At the old familiar speech , the man 's expression altered , and when he replied it was in a far gentler tone . " I came to see Cuthbert ; for the thousandth time , is n't it ? Failing him again , though I did n't mean to fail , I had to talk with  --  thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and that virago brought me here to wait . Then she locked me up and set this idiot to watch . There are no windows to get out of from above , nothing but that skylight , so I finally forced the door at the foot of the stairs , and then again this . Here was that ruffian , armed with a cudgel , and  --  the rest thee knows . " " I am very sorry , cousin . I can but apologize for what I would never have permitted had I known , " and the mistress 's gaze rested upon Cleena most reproachfully . Yet that bold-spirited creature was in no wise disturbed , and replied , with great enjoyment :  --  " Sure , mistress , I did but do what I 'd do again , come same chance . What for no ? If it was n't for him , yon , there 'd be peace an ' plenty at Fairacres the now . Faith , I harmed him none . " " Cleena ! " " Askin ' pardon if I overstepped me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm surmisin ' you an ' me better be fixin ' things up whiles the family goes home to their beds . " Just then Mr. Kaye 's silent examination of the injury done his beloved studio came to an end . He set down the lighted lantern with the ultra caution of one who dreads fire above all accidents , and turned toward his wife . However , he took but few steps forward before he paused , staggered , and would have fallen had not the ill-treated visitor sprung to his aid ,  --  to be himself pushed aside , while Cleena caught up her master and strode off toward the house , as if she were but carrying an overgrown child in her strong arms . Indeed , the artist 's weight was painfully light , nor was this the first time that Cleena 's strength had thus served his need ; though this fact not even Hallam nor Amy knew . The wife hurried after her fainting husband , and Amy started also ; then reflected that it was she who had brought Fayette to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had since happened there . But the lad gave her time for neither reproof nor question , as he eagerly exclaimed :  --  " ' Twa' n't none o ' my doin 's . She made me . She told me to set here an ' keep Mr. Wingate in , an ' if he broke out I was n't to let him . I do n't know what for . I did n't ask questions . ' Twa' n't none o ' my business , anyway . So I was just trying to jab him back . She fed me first rate . Say , is that your brother ? " " Yes . Oh , Hal ! what shall we do ? " " You run to the house and see if mother wants anybody to go for the doctor , while I try to help this boy stop up the doorway . It 's going to rain , and it would break father 's heart if anything here were harmed . " A curious smile crossed the stranger 's face , but he advanced to lend his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the parts of the door so far into place that they would prevent any damage by rain , except in case of severe storm . The broken lock was , of course , useless , and as the mill lad saw the cripple fingering it , he remarked :  --  " You need n't be scared . I 'll stay an ' watch . I wo n't march to-night . Oh , I can do it all right . I often stay with the watchmen round the mill , an ' I 've got a good muscle , if anybody wants to tackle it , " with which he glared invitingly toward the late prisoner . A protesting groan was the only reply ; and the lad received this with a snort of disdain . " Druther let old scores rest , had ye ? All right . Suits me well enough now , but I ai n't forgot the lickin 's you 've given me , an ' I ai n't goin ' to forget , neither . " Fayette 's look was again so vindictive that Hallam interposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I wish you would watch here for a while . As soon as Cleena can be spared , she shall bring you a blanket . And anyway , if you 'll keep everything safe , I 'll try to find something to pay you for your trouble . " " Hmm , I 'd take your donkey an ' give back considerable to boot . " " My donkey ? Balaam ? Well , I guess not . " " I could do it . I could , first rate . I 've got money . It 's in the savings bank . ' Supe ' put it in for me . " " I could n't think of it , not for a second . Mr. Wingate  --  is it ? " " Archibald Wingate , and your kinsman , young sir . " " So I heard my mother say . She would wish you to come to the house with me , and we 'll try to make you comfortable . I must go  --  I am wild to know what is wrong with my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered the other , coldly . " Your father was always weak  --  was never very rugged , and he has n't lived in a way to make himself more robust . A man 's place is in the open ; not penned like a woman behind closed doors and windows . " " Beg pardon , but you are speaking of my father . " " Exactly , and of my cousin . Oh , I 've known him since we sat together under our grandmother 's table , munching gingerbread cakes . Ah , she was a famous cook , else the flavor of a bit of dough would n't last that long . " " I 've heard of my great-grandmother 's talent for cookery . Father and mother often speak of it , and some of her old recipes are in use in our kitchen to-day . " Mr. Wingate had kept an even pace with Hallam 's eager swings upon his crutches , and they were speedily at the old house door , with a kindly feeling toward one another springing into life within the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had exclaimed to Amy , in all sincerity , " I hate him unseen . " With the ready trustfulness of youth , Hallam began to think his mother 's and the lawyer 's words had not meant literally what they expressed . On Mr. Wingate 's side , the sight of Hallam 's physical infirmity had roused regret at the action he must take . Up till this meeting he had lived with but one object in view  --  the possession of Fairacres ; nor did he now waver in his determination . There had simply entered into the matter a sentiment of compassion which was a surprise to himself , and which he banished as completely as he could . Amy met them at the door with the gratifying report :  --  " Father is about all right again . It was a sudden faint . Cleena says that he has had them before , but that mother had not wished us told . There is no need of a doctor , and Cleena is to get the west chamber ready for Mr. Wingate to sleep in . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . " The house mistress came toward them , vial and glass in hand , on her way back to the sick-room . The hall was dimly lighted , and as she turned at the stair 's foot and passed upward , with that soft gliding motion peculiar to herself , she seemed to the entering guest like a sad-faced ghost of a girl he had known . Halfway up she paused upon the landing and smiled down upon them ; and the serenity of that smile made the hard facts of the case  --  illness , poverty , and home-breaking  --  seem even more unreal than anything else could have done . Amy looked into Mr. Wingate 's eyes , which were fixed upon their mother . " Is n't she like the Madonna ? Father has so often painted her as such . " " Yes  --  hmm . He ought to . A Madonna of Way and Means . Say , little girl , you are bright enough , but you act a good deal younger than your years . How happens it you 've never learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother ? Can you do anything useful ? " " That depends . I can arrange father 's palette , and crack his eggs just right , and buy things  --  when there 's money , " she finished naively . " It all seems ' father . ' What about your mother ? What can you do , or have you done , to help her , eh ? " Amy flushed . She thought this sort of cross-questioning very rude and uncalled for . As soon as she had heard this man 's name she had realized that it must be he of whom Hallam had spoken , and whom she , also , had decided she " hated unseen . " But , in truth , hatred was a feeling of which the carefully sheltered girl knew absolutely nothing , though it came very near entering her heart at that instant when the shrewd , penetrating gaze of her kinsman forced her to answer his question . " Why  --  nothing , I 'm afraid . Only to love her . " " Hmm . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the loving , I guess , if you want to keep her with you . She looks as if the wind might blow her away if she got caught out in it . Now , good night . You and your brother can go . I 'll sit here till that saucy Irishwoman gets my room ready . Take care ! If you do n't mind where you 're going , you 'll drop sperm on the rug , tipping that candlestick so ! " Illustration : " TAKE CARE ! YOU 'LL DROP SPERM ON THE RUG , TIPPING THAT CANDLESTICK SO ! " Hallam had been standing , leaning against the newel post , with his own too ready temper flaming within him . But there was one tenet in the Kaye household which had been held to rigidly by all its members : the guest within the house was sacred from any discourteous word or deed . Else the boy felt he should have given his new-found relative what Cleena called " a good pie-shaped piece of his mind . " He had to wait a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent tone of voice , then swung up the staircase in the direction of his mother 's room . Amy was too much astonished to say even thus much . She righted the candlestick , amazed at the interest in rugs which Mr. Wingate displayed , and followed her brother very slowly , like one entering a dark passage wherein she might go astray . She stopped where Hallam had , before their mother 's door , which was so rarely closed against them . Even now , as she heard her children whispering behind the panel , Mrs. Kaye came out and gave them each their accustomed caress ; then bade them get straight to bed , for she would be having a long talk with them in the morning , and she wanted them to be " as bright as daisies , " to understand it . " Mother , that man ! He  --  he 's so dreadful ! He scolded me about the candlestick , and  --  and you  --  and he made me feel like a great baby . " " I wish he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a very confused and troubled Amy who crept into bed a little while afterward , and she meant to lie awake and think everything out straight , but she was too sound and healthy to give up slumber for any such purpose , and in a few minutes she was asleep . CHAPTER VI . SETTLEMENTS . On the following morning the guest was the first person astir at Fairacres , not even excepting Cleena , who rose with the birds ; and when she opened her kitchen door , the sight of him pacing the grass-grown driveway did not tend to put her in good humor . But there was little danger of her breaking bounds again , in the matter of behavior . A short talk had passed between her mistress and herself , before they bade each other good night , that had not left the too devoted servant very proud of her overzeal ; and she now turned to her stove to rattle off her indignation among its lids and grates . But she kept " speakin ' with herself , " after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattering . " Arrah musha ! The impidence of him ! Has n't he decency to wait till all 's over ' fore he struts about that gait ? But , faith , an ' I 'll show him one thing : that 's as good a breakfast as ever he got in the old lady 's time , as one hears so much tell of . " Whereupon , with this praiseworthy ambition , a calm fell upon poor Cleena 's troubled spirit , and when , a couple of hours later , the family assembled in the dining room , everybody was astonished at the feast prepared ; while all but the stranger knew that a week 's rations had been mortgaged to furnish that one meal . However , nobody made any comment , though Mr. Wingate found in this show of luxury another explanation of the Kayes ' financial straits . " Cuthbert will not be down this morning , Archibald . I hope thee rested well . Hallam , will thee take thy father 's place ? " Mrs. Kaye 's manner , as she greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her real feeling toward him , nor had her children ever seen her more composed and gentle , though Hallam noticed that she was paler than ever , and that her eyes were dull , as if she had not slept . " It 's going to be a miserable day outside , " remarked the guest , a little stiffly . " Inside , too , I fancy , " answered Amy . " I hate undecided things . I like either a cheerful downpour or else sunshine . I think wobbly weather is as bad as wobbly folks  --  trying to a body 's temper . " Mr. Wingate laughed , though rather harshly . Amy was already his favorite in that household , and he reflected that under different circumstances than those which brought him to Fairacres , he would have found her very interesting . " The weather should not be allowed to affect one 's spirits , " said Mrs. Kaye . " No , mother ; I suppose not . Yet , it was so pretty here , last night ; and now the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border on the tablecloth is as crooked as can be . It all has such an afterward sort of look . Ah , it is raining , good and fast . " Mrs. Kaye excused herself and went to look out toward the library . The wind was howling in that direction , and she exclaimed , anxiously :  --  " Cleena , go at once and see if it is doing any harm out there ! That broken door and window  --  put something against them , if it is . " " I do n't think there 's any danger of harm . I 've sent for a carpenter more than an hour ago , " observed Mr. Wingate . " Thee ? " For a moment there was a flash in the matron 's eyes , but she did not remark further , though Hallam took up her cause with the words :  --  " I suppose you meant it for kindness , but my father does not allow any one to interfere with that place . Even if it rained in , I think he would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered the guest , dryly , while Cleena deposited a dish of steaming waffles upon the table with such vigor as to set them all bouncing . " Sure , mistress , you 'll be takin ' a few of these , why not . I never turned me finer , an ' that honey 's the last of the lot , three times strained , too , an ' you please . " " Waffles , Cleena ? Did thee take some up to the master ? I am sure he would enjoy them . " " Indeed , I did that . Would I forget ? So eat , to please Cleena , and to be strong for what comes . " Even Mrs. Kaye 's indifference was not proof against the tempting delicacy , and doubtless the food did give her strength the better to go through a trying interview . For immediately breakfast was over , she rose , and , inviting the visitor into the old parlor , bade her children join them . " What our cousin Archibald has to say concerns us all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and she sat down with Amy snuggled beside her , while Hallam stood upon his crutches at her back . Somehow , Mr. Wingate found it a little difficult to begin , and after several attempts he put the plain question abruptly :  --  " When can you leave , Salome ? " She caught her breath , and Amy felt the arm about her waist grow rigid , but she answered by another question :  --  " Must thee really turn us out , Archibald ? " The plain , affectionate " thee " touched him , yet for that reason he settled himself all the more firmly in his decision . " What has to be done would better be done at once . It is a long time , Salome , since I have had any recompense for the use of this  --  my property  --  " " Your property ? " cried Hallam . " Yes , mine . Mine it should have been by lawful inheritance , save for a rank injustice and favoritism . Mine it is now , by right of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to desire that you should at last learn the whole truth , and I assure you that I have advanced more than twice the money required to buy this place , even at an inflated market value . So , lad , do n't get angry or indignant . I make no statements that I can not prove , nor can your parents deny that I notified them to vacate these premises more than two years ago . " " Mother , is that so ? " " Yes , Hallam . " " Why did n't we go , then ? " " Our cousin had a heart and did not force us . " " Why do you now , sir ? " " Because I 'm tired of waiting . The case grows worse each day . I 'm sick of throwing good money after bad , while , all the time , such folly as is yonder goes on , " pointing toward the distant studio . " One man is as good to labor as another . Cuthbert Kaye has had money all his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Archibald ! Beg pardon , but that is not so . " " But it is so , Salome . If you have been hoodwinked and believed false tales , it is time these youngsters learned the facts . They are Kayes , like you and me . It is honest blood , mostly , that runs in all our veins . Well then , the life they are living is not an honest life . No man has a right to more than he can pay for . Can Cuthbert  --  " " Archibald , thee shall leave him out of the question ! " cried the wife , roused from her firm self-control . There was something so appealing in her tone that her children watched her in alarm . " Very well . So be it . Since he is not man enough to stand by you in the trouble he has brought upon you  --  " " If thee continues , we will leave the room . " " Why have n't I been able ever to meet him then ? Why has he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you were a woman I would forever put off the day of judgment , he has for once reckoned without his host . I tell you the end has come . " Mrs. Kaye sank back in her chair , trembling ; but still her lips were closed until the angry guest had finished his speech and had walked off some of his excitement in a hasty pacing of the long room . At length he paused before her and said , more quietly :  --  " There is no need of our having recourse to legal force . You should leave without being put out . That is why I came , to arrange it all to your satisfaction . You are a good woman , Salome , as good as any of your race before you , and just as big a simpleton when your affections are touched . A little more firmness on your part , a little less devotee sort of worship of a  --  " " Archibald , remember thee is speaking of what does not concern thee . There is no need for rudeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had I understood , two years ago , that thee needed  --  needed  --  this old home for thyself , I would have left it then . It has , of course , been to our advantage to occupy it , but it has also been to thine . An empty house goes swift to ruin . Everything here has been well cared for , as things held in trust should be . We will leave here as soon as I can find a house somewhere to shelter us . " Mrs. Kaye rose , as if to terminate the interview ; but Mr. Wingate cleared his throat and lifted his hand as if he had something further to say . " I suppose you have thought about this many times , Salome . What are your plans ? " " They are not definite . House-hunting is the first , I suppose , since we can not do without a roof to cover us . " " How  --  I ca n't forget that we are kinsfolk , Salome  --  how do you propose to live ? I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use common sense . There are few houses to rent in this out-of-the-way town , where everybody , except the mill folks , owns his own home ,  --  and even some of them do . I 've come into possession of a house which might suit you  --  ' Hardscrabble . ' I 'll let you have it cheap . " " ' Hardscrabble ' ! The ' Spite House ' ? " " Yes . " " Oh , Archibald ! " " Exactly . I knew how it would strike you . We both know the story of the place , but our grandfather 's enemy took good care to make his tenement comfortable inside , even if it was ugly as sin outside . " For a while Mrs. Kaye remained silent , debating with herself . Very soon she was able to look up and smile gratefully . " Thee knows as well as I what a stab thee has given my pride , Archibald ; but there is that saving ' common sense ' in the offer , and love is stronger than pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will take the place if I can . " " Ten dollars a month . " The prompt , strictly business-like answer fairly startled its hearer . Then she smiled again . " I have never lived anywhere save at Fairacres , thee knows . I must trust thee in the matter . I have no definite ideas about the values of houses , but I think I can pay that . I must . There is nowhere else to go . Yes , I will take it . " " It 's dirt cheap , Salome . You will never think kindly of me , of course , but I 'm dealing squarely , even generously by you . If ' thee 'd , ' " for the second time he dropped into the speech of his childhood , which his cousin Salome had always retained , and she was quick to observe this , " if thee had trusted me years ago , things might have gone better with us both . When will thee move ? " " To-day . " " To-day ? There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the sooner the better , ' and I agree . Get the lease ready as soon as possible , and I will sign it . I 've only one thing to ask about that : please do n't have the name put as either ' Hardscrabble ' or ' Spite House . ' I 'd like it called ' Charity House . ' " " Upon my word , Salome , you 're the queerest mixture of business and sentiment that I ever met . You 're as fanciful as a girl , still . But the name does n't matter . Call the place ' Faith ' and ' Hope ' as well as ' Charity , ' if you wish , after you get there ; but I wo n't alter the lease which I brought along with me last night . " " Brought already , Archibald ? Thee expected me to go to that place , then ? " " Under the circumstances , Salome , and , as you 've just admitted , I did n't see what else you could do . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I want you should have things all straight . He 'll witness our signatures to the lease , and if you 'll pick out such furniture as you most especially care to have , I 'll try to spare it , though the mortgage covers all . " But the speaker 's glance moved so reluctantly and covetously over the antique plenishing that Mrs. Kaye promptly relieved his anxiety . " It would be a pity to disturb these old , beloved things in their appropriate places  --  " " You 're right , " interrupted the gentleman . " I 've a better notion than that . I 'll leave whatever is in ' Spite House ' for your use , and not break up Fairacres at all . " " Is it still furnished , then ? " " Yes , according to old Ingraham 's ideas  --  for hard use and no nonsense . He had a big family and nothing much but his temper to keep it on . However , if there 's anything actually needed , I suppose I could advance a trifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Salome . " " Thank thee , but I hope not to run further into thy debt , Archibald , save in case of direst need . And do not think but that I fully understand and appreciate all the kindness which has permitted us to stay at Fairacres so long . In some things , as thee will one day discover , thee has mistaken and misjudged us ; but in one thing I have understood and sympathized with thee , always , and with all my heart : the passionate love which a Kaye must feel for his home and all this . " There was pathos and dignity in the quiet gesture which Salome Kaye swept over the apartment that had been her own for all her life ; but there was also courage and determination in her bearing as she walked out of it , leaning lightly upon Amy 's shoulder , and with Hallam limping beside her . Somehow , too , Archibald Wingate did not feel quite as jubilant and successful as he had anticipated , and he welcomed , as an agreeable diversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lawyer Smith , to witness the lease and to give any needful advice in the matter . " Hello , Smith . Quite a rainy day , is n't it ? I 've been studying that row of old pines and spruces . How do you think the avenue 'd look if I was to have ' em trimmed up , say about as high as your head , from the ground ? Give a better view of the old Ardsley Valley , would n't it ? " The lawyer stepped down from his vehicle , backward and cautiously , then turned , screwed up his eyes , and replied deliberately :  --  " Well , it might ; and then again it might n't . It 's taken a good many years for those branches to grow , and once they 're off they ca n't be put back again . If I was in your place , I 'd rather let things slide easy for a spell ; then  --  go as you please . Have you come to a settlement ? Will they quit without lawing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , woman ! You , Cleena , bring me a hatchet , will you ? I 'll just lop off a little limb on one side , and see the effect . Hurry up ! " " Faith , I 'll fetch it ! " responded Cleena , loudly . But when she did so , she advanced with such a menacing gesture upon the new proprietor of her old home that he shrank back , doubtful of her intent . " Ai n't it enough to break hearts , without breakin ' the helpless trees your own forebears planted long by ?  --  Aha , my fine gineral , so you 're bad penny back again ? Well , then , you 're the handle o ' time . By the way you tacked up them boughs , you 'll be clever at packin ' . Come by . I 'll give ye a job . " Thus , partly to Lawyer Smith 's caution and partly to Cleena 's indignation , the fine evergreens of Fairacres owed the fact that they , for the time being , escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF BAREACRE . By nightfall it was all over ; and Cleena , Hallam , and Amy , with their self-constituted bodyguard , Fayette , were gathered about a big table in the kitchen of the " Spite House , " to eat a supper of bread and milk , and to discuss the events of that memorable day . Strangely enough , as Amy thought , none of them realized anything clearly except the facts of fatigue and hunger . " Arrah musha ! but the face of that lawyer body , when I tells him I was takin ' the loan of his bit buggy wagon for the master an ' mistress to ride to Burnside the morn , an ' how as old Adam would sure send it back by a farm-hand , which he did that same . An ' them two goin ' off so quiet , even smilin ' , as if  --  But there , there ! Have some more milk , Master Hal . It 's like cream itself , so ' t is ; an ' that neighbor woman in the cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three pints to the quart if I 'd leave her be . " " Well , dear old Adam will be glad to see them on any terms , he is so fond of father and mother . But knowing they 're in such trouble , he 'll have the best of everything for them to-night . " " Yes , Adam Burns is as likely as any man creature can be , which I 've never been bothered with meself , me guardian angel be praised . " " Well , Cleena , I 've seen you work hard before , but you did as much as ten Cleenas in one to-day . " The good woman sighed , then laughed outright . " It 's been a hard row for that wicked body to hoe . " " Who , Cleena ? " " That sweet , decent kinsman o ' your own . Was many an odd bit o ' stuff went into the van ' t he never meant should go there . The face of him when I went trampin ' up the libr'y stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint trash that he 'd allowed the master might have . ' Take anything you want here , my boy , ' says he . So , seein ' Master Hal was working dainty an ' slow , I just sweeps me arm over the whole business ; an ' I 'm thinkin ' there 'll be ' tubes ' a plenty for all the pictures master 'll ever paint . In a fine heap , though , an ' that must be your job , Master Hal , come to-morrow , to put them all tidy , as ' t is himself likes . " " I 'll be glad to do it , Cleena ; but in which of these old rooms am I to sleep ? " Cleena had taken a rapid survey of the dusty , musty bedchambers , and her cleanly soul revolted against her " childer " using any of them in their present condition . So for Amy she had put Mrs. Kaye 's own mattress on the floor of what might be a parlor , and spread it with clean sheets ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge ; and for herself and Fayette , who insisted upon staying for the night , there were " shakedowns " of old , warm " comforts . " " And it 's time we were all off to Noddle 's Island . It 's up in the mornin ' early we must be . So scatter yourselves , all of ye , an ' to sleep right away . Not forgettin ' your prayers , as good Christians should n't . " " Of course not , " answered Amy , drowsily ; but Fayette looked as if he did not understand . " Sure , you 'll have to be taught then , my fine sir , an ' I 'll tackle that job with the rest of to-morrow 's . " But when daylight broke and roused the active Cleena to begin her formidable task of scrubbing away the accumulated dirt of years there was no Fayette to be found . Dreamily , she recalled the sound of musical instruments , the shouts of voices , and the squealing of the rats that had hitherto been the tenants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if any , was answerable for the lad 's absence , she could not guess . " Well , I was mindin ' to keep him busy , had he stayed ; but since he 's gone , there 's one mouth less to feed . " It did not take the observant woman long to discover that the outlook for the comfort of " her folks " was even less by daylight than it had seemed the night before . Her heart sank , though she lost no time in useless regrets , and she did most cordially thank that " guardian angel " to whom she so constantly referred for having prevented her spending the last twenty-five dollars she possessed . This would long ago have wasted away had it not been placed in the care of that true friend of the family , Adam Burns , with whom her master and mistress had now taken refuge . " Alanna , that 's luck ! I was for usin ' it long syne , but the old man would n't leave me do it . ' No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' thee might be wantin ' it for doctor 's stuff , ' says he . Twenty-five dollars ! That 'd pay the rent an ' buy flour an ' tea , an ' what not ; " and with cheerful visions of the unlimited power of her small capital , the old servant stooped to fill her apron with the stray chips and branches the bare place afforded . At that moment there fell upon her ears the familiar sound of Pepita and Balaam braying in concert for their breakfast . " Now what 's to feed them is more nor I know ; yet never a doubt I doubt it would clean break the colleen 's heart must she part with her neat little beast . " The braying roused Hallam and Amy , also , from a night of dreamless sleep ; and as they passed out from the musty house into the crisp air of a frosty morning , they felt more cheerful than they considered was quite the proper thing , under the circumstances . Then Amy looked at her brother and laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it funny to be here ? Yesterday it seemed as if the world had come to an end , and now it seems as if it had just been made new . " " ' Every morn is a fresh beginning , ' " quoted Hallam , who loved books better than his sister did . " Let 's go down to the gate , or place where a gate should be , and take a good look at our  --  home . " " All right . Though we 've seen it at a distance , I suppose it will appear differently to us at near hand . " " And uglier . Oh , but it 's horrid ! horrid ! " and with a sudden revulsion of feeling Amy buried her face in her hands and began to cry . " I hate it . I wo n't stay here . I will not . I 'd rather go home and live in the old stable than here . " " That would n't have been a bad idea , only we should n't have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 'd want an empty stable ? " " Our cousin Archibald ! " answered Hallam , with scornful emphasis . " I believe he feels as if he had a mortgage on our very souls . Indeed , he said I might sometime be able to earn enough to buy the place back , as well as pay all other debts . He said he could n't live forever , and it was but fair he should have a few years ' possession of ' his own . ' He  --  Well , there 's no use talking . I wish  --  I wish I were  --  " " No , no ! you do n't ! No , you do n't either , Hallam Kaye ! I know what you began to say , and you shall not finish . You shall not die . You shall get well and strong and do all those things he said . I 'm ashamed of myself that I cried . I felt last night as if my old life were all a beautiful dream , and that I had just waked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for myself and for others ; not have others do for me any longer . " " That was about the state of the case , I fancy . " " Well , that is n't so bad . It should n't be , that is ; for I have such health and strength and everything . Nothing matters so much as long as we are all together . " " Nobody knows how long we shall be . I do n't like these ' attacks ' of father 's , Amy . I 'm afraid of them . It will kill him to live here . " It needed but the possibility of giving comfort to somebody to arouse all Amy 's natural hopefulness , and she commanded with a shake of her forefinger :  --  " Hallam Kaye , you stop it ! I wo n't have it ! If you keep it up , I shall have to  --  to cuff you . " " Try it ! " cried the brother , already laughing at her fierce show of spirit ; yet to tempt her audacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head playfully . She did not resent it ; she could resent nothing Hallam ever did save that morbid talk of his . She had been fighting with this spirit ever since she could remember , and their brief " tussle " over , she crept closer to him along the old stone wall and begged :  --  " Cleena has tied the burros out to graze in the weeds , and that will be their breakfast , and while we 're waiting for ours , I wish you 'd tell me all you know about ' Spite House . ' I 've heard it , of course , but it 's all mixed up in my mind , and I do n't see just where that cousin Archibald comes in . " " Oh , he comes in easily enough . He 's a descendant of old Jacob Ingraham as well as of the house of Kaye . I believe it was in this way : our great-grandfather Thomas Kaye and Jacob were brothers-in-law , and there was some trouble about money matters . " " Seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see why it was ever made . " " Well , they had such trouble anyway . Great-grandfather had just built Fairacres , and had spent a great deal to beautify the grounds . He was a pretty rich man , I fancy , and loved to live in a great whirl of society and entertain lots of people and all that . He was especially fond of the view from the front of the house and had cut away some of the trees for ' vistas ' and ' outlooks ' and ' views . ' There were no mills on the Ardsley then . They came in our own grandfather 's time . It was just a beautiful , shimmering river  --  " " Hal , you 're a poet ! " " Never , " said the boy , with a blush . " But you are . You tell things so I can just see them . I can see that shimmering river this instant , in my mind , with my eyes shut . I can see boats full of people sailing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who 's the poet now ? " " I 'm not . But go on . " " It seems that old Mr. Ingraham thought he had been cheated by great-grandfather  --  " " Likely enough he had . Else I do n't see where he got all that money to do things . " " But , missy , he was our relative . He was a Kaye . " " There might be good Kayes and bad Kayes , might n't there ? " " Amy , you 're too honest for comfort . You may think a spade 's a spade , but you need n't always mention it . " " Go on with the story . In a few minutes Cleena will call us to our ' frugal repast , ' like the poor children in stories , and I want to hear all about this ' ruined castle ' I 've come to live in , I mean ' dwell , ' for story-book girls  --  ' maidens '  --  never do anything so commonplace as just ' live . ' Hally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world . " " How did you find that out , Miss Experience ? " " I did n't trouble to find it , I just read it . I thought it sounded sort of nice and old , so I said it . " " Humph ! Well , do you want to hear , or will you keep interrupting ? " " I do want to hear , and I probably shall interrupt . I am not blind to my own besetting sins . " " Listen . Just as great-grandfather had everything fixed to his taste and was enjoying life to the utmost , old Jacob came here to this knoll that faces Fairacres  --  Oh , you need n't turn around to see . The trees have grown again , and the view is hidden . On this knoll , if there was anything tall , it would spoil the Fairacres ' view . So Jacob built this ' Spite House . ' He made it as ugly as he could , and he did everything outrageous to make great-grandfather disgusted . He named this rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called ' Glenpolly , ' because his enemy had named the beautiful ravine we know as ' Glenellen . ' Polly and Ellen were the wives ' names , and I 've heard they grieved greatly over the quarrel . Mr. Ingraham painted huge signs with the names on them , and hung up scarecrows on poles , because he would n't let a tree grow here , even if it could . There are a few now , though . Look like old plum trees . My , what a home for our mother ! " Amy 's face sobered again , as she regarded the ugly stone structure which still looked strong enough to defy all time , but which no lapse of years had done much to beautify . Nothing had ever thrived at Bareacre , which was , in fact , a hill of apparently solid stone , sparsely covered by the poorest of soil . The house was big , for the Ingraham family had been numerous , but it was as square and austere as the builders could make it . The roof ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Amy said , " like a girl with her eyelashes cut off . " There were no blinds or shutters of any sort , and nothing to break the bleak winds which swept down between the hills of Ardsley , and which nipped the life of any brave green thing that tried to make a hold there . A few mullein stalks were all that flourished , and the stunted fruit trees which Hallam had noticed seemed but a pitiful parody upon the rich verdure of the elsewhere favored region . " Has nobody ever lived here since that wicked old man ? " " Oh , yes . I think so . But nobody for long , nor could anybody make it a home . " " It looks as if it had been blue , up there by the roof . " " I believe it was . I 've heard that every color possible was used in painting it , so as to make it the more annoying to a person of good taste , such as great-grandfather was . " " Heigho ! Well , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's hopeless . I ca n't see a ray of light in the whole situation . " " You dear old bat , you should wear specs . I can see several rays . I 'll count them off . Ray one : the ugly all-sorts-of-paint has been washed away by the weather . Ray two : the air up here is as pure as it 's sharp , and there 's nothing to obstruct or keep it from blowing your ' hypo ' away . Ray three : there are our own darling burros already helping to ' settle ' by mowing the weeds with their mouths . What a blessing is hunger , rightly utilized ! And , finally , there 's that worth-her-weight-in-gold Goodsoul waving her pudding-stick , which in this new , unique life of ours must mean ' breakfast . ' Come along . Heigho ! Who 's that ? Our esteemed political friend , ' Rep-Dem-Prob . ' I 'd forgotten him . Now , by the lofty bearing with which he ascends to our castle of discontent , I believe he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , Fayette whom they saw climbing over the rocks . He wore his oilcloth blouse and his gay helmet , and soon they could hear his rude voice singing and see the waving of his broom . " He ? Coming back again ? Why , we ca n't keep him . We ca n't even ' keep ' ourselves . " " Yet never a doubt I doubt he means to tarry , " quoted Amy , laughing at her brother 's rueful countenance . CHAPTER VIII . NEEDS AND HELPERS . " Sure , I thought ye had lost yourself or been ate by the rats ! " cried Cleena , as Fayette rather timidly peered in at the open kitchen door . " But all rogues is fond o ' good atin ' , so I suppose you 've come for your breakfast , eh ? " " No . I 've et . " " Must ha ' been up with the lark then . No , hold on . Do n't go in there . They 're master Hallam an ' Miss Amy still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the gentry should . If there 's ought left when they 're done , time enough for you an ' me . " " I 've had my breakfast , I told you . " " Did n't seem to set well on your stummick either , by the way your temper troubles ye . Are ye as ready to work as ye was yesterday ? " " Yes . What I come back for . " Cleena paused and studied the ill-shaped , vacant , though not vicious , face of the unfortunate waif . Something drew her sympathy toward him , and she pitied him for the mother whom he had never known . In the adjoining room she could hear the voices of her own " childer , " with their cultured inflection and language , which was theirs by inheritance and as unconsciously as were " Bony 's " harsh tones and rude speech his own . " Arrah musha ! but it 's a queer world , I d'know . There 's them an ' there 's him , an ' the Lord made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a hold o ' that broom o ' yours , an ' show me what it 's made for . If you 're as clean as you 're homebly , I might stand your good friend . What for no ? " Fayette had returned Cleena 's cool stare with another as steady . He liked her far better and more promptly than she liked him , yet in that moment of scrutiny each had measured the other and formed a tacit partnership . " For the family , " was Cleena 's watchword , and it had already become the half-wit 's . Cleena went to the well , tied her clothesline to the leaky old bucket and lowered it . On the night before she had obtained a pail of spring water from the cottage at the foot of the knoll , from the same friendly neighbor who had sold her the milk . But their own well must be fixed . To her dismay she found that it was very deep , and that the bit of water which remained in the bucket when it was drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried her . A scarcity of water was one of the few trials which she had been spared , and she could hardly have met a heavier . As she turned toward the house she saw that Fayette had carefully set out of doors the old chairs and the other movable furniture which the kitchen had contained , and that , before sweeping , he was using his broom to brush the cobwebs from the ceiling . The sight filled her with joy and amazement . " Saints bless us ! That 's the first man body I ever met that had sense like that ! " and she lifted up her voice in a glad summons :  --  " You , Napoleon Gineral Bonyparty , come by ! " " Before I finish here ? " " Before the wag o ' dog 's tail . Hurry up ! " " The wind 'll blow it all over again . " " Leave it blow . Come by . Here 's more trouble even nor cobwebs , avick ! First need is first served . " This summoned Hallam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after learning the difficulty and peering into the depths of the old pit they offered their suggestions . Said Amy :  --  " We might draw it up , bucket by bucket , and throw it away . Then I suppose it would fill with clean water , would n't it ? " " If we did , ' t would break all our backs an ' there 's more to do than empty old wells . Master Hal , what 's your say ? " " Hmm , we might rig up some sort of machinery and stir it all up , and with chemicals we could clear it and  --  " " Troth we could , if we 'd a month o ' Sundays to do it in an ' slathers o ' time an ' money spoilin ' to be spent . " Hallam was disgusted . Already he had blamed himself for his haughty refusal of Mr. Wingate 's offer , on the previous day , to send a practical man to look over the premises and " set them going , " as any landlord would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority to decide for his absent parents : " We wo n't trouble you , sir . What happens to us , after we leave Fairacres , is our own affair . If you get your rent , that should be sufficient for you . " After that the offer was not renewed ; for Mr. Wingate was not the man to waste either money or service , and the lad 's tone angered him . Regrets were now , as always , useless , and Cleena 's open disdain of Hallam 's suggestion sent him limping angrily away ; though Amy laughed over her own " valuable contribution to the solution of the dilemma , " and by her intentional use of the longest words at hand caused Fayette to regard her with a wonderment that was ludicrous in itself . " Well , Goodsoul , we 've helped a lot . Ask our ' Rep-Dem-Prob ' what his ' boys ' would do . " " What for no ? Sure , he 's more sense nor the whole of us . Say , me gineral , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had an inordinate vanity , and , like most of his sort , he possessed an almost startling keenness of intelligence in some respects , as contrasted with his foolishness in others . Moreover , he had been disciplined by poverty , and had always lived among working people and , for a long time , about the carpet mills . " Well , the ' Supe 's ' force-pump . " " Hmm , I know , I know . But what 's the ' Supe ' an ' his pump ? Is he fish , flesh , or fowl , eh ? " " He 's the ' Supe ' to the mill . Ai n't ye any sense ? " " No . None left after botherin ' with you . What 's it , Miss Amy ? " " I know . You mean Mr. Metcalf , do n't you ? " " Yes . " " What would he do ? How could he help us ? " " Lend me the donkey . I 'll ride and tell him . All them houses  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly . They look very pretty from here , with all the trees about them . " " They 've got wells . Once in six months the wells has to be cleared out . That 's orders . Me an ' another fellow goes down ' em , after the pump 's drawed out all it can . We bail ' em out . I clean cisterns , too . Ai n't another fellow in the village as good at a cistern as me . See , I 'm slim . I can get down a man-hole ' t nobody else can . Shall I go ? " " I 'll ask Hallam . " Who , upon consultation , replied :  --  " I suppose it 's the only thing we can do , but it does go against my inclination to ask favors of anybody . " " Hal , that 's silly . We must send Fayette to Mr. Metcalf , and will you write the note , or shall I ? " " You , since you 've seen him , personally . " " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed the girl , and ran into the house to find a sheet of paper . Then the mill boy was given his choice of the burros , to ride as messenger ; and having selected Balaam , departed down the slope in high glee . When he reached the mill , and Mr. Metcalf was at liberty to see him , he began a voluble description of all that had occurred since his chance meeting with Amy in the wood ; but the superintendent cut the story short . " Now , see here , ' Bony . ' This is the chance of your life . Understand ? They are , I should think , the very nicest folks you ever saw . Well , treat them square . None of your monkey shines nor nonsense . Do everything you can to help them . Of course you can have the pump , though you ca n't carry it up to ' Hardscrabble ' donkey-back . That fellow is as black as his brother , or sister , is white . They 're the prettiest donkeys I ever saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go round to John . There 's no teaming to be done this morning , and he shall take the pump there in the wagon . He 'll help you too , no doubt , for a small payment . " " Say , ' Supe . ' " " Well ? " " I do n't believe they 've got any money . Do n't look so they had a cent . Ai n't it queer ? With all them purty things an ' the way they act an ' talk . Ai n't like nobody I ever saw before . Ai n't never saw anybody liked each other so much . I 'm goin ' to stay . " " Have they asked you ? " " No . " " Well , run along and get hold of John before he goes home for a nap , as he might , with nothing needed here . " Then , when Fayette had left him , Mr. Metcalf took up Amy 's note and reread it . The second perusal pleased the gentleman even more than the first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl he had met , and he specially liked her statement that his former kindness presupposed a later one . So he stopped John , the teamster , as he was driving out of the mill yard , with the request :  --  " You stay up there all day , if you can be of any use . Got your dinner with you ? and the horses ' ? Good enough . I 've heard about that family being turned out from their old home , and whether it was justly done or not does n't alter the fact of its hardness . Lend them a hand , as if it were for me , John , and I 'll make it all right with you . " " It 's all right already , sir . I saw that girl , when she was down here that day ; saw her take her fine little handkerchief out of her pocket and wipe that idiot 's , or next door to idiot , wipe his lips as nice as if he was her own brother . Ai n't one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too dainty . She was n't , because she was quality . It always tells . Pity though that such folks have so little common sense . Now  --  " But Mr. Metcalf warded off any further talk of the good John , who had lived at Ardsley all his life and knew the history of the Kaye household almost better than they knew it themselves . " I 'll ask you to tell me about them another time . Just now I guess you 'd better hurry to get them a decent drink of water . Hold on , ' Bony . ' Ride over to the office door . I 'll send a note back to Miss Kaye , and want you to carry her a little basket . " So this was the note which answered Amy 's , and that proved its writer to be a gentleman , even though he had begun life a humble ash-boy in just such a mill as he now managed so ably :  --  " MY DEAR MISS AMY : The kindness is wholly on your side in allowing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in any further matter wherein I can be of use . " I am sending the pump by John Young , our teamster , with instructions to remain under your orders for the rest of the day . You will find that ' Bony ' thoroughly understands the business of well-cleaning , but you will have to restrain him from venturing into any great hazard , because , poor lad , he has not the caution to balance his daring . " I am offering , also , a little basket of fruit which came my way this morning , and which looks , I fancy , as if it wanted to be eaten by just such a girl as you . " FAITHFULLY YOURS , " WILLIAM METCALF . " When Amy read this note aloud to Hallam and Cleena , she did so in a proud and happy voice . " Well , I 've written letters for mother , and father , too , sometimes , but I 've not had many of my own . This is . I 'm going to keep it always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he just the dearest man ? Oh ! I am so happy I must just sing . It 's such a beautiful world , after all , and maybe we 've had all our old things taken away just to teach us that folks are better than things . I feel as if I 'd come out of a musty room into the open air . " " Amy Kaye ! You should be ashamed of yourself . Have you no heart at all ? As for musty rooms , if you can find any to beat these at ' Spite House , ' you 'll do well . " " I know . I 'm ' bad , ' of course , but come on . I 'll fetch you all father 's tubes and brushes that are in such a muddle , and you can sort them right near the well , and watch John fix it , and take care of Fayette ; I 'm going in and help Cleena , in any way I can . " Amy 's cheerfulness was certainly infectious . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be the well and cistern cleaning , Mr. Young having discovered a cistern beneath a pile of decayed boards , at a little distance from the house . But the water in both being unfit for use , Amy bravely picked up a couple of pails and started down hill to their new neighbor 's cottage . " Wait , Amy , I 'll rig up something , " called the cripple ; and by the aid of a rope , a barrel stave , and some wire he managed to hang the pails on either side Pepita 's saddle . " So all you 'll have to do will be walk up and down and make her behave , " referring to Pepita 's uncertain temper . " If I had a barrel I 'd better that job , " said John the teamster . " I 'd drive down once and get all you needed for the day . " " But there is n't any barrel that will hold water , " answered the girl . " So I 'll play ' Jack and Jill ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cottage children think she 's beautiful , and they are so kind they help me fill the pails each trip , as well as give us the water in them . " John wiped his brow and looked admiringly upon her . " Keep that spirit , lass , and it 'll make small difference to you whether your purse is empty or full . But ' give ' you the water ? I should say yes . The Lord gave it to them in the first place , free as the air of heaven . Well , there 'll be water to spare up here , too , soon , for we 've got the pump about ready for work . " It was a long time , though , before any impression was made upon the accumulation of water in the deep well . After a while , however , less came with each draft , and it was thicker and fouler . Finally , the pump ceased to be of any use , and was drawn up and laid beside the broken curb . Then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perilous . Keeping an eye upon all of Fayette 's movements , John had allowed him " to boss the job , " partly because the lad did fully understand his business , and partly to give him pleasure . But now was need for utmost caution . " Will you fetch me a candle ? " the teamster asked Cleena ; and when she had done so he fastened it to the end of the clothesline and slowly lowered it into the shaft . The flame was instantly extinguished . " Hmm , have to wait a spell , I reckon . Might as well tackle the cistern . " " What made the candle go out ? Was there a wind ? " asked Amy . " Carbonic acid gas , " answered her brother . " Huh , " said Fayette , contemptuously , " ' twa' n't neither . Just choke damp an ' fixed air . Soon 's the candle 'll stay lighted , I 'll go down . Cistern 's the same , only wider . Got a powder here 'll fix it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cistern was cleaned , and this was a much easier task than the well , Fayette returned to the curb , again lighted the candle , and lowered it . The foul and poisonous gases had mostly passed away , and the flame continued to burn as far down as the clothesline would reach . " That 's all right ; I 'll tackle it now . " " No , you 'll not . None o ' your foolhardiness here . " " Who made you boss o ' me , John Young ? " " I did . I 'll prevent you , if I have to hold on to you . Best leave it open till to-morrow , or longer even , " said John . " I 'm going to eat my dinner now . Come and have some . " " Bime-by . I 'm goin ' to take off my shoes . Work best when I 'm barefoot . " The answer gave John no concern , for he knew this peculiarity of Fayette 's ; so he walked quietly away toward the old shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their food and secure his own . Before he reached them , however , he heard a loud shout , and , turning , saw the foolish boy capering about on the beam which had been laid across the top of the well , and from which the rope and bucket were still suspended . " ' Bony , ' you fool , get off that ! A misstep and you 're gone ! " " All right , I 'll get off ! " There was a wild waving of arms , a burst of derisive laughter , and " Bony " had disappeared . CHAPTER IX . THE WATERLOO OF BONAPARTE LAFAYETTE . The teamster 's cry of horror brought everybody to the scene . Cleena was the first to reach it and to find John standing by the mouth of the well , whitefaced and trembling . " What 's it ? What 's down there ? What mean ye yellin ' that gait ? Speak , man , if ye can . " He could only point downward , while he strained his ears to catch any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him fiercely . " Speak , I tell ye ! Where 's the boy ? " The other still pointed down into the shaft , but he made out to say :  --  " I heard him laugh , then shout , and he must have gone stark crazy . " " He down there ? That poor , senseless gossoon ? Where was you that you 'd leave him do it ? " " I was walking  --  wait ! I hear something . " Four white , terror-stricken faces now bent above the old well , while Cleena 's arms clasped her " childer " tightly , fearing they , too , might be snatched away from her . " Saints save us , it 's bewitched ! Oh , the day , the day ! " " Shut up , woman ! Keep still . I hear something . " Again they stooped and listened , and Amy 's keen ears reported , joyfully :  --  " It 's Fayette ! It is , it is ! It sounds as if he were speaking from the far end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive , he 's alive ! " " He might as well be dead . His bones must be broken , and he ca n't live long in such an air as that , " said Hallam . " I do n't know . That he 's alive at all proves that the air is n't as bad as I thought . Besides , he may not have broken any bones . He 's had fearful falls , before this , and he always came out about sound . But the rope does n't reach much more than two-thirds down . I 've heard they dug this well a hundred and fifty feet deep . They had to , to reach water from top this rock . " " A hundred and fifty feet ! How can we possibly reach him ? " " Not by standin ' talkin ' . Whisk to the cottage , Amy , an ' beg the length of all the rope they have . To save a lad 's life  --  be nimble ! " The girl was away long before Cleena finished speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the sheets and blankets from the beds , and tore them into strips . Never wasting one motion of her strong hands , and praying ceaselessly , she tied each fresh length and tested it with all her force . Meanwhile Amy almost flew over the space between " Spite House " and the cottage , arriving there nigh breathless ; but gasping out her errand , she rushed straight to the line in the drying yard and began to tear it from its fastenings on the poles . " You 're wanting my rope , miss ? Somebody in the well ? Heaven help him ! But wait ! If it 's cleaning the well he is , why of course he 'd be down there . Who is it ? " " Fayette . Maybe you know him as ' Bony . ' " " The half-wit ? Pshaw , Miss . Do n't look that frightened . He 's all safe , never fear . Nothing hurts him . The Lord looks after him . I 'm afraid this rope wo n't hold , it 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind the children , they 'll have to take care of themselves . " All the while she was talking the kindly woman had been rolling the line , retying it where their haste broke its worn strands , and following Amy up over the slope . Now she paused for one second to remonstrate :  --  " You , Victoria , go back ! There 's William Gladstone trying to creep after us . Beatrice , Belinda , go home . You must n't follow mother every time she turns her back ! Go home , I tell you . Go  --  right  --  straight  --  back  --  home . My ! but this is steep ! " A shriek , shrill and piercing as only infant lungs could utter , made even Amy stop , eager though she was to reach the well where poor " Bony " might already have breathed his last . The one backward glance she cast showed the numerous children of the house of Jones toiling industriously skyward , in their mother 's footsteps . Victoria , who was " eight and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of himself , with the result that , being less than two years old and rather unsteady on his legs , he had toddled up to the biggest stone in the path , tried to step over it , lost his balance , and fallen . The hill was so steep that once the fat little fellow began to roll downwards he could not stop , and the terrified outcry first showed the mother his danger . " He 'll bump his head against a rock and  --  " Mrs. Jones did not finish her sentence , but faced about and ran frantically down the slope , catching up her baby and smothering it with kisses , although she had assured the little fellow , at least a dozen times that day , that " he was the very plague of her life . " She had dropped the rope , and Amy caught it , then turned and ran as fast upward as her neighbor was going in the other direction . Behind Amy still followed Victoria , Beatrice , and Belinda . " You should go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes 'm . He is often , " coolly replied Victoria , who could have the minor excitement of examining the baby 's bruises any day , but who did not intend to lose the greater one of " a man down the well " for any commonplace home matter . Just before she came to the crest of the knoll Amy hesitated , and stood still . It seemed to her she could not go on and face the possible , even probable , tragedy at the top , and into the midst of her awestruck waiting there was hurled this startling question :  --  " Say , miss , where do you s'pose you 'll have the funeral ? May I come ? " " Ugh ! Oh , you horrid little thing ! " Victoria appeared so amazed at the effect of her inquiry that she stared back into Amy 's face , wide-eyed and open-mouthed . " Wh-h  --  why ! " " I should n't have said that . But you go right straight back home . Your mother wants you . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " Why , ' cause I like to go to funerals . I go to every one Ma does . She 's got a real nice ' funeral dress , ' an ' so have I. " Amy fled . She had never seen anything like little Victoria , and she was so indignant that she almost forgot her dread of what might lie before her . She reached the group about the well , who were now utterly silent , and seemed to be watching with more astonishment than terror something happening within it . Amy , also , stretched her neck to see , though she shut her eyes , and this naturally prevented ; nor did she open them till she felt Cleena clutch the skirt of her frock and heard her exclaim :  --  " Faith , but he 's the biggest monkey out o ' the Zoo ! Arrah musha ! I 'll teach him scaring folks out o ' their wits , an ' wastin ' good bedclothes on such havers ! Huh ! " For this was the marvel that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grotesque than ever , climbing upwards into the daylight , blinking and sputtering , his back against the stones of one side the shaft , his feet against the other , his hands clutching , pulling ; both feet and hands almost prehensile , like the creature 's to which Cleena had likened him , yet safe , unbruised , and only mud-splashed and laughing . With a final , agile movement he reached the top , threw his arms about the beam , and leaped to the ground beside them . Then he laughed again , hilariously , uproariously , and not for long . In Cleena Keegan 's indignant soul a plan had been rapidly forming . " So you 'd be givin ' us all the terrors , would ye , avick ? Sure , a taste o ' the same medicine 's good for the doctor as his patient . I 'll just give ye a try of it , an ' see what ye say . Hmm , them sheets might ha ' lasted for years , so they might ; an ' them blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the astonished " Bony , " could comprehend what she would be about , Cleena had tripped and thrown the lad to the ground . She was more powerful than even his boasted muscle , and he quite unprepared for what she meant to do . The life-line made from her cherished bedclothing was twisted about his wet shoulders like a flash . Yet there seemed nothing violent nor vindictive as she rolled him over and over , wisely winding and binding first his hands and feet . After that the punishment she administered was but a question of endurance on her part , and the length of the line . " There , you blatherskite ! What 's your guardian angel thinkin ' of ye the now , you poor , ignorant , heathen gossoon ? Well for ye that old Cleena has met up with ye to beat some bits o ' sense into your idle pate . Tight , is it ? Well , not so tight as the bands o ' me heart when I looked to see ye brought up to me dead . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cleena finished her harangue and her task together . After that she stood up straight and strong , and regarded the teamster with a questioning eye . " Is it true , what he says , that he 's nor kith nor kin , hereabouts ? " " I guess it 's true , " answered John , laughing at the ludicrous appearance of Fayette upon the ground . " He was born in the poorhouse , an ' I 've heard his mother died . His father had before then , I know . I used  --  " Cleena was in no mood for long stories , and she foresaw that one was imminent . She interrupted without ceremony  --  " So , if I take him in hand to train him a bit , what for no ? There 'll be no one botherin ' an ' interferin ' , is it ? " " I guess there wo n't anybody worry about ' Bony . ' He 's right handy around the mill , an ' he does odd jobs for a many people ; but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ' for a song . ' " " I 'll have no song singin ' , not I , nor from him . But if I do n't make a smart , decent lad where there lies a fool , my name is n't Cleena Keegan , the day . Now what 's about the well ? " " That 's what I want to know , Cleena , " cried Amy . " How did he , could he , fall into it and climb out of it alive ? " " Easier than you think , miss . He slid down the rope as far as it went , I suppose , then caught his feet in the stones of the sides , then his hands , and went down just as he came up . He did n't go into the water in the bottom , of course ; but he 's proved that the well is safe enough , and to-morrow morning he ought to be made to go down , properly fixed , with a rope around his waist and the tackle for bailing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even after to-day 's beginning . But I 'll tell the boss about it , and I do n't doubt he 'll send the other man that helps ' Bony ' in the mill village , and get things right this time . What say , boy ? Think you 'll take matters a little soberer to-morrow , if I come back to help ? " Fayette lay with closed eyes and made no answer , but Cleena spoke for him , and as one in authority :  --  " Faith an ' he will . An ' I 'm thankin ' ye , sir , for all ye 've done the day . Sure , by this hour to-morrow , we should begin to see daylight ' twixt the dirt . " " I ' low you will . You 're a master scrubber , and no mistake . Well , good-by . Anything I can do for you village way ? " " I 'm beholden to you , sir , an ' so are my folks , but there 's not . I 'm for sending the childer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' master ; an ' they 'll fetch back what 's lackin ' o ' food an ' so on , when they come . It 's hungerin ' sore will the sweet lady be for a sight of her own . " " Oh , Cleena , is that so ? May we go ? But  --  that will leave you quite alone , " said Amy . Hallam smiled . " She 'll not be so very much alone , after all , dear , " and he nodded significantly toward the still apparently sleeping Fayette . Then they went away to saddle the burros , and after having received a mysterious message which they were to deliver to Adam Burn , to the effect that " he 'll know what to send o ' them things in his box . " " And it 's as clear as the sunshine just what you are asking , dear old Goodsoul . That Friend Adam shall give us your dollars out of his box . You transparent old pretender ! Well , never mind , Scrubbub . Some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall live in lavender , " said Amy , hugging the faithful woman , and smiling , though tears of gratitude were in her dark eyes . Which eyes , happening to look downward , saw Fayette 's own half open , and watching this little affectionate by-play with deep interest . No sooner , however , did he perceive that Amy had discovered this fact than his lids went down with a snap . " Ah , ha , Fayette ! I saw you . I 'm sorry for you , but just you tell Goodsoul , here , that you 'll remember not to shame your ' guardian angel ' any more , and she 'll let you up . I know her . Her heart 's made of honey and sugar , and everything soft and sticky . I believe she 's caught you in it , now , bad as you are , and if she has , you 'll never get quite clear of her love and too demonstrative kindness . " Then she cried to Hallam , who was limping toward the tethered burros : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would trot a good pace if they realized they were on the road to mother and father and Friend Adam Burn 's big oat-bin ! " As they passed through the gateless entrance to " Bareacre , " Hallam turned , and with something of Amy 's cheerfulness waved his hand to Cleena . " We 'll be back before dark , Goodsoul . Do n't keep that lad tied any longer . Do n't . " " Arrah musha ! Ca n't I do what I will with me own ? There 's somewhat to pass ' twixt him an ' me afore he gets free o ' them bonds . " Evidently , there was ; nor was she sorry to see all go and leave her alone with Fayette . Of what occurred during their brief absence at the Clove , nobody ever heard ; but when the brother and sister rode up the slope , just as the evening fell , Fayette appeared to meet them and take their burros for them . His manner was subdued and gentle , and on his homely face was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Another lull before another storm , is n't it ? " Hallam regarded the half-wit critically . " No . But I think he 's ' met his Waterloo . ' " " Oh , is that what we are to call her in future ? She 's already as many names as a Spanish princess . " Then she lifted her voice to summon Cleena . " Heigho , ' Waterloo ' ! Father and mother are doing finely , and send love , and dear old Adam sent something much more substantial , but not what you asked for . Just plain beefsteak and potatoes , and a jolly chicken pie that 's in a basket on Hallam 's crutch . Those crutches are the handiest things ! " " Faith , so they be . An ' there 's a fire out of some wood the cottage woman sent , an ' the steak 'll broil while the taties roast , like the whisk of a squirrel in the tree . " So " Waterloo " became another of good Cleena 's " love names . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes a sweet sound in one 's ears , and the woman 's heart thrilled , and her weary shoulders lifted because of the love which sang through Amy 's innocent jest . CHAPTER X. HOME-MAKING . For one whole week the artist and his wife remained at the Clove . During that time " Spite House " had undergone the most thorough cleaning and overhauling of its existence . The walls had been scraped of the ancient and discolored whitewash that covered them , and a fresh coat of sweet-smelling lime applied . " It 's like a new-mown field , I think , " said Amy , on the day that this whitewashing had taken place , to Fayette who was artisan in chief  --  always under Cleena 's orders . " An ' I must be the daisy that grows in it , " he returned , catching a glimpse of his lime-splashed face in the tiny pocket mirror he always carried . " A whole bunch of daisies , indeed . But is n't it jolly ? I never did so much hard work in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet ache  --  whew ! And I never , never was so happy . " Fayette paused midway to the shed , which he had repaired with bits of boards , begged or offered in various sources . The whitewash brush over his shoulder dripped a milky fluid upon his bared head , and occasionally a drop trickled as far as the corner of his capacious mouth . But he minded nothing so trivial as this , and he stared at Amy in the same wonderment with which he had regarded her from the beginning of their acquaintance . She also paused and returned his gaze with an amused scrutiny . " Fayette , that stare of yours is getting chronic . I wish you 'd give it up . Everything I do or say seems to astonish you . What 's the matter with me ? Am I not like other girls ? You must know many down at the mill . " " No , you ai n't . " " How different ? I 'd really like to know . " " Ai n't seen you cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he corrected truthfully . " An ' you left all them things up there , an ' the trees , an ' the posies , an ' everything like that way . " For one moment Amy 's breast heaved and her voice choked . Then she jerked her head in a fashion she had when she wished to throw aside unpleasant things and replied :  --  " What would be the use of crying ? If it would bring them all back , I 'd cry a bath-tub full . But it wo n't . Thinking about it only makes it worse . It had to be , and in some ways I 'm thankful it did . It was all unreal and dreamlike up there . I knew nothing about the sorrows and hardships in the real world . But how I am talking ! I wonder , do you understand at all what I have said ? " " I could n't help cryin ' when the bluebird 's nest fell an ' smashed all the eggs , " remarked Fayette , whimpering at the recollection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing through a cloud , " as the girl often expressed it , when the untaught lad revealed something of his intense love of nature , so strongly in contrast to his otherwise limited intelligence . " Well , we must forget what 's past and go to work . I 'll tether the burros out of the roadside while you clean up their shed ; and when they come back to find it all sweet and white , like Pepita herself , they 'll be as pleased as Punch . Wonder we never thought of having the old stable at Fairacres whitewashed . " " Did n't have me , then , " answered the lad . " Fayette , you 're as vain as a peacock . You always say ' ME ' as if it were spelled with the biggest kind of capital letters . " " Do I ? Hmm , " responded Fayette , with a vacant smile . Then Amy went into the house where Hallam and Cleena were arguing about what rooms should be arranged for the personal use of master and mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should take precedence of all others . During this time of separation from him , the son had grown to think of his parent as a whimsical invalid , only . Oddly enough , with his own physical infirmity , he had come to look upon any bodily weakness of other lads or men as something almost degrading . He had always felt himself disgraced by his own lameness . It was this which had given him so bitter and distorted an outlook upon life , and involuntarily there had crept into his love for his father a feeling of contempt as well . Something of this showed in his talk with his sister , over this selection of rooms , and shocked her . Then , with loyal indignation she proceeded to enlighten him as to her own view of the subject . " Now , see here , Hallam Kaye . I do n't believe , I ca n't believe , and I never will believe that from being a brilliant scholar and a wonderfully talented artist my darling father has suddenly become a  --  a  --  the sickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy ! I never said that . I never thought it . I only remember that he has always had the best of everything , and I supposed he always should . " The tears of excited protest rushed into her eyes , but she dashed them away . " Queer , I never cry , hardly ever , unless I 'm mad . I am mad at you , Hal Kaye , right straight clear through . You wait and see how father is , after this trouble . All his life he has been petted by mother , who adores him ; and that not too agreeable cousin Archibald said the truth about his having had so easy a path all his life . I tell you it is n't for his children to sit here in judgment upon him , nor criticise anything he does ; but one thing I believe , he 's had a good hard waking up . He has n't realized the truth . How should he ? Mother has always smiled and smiled and seen to everything . He was a genius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Not till now . Now he has been tumbled off his cushions whack ! and presently he 'll get up  --  all right . " " Whe-e-ew ! You do n't mince matters in speaking of your relatives , do you , sweet sister ? " " Not a bit . Just you wait . All the histories we 've ever read , all the tales we 've ever heard , of gentlemen and gentlewomen , ' aristocrats , ' who have had to suffer anything dreadful , show that they have borne the troubles as no meaner person could . The good there is in being of ' family , ' it seems to me , is the self-respect that holds us upright , no matter what blows are dealt . " Again Hallam blew a long note . But he looked at his excited little sister with a new admiration . " Upon my word , Amy , my dear , you are positively eloquent . Who knows but you may one day take to the ' stump , ' become a public orator , and lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which you are so proud . " " No , thank you . I do n't need to go abroad to lecture . I find enough subjects right in my own household . Between you and ' Bony ' and Miss Scrubbub my life 's a burden to me . Now hear me , both of you ; for in the language of ' Bonaparty Gineral Lafayette , ' ' there ai n't none o ' ye got no sense ' cept me , ' and ' me ' says : Fix up the north chamber for a studio . Put all father 's things in there . Fix the middle room , which faces east and the sunrise , for a bedroom ; and this warm southwestern one for a private sitting room , for mother darling , where she can retreat to think upon her husband 's greatness and her children 's folly ; and where the sweet blessed thing will never be alone one single minute , unless every other member of the family is sound asleep . So that 's for the ' retreating ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this minute ! that I could hug the heart right out of her ! Fly around , Amy , ' an ' set the house to one side , ' a la Friend Adam 's old housekeeper . " It was wonderful what four pairs of arms could accomplish when love actuated them . " Spite House " had seemed hopelessly bare and dirty when the little household first entered it , but it was far from that by the end of a week 's stay . Bare and bleak and unadorned it was still , and the surroundings seemed to forbid that it would ever be any better . But there was not an inch of its surface , outside or in , that had not been cleaned and polished , by scrubbing or whitewash brush . Even the moss-grown roof had been swept by Fayette , standing barefooted and unsupported on the sloping shingles , while he vigorously attacked them . To Hallam this seemed a desecration . The moss had been the one redeeming feature of the roof 's ugliness . " Saints save us ! If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me dressin ' for mass an ' no rackin ' down me hair , so it would . No , Master Hal , if riches we ca n't have , cleanness we can . An ' that 's aye more pleasin ' to God . " The plain , strong furniture which had been in the house had been placed to best advantage ; and in the parents ' rooms above , as well as the one family living room below , were gathered all that had been brought from dear Fairacres . A load of wood and another of coal , which Cleena supposed had been sent by Friend Adam and paid for with her money , gave a comfortable look to the woodshed , and in the storeroom was a bag of flour , a side of bacon , a fair supply of vegetables , and a barrel of apples . These the village grocer 's lad had brought in his delivery wagon , and it was useless to ask him by whose order . Since they were needed , however , it was well to take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coal . Finally , the Saturday afternoon arrived on which Hallam and Amy were to go to the Clove , to pass First Day with Adam Burn and their parents , returning before nightfall with the latter , to begin their reunited family life . Dressed in their freshest clothes , upon Balaam and Pepita , groomed by the willing hands of Fayette , they journeyed gayly down the slope over the familiar road , eager for their visit and the warm welcome awaiting them . " Do you know , Amy , it 's queer that we 've never been about alone much , even on these country roads , till now ? Losing our home seems to have broken down ever so many restrictions . " " Well , do n't you like it ? Does n't it make you feel freer and healthier ? " " Maybe . I 'm not enthusiastic over our poverty . I 'd be glad enough to go back to Fairacres . " " So would I , if we could live there honestly . I would n't go , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in debt as we did . " " Are n't we living in debt just the same now , and much more uncomfortably ? " " I suppose so ; though it 's different . This time it is n't going to last , and we have n't shut our eyes to it . " " Why is n't it going to last ? How can we stop it ? I see nothing ahead except starvation . " " Hallam Kaye , the very first thing you ought to learn is to be cheerful . You do n't want to be a dead weight on anybody , do you ? Well , you will be if you ca n't look ahead at all to anything bright . You and I are going to work and mend the family fortunes . Then we 're going back to Fairacres and do all the good we can with the money we 've earned . " " If I were sound  --  " " And sensible , you 'd race me again to the gate of the Clove . " Burnside-in-the-Clove was a bonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm took its name almost as much as from the family which had dwelt there for generations , ran through the velvet lawn and was spanned by a rustic bridge where the well kept driveway curved toward the roomy house . " Oh ! it 's so lovely here . The many , many windows , each more cheery and inviting than its neighbor ; the old-fashioned door , opened almost all the time ; the hammocks , the benches , the flowers , the cool , sweet dairy  --  this is a home . I guess I 'll make ours here instead of at Fairacres , after all , " laughed Amy , as they paced sedately over the gravel , the better to enjoy the scene , and now that they had arrived , in no such haste for the meeting with their people . " I like to go slowly now , do n't you , Hal ? Because that makes the pleasure ' long-drawn out ' and all the sweeter . In a minute mother 's face will be in the doorway , with father looking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobble after , if he is not too lame ; and then we shall jump off and the ' man ' will take the burros , and we will go in and hug everybody all round , and eat the biggest kind of a supper  --  living on dry bread and milk two meals a day can give an appetite ! And then one of dear old Adam 's ' Spirit ' talks ; and bed and sleep , and breakfast and meeting , and  --  " " ' Spite House ' ! " " No , Hallam , truly not . Our mother could n't live in such a place . To-morrow a new life will begin on the barren knoll . ' Charity House ' she will have it , and wherever our mother goes , softness and kindness and loveliness are sure to follow . " " Yes , that is so , " answered the cripple , thoughtfully . " Well , hear me , Amy . I guess I have been about as much of a wet blanket as I could be , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for father and mother . Just now , as we rode down the valley into all this peace and quiet , I seemed to see myself exactly as I am . Heigho ! but look how green the grass is still , late in the year as it is , and how beautiful the vines on the stone walls . The maples are like a golden glory . My father must have been wonderfully soothed by so much loveliness about him , though he 's going to feel it all the  --  " " Take care , Sir Optimist , that is to be . You 're taking the wrong turn , comrade . Come away from the down to ' has been , ' and climb to ' will be , ' short metre . " It was all as they said . The mother 's gentle face in the doorway , looking rested and less faded for the week passed in the society of a simple , noble man ; the father 's gay and debonair , as Amy remembered it  --  how long ago , was it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his broadbrim crowning his snowy hair , his expression one of childlike happiness and freedom from care . He welcomed them both with all heartiness , but Amy was dearest . She had always been , perhaps because she bore the name of his long dead wife , and had always seemed to stand as a child to his childless life . So after the fine supper was over , while before a blazing fire in another room Mr. and Mrs. Kaye discussed with Hallam all the events of the past week , Amy and the old man who had lived for more than eighty years a blameless , helpful life sat by a window in another place and looked out into the moonlight saying little , but enjoying all . " Dear father Adam , shall I tell thee "  --  for with him she always drifted into the sweet speech which was hers by birthright and his for all his life  --  " shall I tell thee how it seems to me , as if thee had learned every single lesson life and God has had to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong that others have done thee . Thee has seen thy kindred go away and leave thee alone . It is just like a good soldier who has been in a thick fight and a sailor who has swam in deep waters , but has come out safe on the other side . Thee is so calm and happy , like Mrs. Jones 's little Belinda , who sits in the sun and sings and croons to herself , with never a plaything or anything good about her except her own serene happiness . Is n't it ? " " Maybe , child . It may be . It should be , certainly . There should be no care in either extreme of life . Both ends are so close to the Father 's house . " Thee is right though , about the middle of life , little Amy . It is a time of struggle and rebuff . " " But to-night it seems as if it could never have been so with thee . Tell me , father Adam , how thee has kept thyself so simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that . Simple , indeed , but not good . There is none good but One . Yet there are certain things that help . I 'll tell thee what has helped me most , that is , in my daily life in the world , from which we can never escape while the heart beats . " The dear old man rose , limped toward an ancient secretary , and took from it a small book . Just an ordinary account book , ruled for the keeping of small affairs , but arranged with every page inscribed by the trembling fingers of this all-thoughtful friend . " I have been thinking what a muddle it would be to thee , Amy , and I fixed this for thee . On one side is the debt and the other side the credit . Thee will have to keep the reckonings for thy family , I foresee ; for thee is practical . Look . Is the light sufficient ? " Amy held the little volume so that the rays of the harvest moon fell clearly over them , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She questioned , and he explained just how the book should be kept , and she found his " system " exceeding plain and direct , as was everything about him . But there were two legends inscribed upon the covers which had little in common with the figuring to be done between them ,  --  or so Amy thought ; and when she asked him what they meant , he quietly explained :  --  " They have been my rules of life , Amy , and I think it would be well for thee if thee also adopted them . They are short and easy to remember , but they cover all . ' Simplicity , Sincerity , Sympathy , ' on the front page ; and on the last , when the first rule seems sometimes to fail and the heart needs cheer , there is this other : ' Love is all powerful . ' " " Thank thee , dear Adam , so much . Not only for the book and the help it will be , but for the ' Rules ' and  --  for thyself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me if I am succeeding . Now , I know thee is sitting up beyond thy time . I 'll help thee to the living room and then to thy own . " Nor was Amy ever to forget that peaceful hour with this ripe old Christian ; and she never again sat in the rays of the harvest moon without recalling the lessons she learned that night . CHAPTER XI . THE YOUNG OLD MAN AND THE OLD YOUNG GIRL . It seemed to Amy that she had never remembered so lovely a First Day as that one at Burnside Farm . Things happened just as she had foretold . Mrs. Kaye and Adam went to meeting in the little phaeton into which it was so easy for him to climb , and Hallam and she rode beside it ; for " Old Shingleside , " as the meeting-house was called , was at some distance from the Clove . It crowned a wooded hill-top , and behind it lay the peaceful burying-ground , with its rows of modest tombstones and wider rows of grass-covered , unmarked mounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mild air came in and warmed them ; for as yet the plain box stoves held no blazing logs within , and the rows of old-time foot-stoves reposed securely upon their tops . Later , when the weather turned , these little wood-rimmed , perforated tin boxes would be filled with coals from the fire and placed beneath the feet of the elderly folk who came to worship . The girl looked into her mother 's face and found it beaming with the still delight of one whose heart was deeply moved . She had always been a member of this simple congregation , but of late years Salome Kaye had been obliged to forego the pleasure of gathering with it . The distance from Fairacres was too great for her to walk , and it was long since the horses and carriages that had once filled Fairacres stables had disappeared . Hallam , also , from his place on the men 's side , saw the joy in the face he loved , and thought :  --  " I wish mother would consent to ride one of the burros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wished . But she does n't think it decorous . Well , I 'm glad she 's having the comfort to-day ; but what is Friend Adam saying ? It sounds like a farewell . " He shot a startled glance across to Amy , among the women , and she responded . Then both regarded Adam anxiously . He stood in the speaker 's place , where he was always found in meeting time . His body swayed gently back and forth , though his hands rested upon his cane as if he needed its support . His voice fell into the rhythmic measure to which they were accustomed whenever he became the mouthpiece of the Spirit , but his words were as of one who departs for a distant country and wishes many things to be remembered . His message was brief , yet delivered with all the fire and eloquence of youth ; but when he had finished and cast his eyes about him , something like a sob burst from his withered lips :  --  " It 's so queer . He looks so happy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of greeting to his neighbor , and so meeting 's over . " There was no trace of sadness now . In the friendly hand-shaking that became general was , as Amy had seen , the signal for the closing of the meeting , whereupon old neighbors and friends fell promptly to giving and receiving news of mutual welfare or trouble , as the case might be ; and after a while there was a driving away of vehicles , the nods and signals of gray bonnets and broad brims , until the while party from the Clove were the very last left lingering on the grass before the steps . " Well , it 's been a good day , Salome . And now the Word comes : ' For here we have no continuing city , but seek one to come . ' " The old man 's eyes fixed themselves earnestly upon the weather-beaten structure ; then with a bright smile he turned away and climbed into the phaeton which Amy had brought . Old Fanny mare trotted homeward at an almost giddy pace , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though their chronic laziness overcame them at times , and they fell behind . After which Hallam and Amy would prod their indolent beasts till they had " made a spurt and caught up . " " No use , children , " laughed Adam Burn . " Fanny is a well-trained ' Quaker . ' She knows meeting days as well as I do , and she never fails to go there as slowly as she returns swiftly . She thinks , if horses think , and I think they think  --  does n't thee think so , Amy ? She thinks she has done her duty , and her conscience is as clear as her stomach is empty . On meeting days she has always an extra feed . That 's why she spins along like this . " He was very jolly , and as full of fun as Amy herself . They found Mr. Kaye pacing the driveway , waiting for them , and as eager for his dinner as Fanny for hers . They were soon gathered about the table , and again old Adam 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his suggestions the most practical . " I advise thee , Cuthbert , to have a lot of good soil drawn up and spread over the top of Bareacre knoll . Thee can have the use of the team here till  --  for some time . There is plenty of muck in the hollow , and I 'd be glad to have it cleared out . Then thee must sow grass , or grain and grass mixed , and Salome can have as many roots and cuttings of the green things here as she wishes . Get them all in this autumn . By another spring they will begin to grow , and a little greenery will transform the place . " Mrs. Kaye thanked him , but Amy looked up from her dish of rice pudding and smiled . " Thee is n't helping us to keep the rule of ' do n't run in debt ' that thee told me was so good . " " Cuthbert and I will settle that . Eat thy pudding , child . " But he shook his head at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner came the big carryall , with its back part loaded so that the springs touched , and with the " man " upon the front seat , ready to drive the Kayes to their new home . " Why , Adam , dear old friend , this is too much ; it really is . I can not let thee do it , " protested Mrs. Kaye , astonished at the sight . For there were vegetables of every sort that grew at Burnside , with hams and bacon , some very lively chickens , and baskets heaped with the grapes and pears for which the Clove was famous . " Too much , Salome ? I think not . Not judging by the samples of appetites I 've seen this noon . Say nothing . Thee knows how gladly I give it , and would give much more . Here , Amy , is a little letter for thee . I wish thee to keep it without reading until  --  " he hesitated , looked at her gravely , and finished his sentence  --  " until thy own heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallam , too , there is a bit of writing , and that he may read at any time he chooses . " " That 's right now , then , " laughed the lad , and eagerly tore the sealed envelope . Adam Burn winced a little at the ragged edge this made on the paper , for he was a careful person and hated slovenliness . But he could not refrain a smile as he saw the expression of disappointment growing upon Hallam 's face , where he sat upon black Balaam , his crutches crossed before him , looking down at the open sheet he had found . The envelope dropped to the ground , and Amy picked it up ; but her brother did not show her the message he had received , and she was puzzled to hear their old friend say :  --  " The truth which I have written there is better for thee than a fortune , Hallam . " " It may be , but , under the circumstances , I 'd rather have the fortune . " " Thee 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Amy thrust the envelope into her pocket , along with the letter Adam had given her , and a moment later they all passed out of the yard , and turned toward the knoll of Bareacre . The last glimpse they had of their friend showed him standing in the sunshine , leaning upon his cane , and gazing after them as they vanished from his sight . " There is something different about that blessed old man to-day , " said Amy to Hallam , riding with him beside the carryall . " Well , I suppose it makes him feel badly to know we are not going back to Fairacres . He always does feel other people 's troubles more than his own . " " What was in your letter , Hal ? " " Humph ! It could n't be called a letter . From anybody else I would have thought it insulting . " " Not from him , dear . He could n't insult anybody . He 'd not have the heart to do it . Do you mind telling ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take example by it too . For it was a sort of sermon in few words ,  --  ' The perfection of a man is the stature of his soul . ' That 's all . " " I do n't see yet just what it means , but I think it is that you should n't mind being lame . That you should let your soul grow so big you would forget your poor legs , and other folks would forget them too . " Nothing more was said , and even Amy felt that they had had enough of " sermons " for one day , and it was a relief to the thoughtfulness upon them all to reach Bareacre , and to see Cleena , with Fayette beside her , waiting to welcome them . " Hal , is n't it odd ? The poorer we are the more folks we have . Fayette means to live there with us , and so , it seems , do all the little Joneses . My ! Who is that ? " " A scarecrow , I should think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocking-chair which she had herself brought out from the house was a young girl of about Amy 's age , though from her dress and manner she might have been at least several years older . Amy caught a vision of something very gay and brilliant , rivalling the forests upon the hillsides in variety of tint , but never in their harmony . " Whew ! Whoever she is she makes my eyes ache ; and what a picture for father to see , the first at his new threshold ! " Yet apparently without noticing anything unpleasing , Mr. Kaye assisted his wife from the carryall and walked with her to where the stranger still sat and rocked . She did not rise at their approach , and returned the courteous greeting of the master and mistress of the house with the barest of nods . " How do ? I come to pay a call . " But not upon them . For the first time in their lives the artist and his lovely wife were relegated by this self-possessed young person to the land of " old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a twinkle in his eye that met an answering one in hers , the gentleman handed Mrs. Kaye on toward the eager Cleena , and turned to his children :  --  " My dears , a visitor for you , I think . " So Amy and Hallam rode up and dismounted , while the former went forward slowly , smiling a welcome , yet feeling oddly disconcerted before this unknown girl . " I 'm Gwendolyn Jones . Ma said it was n't no more ' n friendly to come an ' call . I do n't have no time ' cept Sunday an ' Saturday-half . Then I generally go to Wallburg to do my shopping . It 's such a trouble , shopping is , ai n't it ? " " I do n't know . I never did any , " answered Amy , simply . She was amused by Gwendolyn , but regretful that the visit had been timed just then . She had counted upon showing the interior of the new home to her parents , with all the best features accented , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , she was conscious that she had herself been noticed only in the slightest degree by this maiden whose big brown eyes were fixed upon Hallam with a steady gaze that annoyed him exceedingly . He was always more conscious of his lameness in the presence of a stranger , and the people he had met , heretofore , had been so well bred that beyond the first involuntary surprise at his condition they had ignored it entirely . To his amazement Gwendolyn exclaimed :  --  " So you 're the lame fellow , are you ? Well now , you do n't look it , not above your waist . You look real likely in your face , and your shoulders is broader than Lionel Percival 's . He 's considered well growed , too . " " Is he ? " asked poor Hallam , understanding that some sort of reply was expected . " Yes ; ' Bony ' feels real sot up , do n't he , taking care of them donkeys ? Oh , I tell you , ' Bony ' is a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallam . He looked helplessly toward Amy , but she was disappearing indoors , too eager to be with her parents to loiter with this unprepossessing guest . " Yes , he 's telling all over the mill , and village too , how that he belongs to your folks now . He 's going to live here , ai n't he ? " " He may be . It will be just as Cleena wishes , I fancy . She is the one who has taken him in charge . " " That 's the work girl , ai n't it ? " To the young Kayes and their parents their faithful servant had never been anything save just " Cleena . " Her position in their family was as assured as their own , and that she might be thought a " work girl " by others , was a novel idea to the lad . It gave him something natural to think about ; and he stood leaning on his crutches , with a smile upon his face , looking down upon the girl in the rocking-chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes ; I suppose she is . She certainly works , and all the time . But I should hardly call her a ' girl . ' " " Say , you must be tired , standing so long . Take this chair . I 'll step in and get another . " Again Hallam smiled . The girl , in her ignorant kindness of heart , had broken a minor law of that courtesy in which he had been educated . She had offered him the chair in which she had herself been sitting , instead of the fresh one she meant to get . But he declined both , saying :  --  " Please do n't trouble . I can easily bring one for myself . " Because she was curious to see how he would do this , she watched him and sat still . Now he was quite able to wait upon himself in most ways , and handled his crutches so deftly that they often seemed to Amy , as to him , " but an extra pair " of feet or hands , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and out again , once more looking for his sister , and hearing her voice above stairs explaining , exhibiting , and regretting :  --  " Is n't it too bad , mother , that this young lady should have come just now ? Hal has worked so hard and done so much . Anyway , father , you must not , indeed you must not , go into your studio till he can take you there . It would be such a disappointment , for he 's arranged and rearranged till I 'm sure even your fine taste will be pleased . " He lingered a moment to catch the answer , and it filled his foreboding soul with great content . " It is all very excellent thus far , dear , and we 'll surely leave the studio for him to show . I had no idea you could so transform this barn of a place . From the outside it was ugliness itself , but you have all done wonders . We shall be very happy here . " " Can that really be father speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy was right . Blood tells . And there 's something better even than blood to help him now . That 's love . Dear old Adam was right , too : so long as we have each other we can be happy . " Then he caught up a light chair under his arm and swung himself back to play knight-errant to this unknown damsel . She found him very agreeable , for he was a gentleman and could not fail in courtesy toward any woman , old or young . So agreeable , indeed , that she remained rocking , chewing , and talking , till the shadows of the autumn evening crept round them , and Cleena , watchful for her " child , " and indignant at the intrusion of this stranger , appeared . " Arrah musha , Master Hallam , will you be sittin ' here catchin ' your death ? Come in by , immediate . The supper is on , an ' the master waitin ' . Sure , that 's bad luck , for the first meal we 're all together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was impossible for him to avoid asking Gwendolyn to remain , and she , utterly ignoring the sniffs and scowls of Cleena , promptly accepted . Of that meal it is not worth while to write . The girl did have the grace to keep reasonably quiet , though occasionally she would feel that this silence was not doing herself justice , and would break into the cheerful conversation of the others with a boldness and self-assertion that made Amy stare . Finally she departed , and Mr. Kaye sighed his relief . " Well , Friend Adam is the youngest old person , and Gwendolyn Jones is the oldest young person I ever saw , " remarked Hallam , as he lighted his mother 's bedroom candle and bade her good night . CHAPTER XII . BAD NEWS FROM BURNSIDE . " Yes , it is to be ' Charity House ' now , " said Salome Kaye , with that quiet decision of hers which , as Amy described it , " Never makes any fuss , and never wobbles . " " That 's the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes ' when she means ' no , ' and she never says either till it 's all settled . I remember how , when I was little , I used to ask , ' Is it decided ? ' and when she answered , ' Yes , it 's decided , ' I gave up teasing . Mountains might crush , but never move her . " " So it 's ' Charity House ' forever and a day . The trouble with you , mother , is that all you say  --  or the little you say  --  always means something . ' Charity House ' is , I suppose , just as full of meaning as everything else . Is n't it ? Let me guess . It 's ' Charity ' because cousin Archibald lets us live here for what he calls a ' starvation rent . ' That 's the meanest kind of ' Charity , ' and it 's a lie , too . " " Hallam ! " " But , mother , it is . I 've heard these people talk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallam , thee is proving that a ' Charity House ' is the very sort of home thee needed . " " Well , motherkin , it 's true . He is curmudgeon-y . He 's tried for years to get a tenant for this property , and not even the mill folks would touch it . He took advantage of us and made us think we were getting a great deal for nothing . " " Are we not ? Look about thee . " " Of course , it 's big enough . " " What a curious place it is , " said Amy ; " like a box that eggs come in . See , this is it , " and she rapidly sketched upon a paper the diagram . " Two partitions run this way , north and south , and two run at right angles . That 's three rooms deep on each floor , look at it from any point of view . Each room is as like its neighbor as its twin . Hmm , I did n't realize it , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' black hole . ' " " Almost as large as ' Fairacres , ' thee sees . " " It 's not so bad , if it were n't so fearfully bare , " remarked Hallam , examining Amy 's sketch . " But it 's queer . " The entrance hall was the middle front room of the old building . From this a flight of stairs ran up and ended in " the middle room " above , with a narrow flight behind into the attic . The upper middle room was therefore an open space , from the sides of which a narrow gallery had been reserved to surround the well-like opening of the stairway . Next the stairs the gallery was furnished with a strong plain railing , to prevent the accident of falling into the " well , " and all the bedrooms had doors opening upon it . This upper space was dark , save when the bedroom doors were open and gave it light . So , also , was the room below ; and beneath this , still , was the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . Whatever the original purpose of this " hole , " which received no light nor ventilation except through the kitchen cellar , it was now the terror and despair of Cleena 's cleanly soul . She had wasted many good candles in trying , by their light , to sweeten and make wholesome this damp , miserable place . But despite all it remained almost as she found it . " The pit of original sin , " Hallam named it , advising her to give over the task of purification . " You 've sprinkled pounds of chloride , splashed whitewash galore , swept and scrubbed and worn yourself out , and it 's hopeless . Well , I never heard that any of the Ingrahams died of pestilence bred down there , so I fancy it wo n't hurt us . " " Faith , it sha n't that . I 'll keep the front cellar door open into it incessant , an ' I 'll  --  " " Waste your substance in lime . Do n't , Goodsoul . But it 's on my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong as I wish , I 'd turn rabbit and burrow galleries out from the middle vault under the middle rooms each side of the house . That would give light and air and keep everything dry . " Neither Cleena nor Hallam noticed that Fayette had been a close listener to this conversation , nor heard the muttered exclamation :  --  " I 'll do it ! Huckleberries ! I 'll s'prise ' em ! " This had been some days before Amy drew the diagram of the house , which she now tossed into the waste-basket . From that it was rescued by the half-wit and treasured carefully ; for to the purpose formed in his mind it would prove a great help . " But go on , mother dear . What 's the other sort of charity you mean ? " " That by all the advantages which we have had over these new neighbors we should be helpful to them . We possess nothing of our own , absolutely , not even our better training and  --  " " Arrah musha ! Sure the pullet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! An ' me steppin ' me great foot  --  There , there , darlin ' . Cry no more , cry no more ! " The interruption was Cleena , and the cause " Sir " William Gladstone . " Again , Goodsoul , " jeered Amy . " Again is it ? An ' me goin ' down that hill betimes this mornin ' to remind me neighbor as how it was n't necessary to send all the childer up here to wonst . Not all ! " One of the first things which Cleena had made Fayette do was cut and smooth a path from the door of " Charity House " to that of the cottage below . She foresaw that there would be frequent errands to and fro , and the loose stones , with the tangle of running blackberry vines , were dangerous to life and limb . Then , because Hallam 's lameness was also in her mind , she had persuaded the mill boy to add a row of driven stakes with rope strung along their tops . " But never at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone down or up by that same . Me fathers , what 's a body to do ! " " We 're living in ' Charity , ' Goodsoul . And I 've observed that , look out of window when I will , there 's always a yellow headed Jones-let ascending to us by the easy road you 've fixed . Belinda , the small , is apt to lead the way . She likes it up here . She likes it very much . " " Hmm , that 's what the mother be 's sayin ' . But is that any reason at all , avick , why they should be let ? " " Mrs. Jones thinks it is . She feels that we are flattered by the preference her offspring show for our society ; but between ourselves , Cleena , I think it 's more raisin-bread than affection . You made a dire mistake in beginning to feed them . " " An ' is n't it I that knows it ? Now , this baby  --  " " Yes , that baby . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , like a coach-dog . What 's he licking from his fingers ? " " It 's spoilin ' the bakin ' o ' bread is he the day . Takin ' the coals from the bucket , each by each , an ' pressin ' them deep in that beautiful dough . Will I wash his face , eh ? Never a wash I wash , but home to his mother he goes the same as he is . If the sight does not shame her , I 'd know . " " I 'll take him , Cleena , and I 'll bring back the milk for the day . " So with her pail in one hand and the other guiding the still uncertain steps of William Gladstone , Amy started . " It 's a pity , Sir William , it really is a pity that you ever learned how to climb . You 've progressed so alarmingly . First time you tried it you could only stumble and fall backward . Now  --  you hitch along famously . Heigho ! here 's Victoria . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . ' Well , Victoria Regina , what 's the errand now ? " " Nothing , only thought I 'd tell you about that old Quaker man you like . " " Everybody likes . What about him ? " " He 's gone away . Ma says he wo n't never live to come back again . " " Victoria  --  Jones , what are you saying ? " " That Mr. Quaker Burn , up Clove way , had been took to Ne ' York . " " I guess you 're mistaken . We would have heard about it if it were so . Now , if you please , though , I should like Master Gladstone to be ' took ' home . If you 'll hold his other hand we 'll get him there the quicker . " " I guess I 'll go up and set a spell ; you take him , " remarked Victoria , and turned to ascend the slope . Amy sighed : " Something must be done to stop this ! " Then she lifted her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and across which lay the Jones 's cottage . A wagon was driving leisurely along this highway , and it had a most familiar appearance . A moment 's watching showed it to belong to the Clove Farm , and it was Adam Burn 's " hired man " who was driving in it . Her heart sank . What if Victoria had spoken the truth ? So she hurried her young charge to his home , and waiting only to have her pail filled with the milk , ran back to intercept the approaching vehicle . " Good morning , Israel . How 's dear old Adam ? " " Only the Lord knows . Sarah Jane 's got him . " " She has n't ! Do n't tell me ! " " But she has , though . " " Where ? " " York . " " When ? " " Yesterday . " " Why ? " " Same old story . If she had n't gone to Europe , she 'd had him last year . I knew how ' t would be when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the letters . She 's the powerfulest hand to do her duty that ever was . Everything else has to give way . " Amy 's hand trembled so that her milk began to trickle over the sides of her pail . " That 's what it meant , then , that dear , precious old fellow . He knew he was going to leave us , that First Day we spent at the farm . That was why his words in the meeting-house were so like a farewell . It is too bad ! It must have broken his heart . " " No , it did n't . He did n't want to go , not a mite ; but there was n't no heart-break , not in sight . If there was , he kept it hid . But he went all round the place , into every shed and building , pointing out things that should be done , and being most particular about the flowers and garden . He told me to take care of everything just as if he was coming back to-morrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Israel , you shall not say that ! He must come back ! " " Oh , he 'll come , of course , one way : that 's feet foremost . He 's a sight feebler ' n he ever let on , an ' this riotous livin ' at York , what with balls and parties and wine suppers , he wo n't last long . They 'll kill him out of hand amongst ' em . " " Oh , Israel , the idea of Adam Burn at ' balls and parties and wine suppers , ' when he 's so simple and sweet and abstemious . I do n't believe he ever tasted wine during all his pure , beautiful life . I 'm not worrying about that . It 's the leaving the things he loved will hurt him so . Why could n't Sarah Jane have left him in peace ? O dear ! O dear ! This will be a fresh sorrow for mother . " " So I suppose . For all of us , too . It 's going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boggs wo n't have so much to do . She wants to give up the job , an ' go live with our son , Jim . But Sarah Jane told us to stay , an ' so we 'll have to . " " Is this dreadful woman who 's spirited Adam away any kin to you ? " " Course not . But you need n't laugh . You do n't know that lady . She 's masterful , and she 's rich  --  ' rich as Croesus , '  --  and do n't know what to do with her money . When the old man was lookin ' around an ' chargin ' me ' bout things , she broke in with : ' Oh , do n't worry , father-in-law . The trumpery stuff is n't worth so much thought . I 'm not a relic hunter , and let it go , ' says she . Then he reminds her that he wanted it kept right for  --  Whew ! I near let the secret out , did n't I ? He told me he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't he ? Well , if you 'll carry the message for me , I wo n't climb ' Spite ' hill this morning . There 's a few things to fetch up in the open wagon , and I 'll see your folks about hauling that muck . Good-by . The spirit 's taken clean out of me . Twenty-five years me and him has lived together , and to part sudden like this . Twenty-five years by the clock , and a better man than him never trod the footstool . " With that Israel brought the mare around , and giving a mournful nod of his head drove dejectedly away . Amy flew up the hill . She paid little heed now to the spilling of the milk , for she began to realize in all its force the calamity which had befallen them ; and she burst into her mother 's sitting room flushed and indignant , demanding :  --  " What right had Sarah Jane to take him away ? " Mrs. Kaye 's heart sank . She understood what this hysterical question implied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though against its justice she could find nothing to say . " Every right , dear . She is his son 's widow . She is acting , no doubt , as she thinks her husband would wish . " " But he did n't want to go . " " She probably felt he was too old to live alone , without relatives . Indeed , I know that she would have taken him long ago , if she had been living in this country herself . As soon as she came home she has attended to her  --  her duty , as she sees it . As I suppose , anybody would see it , who was indifferent whether he went or stayed . I hope , though , that she 'll bring him back to Burnside in the spring . " " Do you know her , mother ? " " Not well . When we were both younger I used to see her sometimes . She was never very fond of Burnside , however . It was too quiet for her . She is a wealthy woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is at the head of many charitable associations , and she has always had wonderful executive ability . " " Does that mean being what Israel called ' masterful ' ? " " About the same thing . " " Will she be good to our dear Adam ? " " Certainly . She will see that he has every comfort possible . He will , doubtless , have a servant especially appointed to wait upon and care for him , and he will be made to share in all the enjoyments of the house . She believes that it is the duty of all to live actively in the world and do good aggressively , so to speak . But Adam is so old and feeble , he has passed his days in such simplicity , I can feel what a change for him it will be . Still , if he were to fall seriously ill , he would be better off at his daughter-in-law 's than here . Ah , yes . I suppose it is for the best  --  for him . For us  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without his gracious presence . He was my parents ' oldest , closest friend , as he has been mine . " Mrs. Kaye rose , folded up her mending , and left the room . " I must tell Cuthbert , " she remarked , as if to herself , and her face was very sad . When Amy found her brother and told him the news his comment was :  --  " That 's a bad business for us , girlie . " " Of course . Do n't you suppose I feel it ? " " As long as Adam Burn was near , mother would never have been allowed to really suffer for anything . I mean that he would have managed to keep an eye upon her and have helped us out , till we could help ourselves . Do you know where that letter is he gave you ? Have you read it ? I should think this might be that ' right time ' of which he spoke . " " The letter ? In my other dress pocket . I 'll get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pockets but in every other possible place , the letter could not be found ; and though Mrs. Kaye assured them that there was probably very little of importance in it , her children could not help imagining something quite to the contrary ; and to learn the unread message became the great desire of their hearts . " Well , in any case , we have what he said to you , Hal , about soul growth and that . " " Humph ! Such talk is all well enough , but how is it going to help when we reach our last dollar ? Did you ever think , Amy , seriously think how we are going to live ? Just where our actual bread and butter is to come from ? " " No . Why , no , not really . " " Then it 's high time you did . " CHAPTER XIII . AMY PAYS A BUSINESS CALL . At about the same moment , on a " Saturday-half " in November , Amy Kaye and Gwendolyn Jones left each her own home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope of " Bareacre " and paused for mutual greetings . " How do ? I was just going up to your house , " said Gwendolyn , turning her back to the wind that just then blew strongly . " Good afternoon . Were you ? And I was going to yours . " " My ! How cold it is . Winter 'll be here before we know it . Makes a body think about her clothes . That 's why I was coming . I thought , maybe , you 'd like to go shopping with me . " " You 're forgetting , I fancy , that I told you I never did that . I should n't know how to shop , nor scarcely what it means , " laughed Amy . " That 's what me and ma was saying . You seem such a little girl , yet ' Bony ' says you 're ' most as old as I am . " " But I do n't feel old , do you ? I wish I might never grow a day older , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my people . " " Wo n't you go , then ? " " Maybe , if you will do something for me , too . I 'm not on the road to buy anything , but to sell . I thought that you might know of somebody who would like a burro . Do you ? " " I 'd like one myself , first-rate , only I 'm saving for a wheel . I 'm buying it on the instalment plan . I pay a dollar a week , and after I get my winter things I 'll pay more . Do you ride ? " " Nothing so fine as a bicycle ; just either Pepita or Balaam . " " It 's awful hard to have to walk everywhere , and the good thing about a wheel is that it do n't have to eat . " " And the bad thing about a burro is that it does . " " Are you in earnest ? Do you want to sell it ? " " No ; I do n't want to at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know anybody who really might buy Pepit ? " " Guess I do . Guess the ' Supe ' would . " " The ' Supe '  --  Mr. Metcalf ? " " Yes ; I heard him say he 'd like to get such a pair of mules or donkeys , or whatever they are , for his children . He 's got a slew of them , and he gets ' em every conceivable thing . I would n't wonder if he did , if you was to ask him . " " Will he be at the mill to-day ? " " No ; he 's at his house , I guess . The mill 's shut up , only the watchman there . The ' Supe ' do n't hang around there himself so much since the new ' boss ' came . " " Maybe his house would be out of your way . If you 'll tell me how to find it , I can go by myself . I would n't like to give you trouble . " " Oh , ' twould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 'd be time enough afterward for Mis ' Hackett 's . She keeps open till near midnight , Saturdays . She gets lots of the mill trade , and she 'd like to have it all . But Wallburg 's far nicer . Do n't you love Wallburg ? " " I was never there except once , when father had a guest from town . Then mother sent for a carriage , and they took their friend to see the city . Hallam and I rode our burros , but we were very tired when it was over . Even then we passed through the residence streets only . " " Pshaw ! It 's where the stores are that I like . I always wish I was made of money when I 'm in a store . They do have such lovely things . " " Does n't your mother buy your clothes ? " " My mother ? My mother ? Well , I guess not . The idea ! If a girl earns her own money and pays for all she has , I guess she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " " Why  --  yes . I suppose she has a right , if her mother allows . But I should think it would be very trying to select one 's own things . I should be so afraid I would n't choose correctly , and not please her taste . " " My land ! What if you did n't ? It 's you that has to wear them , is n't it ? Have a piece of this gum . It 's a new sort . Mis ' Hackett keeps it and charges two cents a stick . Other kinds are only one cent , but this is prime . " Gwendolyn was kind-hearted . She was also very vain . She felt that it was a fine thing to be acquainted with " aristocratics " like the Kayes ; yet in her heart she was rather ashamed of Amy 's plain attire , the simplicity of which seemed to Gwendolyn a proof of Mrs. Kaye 's incapacity to " shop " ; and its being white  --  though of soft warm wool  --  of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any girl who could , would buy gum , and decided that her new acquaintance must be very poor indeed . " Take it . I can get plenty more . I earn real good wages now . " " Do you ? " asked Amy , so wistfully that the other was confirmed in her opinion of the poverty . " I should think you would like to work in the mill , would n't you ? If your folks have lost their money , it would seem real handy to have a little coming in . " " Yes , it would , indeed . But I could n't do it . " " Why not ? You 're strong enough , I guess , if you are n't so big . " " Yes , I 'm strong and well . But father has forbidden me to think of it . " " Pshaw ! He 'd come round . If you want to do it , I would ; and once you were settled he would n't care , or he could n't help himself , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 've heard that . " " Queer ? Yes ; just as queer as a splendid gentleman like him must always seem to common people , " flashed the daughter , all the more disturbed because she realized that there had been once , if not now , just a little truth in the suggestion . " Pshaw ! I did n't mean to make you mad . O ' course , I had n't ought to have spoke so about your own father . I s'pose I 'd be mad , too , if anybody said things about pa . They do , sometimes , or about ma , their naming us children by fancy names , as they did . You see , they 're English , pa and ma are , and so they named us after English aristocratics . Ma 's a master hand for reading novels , too , and she gets notions out of them . We take the Four Hundred Story Paper , and the Happy Evening Gazette . Do you take them ? " " No ; I never heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ai n't that queer ? Why , they 're splendid . They have five serial stories running all the time . As fast as one is finished another is commenced . Umm , they 're awful exciting . You ca n't hardly wait from week to week to get the new instalments . Trouble is , ma says , we 'd ought to each of us have a copy , we 're so crazy to get hold of it when it comes . Some of the girls take fashion papers , and we lend them ' round . Some lend , I mean . Some are stingy , and wo n't . They have patterns in them . You can get some of the patterns free , and some cost ten or fifteen cents . Say , how do you like my dress ? " Amy looked critically at her companion 's attire . She admired it far less than Gwendolyn had her own simple frock , and she found the question difficult to answer without giving offence . She compromised by saying :  --  " Your mother must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housework and the children . " " If you ai n't the greenest girl I know ! My mother could n't make a dress like this to save her life . " " O  --  oh ! " stammered Amy . " Indeed , she could n't . This was made by a dressmaker . The best one in Ardsley , too . She charged me five dollars , and ma said it was too much . I think it was , myself , but what can you do ? You must look right , you know ; if you do n't the girls will make fun of you , and the boys wo n't take you any place . Is there any boy you like , much ? " " Why , of course ; though I know only three . Is this the way , around the corner ? " " Three ? Who 're they ? " " Hallam , and Fayette , and William Gladstone . Does n't the mill village look cosy ? The cunning little houses with their porches and gardens and neat palings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , I think . " " Oh , they do ; prime . That 's the ' Supe 's ' house , that big one , upon that little hill . That whole row belongs to the different ' bosses , '  --  of the setting room , the weavers , and the rest . The ' Supe ' is real nice , I think , though some say he 's stuck up . He was a poor boy , once ,  --  as poor as a church mouse . Say , do n't you feel sort of afraid to call on him , after all ? " " Why ? No , indeed . Afraid ? Why should I ? " " Oh , because . " Amy laughed and hastened forward . Nothing more was said until they reached the door , shadowed by vines from which not even yet all the leaves had fallen . The whole place had a sheltered , homelike appearance , which spoke well for the taste and kindliness of its owners . " Yes ; Mr. Metcalf is in . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you ? Walk in . " Yet even Amy noticed that the maid 's manner in welcoming her companion was less cordial than in welcoming herself . She concluded that there might be some truth in the assertion of this family considering themselves rather better than their neighbors . They were ushered into a cheery sitting room , which seemed also a sort of library , for there were bookcases around the walls , and a table was spread with the current literature of the day . The room was small by comparison with those to which Amy had been accustomed , but what it lacked in size it made up for in comfort . A coal fire glowed on the hearth , a bird sang in its cage before the window , and about the floor were scattered the playthings that told that it was the resort of children . The girls were not kept waiting . Mr. Metcalf entered almost at once , nodded kindly to Gwendolyn , and cordially extended his hand to Amy . " I am very pleased to see you , Miss Amy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day . " " Thank you , but I 'm not cold , and I do n't wish to detain you . Gwendolyn tells me that it is your holiday , too , and that you go to Wallburg . " Mr. Metcalf glanced across at the other girl , who bridled and simpered as she adjusted her hat and settled her skirts . " She goes there herself , I fear , rather too much . Eh , Gwendolyn ? " " I go when I please , " answered the mill girl , pertly . She resented something in the tone of her superintendent , feeling that out of work hours he had no authority over her . " Oh , of course . By the way , there 's the stage just ready for the other end of the village . Do you see it , Miss Amy ? The shop mistress , Mrs. Hackett , sends one over every Saturday afternoon to carry our folks free to her place of business . She 's an enterprising person , but , unfortunately , as soon as she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up rival stages also . It 's very funny , sometimes , to see the respective drivers ' efforts to secure passengers , and therefore custom . " At the mention of stages , Gwendolyn rose and looked through the window . Then she turned toward Amy like a person in great haste . " Tell the ' Supe ' what you came for , Amy , so we can get a ride over ,  --  that is , if you want to go shopping with me after all . " But poor Amy could not reply just then . It had come over her with a rush what her errand really meant to her , and she was wholly indifferent to the charms of a stage or even " shopping . " " Do n't wait for me , please ,  --  that is , of course , I will keep my word , but  --  " " All right , then , some other day . I 'll be up to see how you made out , and if Mr. Metcalf do n't want it maybe I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good day , sir , " and off she tore , banging the door and shouting loudly to the driver of Mrs. Hackett 's stage . Mr. Metcalf watched her in silence till she had climbed the steps at the rear of the omnibus , and then he remarked :  --  " That girl has so much sense that she ought to have more . " " That 's a doubtful compliment , is n't it ? " asked Amy , smiling . " I suppose so , though it 's quite true . She is warmhearted , generous to a fault , and as silly as they make them . However , she has given me the pleasure of seeing you to-day , and I hope that you will tell me how I can be of use to you . From Gwendolyn 's words I judge that you came upon some special errand . " " Yes ; I came to ask if you would like to buy my white burro . " " Ah , you are tired of her ? I mean you wish to sell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' again ? " " No , she has been very , very good , and I do n't at all wish to part with her ; but I want some money very badly , and that is the only thing  --  the only way I could get it . " " I am very glad you came to me . Ever since I made Miss Pepita 's acquaintance , that day at the mill , I 've wished I could find another like her for my little Nanette . How much do you ask for the burro ? " " I do n't ask anything . That is , I do n't know how much she is worth . " " I think you told me that she was a gift to you ? " " Yes , from my uncle in California . " " Hmm , I 've heard of him , " commented the gentleman , briefly . " Now , I am almost as much in the dark in regard to the value of such animals as you are , but , at a rough estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make inquiries , and if I find I have named too small a price , I will add the balance . Is that satisfactory ? " " Oh , yes , indeed . Thank you . I  --  I shall be glad to have Pepita in such a nice place . " At home Amy had spoken to none save Cleena about this intention of hers , and that good creature had sighed and wiped her eyes , but had not uttered one word of protest . The girl sighed , too , now , and the superintendent felt it would be kind to cut the matter short . " When can I send for her ? " " Oh , at  --  at any time , I suppose . Or , if you do n't mind , I 'd like to ride her here myself . Just once more . " Mr. Metcalf looked at his watch . " In a few moments John will be passing by Bareacre on his way to the other village . You might drive up with him and ride her down here afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must tell your people not to be anxious , should there be any delay . " " Very well ; and maybe Hallam , my brother , will come , also . Though he has n't been told yet , and might not  --  " " Very well . Excuse me for a moment . I will speak to John . " He did not add , nor Amy reflect , that it was a very long and roundabout way to reach " the other village , " by passing over rough and steep Bareacre hill ; but John was willing enough to take it , when he was told who was to be his companion on the route . He had liked Amy from the first , and had grown to know her fairly well during his time of helping the Kaye household to settle . " All right , boss . Sorry the little thing is to give up her donkey . She set a powerful store by it , I ' low . Well , all ready ? How do , Miss Amy ? So me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? Then I can find out for myself how the well is doing . Do n't see much of ' Bony ' since your folks took him in hand . Giddap , there , Jinny ! Here we go ! " To pass the time agreeably John talked of everything which he imagined might be of interest to the silent girl beside him , but he elicited few replies , and had the stream of his words flow , for once , without interruption . Yet it seemed a very , very slow ride to Amy , and when it came to an end , she scarcely waited to thank John for his " lift " before she sped to the shed where Pepita was tied , and shutting the door behind her , threw her arms around the neck of the gentle beast , to cry as freely as she pleased . " Bray ! Br-a-ay ! Ah-umph ! Ah-u-umph ! " inquired the burro , turning her head around as far as she could by reason of Amy 's embrace . " Oh , you darling , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't look at me as if you thought I had no heart . Do you think I do n't love you , that I will sell you , Pepit ' ? But  --  it must be . It must be . Better you than Balaam , and even he  --  " " Ah-umph ! A-ah-umph ! Br-r-r-ay ! Bray-bray-bray ! B-r-a-y-a-u-m-p-h ! ! " protested Balaam , with great haste and emphasis ; and this sound was an added pang in the heart of the unhappy Amy , who felt that she was not only breaking her own heart by this separation , but the hearts of this four-footed pair as well . Then she heard a sound along the frozen ground , and instantly she lifted her head , pulled her Tam over her eyes to hide the traces of tears , and called out , gayly :  --  " Is that you , Hal dear ? What do you think ? You and I are to ride down to Mr. Metcalf 's , right away now . Is Fayette in the house ? I want him to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as he says . Halloo to him , for me , please . " But instead of that the brother hobbled into the shed and asked :  --  " Why should we go there ? I do n't want to . I 've no fondness for paying visits . " " But you must go this time , Hal . You really , really must . I 'll tell you why , by and by . " CHAPTER XIV . PEPITA FINDS A NEW HOME . When the cripple firmly declined the visit , Cleena found some errand for Fayette to do at the " general store " in the mill village . Hallam thought it a little queer that he was not greatly urged in the matter , and that Cleena should ask him to let Fayette ride Balaam . " For you know , Goodsoul , how I hate to have anybody ride him , except myself . Not even Amy is really welcome , though she does sometimes . I do n't see why she goes , anyway . What have we to do with any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were a daughter , I 'd stay at home . " Cleena wheeled about from scrubbing the kitchen table and retorted , impatiently :  --  " Do n't you go throwing blame on Miss Amy , lad . Arrah musha ! but she 's the more sense of the lot of us , so she has , bless her bonny heart . An ' that sunbright an ' cheerful , no matter  --  " " She 's not very cheerful this afternoon , Cleena . I believe she 'd been crying , just now , when I found her in the shed . I fancy she 'll find a ride anything but funny , on such a day as this . I like the warm fire better than the road in such weather . " " Get back to it then , child . There 's your book yon , on the settle . Wait . Carry in a bowl of porridge to the mistress , an you can ? Heigh ! Move them crutches easy now , an ' not spill the stuff all over me nice floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her deft-handed " child , " who could do so many helpful things , even though a cripple , and she watched him cross the wide room , swinging easily along on his " other feet , " yet holding the bowl of steaming liquid upright and safely . Then she sighed , and going to the door called :  --  " Me Gineral Bonaparty , come by ! " Fayette was digging , even though the ground was frozen , and it would be months before anything could grow again . But the simple fellow was a " natural farmer , " and it was his intention to " let her lie fallow this winter . Next summer I 'll show you a garden 'll make your eyes bung out . I 'm the best gard'ner anywhere 's round , I am . " He now replied :  --  " What fer ? I want to get this side gone over , this afternoon . Then come Monday I 'm goin ' to get some trees down brook way , an ' get John to haul ' em up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy  --  " " Faith , what else 'll you ' get ' with your ' get ' an ' ' get , ' I 'd know . Come by , I tell ye , to wonst . " When Cleena spoke in that tone , it was noticeable that Fayette always obeyed . He now threw down his spade , though reluctantly , and sauntered to the kitchen door . " A woman hai n't got no sense nohow , stopping a man from his work . " " An ' all the sense a man body has , me fathers , is to keep a woman standin ' in her doorway . I 'm wantin ' ye to go to the store down below . Master Hallam 's for lettin ' ye ride Balaam . Off with ye , now , an ' clean the beast 's coat , sayin ' nothin ' of Miss Amy 's own little white . Will she ride with ye ? What for no ? Proud you be , says I , to be escortin ' of the like o ' her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was to possess Balaam for himself ; failing this , to have the privilege of using the pretty creature occasionally . " How happened it ? How does she want to go there in such a wind ? Blows the hair right off your head , I ' low . I 'd ruther go alone , I would . " " ' Ruthers ' is all froze up . Haste along with ye now , an ' be off . Mind ye talk pretty to my colleen , ' cause  --  No matter . " Fayette made swift work of the grooming , and only a few moments later Amy and he rode out of the enclosure . As she descended the slope , the girl turned and waved her hand cheerfully to Cleena , then set her face toward the valley and relapsed into silence . Fayette endured this as long as he could , for though he rarely needed anybody else to speak , this afternoon he was annoyed by his companion 's preoccupation . " What 's the matter , Amy ? You ai n't said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and we 're almost there , already . Well , I was thinking . That 's all . I 'll try to do better on the way home . " " Feelin ' bad about your ma ? Land , she 'll get well . All she wants is a bit o ' boneset tea , or sage an ' sassafras . I 'll go yarb hunting to-morrow , if I get my garden ploughed . Cleena 'll stew it . Say , have you heard my new one ? Hark to this . " He pulled from his pocket a small jewsharp and began to " play " upon it in the most nerve-rasping manner . " Oh , Fayette , another ? Why , you must have a half-dozen already . I come upon them everywhere about the house , in the rooms where you are . " " Ai n't got none now but this . I bought it to Mis ' Hackett 's . Cleena 's took my others . Got ' em all in her kitchen draw ' . ' Low she 'll get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need . You 'll have it out to show her how talented you are , and then  --  away goes your pride , your jewsharp , and all . " " Hmm , she better try . I 'll teach her a lesson some day she ai n't goin ' to ferget . That woman bosses me too much . I ai n't a-goin ' to stand it . You 'll see . I 'll clear out an ' leave the whole kerboodle first you know . Sho ! Here we be . " " Indeed . Well , I 'm sorry to have reached the place so soon , though it is pretty cold . " " You go in and see the ' Supe 's ' folks . I 'll ride along an ' do my arrants . Cleena 'd ruther trust me than you , would n't she ? I 'm a master hand for a trade , an ' she knows it . Say , I do wish he 'd sell me Balaam . " " You must drop that subject , really , Fayette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not be to you . " The simple lad 's fierce temper rose in full force at Amy 's blunt words . " Like to know why not ? Ai n't my money as good as anybody 's ? Ai n't I ' stuck up ' enough to suit ? He never rode in a parade , he did n't . Told me so himself . " " Nor do I think he ever will , and , of course , one person 's money is as good as another 's , excepting that we could never trust how long you would be kind to dear old Balaam . Hal would take much less to have the creature well treated than  --  I mean  --  Oh , do n't get so angry ; it 's not worth while . " The more she tried to smooth matters over , the more indignant the other became . His harp was still between such discolored teeth as Pepita 's former assault had left him , and added to the grotesqueness of his appearance as he glared upon Amy . To finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just tie him there , at that second post , please , and you 'd best put his blanket on him . " " Tie him ? I 'm goin ' to ride him to the village to let the boys see him an ' try him . I promised I would . Tie him ! I sha n't neither ! " " You certainly will not ride him to wherever those dreadful boys are . Nobody shall touch him , except you or me , and you ought not . " Fayette gave her one more angry glance , leaped from his saddle with a jerk , and bestowed upon the unoffending burro a vicious kick . Then he disappeared down the street , and Amy tied Pepita in haste , that she might look after the other animal also . Just then she heard a step upon the path behind her , and the superintendent 's pleasant voice , saying :  --  " Well , young lady , you are certainly prompt , and promptness is a cardinal virtue  --  from a business man 's point of view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are giving up your pet . " " Ah , indeed . " Amy smiled upon the child , who might have been ten years of age , and the fragile little creature appeared to smile in return . Then it came over the visitor that there was something out of common in that uplifted , happy face , and that the smile was not in response to her own greeting . The wide blue eyes looked upward , truly , but with the blank stare of one who sees nothing . " Ah , is it so ? " cried Amy , a second time , watching with what hesitation the little girl moved along the path , and how persistently she clung to her father 's hand . " Yes , blind ; quite blind  --  from her birth , " said Mr. Metcalf , sadly . Amy was on her knees in a moment , clasping the child 's slight body in her arms and saying :  --  " Then I 'm glad , glad that you are to have Pepita . She is the dearest , nicest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry you wherever you want to go ,  --  that is , if she is willing . You dear little girl , she shall be yours , without that money either . I never knew about you before , or you should have had her before , too . " Illustration : " ' THEN I 'M GLAD , GLAD THAT YOU ARE TO HAVE PEPITA . ' " Mr. Metcalf smiled , well pleased . His blind daughter was the idol of his flock , and anybody who was attracted by her became interesting to him . Amy had been so , even before this incident , but he liked her heartily now . " So , Miss Amy , though you hated to part with your burro for money , you would do so willingly for love and sympathy ? " " Why , of course . If I 'd only known  --  " " You will not make a good business woman , at this rate . But this wind is sharp . I must n't keep Nanette out here long , else her mother will worry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know more about donkeys than I do , that you give my girl her first riding lesson . Reach Miss Amy your hand , dear heart . " Amy caught the little white-mittened fingers in her own and kissed them impulsively . Then she rose and placed the child on Pepita 's saddle . " Take hold of the bridle , so , in both hands , now , till you learn how . I 'll keep my arm about you . No , dear , you can not fall . I would n't let you , even if Pepita would , and she 's in a gentle mood to-day . Are n't you , Pepit ' ? " " Br-a-ay ! Ah-ump ! " responded the burro . She did not always have her replies so ready , and , for an instant , it seemed as if she would frighten her new mistress . But there was always something absurdly amusing in Pepita 's tones , and after the first shock of hearing them had passed , Nanette burst into a merry laugh that made the others laugh too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does she always answer so quick ? " " No , indeed . Sometimes the naughty little beast will not say a single bray . She has many moods , has Pepit ' . You 'll find them all out , though , after a while . Now , how do you like it ? Is n't the motion soft and gentle ? " " Oh , if mamma could see ! " cried the happy little girl , turning her sunny face toward Amy . Then she suddenly pulled off her mittens and drew her new friend 's head down so that she could feel the unfamiliar features . Swiftly , lightly , the tiny finger-tips passed over every one , then travelled upward and lost themselves in the close rings of hair under the scarlet Tarn . " Now , I 'll know you forever . What color is your hair ? What is your hood , or bonnet ? " " My hair is very dark brown , or almost black , I think . My Tarn is red . But do you know colors ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that maybe that is not the same as they are in the truly world , but I do n't care . They are pretty and suit me , my blind colors do . I like you . I like you very much . I think you are lovely , lovely to give me your don-key  --  " " But I did n't . That is , I will , since I know about you ; but I asked your father to buy her first . I would n't  --  " " Oh , never mind . It 's all the same , is n't it ? It would be in my blind world . She was yours and now she is mine , and you 're lovely . Oh , I wish mamma could see ! " " Why , ca n't she , dear ? Is she  --  " " No , " interrupted the superintendent , smiling . " No , she is n't blind . The only body in our household who is able to see beautiful things with her eyes shut is Nanette , here ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a new baby in her room just now , so she has n't time or strength to get up and look out of window at new burros . She thinks the new babies are the nicer of the two sorts . Eh , Nan , child ? " " I suppose she does , but I do n't . Pooh ! there have been three new baby sisters that I can remember , and once I was a new baby sister myself , to my brothers . They 're so common , you know ; but I do n't think of any girl anywhere , except you , and now me , that has had a new snow-white donkey . Do you ? " " No , I do not , " laughed Amy . Mr. Metcalf invited Amy into the house , while he led the burro around to the little stable in the rear , which was to be Pepita 's new home . Amy would have liked to throw her arms about the hairy white neck , but pride forbade , and so the parting was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eager for shelter , and her late mistress to hear what the blind child was saying . " It 's right this way into the sitting room . I love the sitting room best . That 's where papa has his books and papers , and it smells like him . He smokes , you know , but only in this room or out of doors . Oh , do help me think ! Mamma , dear heart , says I am to name this last little new baby . Just fancy it ! I , myself ! And it bothers me terrifically . I would want a nice long name , the longest that 's in the books ; but papa says that there are so many little folks who like us and come to live with us , that we must n't spend time on long names . Oh , I 've just thought ! I 'll name her ' Amy . ' That 's short , is n't it ? Could a body nickname it ? We do n't like nicknames here . I 'm the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the baby last before this one came , mamma named her Abby after Grandmother Abigail . Then she thought we could n't ever stop to say Ab-i-ga-il , so she shortened it to Abby . Next thing , listen . Abby was crying one day and Rex heard her , and grandmother asked , ' What 's that ? ' ' cause she 's deaf and does n't hear straight , and Rex said , ' Oh , that 's nothing but little Ab ! ' She was just three days old then , and mamma thought if her name got cut in two so quick as that , she would n't have any at all in a week or two longer . So she 's just Ruth now ; and when the boys say ' Ruth-y , ' papa makes them put a nickel in the box . Do you have a nickel box on your bookcase ? " " No , indeed . Tell me about it . I 've never heard of such a thing . " " Why , it 's this way . Feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as if she could see perfectly , Nanette guided Amy to the further side of the room , where stood a pretty , polished box upon the bookshelf . The box had a slit in its cover , and it jingled merrily in the blind child 's hand . " Hear ! We must have been pretty bad this month . But that makes it all the better for the little ' fresh airers , ' does n't it ? Sometimes , when I think about them , I just want to do things  --  not nice things  --  all the time , so as to make more money for them . But of course it would n't be honorable , and I would n't do it . " " Do you put the nickels in when you are ' naughty ' ? " " Yes , for crossness and unpolite words and messing at table and  --  lots of things . Once  --  " Nanette paused and turned her eyes toward Amy for a long time . Then she again passed those delicate finger-tips over the other 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust you . Once one of us , I could n't tell you which one , but one of us told a wrong story , a falsehood , an untruth . One of the dreadful things that made our dear Lord kill Ananias and Sapphira dead . Was n't that awful ? Mamma and papa did n't know what to do . A nickel did n't seem much pay for a lie , did it ? So they made it a dollar . Yes , ma'am , one whole dollar . That 's twenty nickels . Oh , it was so unhappy those days ! I was gladder than ever that I was blind . I think I should have died to see the bad face of the one that did it while it was bad . But mamma says such a lesson is never , never forgotten . You see , we have n't any right to be bad , have we ? " " I suppose not , dear . What a wise little thinker you are ! " " Papa says I think too much . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me the burro . He hopes it will stop me some . But in a home a body must remember it is n't his home nor her home , but the home of everybody that belongs . If I should be naughty , it would throw things all out of  --  of smoothness , do n't you know . I ca n't be naughty all by myself . If I could  --  no , I would n't like it either . When I 'm selfish or bad , I always feel as if I had on a dirty apron , and I do just hate dirty clothes ! " " And you do just love to talk , little one , " cried the superintendent , coming in and catching up his daughter in his strong arms . " We tell her , Miss Amy , that she makes up for what she does n't see by what she does say . Eh , midget ? " Nanette cuddled her fair head against her father 's beard , and turned her eyes toward Amy . It seemed impossible to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested , and the tears of sympathy rose to Amy 's own as she tried to comprehend this . " Is n't he a dear , funny papa ? But you just wait until you see my mother . She 's the nicest thing in this whole world . Oh , papa , shall I call the baby ' Amy ' ? " " If you like , darling . It 's a pleasant , old-fashioned name . " " I 'll tell you a better one , though it 's longer . That is ' Salome . ' " " Who 's she ? " asked Nanette . " My mother . As you feel about yours , I think she is the sweetest thing in this whole world . " " Sa-lo-me , Sa-lo-me , " repeated the child , slowly . " That is pretty . What do you say about that , papa ? " " As you and mother please , darling . It is a good name . But now , dear , run away . I have to talk business with this new friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I do talk , do n't I ? I love to talk . Good-by , Amy . Please come again to see me , and every time you must ride on Peppy  --  what is her name ? " " Pe-pi-ta . It is Spanish and very pretty , I think . " " Pay-pee-tah , " repeated Nanette , imitating the sound and ignorant of the spelling . " Now , Miss Amy , I 've had your saddle put upon your brother 's burro . You can ride him home , and I will have ' Bony ' carry the other saddle . To-morrow he shall bring the girl 's saddle back to Nanette , and I echo her invitation that you should come often to visit us and ride upon your own , old favorite . Here is the envelope with the money , and since you must go at all , I 'll urge you to go at once . There is another squall coming , and it will darken early . " As she rode homeward a doctor 's phaeton passed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered out at her from beneath the hood . Then it stopped and waited for her to approach . " Do you belong at the ' Spite House ' ? " " Yes ; why ? " " Make haste . Drive on . " CHAPTER XV . FACING HARD FACTS . " Make haste . Drive on . " The words sang themselves into Amy 's brain as she urged Balaam up the slope , and for days thereafter they returned to her , the last vivid memory of that happy time before bereavement came . Then followed a season of confusion and distress ; and now that a fortnight was over she sat beside a freshly made mound in Quaker burying-ground , trying to collect her thoughts and to form a definite plan for her future . The end of a gentle , beneficent life had come with merciful suddenness , and the face of Salome Kaye was now hidden beneath this mound where her child sat , struggling with her grief , and bravely endeavoring to find the right way out of many difficulties . Finally , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air of grave decision and kneeling for one moment in that quiet spot , rose again , and passed swiftly from the place . Hallam was at the cemetery gate , resting sadly against the lichen-covered stone post , and waiting for her return . Indian summer had come , a last taste of warmth and brightness before the winter closed , and despite their sorrow nature soothed them with her loveliness . In any case , whether from that cause or from her own will , the girl found it easier than she had expected to speak with her brother upon their material affairs . " Shall we stop here a little while , Hal dear , to talk , or will we go on slowly toward home ? I 've been thinking , up  --  up there beside mother , and I 've found a way , I hope . " " I do n't care where , though I 'd rather not talk . What good does it do ? I hate it . I hate home . I hate this place worse  --  Oh , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have to leave Fairacres ! She might be  --  " Amy 's hand went up to Hallam 's lips . " Hush ! Do you suppose God blunders ? I do n't . If He had meant her to stay with us , He would have found a way to cure her . To think otherwise is torture . No . No , no , indeed no ! Father is left and so are we . We have got to live and take care of him and of ourselves . " " I should like to know how . I  --  a miserable good-for-naught , and you  --  a girl . " " Exactly , thank you , just a girl . But a girl who loves her brother and her father all the more because  --  she loved them too . A girl who has made up her mind to do the first thing and everything that offers , which will help to make them comfortable ; who is going to put her family pride in her pocket and go to work . There , it 's out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy  --  Kaye ! " " Yes , indeed . Do n't take it so hard , dear . " In spite of himself he smiled . Then he remembered . " I do n't see how you can laugh or jest  --  so soon . As if  --  but you must care . " " Just because I do care , so very , very much . Oh , Hal , do n't dream I 'm not missing her every hour of the day . I fancy I hear her saying now , this moment , as she used to say when I 'd been naughty and was penitent : ' If thee loves me so much , dear , thee will try to do the things I like . ' The one thing she liked , she lived , was a brave helpfulness toward everybody she knew . She did n't wait for great things , she did little things . Now , the first little things that are facing us are : the earning of our rent and of our food . " Hallam said nothing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and groaned . " I 'm going to work in the mill , " she continued . " Amy ! Father expressly forbade that , or even any mention of it . You , a Kaye ! " " He has given me permission , even though I am a Kaye . " She tried to smile still , but found it hard in the face of his want of sympathy , even indignation . " Do you think he knew what he was saying when he did it ? " " Yes , Hallam , I do . It seems to me that father is more like other folks since this trouble came than he was before . I was worried and asked the doctor , for I remembered mother always used to spare him everything painful or difficult that she could . The doctor said :  --  " ' It may be that this blow will do more to restore him than all her tender care could do . ' " And then I asked him something else . It was  --  what was the matter with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' No , indeed . It 's his head . ' He was in a great fire , at a hotel where he was staying , a long time ago . He was nearly killed , and many other people were killed . For a while he thought that mother had been burned , they had gotten separated some way , and it made him  --  insane , I suppose . But when she was found , in a hospital where he was taken , he got better . He is n't at all insane now , the doctor says , but is only a little confused . Mother never had us told about it , because she wanted we should think our father just perfect , and for that reason she drew him into this quiet life that we always have lived . If he wanted to spend money foolishly , she never objected . She hoped that by not opposing any wish he would get wholly well . Part of this Cleena has told me , for she thought we ought to know , now , and part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be grand , grand , to take care of him as nearly like she did as we can . Do n't you ? " Hallam 's eyes sparkled . " Amy , I always said she was the most beautiful woman in the world , in character as well as person . " " To us , she certainly was . My plan is this : I will go to Mr. Metcalf and ask him to give me a place in the mill . If those other girls can work , so can I. " " Do you know who owns the mills now ? " " Yes ; our cousin Archibald Wingate . " " And you would work for him ? You would demean yourself to that ? Yet you know how , when he offered us money last week , or to do other things for us , both father and I indignantly declined . " " Yes , I know . I , too , was glad we did n't have to take it , though I do not believe he is as bad as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but if we could from the other , he might not seem so hard-hearted . He said he was sorry . He seemed to feel very badly . " " Yes , and when he came and asked Cleena to let him see  --  her , just once more , she gave him a reproof that must have struck home . She told him he was practically the cause of mother 's death ,  --  his driving her from Fairacres ,  --  and I shall always feel so , too . " " I hope not , dear . " " Well , I hate him . I hope I can sometime make him suffer all he has made us . " " But , Hal , that is vindictive . To be vindictive is not half as noble as to be just . Mother was just . While it grieved her to leave her home , she fully appreciated how much he must long for it . It was their grandmother 's , you know , and he felt he had a right there . I do not blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's such a lonely old fellow , it seems to me . " " Humph ! I would n't work for him and take his money . I should feel as if it were tainted . " For a moment Amy was staggered by this view of her brother 's . Then it dropped into its proper place in the argument , and she went on :  --  " It would be pleasanter to work for somebody else . But there is nobody else . I think Mr. Wingate has very little to do with the employees of the mill . It 's Mr. Metcalf who pays them , and he 's a dear , good friend already . I 'm going to see him this afternoon . I asked Gwendolyn to tell him I was coming , but I suppose he thinks it is about selling Balaam . He 's ready to take him off your hands if you want to part with him . That seventy-five dollars he paid for Pepita and the saddle and harness was such a blessing . It carried us through ; we could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wingate help . " " Never ! Well , I suppose he 'll have to take him . If I ca n't work , I can give up , as well as you . " " No , Hal , I do n't want to sell him yet . Wait till the last thing and we ca n't help it . Do try to think kindly of what I 'm doing , dear . Down in my heart I 'm pretty proud , too . But you start home . I 'll take a bit of lunch and then start out to seek my fortune . Wish me luck , laddie ; or , rather , bid me God-speed . " She lifted her face for his kiss , and he gave it heartily . It was to the sensitive , proud , undisciplined boy the very hardest moment of his life , save and apart from his bereavement . " To think , Amy , little sister , that I , who should be your protector and supporter , am just  --  this ! " " Hush ! you shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they are very good legs , indeed . There 's nothing the matter with them except that they wo n't move . They 've been indulged so long  --  " " Amy , I do n't understand you . First you seem so cheerful ; then you make light of my lameness . Are you forgetful , or what ? " " Not forgetful , nor hard-hearted . Just ' what , ' which means that I believe you could learn to walk if you would . " " Amy ! Amy ! ! " " Hallam ! " " Do you suppose I would n't if I could ? " " Hal , do you ever try ? " He looked at her indignantly ; then he reflected that , in fact , he never did try . But to convince her he made an effort that instant . Tossing his crutches to the ground , he tried to force his limbs forward over the ground . They utterly failed to respond to his will , and he would have fallen had not Amy 's arms caught and supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first attempt it was fine . Bravo ! Encore ! " Yet she picked up his " other legs " and gave him , then led Balaam away from the late thistle blooms he was browsing . Hallam mounted , crossed his crutches before him , and lifted his cap . Amy tossed him a kiss and turned millward , while he ascended the hill road . But no sooner was she out of sight than her assumed cheerfulness gave way , and for a time it was a sad-faced girl who trudged diligently onward toward duty and a life of toil . Gwendolyn had delivered her message , and the superintendent welcomed Amy to his office at the mill with a friendly nod and smile ; but , at that moment , he was deep in business with a strange gentleman , negotiating for a large sale of carpets , and after his brief greeting he apparently forgot the girl . She remained standing for some moments , then Mr. Metcalf beckoned an attendant to give her a chair and the day 's newspaper . Her heart sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person from the friend she had met in his own home . Her throat choked . She felt that she should cry , if she did not make some desperate effort to the contrary ; so she began to read the paper diligently , though her mind scarcely followed the words she saw , and would deflect to those she heard , which were very earnest , indeed , though all about a matter no greater than one-eighth cent per yard . " How queer ! Two great grown men to stand there and argue about such a trifle . Why , there is n't any such coin , and what does it mean ? Well , I 'm eavesdropping , and that 's wrong . Now I will read . I will not listen . " Running in this wise , her thoughts at last fixed themselves upon a paragraph which she had perused several times without comprehending . Now it began to have a meaning for her , and one so intense that she half rose to beg the loan of the newspaper that she might show it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard those doctors talking about in mother 's room . I 'll ask for it , or copy it , if I can , and show my boy . Who knows what it might do ? " There was a little movement in the office . The gentleman in the big top-coat , with his eyeglasses , his gold-handled umbrella , and his consequential air , was leaving . He was bowing in a patronizing sort of way , and Mr. Metcalf was bowing also , smiling almost obsequious . He was rubbing his hair upward from his forehead , in a way Amy had already observed to be habitual when he was pleased . Evidently he was pleased now , and greatly so , for even after the stranger had passed out and entered the cab in waiting , the superintendent remained before the glass door , still smiling with profound satisfaction . Then , as if he had suddenly remembered her , he turned toward Amy . " Well , miss , what can I do for you to-day ? I saw you were interested in our argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to tell you I won . Yes , I carried my point . " The girl was disgusted . Though she liked to know her friends from every side of their characters , she was not pleased by this glimpse of Mr. Metcalf 's . He saw her feeling in her face and took it merrily , dropping at last into the manner which she knew and liked best . " A small business , you 're thinking , eh ? Well , Miss Amy , let me tell you that on this one deal , this one sale , my gaining that fraction of a cent means the gaining to my employer of several thousand dollars . And that is worth contesting , do n't you think ? " " It does n't seem possible . Just that tiny eighth ! Why , how many , many yards you must sell ! " " Indeed , yes . The mills are constantly turning out great quantities and , fortunately , the market is free . We dispose of them as fast as we can finish . We could sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what has brought you here , I fancy . Tell me your errand , please . I have much to get through with before closing . " The return to his business manner again chilled Amy 's enthusiasm , but she thought of her father and what she hoped to do for him , and needed no other aid to her courage . " I 've come to ask a place in the mill . I want to work and get paid . " " Certainly . If you work , you will be paid . What makes you want to do it ? Does your father know ? " " He has consented . I think he understands , though he did n't seem to care greatly , either way . I must do it , sir , or something . It was the only thing I knew about . " " You know nothing about that , really . The girls here are from an altogether different class than that to which you belong . You would not find it pleasant . " " That would n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Theoretically . How much do you suppose you could earn ? " " I do n't know . Whatever my work was worth . " " That , at the beginning , would be not more than two dollars a week , and probably less . It would be fatiguing , constant standing in attending to your ' jenny . ' I really think that you would better abandon the idea at once . Try to think of something nearer what you have known . " Yet he saw the deepening distress in her face and it grieved him . He was bound , in all honesty to her , to set the dark side of things before her , and he waited for her decision with some curiosity . " If you 'll let me try , I would like to do so . " CHAPTER XVI . AMY BEGINS TO SPIN . " Well , deary , it 's time . Oh , me fathers , to think it ! Wake up , Amy , me colleen , me own precious lamb . " Six o'clock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin any undertaking . Amy turned in her comfortable bed , rubbed her eyes , saw Cleena standing near with a lighted candle in her hand , and inquired , drowsily :  --  " Why  --  what 's happened ? Why will you get up in the middle of the night ? Do n't bother me  --  yet . " " Faith , an ' I wo n't . Upon honor it 's wrong , it 's all wrong . What 'll your guardian angel think of old Cleena to be leavin ' you do it ! Body an ' bones , I 'll do naught to further the business  --  not I ! " The woman 's voice was tremulous with indignation or grief , and all at once Amy remembered . Then she sprang from her cosy nest , wide-awake and full of courage . " Hush , dear old Goodsoul , I forgot . I forgot , entirely . I was dreaming of Fairacres . It was a beautiful dream . The old house was full of little children and young girls . They were singing and laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't real ; but , I 'm all right now . I 'll be down stairs in a few minutes . Do n't wake anybody else , for there 's no need . Is it six o'clock already ? It might be midnight or  --  any time . Why , what 's this ? " " A frock I 've made for you , child . " " You made a frock for me ? Why , Cleena ! " " Sure , it 's not so handy with the needle as the broom me fingers is . But what for no ? Them pretty white ones will never do for the nasty old mill . This did n't need so much . The body 'll about fit , thinks I , if I sew it fast in the front an ' split it behind . The skirt 's not so very long . She was a mite of a woman , God rest her . Well , I 'll go an ' see the milk does n't boil over , an ' be back in a jiffy to fasten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a spirit 's brave like your own will be prospered , I know . " Then Cleena went hurriedly out of the room . The frock which she had prepared for Amy 's use in the mill was remodelled from an old one of her mistress 's . As has been said , Amy had never worn any sort of dress except white . The fabric was changed to suit the season , but the color was not . Even her warm winter cloak was of heavy white wool , faced here and there with scarlet , to match the simple scarlet headgear that suited her dark face so well . Quite against the habits of her own upbringing , Mrs. Kaye had clothed her daughter to please the taste of her artist husband , and therefore it had not greatly mattered that this taste dictated a style more fanciful than useful . Now everything was altered , and Cleena had consulted Mrs. Jones with the result just given . But from a true delicacy , the faithful old servant did not stay to watch the girl as she adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she need not have been afraid . For a moment Amy held the gray dress in her hand , feeling it almost a sacrilege to put it on . She remembered it as the morning gown of her mother , plain to the extreme , yet graceful and precious in her sight because of the dear wearer . Then she lifted the garment to her lips , and touched it lightly . " Mother , darling , it is a good beginning . It seems to me it is like a sister of mercy putting on her habit for the first time . It is a protection and a benediction . If I can only put on my mother 's beautiful character with her clothing , I shall do well , indeed . " Then she examined the alterations which Cleena had been instructed by the cottager to make , and was able to smile at them . " The new sewing and the old do not match very well , but it will answer , and it does fit me much better than I would have thought . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly so , as she was . Well , no time for thinking back now . It 's all looking forward , and must be , if I am to keep my courage . " Then she knelt beside her bed , prayed simply and in full faith for success in her efforts to provide for her beloved ones , and went below , smiling and gay . " Think of it , Cleena Keegan . This is Monday morning . On seventh day I expect to bring back two splendid dollars and put into your hands . I , just I , your own little Amy . Think of the oatmeal it will buy . " It was not in Cleena 's heart to dampen this ardor by remarking how small a sum two dollars really was , considered in the light of a family support ; and , after all , oatmeal was cheap . Fortunately , it also formed the principal diet of this plainly nurtured household , and even that very breakfast to which the young breadwinner now sat down . But the meal was exquisitely cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , there lay , neatly wrapped in a spotless napkin , the mid-day luncheon , which Cleena had been told to prepare , and which Mrs. Jones suggested should be of something " hearty and strong " for " working in the mill beats all for appetite . " Then Amy took the big gingham pinafore , that Cleena had also prepared , and with her little parcels under her arm , skipped away down the slope to the Joneses ' cottage , where Gwendolyn was to meet and escort her to her first day 's work . " Pshaw ! I thought you was n't coming . We 'll be late if we do n't hurry . Hmm . Wore your white cloak , did n't you ? Well , I guess the girls wo n't laugh at you much . A dark one would have been better . " " But I have no dark one , so it was this or nothing . How fast you walk , almost as if you were running ! " " We 'll be late , I tell you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What is ' docked ' ? " " Why , having something taken from your wages . " " Would that be done for just so short a time ? " " Yes , indeed . The time-keeper watches out and nobody has a chance to get off . To be late five minutes means losing a quarter day 's wages . They count off a quarter , a half , three-quarters , or a whole , according to time . " " Then Gwendolyn , let 's run . I would n't make you lose for anything . " " All right . " When they arrived at the mill , Gwendolyn said :  --  " You come this way with me . Hang your cap and coat right here , next to mine . Never mind if the girls do stare , you 'll get used to that . I felt as if I should sink the first day I came , though that was ages ago . Hello , Maud , where was you last night ? " Amy did not feel in the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the light was already growing much stronger . She looked around upon these strangers who were to be her comrades at toil , with a friendly interest and curiosity . Some of her new mates regarded her with equal curiosity , though few with so kindly an interest as her own . The unconscious ease of Amy 's bearing they esteemed " boldness , " or even " cheek , " and her air of superior breeding was distasteful to them . " My , ai n't she a brazen thing ! Looks around on the whole crowd as if she thought she could put on all the airs she pleased , even in the mill . Well , ' ristocrat or no ' ristocrat , she 'll have to come down here . We 're just as good as she is and  --  " " A little better , too , you mean , " commented a lad , just passing . The girl who scorned " ' ristocrats " paused in fastening her denim apron and looked after the youth , who was , evidently , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They watched his jaunty movements with undisguised admiration , and his passing left behind him a wake of smiles and giggles which to Amy seemed out of proportion to the wit of his remark . However , there was little loitering , and the long procession of girls , with its sprinkling of men and boys , swiftly ascended the narrow open staircase to the upper floors . This staircase was built along the side wall of the great structure , flight above flight , an iron frame with steps of board . The only protection from falling upon the floor below , should one grow dizzy-headed , was a gas-pipe hand-rail ; and even this might not have been provided had not the law compelled . As she fell into line behind Gwendolyn and began the upward climb , Amy grasped this slender support firmly ; but everything about her seemed very unlike her memory of her first visit here . Then the sun was shining , she was under the guidance of the genial superintendent , and the scene was novel  --  like a picture exhibited for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene had become dingy , and herself a part of it . All around her were voices talking in a sort of mill patois concerning matters which she did not understand . But nobody , not even Gwendolyn , spoke to her , and a sudden , overpowering dismay seized her stout heart and made her head reel . Then she made a misstep and her foot slipped through the space between two stairs . This brought the hurrying procession to a standstill , and recalled attention to the " new hand . " " My sake ! Somebody 's fell . Who ? Is she hurt ? Oh , that donkey girl . Well , she ai n't so used to these horrid stairs as we be . " " Hold back ! She 's sort of giddy-headed , I guess . " Amy felt an arm thrown round her waist , a rather ungentle pull was given her dangling foot , and she was set right to proceed . But for an instant she could not go on , and she again felt the arm supporting and forcing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be longer hindered . Then she half gasped :  --  " Oh , I am so sorry . I did n't mean  --  " " Of course you did n't . Never mind . You ai n't the first girl has had her foot through these steps , and you wo n't be the last . After somebody has broke a leg or two , then they 'll put backboards to ' em . Not before . Is your head swimming yet ? " " It feels queerly . It jars so . " " That 's the machinery and the noise . The whole building just shakes and buzzes when we get fairly started . Do n't be scared . You 're all safe . Lots of girls feel just that way when they first come . Lots of ' em faint away . Some ca n't stand it at all . But you 'll get used , do n't fear . I was one of the fainters , and I kept it up quite a spell . The ' boss ' of the room got so mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to quit spinning . So I made a bold face and have n't fainted since . You see , I could n't afford to . I had to do this or starve . " By this time Amy 's fright was past , and she was regarding her comforter with that friendly gratitude which won her the instant liking of the other , who resumed :  --  " Pshaw ! The girls did n't know what they were saying . You do n't look a mite stuck up . You are n't , are you ? " " Indeed , no . Why should I be ? But I do thank you so much for your kindness just now , and I 'm sorry if my blundering has made you late . Will you be ' docked ' ? " " Oh , no . We 've time enough . Gwen is always in a desperate hurry . She likes a chance to talk before she begins work . She 's a nice girl , but she is n't very deep . Say , have you seen her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that she wore this morning ? " " My ! yes . " The " old hand " and the " new " were now quietly climbing to the top floor where their tasks were to be side by side , and Amy had time to examine her companion 's face . It was plain and freckled , boasting none of that " prettiness " of which Gwendolyn was so openly proud , but it was gentle and intelligent , and had a look of delicacy which suggested chronic suffering , patiently borne . Amy had not far to seek the cause of this pathetic expression , for Mary Reese was a hunchback . In her attire there was as much simplicity as in Amy 's own , but without grace or harmony of coloring . " You 're looking at my clothes , are n't you ? Well , they 're the great trouble of my life . After I pay my board and washing , I do n't have more than fifty cents left . I do the best I can , but I 'm no hand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were the loveliest thing I ever saw , that day you went round the mill with the ' Supe . ' " " Oh , did you see me then ? Did I see you ? What is your name ? Ah , are we up there already ? " " You can ask questions , ca n't you ? Yes , I saw you . My name is Mary Reese . If you saw me , you certainly did n't notice me , and I 'm always mighty glad when folks do n't turn for a second stare at my poor shoulders . " " Mary , nobody would , surely , " cried Amy , and flung her arm protectingly across the deformity of her new friend . " You dear , to think you 'd do that when you know me so little . Well , there 's many a body touches my hump ' for luck , ' but I ca n't remember when anybody did for  --  love . I 'm not going to forget it , either . Even a homely little hunchback has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're here . This is our ' jenny . ' I 'm so glad we are to work on the same machine . There 'll be another girl on your side till you learn ; then she 'll be taken off and we 'll be alone . I 'll like that . Shall you ? " " I  --  think  --  so , " responded Amy , absently , her attention now engrossed by the excitement about her . Girls were hurrying to take their places before the long frames filled with reels , on which fine woollen threads were being wound by the revolutions of the machinery overhead . These reels whirled round so rapidly that Amy could not follow their motion , and the buzz-buzz , as of a thousand bees humming , filled her ears and confused the instructions of the girl who was to give her her first lesson in winding and " tending . " Across the great frame Mary nodded encouragingly , but it is safe to say that Amy had never felt so incompetent and foolish as she did while she was striving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , no ; you must be quicker . See , this spool is full . This is how . ' Doffer , ' here ! " The lad who had created the ripple of admiration on his passage to this room , now approached . His motions were exact and incredibly swift . It was his duty to remove full spools and replace them by empty ones , and he did this duty for sixteen spinning frames . Seeing the " new hand 's " astonishment at his deftness he became reckless and , intending an unusually dexterous movement , miscalculated his reach , and the result was a momentary tangle among the whirling spindles . " Stupid , see what you 're at ! " cried Amy 's instructor , as by a swift movement of her foot she brought the rapidly circling frame to a standstill . " Now , you 've done it ! " " And I 'll undo it , " he returned , casting a side glance at the stranger . " If those who 've worked here so long make mistakes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary came round from behind the frame in time to read this thought . " Do n't you mind . You see , we have to be on guard all the time . If we 're not , something happens like this . Wait . While they 're fixing those spools , you watch me tie these threads . That 's what you have to do . To keep everything straight and fasten on the new ends as the old ones run out . " " But I do n't see you ' tie ' it . There is no knot . " " Of course not . We could n't have rough things in the thread that is going to make a carpet . We just twist it  --  so . Do you see ? It ca n't pull apart , and it makes no roughness . Try ; keep on trying ; and after you have practised awhile , you 'll be as swift as swift . " " I feel as slow as slow . " The " new hand " smiled into the eager face of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That so bright a creature should ever come to be a worker in that busy mill , side by side with her own self , was stranger than the strangest of the cheap novels she read so constantly . " It beats all , do n't it ? " demanded Mary , clasping Amy 's little brown hand . " What , dear ? What beats what ? Have I done that one better ? Do you think I 'll ever , ever be able to keep up my side of the ' frame ' after this other one leaves me ? " Mary 's laugh was good to hear . Mr. Metcalf , entering the room , heard it and smiled . Yet his smile was fleeting , and his only comment a reprimand to " Jack doffer " for his carelessness . " It must not happen again . Understand ? " " Yes , sir , " answered the youth , humbly . Of Amy herself the superintendent took no notice whatever beyond a curt nod . She did not understand this , and a pain shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not have seen her . " Do you suppose he did , or that he knew me ? You see , I 've always worn white before , and maybe he did not recognize me . " " Oh , he saw you all right . He would n't more ' n nod to his own wife , if he 's on his rounds , and full of business . I 've heard that he was very pleasant outside the mill and among his folks , but I never saw him any different from just now . Seems to me he looks on us like he does the spools on the spinners . I always feel as if I were part of the machine  --  the poorest part  --  and I guess you will , too . There , it 's fixed and starting up . Hurry to your place and do n't get scared . Sallie 's cross , but she ca n't help it . She used to be one of the ' fainters . ' Yes ; that 's right . Now all there is , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That meant nearly five hours of the steadiest and most difficult labor which Amy had ever undertaken . Yet these others near her , and the crowds of spinners all through the great apartment , appeared to take this labor very easily , and were even able to carry on a conversation amid the deafening noise . Amy watched so intently , and tried so faithfully to do just what and all that was expected of her that she did , indeed , make a rapid progress for one beginning ; and when the welcome whistle sounded , she was surprised to see how instantly every frame was stopped , and to hear Mary saying :  --  " If you do n't want to go with anybody else , I 'd admire to have you eat your lunch with me . " " I 'd like to , certainly , but I do n't believe I can eat . My head is whirling , whirling , just like those dreadful spools . Is n't it terrible ? " " No , I do n't think so . I do n't notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But come along , we have a half-hour nooning . We might have a whole hour , but most of the hands like to give up part of their dinner-time every day and then take the afternoon off on Saturday . The ' Supe ' does n't care , so that 's the way we get our ' Saturday-half . ' I sometimes wish we worked the other way , but of course we could n't . If part stops , the other part has to , ' cause every room depends on some other room to keep it going . " " Why , I think that 's beautiful , do n't you ? Like a big whole , and all of us the needed parts . " " No , I do n't . I do n't see one single beautiful thing about this hateful old mill . At least , I did n't before this morning , when you came . " Amy looked into Mary 's face a moment . Then she stooped and kissed it gently . Small though Amy herself was , for her age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt herself far stronger . Away in another place Gwendolyn and her mates observed this little by-play , and one girl remarked :  --  " Hmm . That settles her hash . If she 's going to take up with that horrid Mary Reese , there wo n't anybody go with her . Not a single girl , and as for the fellows  --  my ! " To this flirtatious young person to be ignored by " the fellows " meant the depth of misfortune . Happily , however , Amy had never hear the word " fellow , " as at present applied , and to do anything for the sake of attracting attention to herself she would have considered the extreme of vulgarity . Mary guided her to a quiet corner behind some bales , and filling a tin cup with water from a faucet , proceeded to open her own luncheon . Then she watched Amy , who , almost too weary to eat , loitered over the untying of the dainty parcel Cleena had made up . When she at last did so , and quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised by Mary 's astonished stare . " What is it , dear ? Are n't you hungry ? " " Hungry ? I 'm starved . But  --  see the difference . It goes even into our victuals . Oh dear , there is n't any use ! " and , with a bitter sob , the mill girl tossed aside her own rude parcel of food and dropped her face in her hands . Girlhood is swiftly intuitive . The boarding-house lunch which the hunchback had brought was quite sufficient in quantity , but it was coarse in extreme , and meats had been wrapped in one bit of newspaper along with the sweets , so that the flavor of each article spoiled the flavor of all . Yet it was the first time that Mary had rebelled against such an arrangement . Now it was different . Amy 's speech , Amy 's manner and belongings , opened before the slumbering ambition of the mill girl a picture of better things , which she recognized as unattainable for herself . Then she felt again the clasp of firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face that was both smiling and tearful pressed close to her own . " You dear little girl . I see , I understand . But you 've never had a chance to try how I 've lived and I 've never tried how you do . Let 's change . Yes ; I insist , for this once . You eat my lunch , and I 'll eat yours . It will do Goodsoul 's great heart no end of good when I tell her about it , and it will make me comprehend just how life looks from your side . Remember , we 're both poor girls together now , and I  --  insist . " Amy had a will , as has been remarked . So , in a few seconds , the two lunches were exchanged , and for almost the first time in her life Mary Reese knew what it was to feed daintily and correctly . " It makes me feel as if I was straighter , somehow . And you 're a dear , dear girl . " " Thank you , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that hurt my own self-respect , even in such a little thing as eating . But , you see , I had my darling mother . Now I 've had to let her go ; yet if you 'll let me , I 'll be so glad to teach you all she taught me . It will be keeping her memory green in just the very way she 'd like . " " Teaching is n't all . The difference is born in us . " " Nonsense . Think of Mr. Metcalf . They say he was a foundling baby , and yet he 's a gentleman . " " Even if he does n't speak to you in work hours ? " asked Mary , with a mischievous glance that would have surprised her mill mates had they seen it . Already the leaven of kindness was working in her neglected life , and for the moment she forgot to be upon the defensive against the indifference of others . " Even anything . But , hear me , Mary Reese . Here am I , as poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something grand . Guess what ? " " I could n't tell . The whistle will blow again in a minute . " " I 'm going to build a Home for Mill Girls , where they shall have all things that any gentlewoman should have . I have n't the least idea how nor when nor where . But I 'm going to do it . You 'll see . And you shall help . Maybe that 's just why God let me come here and be a mill girl myself . " After a pause the other spoke . " It seems queer to hear you say such things . Yet you 're not what I call ' pious , ' I  --  guess . " " Do n't be afraid . I 'm not goody-goody , at all . But it 's the most interesting thing mother taught me : the watching how everything ' happens ' in life , like a wonderful picture or even a curious , beautiful puzzle . Each part , each thing , fits so perfectly into its place , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I believe that 's the key to my coming . " For a moment these girlish dreamers clasped hands and saw visions . The next , a whistle sounded and , still hand in hand , they returned to their frame and to this toil which was part of a far-reaching " plan . " On the way they passed " Jack doffer , " wearing his most fetching smile , and a new necktie , recklessly disported during work hours for the sole purpose of dazzling the bright eyes of the pretty " new hand . " Unfortunately for his vanity , the " new hand " never saw him , because of those still lingering visions of a Home with a capital H ; and oddly enough , the youth respected her the more since she did not . Later on things would be altered ; but neither of them knew that then . CHAPTER XVII . THE DISAPPEARANCE OF BALAAM . " Me Gineral Bonyparty , come by ! " The lad in the depths of the cellar vouchsafed no reply . He heard distinctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allay her rising wrath . " The spalpeen ! That 's what comes o ' takin ' in folks to do for . Ah , Fayetty , " she called wheedlingly . Good Cleena had almost as many titles for her " adopted son " as her " childer " had for her . Each one suggested to the simple fellow some particular mood of the speaker . " Gineral " meant mild sarcasm , and when " Bonyparty " was added , there was indicated a need for prompt and unquestioning obedience . " Fayetty " was the forerunner of something agreeable , to which might or might not be appended something equally disagreeable . Said Hallam , once : " Freely translated , ' Fayetty ' stands for ginger cookies , and sometimes the cookies must be earned . " The call came the third time :  --  " Napoleon Bonyparty Lafayette Jimpson , come out o ' that ! Two twists of a lamb 's tail an ' I 'll fasten ye down ! " The reconstruction of Fayette gave Cleena plenty of employment , and in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly and defiantly refused to work in the mill or elsewhere that would bring in wages . Since Amy had become a daily toiler , this attitude on his part angered the poor woman beyond endurance . Yet there was not any laziness about Fayette . Nobody could have been more industrious , or more illy have directed his industry . As long as it was possible to work in the ground he had labored upon the barren soil of Bareacre , and those who understood such matters assured the Kayes that they would really have a fine garden spot , when another spring came round . " Surely , he that makes the wilderness to blossom is well engaged , Cleena , " Mr. Kaye had remonstrated once , in his quiet way . " Faith , yes , master , but till them roses bloom there might be better doin ' , " she had returned . In her heart she respected Mr. Kaye 's judgment less even than the mill boy 's , though she veiled this contempt by an outward deference . To-day was a crisis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of wage-earning settled . Either the lad must go to work and bring in something to pay for his keep , or he must " clear himself out . " " D'ye mean it ? " " Yes , avick , I means it ! Up with ye , or stay below  --  for as long as I please . " Fayette threw down his pick and crawled forward through the trench he was digging . The idle suggestion of Hallam had taken firm hold of the natural 's mind , and with a dogged persistence , that he showed also in other matters , he had now been daily laboring upon the cross-shaped excavation which was to ventilate the cellars of " Charity House . " He had made a fine beginning , and so explained to Cleena , as his mud-stained face appeared above the cellar stairs . " A beginnin ' o ' nonsense . When all 's done , what use ? Sit down an ' taste the last o ' the cakes me neighbor sent up . Here , you William , keep out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear heart . Four weeks an ' longer she 's been up before light , trudgin ' away as gay as a mavis , with never a word that she 's bothered . Alanna , Mister Gladstone , what 's now ? " A surplus of small Joneses had swarmed over the lower floor of the house on the hill , and their presence was now accepted by Cleena with little opposition , because of the generosity of their parents . " True for ye , the babies be forever under me foot , but one never comes atop the rise but there 's doubled in his little fist the stuff to make him welcome . It may be a cake , or a biscuit , or a bowl o ' milk even . It 's something for some one . " " The ' some one ' is generally the bearer of the loaf , or cake , eh , Cleena ? " asked Hallam , who was lingering in the kitchen , gathering what warmth he could from the stove there . The coals provided in the autumn were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been able to procure since then , Cleena wasted little below stairs . In the master 's studio above a fire was always burning , and if , as he sometimes did , he asked whence the supply , the faithful servant put his inquiry aside with some evasive remark . He had now work at hand which engrossed him entirely , and to which heat and physical comfort were a necessity . He was painting a life-sized portrait of his wife , and not one of the household could do aught but wish him God-speed on so precious a labor . Meanwhile , Hallam lay so silent upon the settle beside the stove that neither of them , Cleena nor Fayette , noticed him . " Here you , William , Beatrice , Belinda , come by ! Set yourselves down in the corner , yon . Here 's a fine bag o ' scraps for you two little maids . Pick ' em over that neat your mother 'll be proud ; and , William , take out these things from Miss Amy 's box till you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's long since herself 's had the time , an ' he 's a smart little gossoon , so he is . " The little girls emptied the bag of pieces on the floor , and sorting them into piles began to roll them into tidy bundles . Along with improving Fayette , Cleena had early set out upon the same lines with the small Joneses . Even William Gladstone , the mite , was already learning to distinguish between soiled hands and clean , and to enjoy the latter . So now , while she talked , Cleena set the child to take out and replace with exactness the few treasured letters and cards , or papers , which were Amy 's own , and kept in her big japanned box . Once , idly , Cleena observed the child lingering over a square packet , like an old-time letter , sealed with red wax . It was this bit of color which the little one fancied , and she smiled to see his delight in it . " The blessed baby ! Sure , he 's the makings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take a look , Fayetty , if yerself would copy yon . " " You 'll let that youngster play with your things once too often . He 's a hider , Lionel Percival says so . " " Humph ! An ' what that silly heeram-skeeram says means naught . Now , hear me , me gineral . This ends it . You goes to work , or you goes to play . Which is it ? " " I  --  I wo n't . " " Which is it ? " repeated Cleena , sternly . The natural fidgeted . In his heart he was afraid of his self-constituted " mother . " He had no wish to return to the drudgery of the mill . He was wholly interested in his cellar-digging . He had heard tales of mining , and in some way he had obtained a miner 's lantern . This he fastened to his " parade hat , " and wore to lighten his underground labors . Vague visions of untold wealth floated in his dull brain . Somewhere in the world he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had heard the " boys " say so often , and some of them had even gone to do likewise . He had seen gold sometimes in Mr. Metcalf 's office safe . Not much of it , indeed , but enough to fire his fancy . All the time he toiled he was looking for something round and glistening , like the coins he had seen . He was not in the least discouraged because he had found none . There was time enough , for he had not much more than begun what he hoped to complete . Yet , as Cleena knew , he had made a considerable opening under the west room and had carried out many barrowfuls of earth . This he had utilized upon his garden , which was almost as interesting to him as his mining . " Which is it , avick ? " " Must I ? " " Troth , must ye ? Indeed , look here . " Leaning over the table she spread before her charge 's eyes a dilapidated pocket-book . It had been the receptacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty . Fayette stared hard . Then he whistled . " You do n't say so ! All gone ? Every cent ? " Cleena nodded . Her face was very grave . It frightened the lad . He glanced toward Hallam , apparently asleep on the settle , and whispered :  --  " Where 's hers ? What she earns ? " " Humph ! That little ! Well , it 's gone . The last week 's wage to buy her shoes . Faith , the poor little feet ! Steppin ' along to her duty with never a turn aside , an ' the holes clean through the soles . Oh , me fathers , that ever I should see the day ! " Overcome by her memories of far different circumstances , Cleena bowed her gray head upon her arms above the empty purse and shook in suppressed grief . So faithful was she that she would not have counted even her life of value if by sacrificing it she could have restored unto her " folks " the departed joy and comfort of their house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not satisfied until he had examined it for himself . Then he rose and took the lantern from his hat . " I 'll fetch some , " he said briefly , and turned toward the door . But Hallam had not been so fast asleep as he seemed , and he demanded whither Fayette was bound . " It 's nothin ' to worry about , Master Hal . Just a little matter o ' business ' twixt me gineral here an ' meself . Ca n't a body wear out her shoes without so much ado ? " she asked , thrusting into view her great foot with its still unbroken , stout , calfskin brogan upon it . Hallam smiled . " You ca n't deceive me , dear old Scrubbub . It 's not you that 's wanting new shoes , and if Fayette is going millward , I am going too . " " Master Hal , what for now ? An ' what 'll the master be sayin ' if he 's wantin ' you betimes ? Is n't it bad enough to keep him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ; go up by . It 's warmer in the paintin ' room , an ' sure a body 's still as you ca n't bother nobody , even a artist . " But the cripple limped across the room and took from a recess his cap and the short top-coat he wore when he rode Balaam . It was as warm as it was clumsy , and gave his slender figure a width that was quite becoming . Like Amy 's , his headgear was always a Scotch Tam , and when it crowned his fair face Cleena thought him exceeding good to look upon . " Arrah musha , but you 're the lad for me ! An ' after all , no matter if the winds be cold , a ride 'll do ye fine , an ' make the oatmeal taste sweet in your mouth . " " It 's time something did . Oatmeal three times a day is a trifle monotonous . Heigho ! for one of your chicken pies , Goodsoul . " He was sorry as soon as he said that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they desired was always real distress to Cleena . So he laughed her regret away , with the question :  --  " If I bring home a pair of fowls , will you cook them ? " " Will I no ? Fetch me the birds , an ' I 'll show you . Go on , Fayetty , an ' saddle the beast . " But Fayette was not , at that moment , inclined to do this office for the other lad . He had resolved upon a kindly deed , one which involved self-sacrifice on his part , and like many other wiser people he was inclined to let the one generous act cover several meaner ones . It was his heart 's desire to own Balaam . If he took some of the money which the superintendent was keeping for him and gave it to Cleena for the housekeeping , he lessened his chance of obtaining his object by just that much . If he gave Cleena the money , he wanted everybody to understand that he fully realized , himself , how magnanimous he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and between the two there had been , of late , a little secret which Fayette was proud to share . Each day he would ask , with extreme caution :  --  " You hai n't told nobody yet , have ye ? " Commonly the cripple would answer : " No ; nor shall I. There 's no use . " " Sho ! Yes , there is . Read it an ' see . If it 's in the paper , it 's so . Huckleberries ! You ai n't no more pluck than a skeeter . " Then Hallam would reread the scrap of newspaper he carried in his pocket ; and each time , after such a reading , a brighter light shone in the eyes of both boys , and the foundling would observe :  --  " It 's worth tryin ' . I say , it 's worth tryin ' . I ai n't tired yet . Keep her up . " Hallam knew the half-column of print by heart . It had been brought him by Amy , on the day she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan of the newspaper , and had received it as a gift . She had hurried home , full of enthusiasm , and showed it to Hallam . He had not been enthusiastic , and had apparently tossed the article aside as worthless to him . Amy was too busy to give the matter further thought , and did not know that after she had left the room her brother had read the paragraph a second time , and had then carefully preserved it . Even now , as they started for the mill , Fayette requested to " hear it again , " but Hallam declined . " It 's too cold . And if I do n't hurry and do what I set out to , I 'm afraid I 'll back out . " " Is it somethin ' ye hate to do ? " " Yes ; it  --  Do n't let 's talk about it . " " Just the way I feel . I 'd ruther live on one meal a day ' n do it . Once I give it to her , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know her ! She 's a regular boss , she is . " " Cleena ? But she 's a dear old creature , even so . " " Oh , I like her . I like her first rate . She 's a good cook an ' middlin ' good-lookin ' . I hai n't got nothin ' again her . They say , to the village , how ' t John Young talks o ' sparkin ' her . " " What ? Teamster John ? Our Cleena ? Well , he 'd better not ! " In his indignation Hallam nearly slipped from his saddle . He did let one of his crutches fall , and Fayette picked up that , took the other , and cheerfully " packed " them to the end of their journey . " Why not ? His wife 's dead . " " Yes . But  --  our Cleena ! Cleena Keegan ! Well , there 's no danger of her encouraging him . Between her own ' folks , ' yourself , and the Joneses , I think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to worry with . " The subject was idlest village gossip , but it served to divert Hallam 's thoughts from his impending errand , and he arrived at the office of the mill in good spirits . Then he remembered a saying he had heard in the community :  --  " All roads lead to the mill , " and quoted it for Fayette 's benefit . " That 's so . But , say , I hate that old Wingate that 's got it now . He licked me when I worked for him . Licked me more ' n once , just because I fooled a little with his horses . I was bound out to him from the poor-farm , an ' I run away . He treated me bad . I 'm goin ' to get even with him some day . You watch an ' see . " " Well , here we are . Is this the office ? Will you go in with me and help me find the superintendent ? I 've never been here , you know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day . " Fayette meant no reproach . His thoughts were never profound , but Hallam flushed and felt ashamed . " That 's true . The more disgrace to me . Well , cripple or not , that 's the last time anybody shall ever say , truthfully , that my little sister has set me an example of courage and effort . Hurry up . Open the door . " A moment later both lads stood within the little room wherein so many big money transactions took place ; and it is doubtful if any speculator coming there had felt greater anxiety over the outcome of his visit than these two whose " operations " were to be of such a modest limit . " Boss , I 've come after my money . I want the whole lot . " " Good day , ' Bony ' ; good day , Hallam Kaye , I believe . " Hallam bowed , and before his courage could wane , replied :  --  " Yes ; I 'm sorry to interrupt you in business hours , but  --  will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentleman could answer , Fayette had clutched Hallam 's shoulder . " What 's that ? Did you come here to sell that donkey ? " " I came to try to sell it , certainly . " " Then I 'm sorry I ever touched to help you . I want him myself . I come to get my money a purpose . My money is as good as his . He sha n't have it . I 'll have it myself . " Mr. Metcalf interrupted :  --  " But , ' Bony , ' you ca n't afford to keep such an animal . It would take all your capital to pay for him . Wait . Sometime , if you 're industrious , you 'll be rich enough to have a horse and carriage . Indeed , I mean it ; and , yes , Hallam , I will very gladly buy your burro . I 've wanted him ever since Amy let us have Pepita . I  --  " " You sha n't have him , then . You never shall . I want him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The door opened and shut with a bang . Whether purposely or not , it was impossible to say , but in his outward rush the half-wit brushed so rudely past Hallam that he knocked his crutch from his grasp , so that he would have fallen , had not the superintendent caught and steadied the lad to a seat . " That 's ' Bony ' all over . As irresponsible as a child and ungovernable in his rage . Yet , never fear ; he 'll be back again , sometime . " " But  --  he has taken Balaam . What can I do now ? " Mr. Metcalf walked to the window and looked out . There was a dash of something black disappearing at the turn of the road . " Humph ! That 's bad . He 's taken the road to the mountains . When his ' wood fit ' comes over him , summer or winter , he vanishes . Sometimes he is gone for months . " " And he 's taken Balaam with him , " repeated the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the superintendent looked toward Hallam he was startled by the hopeless expression of the lad 's fine face . CHAPTER XVIII . THE FASCINATION OF INDUSTRY . " Sit down , lad , and rest . It will not be long before noon , and then I will send for your sister to come here . " " Thank you . Do you think he will stay long , this time ? " " ' Bony ' ? It 's just as the fit takes him . There 's no accounting for his whims , poor unbalanced fellow . In some respects he is clever and remarkably clean-handed . In fixing parts of the machinery , I would rather have his help than that of most professionals , he is so careful about the minutest details . Yet , of course , it would be out of the question to rely upon him . There 's another thing . He 's a most excellent nurse . For days at a time , when there 's been sickness in the mill village , he has devoted himself faithfully to whoever seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a truly wonderful power of soothing . When I had rheumatic fever , he was the only person I could endure to have in the room with me . His step was lighter even than that of my wife , and I really believe I should have died but for his care . " The superintendent was talking , simply to entertain and divert his visitor from the lad 's own present annoyance , but he little knew how full of import his casual remarks were to his hearer . " Do you mean that he is magnetic ? that there is something in the claim he makes of being a ' healer ' ? " " Quite as much as in the claim of any such person . There are , of course , some human beings so constituted that they can influence for good the physical conditions of other people . I am very sorry that his present whim has seized him . I would like the burro , and you would like the price of him . Well , all in good time . Meanwhile , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was only one way in which you could , so far as I know . That was by buying my pet . I  --  I do n't suppose , " Hallam continued , with hesitancy , " that there is anything such a  --  a useless fellow as I could do to earn money here ? " " I am not so sure about that . What sort of work would you like ? " " Any sort . " Mr. Metcalf went into another room and presently returned with some oblong pieces of cardboard . These had a checked surface , and upon these checks were painted or stained partial patterns , designs for the carpets woven in the mills . " Your father is an artist . Have you learned anything about his work , or of coloring ? " " Something , of course , though very little . I would not be an artist . " " Indeed ? But there are artisans whose work is simple , mechanical , and reasonably lucrative . Our designers , for instance , make an excellent living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns ? " " Yes . " " They are for the guidance of the weavers . The threads of the carpets are numbered , and these numbers correspond . Therefore , the weaver can make his carpet from his pattern with mathematical exactness . We require many such copies of the original design . If you would like to try this sort of work , I will give you a temporary job . The boy who usually does it is ailing , and I have allowed him a vacation . The wages are small , no more than Amy earns , but the work is n't difficult , and is the only thing I have now , suitable for you . " Incidentally the gentleman 's eyes turned toward Hallam 's crutches leaning against the arm of the chair where he sat ; but instead of feeling humiliated by the glance , as the sensitive cripple often did , this casual one fired his heart with a new ambition . He recalled the words of the surgeon , and was no longer angry with them . " I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his brain . Aloud he said :  --  " I will be very glad to try the work . " " Very well . When can you begin ? " " Now . " Mr. Metcalf smiled . " All right . A lad so prompt is the lad for me . But I had imagined another sort of fellow ,  --  not so energetic , indeed . " " I 've not been worth much . I 've been lazy and selfish ; but I mean to turn over a new leaf . I 'll try to be useful , and if I fail  --  I fail . " " But you 'll not fail . God never sent anybody into this world for whom He did not provide a place , a duty . You will succeed . You may even get to ' the top , ' that roomy plane where there are so few competitors . I want you to count me your friend . I , too , am a self-made man . There are few obstacles one can not conquer , given good health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze rested upon the crutches , and his heart misgave him that he had roused ambitions which could not be realized . The poor cripple was handicapped from the start by his infirmity . Hallam again saw the expression of the other 's face , and again it nerved him to a firmer will . " Even that shall not hinder , sir ; and now if you will explain to me the work , I 'll make a try at it right away . " Mr. Metcalf placed the designs upon a sloping table , at one side the office , and Hallam took the chair before it , as requested . Then the superintendent went over the system of numbering the designs , and illustrated briefly . " Now you try . I 'll watch . Go on as if I were not here . If I do not speak , consider that you are working correctly . " Hallam 's intelligence was of a fine order , and he had always been a keen observer . Before Mr. Metcalf had finished his explanations the lad had grasped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pen the gentleman laid down with the confidence of one who understood exactly what he had to do . " ' Knowledge is power , ' there is no truer saying , " remarked the teacher , watching the tyro 's eager efforts . " It 's as easy as A B C to you , apparently . " " It seems very simple . I think I would enjoy it better , though , if I could see the application . " " How the patterns are used ? " " Yes . " " Come this way . " Which was not by the shorter one of the stairway on the cliff , up which Fayette had once forced the reluctant Pepita , but around by the sloping wagon track and into the lower rooms of the great building . Already the lad knew most of these by the descriptions his sister had given him , but no description could equal the facts . As she had done , so he experienced that thrill of excitement , as he realized the mighty , throbbing life all around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brains which controlled it seemed but parts of one vast whole . His eyes kindled , his cheeks flushed , and , as Amy had done , he forgot in his eagerness over the new scene that others might be observing him and his deformity . At the weavers ' looms he was " all eyes and ears , " as one remarked . Seeing the woollen threads stretched up and down , perfectly colored and looking like a greatly elongated pattern , gave him a complete insight of the task for which he had been engaged . " I thought I understood it before . I think I could not make a mistake now . A mistake would mean disaster would n't it ? " " It would , " answered the superintendent , delighted to find his new helper such a promising aid . " See , here is the pattern . Watch the weaver awhile , then come with me to the ' setting room . ' There is where Amy will be if she keeps on as industriously as she has begun . I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it should make you grateful  --  helpful , too . I think the least of all a man 's possessions that he has a right to keep to himself is his brain . " Hallam looked up in surprise . Amy 's acquaintance with the superintendent had begun most auspiciously , and he had desired to be considered her " friend , " even as now her brother 's . Yet since her coming to work in the mill , Mr. Metcalf had not exchanged a dozen sentences with her . She saw him daily , almost hourly . He was everywhere present about the great buildings . In no department was anybody sure of the time of his appearance , yet not one was overlooked . This kept the operators keyed to an expectancy which brought out from them their best , for the approbation of this observant ' boss ' meant much to each . Yet he rarely spoke in a harsh tone to any , nor had any ever heard him utter an oath . This , in itself , gave him a distinction from all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and added , it may be , a greater awe to their respect of him . " I 've been color mixer in a carpet mill these forty years , and Metcalf 's the only ' Supe ' I ever knew could run one without swearing , " often remarked the master of the dyeing room . " He does ; and a fellow may count himself lucky to work under such a man . " The color mixer , being a most important personage in the institution , had influence among his confreres , with good reason . His trade was an art and a secret . Like all trade secrets it commanded its own price . He was said to enjoy a salary " among the thousands , " and to have rejected even richer offers for the sake of the peaceful discipline at Ardsley . Then the two visited the " setting room , " where the mill girls reached the highest promotion possible in their business . The " setting " is the arrangement upon frames of the threads of the carpet , perfectly adjusted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds from two hundred threads to slightly an advance upon that number . It is clean and dainty work , and the operator is fortunate who can secure the position . It is the same " thread " which , drawn over wires , in the weaver 's hands , makes the looplike surface of Brussels carpeting , which was the only sort manufactured at Ardsley . " You find it fascinating , do n't you ? So did Amy . Well , if you work here , in any department , you will have opportunity to study the whole science , from beginning to end . But I 'm to meet Mr. Wingate in ten minutes in his private office . Let us go back . " Amy , away up on the fourth floor where she worked , knew nothing of this visit , and was a little dismayed when she received a summons to go down " to the ' Supe 's ' room for her nooning . " She was now alone with Mary at her " jenny , " and had already become so expert that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted to the " twisting and doubling . " That very morning the " boss " of their room had said to her :  --  " We never had a girl come here who got on so fast . It mostly takes months to learn a half-machine . After another three she can mind both sides . That means about four dollars and a half a week . Well , you 've been quick and faithful , and nobody could envy your good luck . " As she picked up her lunch basket and descended toward the office , more than one called after her a good wish . " Do n't you be scared of the ' Supe . ' If he scolds and you are n't to blame , just tell him so , and he 'll like you the better . " " Maybe he 's going to promote you a'ready , though I do n't see how he could . I wo n't be jealous if he does , though , " cried another ; and Gwendolyn , the inquisitive , resolved to keep up Amy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gwen , did he send for you ? " " No ; course not . If he did , I should n't feel so chipper . There ai n't no love lost ' twixt the ' Supe ' and me . " " Then maybe  --  " " Trash ! I 'm going . Ai n't I the one that fetched you here in the first place ? Had n't I ought to stand by you , thick or thin ? " " Yes , I suppose so , " answered Amy , more frightened by Gwendolyn 's suggestive manner than by any consciousness of blunders made . Nor did she remind her neighbor that for a time , at first , while Amy 's popularity had not been determined , the other had shrewdly held aloof , waiting the turn of the tide . Fortunately , this had been in the " new hand 's " direction , and since then Gwendolyn 's attentions had been almost overpowering . But , indeed , Amy did not even think this . " Simplicity , sincerity , sympathy "  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life , and therefore she could not imagine anything lower in the lives of others . But she still kept her frank tongue , and she gave it rein , as the pair hurried officeward . " Dear Gwen , if you only would n't chew that gum ! It makes you look so queer , and spoils all the pretty outline of your cheek . Besides , I 'm sure Mr. Metcalf does n't like it . He always frowns when a gum-chewer has to speak with him about her work . " " Pshaw , what a fuss you are ! There , then , though that 's the first bit off a new stick , I 've thrown it out the window . Is my cheek pretty ? How do you manage to see things without looking ? I never see you take your eyes off your frame , yet not a thing goes on in that room you do n't seem to hear or know . " " I 'm sure I do n't know , unless it 's because having lived all alone , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the bright faces . Oh , I do love folks ! And it seems to me that every single girl in that mill is far more interesting than the best story book I ever read . " " Well , if you do n't beat ! But , say , Amy ! " " Well ? " " I do n't believe there 's another girl there would tell me I was pretty without saying something else would spoil it . " " Oh , indeed , there must be . If it 's the truth , why should n't one say it ? But if it 's the truth , again , you have no right to deface the beauty . Do give up the gum . " " Why have n't I a right ? " " I do n't know why . I simply know you have n't , any more than I have to be untidy or disagreeable . I never realized until I came to be always among so many people how each one could pain or please her neighbor . And it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best natured , the truest , it is possible . Heigho ! I 'm turning a preacher , and it 's a good thing that there 's the office , and I must stop . Brace your courage , Amy , and knock at the door . " She did so and was promptly admitted ; but did not see the superintendent , who thus served her , for he purposely stepped behind the door , so that her first glance fell upon Hallam seated at the sloping table and busily at work . She caught her breath , regained it , and rushed forward with a little shriek . " Hallam ! Hallam Kaye ! You here ! you  --  working ? " " Yes ; I 'm here . My first day at wage-earning . Did n't provide any lunch . Can you spare some for me ? Ah , Gwendolyn , good day . " Then another person appeared in the doorway  --  one whom nobody present cared to see just then , though the superintendent stepped from his hiding-place , the mirth dying out of his genial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archibald Wingate , the owner of Ardsley Mill and of most of the surrounding property . " Good day , Metcalf . Eh ? What ? Amy ? Hallam ? You here ? " " Yes , cousin Archibald . We are both here and working for you , " answered Amy , quietly . Then she surprised even herself by extending her hand in greeting . CHAPTER XIX . MOTIVES AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS . For an instant it seemed as if the old man would respond to the proffered civility ; but his hand dropped again to his side , and Amy had the mortification of one who is repulsed . However , she had little time for thought . The master of the mill passed onward into his " den " and closed its door with a snap . On the ground glass which admitted light through the upper half the door , yet effectually screened from observation any who were within , was printed in large letters :  --  " Private . No Admittance . " Then the girl turned an inquiring face toward the superintendent , who took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to congratulate you , Miss Amy . You have done well ,  --  famously , even . There 's not been a girl in the mill , since I 've had charge , who has learned so swiftly and thoroughly . What 's the secret of it ? Can you guess ? " She had not been summoned for a reprimand , then . In her relief at this , the young operative scarcely heard the question put to her , and the gentleman replied to it himself . " I can tell you . It 's your untiring perseverance , your persistent effort to do your best , without regard to anything or anybody about you . If all our girls would take example by you , promotions would be more frequent . " Gwendolyn resented the glance with which the superintendent now favored her , and Amy would have preferred not to be so openly praised . She drew a chair to the table where Hallam sat , and hastily spread her luncheon upon it . " Come , Gwendolyn , bring yours . While we 're eating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did so , rapidly , and between mouthfuls , for the half-hour 's nooning had already been cut short by the unexpected meetings ; and when the whistle sounded and the girls hurried back to their room , Amy carried a very thoughtful face . " Why , what a funny girl you are ! You look as if you 'd been scolded , after all , ' stead of praised and promised promotion . What 's wrong ? " " Fayette . To think he could run away with Balaam , after all we  --  or Cleena has done for him . Of course , he 's done things for us , too ; but I thought if we were kind to him , and made him feel that he was dear to somebody , he would improve and grow a splendid man . " " ' Ca n't make a purse out of a pig 's ear , ' " quoted Gwendolyn , seriously . " But do n't you fret . He 'll be back again , as humble as a lamb . You could n't dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's been just wild over you all ever since he first saw you and your white burro . Say , Amy , I 'm going to try and not chew any more . Your brother do n't like it , does he , either ? " " No ; he detests it . He does n't like anything that is unwomanly or coarse . " Then they separated , but in the heart of each was a fresh determination : in Gwendolyn 's that she would make herself into a " real lady , " according to the standard of this brother and sister whom she admired , or saw admired of others ; and in Amy 's , to better deserve the encouragement of her employers , and to support Hallam to the utmost in his new ambition . But as she resumed her work she reflected , with much perplexity : " I do n't understand yet why Mr. Metcalf is so delightful out of mill and so different here ; nor why cousin Archibald still persists in being unfriendly , since he has gotten everything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to know that it is commonly the inflicter of an injury who shows ill feeling , and not the recipient of it . The afternoon passed swiftly , as all her days did now , and at the signal for leaving labor , both the girls hurried to don their outer things and join Hallam . But Amy had still a word for Mary . " To-morrow is half-holiday , you know , dear , and I 've talked with Cleena . She wishes you to come and spend the night at ' Charity House , ' and we 'll fix things about that club all right . " " What 's that about a club ? " asked another girl , noticing how the hunchback 's face brightened . " Are you two going to join ours ? " " Maybe ; maybe not . Maybe we 'll compromise and have but one . Though we can do little until after Christmas , it 's so near now . " " Oh , do n't get up another . We have just lovely times in ours . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll leave you to see . They wanted I should ask you , and your brother , too . He 's real nice looking , ' Jack doffer ' says , even if he is lame . " Amy 's cheek burned , and her quick temper got her into trouble . " My brother Hallam is a very , very handsome boy . Even with his lameness he 's a thousand times better looking than any boy in this mill , and what 's more , he 's a gentleman ! " Then this champion of the aristocracy , which she thought she disdained but now discovered she was proud to call her own class , walked off with her nose in the air and her dark eyes glittering with an angry light . " There , now you 've done it ! " cried Gwendolyn , in amazement . " But ma said it would n't last . She says that 's the way with all the heroines in her novels that lose their money and pretend to be just plain folks afterward . They never are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it . " " Oh , well , they should n't try , " remarked this young " heroine , " fiercely . " I do n't care at all what they say about me , but they 'd best let my Hal alone . " " Hoity-toity , I do n't see as he 's any better than anybody else . " Amy stopped short on the path from the mill to the ladder upon the bluff . Suddenly she reflected how her mother would have regarded her present mood . " He that ruleth his own spirit . " The words seemed whispered in her ear . A moment later she turned and spoke again , but her voice was now gentle and appealing . " Yes , he is better , though I 'm not . He is better because he is just what he seems . There is no pretence about him . He does n't think that plastering his hair with stuff , and wearing ugly , showy clothes , and a hat on the back of his head , or swaggering , or smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks of a gentleman . He 's the real thing . That 's what Hal is , and that 's why I 'm so proud of him , so  --  so touchy about him . " " Amy , what does make a gentleman , anyway , if it is n't dressing in style and knowing things ? " " It 's the simplest thing in the world ; it 's just being kind out of one 's heart instead of one 's head . It 's being just as pure-minded and honest as one can be , and  --  believing that everybody else is as good or a little better than one 's self . So it seems to me . " " We are different , then . I never should know how to say such things . I do n't know how to think them . It is n't any use . You are you , and I am me , and that ends it . " Amy did not even smile at the crooked grammar . This was the old cry of Mary , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am so sorry . It is of use . There is n't any difference , really . We are both girls who have to earn our living . Our training has been different , that is all . I want to know all you know ; I want you to know all I do . I want to be friends ; oh , I want to be friends with every girl in the world ! " " Pshaw ! do you ? Well , I do n't . I do n't want but a few , and I want them to be stylish and nice . You 'd have a lot of style if you could dress different . " Poor Amy . This was like a dash of cold water over her enthusiasm . Just when she fancied that Gwendolyn was aspiring to all that was noble and uplifting , down she had dropped again into that idea of " style " and fashion and good times . But she remembered Mary . In the soul of that afflicted little mill girl was , indeed , a true ambition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hallam , how can you climb all the way to ' Charity House ' ? You will drop by the way . It 's hard , even for me . " " I can do it . I must . There is nothing else to be done . " So they set out together , through the darkness . The days were at the shortest , and Christmas would come the following week . Hallam and Amy looked forward with dread to the festival , remembering their mother had striven , even under disadvantages , to keep the holiday a bright one for her children . There had never been either many or costly gifts at Fairacres , but there had been something for each and all ; and the home-made trifles were all the dearer because Salome 's gentle fingers had fashioned them . Now Gwendolyn was full of anticipation , and from her talk about it her neighbors judged she meant to expend a really large sum of money in presents for her friends . " But , Gwendolyn , how can you buy all these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , and you 've bought so many clothes ; and  --  I guess I 'm not good at figures . My poor little two dollars and a half , that I get now , would n't buy a quarter of all you say . " " Oh , that 's all right . Mis ' Hackett , she charges it . I always run an account with her . " " You ? a girl like you ? What is your mother thinking about ? I thought to buy a wheel that way was queer ; but how dare you ? " " Why , I 'm working all the time , ai n't I ? Anybody that has regular work can get anything they want at Mis ' Hackett 's , or other places , too . Ma and pa do the same way . " " But  --  that 's debt . It must be horrible . It seems like going out of one debt into another as fast as you can . Oh , Gwen , do n't do it . " " Pshaw ! that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very way your own folks did . If they had n't been in debt , they would n't have had to move from Fairacres , and all that . Would they ? " Both Hallam and Amy were silent . The keen common sense of the mill girl had struck home , and again Amy realized that her vocation was not that of " preaching . " Finally , the cripple spoke :  --  " It 's like it , yet it is n't . We had something left to pay our debts . It was n't money , but it was money 's worth . We paid them . We are left poor indeed , but we have n't mortgaged our future . That 's all . But we are too young to talk so wisely . If your parents approve , they probably know best . Hark ! there is a wagon coming . " They all paused , and drew aside out of the road to let the vehicle pass . It was so dark that they could distinguish nothing clearly , and the lantern fastened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater shadow the face of the occupant . To their surprise , the traveller drew rein and saluted them :  --  " Hello . Just getting home , eh ? " All recognized the voice . It belonged to Mr. Wingate . " Yes , just getting home , " answered Amy , cheerily . " Growing pretty dark , is n't it ? Hmm , yes . Heard you lost your donkey , Hallam . " " For the time , I have , sir , " responded the lad , rather stiffly . He hated this man " on sight , " or out of it , and it was difficult for him to conquer his aversion . All the kindness he had felt toward him , on the night of Mr. Wingate 's first unwelcome visit to Fairacres , had been forgotten since ; because in his heart he believed that his mother 's death was due to her removal from her home . Yet he wished to be just , and he would try to feel differently by and by . Meanwhile , his unused strength was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , for he was going home empty-handed . He had lost his beloved Balaam , and he had nothing to show for it . In all his life he had never walked so far as from the mill to the Bareacre knoll , and even his crutches seemed to wobble and twist with fatigue . Amy had noticed this , and made him pause to rest more than once ; but the night was cold , and he felt it most unwise to risk taking cold by standing in the wind . Poverty was teaching Hallam prudence , among many other excellent things . " None of us can afford to be sick now , " he reflected . " Hmm . That half-witted fellow ought not to be allowed to go free . He 's done me a lot of mischief , and I guess he injures everybody who befriends him . The last thing he ought to be trusted with is horse-flesh , or mule-flesh either . Well , I 'm going your way , and it 's a tough pull on a pair of crutches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lift as far as the bars . " Everybody was astonished , and everybody waited for Hallam 's reply in some anxiety . Amy knew his mind , and she knew , also , that he was very weary . She hoped that he would say :  --  " Thank you ; I 'll be glad to accept , " but his answer was a curt : " Thank you ; I would rather walk . " " Very well . Suit yourself . " The horse was touched sharply , and bounded up the hill road at an unusual pace . " Oh , Hal , why did n't you ride ? You are so tired . " " Well  --  because . " " You 'd better . Old man do n't like to have his favors lost , " remarked Gwendolyn . " I 've heard lots say that , even though he has n't been at Ardsley so very long . " Now , in the lad 's heart , besides his unwillingness to " accept favors from an enemy , " there had been another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely and dark was the homeward walk for his sister , after her long day of toil , and even with the company of Gwendolyn . In this his first experience it had come upon him with a shock , that it was neither pleasant nor safe for Amy , and he resolved she should never again be left without his escort , if he were possibly able to be with her . But he could not , or felt that he could not , tell this to the girls ; much less to Mr. Wingate , finding it easier to be misjudged than to explain . Yet had the mill owner known the fact , it would have gone far toward propitiating him , and toward rousing his admiration for his young kinsman . So with the best intentions all around , the breach between Fairacres and " Charity House " was duly widened . The trio of mill workers trudged wearily upward , and the mill master hurried recklessly through the gloom toward a home he had coveted , but found a lonely , " ghost-haunted " solitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , there are memories which are sadder to face than any " haunt " would be . " Stir up the fire , man . Do n't you know it 's a bitter night outside ? " he cried , as he entered it . The master 's tone boded ill for the servant if obedience were not prompt . So though a great blaze roared upon the wide hearth in the old room where we first met this gentleman he was not content , nor was the good dinner which followed appreciated . Nothing was right that night for Archibald Wingate . Nothing ? Yes , one thing gave him great satisfaction , so that , late in the evening , sitting before the blaze he had complained of , he rubbed his hands with a quiet glee . " If you please , sir , there 's a black donkey wandered into the place to-night . It went straight to the stable and to one of the box stalls on the west . It seemed to know the way . The stable boy says it 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came . I thought you 'd like to know , sir ; and , if you please , is it to remain ? " " Yes , Marshall , it is to remain . " And again the old gentleman smiled into the dancing flames and rubbed his smooth palms . CHAPTER XX . IN THE OLD HOME . After one o'clock on the afternoon before Christmas was a mill holiday ; and while the great looms were silent , those who usually toiled at them took their way into Wallburg city to do their Christmas shopping . Though a few , indeed , were able to satisfy their needs at the local stores , and among these , for once , was Gwendolyn . She had come up the knoll after dinner hour , to invite Amy 's presence at the gift buying , and concluded her invitation by saying :  --  " Even if you wo n't get anything yourself , you might come and look at the pretty things . It 's surprising how many you find you can pick out in a few minutes . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get for Beatrice and Belinda . Victoria 's so big she 's outgrown doll  --  " Cleena could hold her tongue no longer . " Toys , is it , alanna ! Better be shoes for their feet ; an ' as for Queen Victory an ' her dolls , more 's the shame to you as sets her the example o ' growin ' up before her time . Vases for the mother , is it ? An ' she after patchin ' the sheets off her bed . Pardon unasked advice , which same is unsavory , belike , an ' get the makin ' of a new pair . That 's sense , so it is . " It was sense . As such it commended itself to Gwendolyn , during her walk to the village , and bore results for the comfort of her family ; for though she did run in debt to make her Christmas gifts , at least she now altered her usual habit completely , and for each member of the household provided some article of use . Even Mrs. Hackett paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark :  --  " Well , now , Gwen , that 's a good plan . I guess your folks will be proud of what you 're giving them this year . Yes , I 'm more ' n willing to trust you for ' em . A girl that 'll spend her money as you are , is n't going to cheat me in the long run . Yes , the wagon 'll be going out late to-night and will fetch ' em all for you . Flannel and sheeting and such are a mighty sight heavier to carry than notions . But say , I 'll put in a little candy for the youngsters , seeing they 're disappointed of their dolls . " Meanwhile , up at " Charity House , " Amy had drawn Cleena into a corner to discuss their own plans , and especially to ask concerning a proposed trip to the city , by her father , and immediately after the holidays . " You know , Goodsoul , that he has n't been there alone in a long time . Is it safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his attacks , what would happen ? Should Hallam go with him ? and  --  worst of all  --  how can we spare the money ? " " Faith , Miss Amy , I 'd leave the master be . It 's the fine sense he 's gettin ' the now . It would hearten the mistress could she see how he does be pickin ' up . Always that gentle I d ' know , as if the sorrow had been a broom sweepin ' his soul all free of the moilder an ' muss was in it long by . Only yesternight , whilst I was just washin ' off me table afore layin ' me cloth , into the kitchen he steps an ' sits himself down by the door , lookin ' out toward Fairacres . It was as soft as summer , like it is this eve , but faith ! a ' green Christmas makes a fat graveyard . ' " The very word made them both silent for a moment , and then Amy resumed :  --  " Father has packed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , studies of heads most of them are , I believe , and all are unframed . What do you suppose he means to do with them ? " " Sell them . What for no ? " " But mother never liked to have him . These are all pictures he did long ago . " " The quicker they 'll go off the hand then . " " Do you approve ? " " With all me heart . " Amy dropped her face on her palms and considered the matter . Even with her habit of dealing with facts rather than fancies , she still found life a most perplexing and complex affair . The only help she gained toward understanding it was that clew taught her by her mother of matching the days and the events as one matches a fascinating puzzle . Out of this thought she spoke at last , though quite to the bewilderment of honest Cleena . " It seems as if our losing all that belonged to us were making us sturdier folks , improving us all . Mother needed no improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , one thing I know , she would be glad for us all , and some way I feel her very near to-day . Only , if I could just talk with her and ask her things . " " Sure ye can , me colleen . I mind it 's no far to the land where she 's gone . But about the money . See here ; how got I this ? " And Cleena whipped out a handkerchief from her jacket pocket and unfolded it with utmost care . In this were a number of silver pieces , from half-dollars to dimes , and added together made the " smart decent sum " of five dollars and fifteen cents . " Why , Cleena ! Where ? I thought all ours was spent as soon as earned . " " Where ? An ' I to be mendin ' a few clothes for me neighbors . Even that man John fetches me a blouse now an ' again , to put in a fresh pair o ' sleeves or set on a button that 's missin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would be leavin ' her childer bring in all the wage . Only  --  " and the good creature 's fine face clouded dismally . Amy 's arms were around the other 's neck , and her soft cheek pressed against the shoulder that had borne so many burdens for her and hers . " Only what , you darling Scrubbub ? " " Only I was mindin ' to buy a few trinkets for you an ' Master Hal . ' T is Christmas comes but once a year , an ' sure me heart should give good cheer  --  " " Cleena , Cleena ! A poet !

It 's this way , me darling . Gifts for you an ' Hal  --  or the trip to town for the master . Which , says you ? For here 's the silver will pay either one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then it 's decided already . At least , I 'm sure Hallam will so agree when he comes in . You know he 's stopped at Mr. Metcalf 's to see some books on designing . Hallam thinks that either he might learn to do it or that perhaps even father might give some odd moments to it , though I do n't know as he would hardly dare propose it . The idea was Mr. Metcalf 's , and he has n't much ' sentiment ' about him . He said that if there was any way in which father could make a living , he would be happier if so employed . It sounded dreadful to me at first , and then it seemed just sensible . " " That last it was , and so I b'lieve the master 'll say himself .

" " Indeed , that 's sweet decent speech , me dear ; but seein ' your ' world 's ' no bigger nor Ardsley township , I ' low I 'll not be over set up by that same . Run away , child , run away ! " " Cleena , you 're watching down the road . Why ? Why ?  --  I demand ; and you talk of pastry , the which has n't been in ' Charity House ' since we came to it , save and except that dried apple pie sent in by Mrs. Jones . " " Ugh ! " cried Cleena , making a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul 's pastry for hardness an ' toughness is n't found this side of the Red Sea . " " Cleena , is that old John coming here to-day ? Is it he you are watching for ? " " Why for no ? If a man 's more nor his share an ' nobody to cook it , why should n't he be a bringin ' it up an ' lettin ' a body fix it eatable ?

What 's the good o ' John , then , but to find food for me folks ? Run along ! " Mr. Kaye had already gone off for one of his long tramps , over the fields and through the woods , to which he was now much given . He had taken such , at first , to subdue the restlessness which followed upon his wife 's death , and as some sort of break in his unutterable loneliness . But nature had helped him more than he had dreamed ; and to the pure air , the physical fatigue , and consequent sound sleep was due much of the cure of his mental illness that all who knew him now noticed . So there was nobody who needed Amy just then , and she set off from " Charity House " at a brisk pace , resolved , as Cleena had advised , to forget all worry and labor , and " just have one good , jolly time . " She took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather a bunch of late ferns for the decoration of the morrow 's dinner table , since Cleena promised it should be a feast day , after all . Before she quite realized it even , she had deflected from her course , remembering just then a certain glen in the grounds of her old home where rare ferns grew to prodigious size , and where no cold of winter seemed to harm them . Then once upon the familiar path every step was suggestive of some bygone outing , and led her to explore farther and still farther . " Ah , the frost-bleached maiden-hair . Nowhere else does it last like this . It 's almost as white as edelweiss , and far more graceful . I must put that in my basket , if nothing else . " So she pulled it gently and with infinite care , lest she should break the delicate fronds that had outlasted their season by so long . Then there were others , dainty green and still fragrant , which she gathered eagerly ; with here and there a bit of crimson-berried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kept to the depth of the little ravine , through which ran a tiny , babbling brook . This had long ago been named " Merrywater , " nor had it ever seemed gayer and more winsome than then . It was like reunion with some old beloved playmate , and Amy forgot everything but the present enjoyment as she stooped and dabbled in the water here and there . Sometimes she came to the fantastic little bridges which Hallam had used to lie upon the bank and construct out of the roots and pebbles she brought him . Where these had fallen into decay she repaired them ; and at one time was busily endeavoring to force a grapevine into place when she heard a sound that made her pause in her task and spring to her feet . " Ah-umph ! A-h-u-m-ph ! A-H-U-M-P-H ! ! ! " " Pepita ! No  --  Balaam ! Balaam , Balaam  --  Balaam ! " She was off up the bank in another instant . The sound was from the old stable , so dear , so familiar to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tufts of sweet grass , such as had been neglected by the mowers , but were dear to donkey appetites . " Oh , the precious ! The blessed little beast ! Wo n't Hallam be glad ! Wo n't this be a Christmas gift indeed , to bring him back his own pet ! How glad I am I took this way to walk , and how queer it is that he should be back in his very own old home . Is it so queer , though ? Would n't I come , too , if I were just a burro and were set free to follow my own will ? I can hardly wait to reach him . " In a moment she had done so , and had filled the manger with the still luscious grass , while climbing upon its front she had thrown her arms about the animal 's neck and was assuring him , as she might a human being , that he had been sadly missed and would be most welcome home . On his part the burro was fortunately silent , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he laid his big ears gently back to be out of Amy 's way , while she caressed him . She smoothed his forelock , ran her fingers through his mane , patted his shaggy head , and told him that his " big velvet lips were the softest things on earth . " " Ahem ! " This remark , if such it could be called , fell upon Amy 's ears so suddenly that she half tumbled backward from her perch upon the manger , and just saved herself by springing lightly down , or she thought it was lightly , until she wheeled and faced the intruder . None other than Archibald Wingate , making a horrible grimace , and holding up one of his pudgy feet as if he were in great pain . " Oh , I beg your pardon ! I did n't know it was your foot , or you were you  --  I thought it was only the hay on the floor . " " Ugh ! Great goodness ! Umm . If you ever have the gout , young woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down full force upon your toes . Ouch ! O dear ! O dear ! " Amy had never been accustomed to seeing people make ado over physical suffering . She did not understand this man before her , and a thrill of distress ran through her own frame , like the touch of an electric battery . " Oh , I am so sorry ! I would n't have done it for anything if I had known . Ca n't I do something now to help you ? Let me rub it or  --  or  --  lead you . You look  --  " In spite of her good intentions , the horrible contortions by which Mr. Wingate 's countenance expressed his feelings affected her sense of the ridiculous , and she smiled . As instantly ashamed of the smile , she buried her face in her hands , and waited what would come next . " Huh ! Yes , you look sorry , of course you do , laughing at an old man after you 've nearly broken his foot in two . Hmm . You 're a sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ! O-oh ! " Yet he , too , and in spite of himself , laughed ; but it was at his own pitiful joke about his kinsmen being a " sorry lot . " Fortunately , Amy did not understand a jest of this nature , but she was swift to see the brightening of his face . She put her hand on his arm , and tried to draw his hand within her own . " Maybe it wo n't be so bad . Lean on me , and I 'll help you to a seat or to the house . And thank you , thank you so much for putting Balaam in the stable , and taking such good care of him . If Hal had known , he would n't have worried so about the little beast . He 's been so tenderly cared for , we could n't bear to think of him as off in the open fields with nobody but Fayette . " Mr. Wingate said not a word . He simply ceased groaning and grimacing , and he slipped his arm through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . He did not lean at all heavily upon her , however , and he merely glanced toward the burro as the pair walked to the stable door . Then the animal thought it time to protest . Amy had brought him fresh grass , but she had dropped it all outside his manger , where he could not reach it . This was aggravation in the extreme . More than that , whenever , in the old days , she had been afflicted with one of these outbursts of affection , there had generally been a lump of sugar connected with it . To lose affection , hay , and sugar , all in one unhappy moment , was too much even for donkey patience . " AH-UMPH ! H-umph ! A-h-u-m-p-h ! " " Whew ! he 's split my ears open . Plague take the beast ! " cried Mr. Wingate , hurrying forward , and now stepping with suspicious freedom from lameness . Amy hurried , too , wondering at his sudden recovery . " Oh , do you dislike his talk ? I love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so absurd , and Pepita 's was even funnier . She had a feminine note , so to speak , and she whined like a spoiled baby . " " What do you know about spoiled babies ? " " Why  --  nothing  --  only William Gladstone , he 's a trifle self-willed , I think . " " William Gladstone ! What do you mean ? Who are you talking about ? Are you all crazy together ? " " Not the English statesman , certainly . Just Mrs. Jones 's youngest son . And I do n't think we 're crazy . " " I think you are , the whole lot . Well , will you come into the house with me ? How did you know the donkey was here ? Who told you ? " " He told me , " laughed Amy . " Yes , I 'll go in if you wish , if I can help you . " " How did he tell you ? " " I was gathering these ferns in the glen , and I heard him bray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the table to-morrow . The prettiest ferns in all Fairacres grow along the banks of ' Merrywater . ' " " Yes , I know . I used to gather them when I was a child . My grandmother liked them , though she called them plain ' brakes . ' So you 're not afraid to trespass , then ? And you 're able to have a dinner-party even so soon after  --  and with all the pretended devotion . But Cuthbert  --  " Amy 's hand went up to her kinsman 's lips . It was a habit of hers , sometimes playfully sometimes earnestly used , to ward off anything she did not wish another to say to her , and she had done it before she thought ; but having so done she would not withdraw her silent protest . This man should never say , nor would she ever hear , a word against her father . Of that she was determined , even though she must be rude to prevent . For a moment Archibald Wingate resented the girl 's correction . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground , he spoke :  --  " You are right . I had no business to so speak . I honor you for your filial loyalty and  --  Come into the house . I have something I wish to discuss with you . So you want to thank me for taking care of Balaam , do you ? You may feel differently after you have heard what I have to say . Oh , you did give me a twinge , I tell you ! " " Would it relieve the pain if I bathed the foot for you ? Or is there anybody else to do it ? " " Would you do that for me ? " " Certainly . " " Ring that bell . " Amy obeyed . It was the familiar one which summoned , or had summoned , Cleena from her kitchen . A man answered the call . " Marshall , have a foot-bath brought in here . This young lady is going to dress my foot for me . For once there 'll be no blundering heavy-handed servant to hurt me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothed the red , misshapen foot . The repugnance she had felt to touching it had all vanished when she saw how acute must have been the old man 's suffering and his now evident relief . " I thought you made a big fuss . Now I do n't see how you walk about at all . " " I walk on my will , " answered he , grimly . " You 're a good girl ; yes , you are . You 're a real Kaye . Our women were all good nurses and tender-handed . It 's a pity  --  such a pity ! " Amy thought the prodigious sigh that moved his mighty breast was for his own distress , and echoed his regret sincerely . " Yes ; it is a pity . It seems to me it should be cured . I wish it could . " " So do I. Say , little woman , suppose you and I try to cure it . " Amy looked up . She had been speaking simply of his disease . She now saw that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , while she so gently manipulated the swollen ankle and bound it with the lotions Marshall handed her , he had been quite comfortable , and the keen twinkle in his eye set her thinking . Was it the family feud he wished might be healed ? He , who was the very foundation and cause of it ? Illustration : " SHE SO GENTLY MANIPULATED THE SWOLLEN ANKLE AND BOUND IT WITH THE LOTION . " She caught his hand in both hers , eagerly . " Do you mean that we might live at peace ; in love , as kinsfolk should ? Now  --  this peace day  --  when the Christ child comes ? Is it that ? " But Marshall made a little motion which might be warning or contempt . The old man 's face hardened again . " What are you asking ? Look , you 've wet my cuffs ! Your hands just out of hot water and all liniment ! " " Never mind your cuffs . Look out for your heart . You 're a poor , lonely old fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew what she was about , Amy had thrown her arms about her cousin 's neck and imprinted a kiss  --  somewhere . It did n't much matter that it landed squarely on the tip of his pudgy nose . Archibald Wingate was so little in the habit of receiving kisses that he might easily have imagined this was quite the customary place for their bestowal . CHAPTER XXI . A PECULIAR INVITATION . It would be difficult to tell which was the most startled . Amy stepped back from the unresponsive object of her affectionate impulse and blushed furiously . She feared that he would think her bold and silly , yet she had only meant to be kind , to comfort him because she pitied him . Now , she was painfully conscious that Marshall was standing near , coolly observant , with a cynical smile upon his thin lips . It was a curious fact , which Amy instantly recognized , that this master of whom so many people stood in awe should himself stand in awe of his own valet . " Ahem  --  shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished ? " Amy had not been accustomed to hearing herself spoken of as a " person , " and the word angered her . This restored her self-possession . She looked up , laughing . " I do n't know how I came to do that , cousin Archibald . I hope you 'll forgive me . " " Oh , I 'll forgive you . I do n't know how you did it , either . Well , man , why are you standing there , grinning like a Cheshire cat . I tell you she has finished . You can take away the things . " " Very well ; it is time for your nap , sir . " The worm turned . " What if I do n't take one to-day ? What will happen ? " " I do n't know , sir , except that you will probably be ill . The doctor 's orders are , when you have an attack  --  " " Hang you and the doctor and the attacks , all together ! You can leave the room , ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring . " Because he was too astonished to do otherwise , Marshall obeyed . He was a privileged person . His master did not often cross his will . There being no other apparent heirs , Marshall had , in his own imagination , constituted himself Mr. Wingate 's heir . Why not ? A lifelong service , an untiring devotion to whims of all sorts , a continual attention to the " creature comforts " which were so greatly a part of Archibald 's life  --  these merited a rich reward . Marshall intended to receive this reward , should he be lucky enough to outlive his employer . He felt that he would fill the position of owner of Fairacres with dignity and profit . He did not like this new interest Mr. Wingate was taking , by fits and starts , in the deposed family who were his relatives and  --  enemies . In Marshall 's opinion the breech between these kinsfolk ought not to be healed . Amy 's presence in the house was a disastrous portent . She must be gotten out of it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would not care to come again . But how ? The servant revolved this question , as he carried away the bath , and so profoundly that he failed to notice where he was going and stepped down a forgotten stair so unexpectedly that he fell and drenched himself with the water from the tub . " Plague on her ! Now , I 'm in for it ! " Which meant that before he could remove the damage to his attire Amy would probably have gained whatever she came to seek . He did not believe that anybody would visit his master without having " an axe to grind , " for he judged all men by himself . However , having tasted the sweets of rebellion against this iron rule of Marshall , Mr. Wingate determined to enjoy it further . " He 's a meddling old fool . He 's a good servant , too . There is n't another man in the world would put up with my tempers as he does . Never a word in return , and as smooth as silk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had had his hair licked by kittens . It 's so slick and flat . Do you have to mind him always ? " " Mind him ? I  --  mind my servant , eh ? " " Oh , I beg your pardon . Of course  --  " Mr. Wingate 's face was scarlet . The weakness which he had hardly acknowledged to himself had been instantly discovered by this bright-eyed girl . It was n't a pleasant thing to have so observant a person about . He had something to say to her , however , and he would do it at once and get rid of her . All his newly aroused affection died in his resentment against her judgment . " I want to go to the studio . There is something there I do n't mean to keep , and do n't wish to destroy , without consulting some of you . " Amy followed him quietly out of the house toward the building where her father had spent so many hours , and which she held in strictest veneration . Did it not still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen , and which had been kept screened from the sight of all ? So she still expected to find the white curtain undisturbed ; and as she entered the studio , paused  --  amazed . The canvas covered the end of the apartment ; but after one hasty glance Amy shielded her eyes in a distress that was almost terror . " Hmm . It is very realistic , is n't it ? The thing is horrible . I do n't wonder that Cuthbert 's wits got scattered , working on it . It would drive me crazy in a week , and I 'm a hard , matter-of-fact man . I kept it , because by right I might have kept everything that was here . I supposed I was getting something worth while . But this ! I do n't want it . I could n't sell it . I hate to destroy it . What 's to be done ? " " Oh , I wish I had n't seen it ! " " So do I. I see it sometimes in the night and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it , for I never come here after dark . It 's a wonderful picture , sure enough . A horrible one . " The canvas fascinated Amy . It depicted a great fire . It was ugly in extreme . The big , bare building was in flames , everywhere . The windows seemed numberless , and at almost every window a face ; on these faces all the gamut of fright , appeal , and unutterable despair . They were human  --  living . The girl felt impelled to run and snatch them from their doom ; also the impulse to hide her eyes , that she might not see . Mr. Wingate had taken a chair before the painting , and was looking at it critically . " I tell you that 's a marvellous thing , and it 's as dreadful as masterly . There 's only one way I can see by which a man could get any money out of it : that 's by cutting out the separate faces and selling them singly . A body might endure to see one such countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be destroyed altogether . It explains why Cuthbert never recovered from the shock of the accident he was in . He never lost sight of it . He must have begun this while it was fresh in his brain , and he did his utmost to keep it fresh . Poor Salome , she had a hard life . " " She had a happy life . She loved my father . He loved her . Whatever he did was right , just right in her eyes . You need n't pity her . But , oh , if she were only here to consult ! Why did you show it to me ? Why did I have to see it ? " " Because it could n't be helped . The thing is ; it exists . Now what is to be done with it ? " " I  --  will ask my father . " " I do n't know that that is wise . It might bring about a return of his malady , and I 'm told he is improving in all respects . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no other way . " " What if it makes him worse again ? " Poor Amy ! All her Christmas cheer had died from her heart . She felt that it would be almost wicked to remind her father of this , his " life work , " of which she had not heard him speak since he left Fairacres . Yet it was his . He had given years to its completion , so far as it had neared that point . Mr. Wingate regarded her keenly . " Well ? " he asked . " Oh , I do n't know what to say . Have you nothing to propose ? " " Only what I did . To cut it up and sell the faces as so many small canvases . That would partially repay me for the things he still owes for  --  the paints and so on . But I detest the thing so I hate to spread the misery of it . " " Repay you ? Do you mean that you believe you have a right  --  you own that picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the labor of  --  it means many years out of my poor father 's life . Can such a thing be ' owned ' by anybody except him ? " " Yes , of course . Hark you . You go home and tell him what I offer . I will take the picture off his hands and allow him  --  hmm  --  maybe two hundred dollars ; or , he can take it and owe me that much more . In any case I want to get rid of it . I wo n't have it left here much longer . I shall have other uses for this room , maybe . Anyway , I mean to get that off the place . " Amy moved slowly toward the door . She did not know how to reply , and she felt her cousin was a very hard , unjust man . Yet she agreed with him that the picture was enough to make a person wish it out of sight , even out of existence . At the doorway he arrested her steps , by laying his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid of stairs . And there 's another thing  --  that donkey . " " Oh , yes ; I had forgotten Balaam . May I ride him home ? Will you have him brought around for me ? " " Eh ? What ? Not so fast  --  not quite so fast ! No , I do n't mean the stairs . I can manage this pace for them . I mean the donkey . It came here of its own accord . It gave me an idea . If your brother wants to sell him  --  By the way , how do you expect to pay the rent ? " Amy stopped short , halfway down the stairs , and so suddenly that Mr. Wingate remonstrated . " If you 'd give warning of these spasmodic actions of yours , it would be more comfortable for those depending on you . There , please move along . " " The rent ? I had not thought . Did n't my mother attend to that ? " " For the first quarter year , she did . To whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new distressing question had been raised , how much she inconvenienced him , Amy sat plump down and leaned her head against the hand-rail . It always appeared to aid her reflective powers if she could rest her troubled head against something material . " I 'll try to think . I earn two dollars and a half a week . " " Oh , my foot hurts again . Let 's get into a decent room and talk it over there . I hate draughty halls and unwarmed rooms . There 's a fire in the little side parlor off the dining room . That 's my own private den . I want to get there and lie down . That rabbit pie I had for lunch does n't agree with me , I 'm afraid . Do you like rabbit pie ? " " No , indeed ; I would n't eat one for anything . " " Why not ? " " I should fancy the pretty creatures looking at me with their soft eyes . They 're the gentlest animals in the world . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest . Besides , she was now in great haste to leave Fairacres and regain the shelter of her own home . Strange , she reflected , how quickly she had ceased to think of this house , her birthplace , as a home ; since all that went to make it such had gone elsewhere . " About that rent money . If Hallam is able to keep at work we may together earn five dollars a week . That would be twenty dollars a month . The rent is ten . We will be able to pay it , I think . " " Do you imagine you will be able to live upon the remainder ? Upon two and a half dollars a week , four grown persons ? " " If we have no more , we shall have to do so , sha n't we ? " " Excuse me ; but what would you eat ? I saw no sign of scrimping and pinching that day I first came here  --  to stay . " " Oh , then Cleena was determined you should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one meal . We 've often laughed over it since . " " Humph ! But this two and a half per week , what would it buy ? " " Meal and milk . Sometimes oat meal , sometimes corn . Once and again an egg or something for father . Oh , we 'd manage . " " Hmm , hmm ; you 'd rather live on that than run in debt ? You younger Kayes , who are all I seem to take account of now  --  Salome is gone . " " We will run in no debt we can not pay , unless we are ill and it is impossible to help . Hal and I settled that long ago . So far we have managed , and now he is working too , I feel as rich as  --  rich . " " Exactly . Amy , if this old house were yours , what would you do with it ? " The answer was prompt and decided . " Make it into a Home for Mill Girls . " " Whew ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , or in this part of it ! Are you beside yourself ? " " I should be with delight , if I could make that dream a reality . " " I gave you credit for more sense . But , business  --  that donkey . How much did Mr. Metcalf intend to pay for it ? " " I suppose the same as he did for Pepita . Seventy-five dollars  --  burro , harness , and all . " " At ten dollars a month , that would take you along well into next summer . Tell Hallam that I will keep the animal and allow him eight months ' rent for it . That 's giving you a half month , you see . Will you ? " " Yes , I 'll tell him , " answered she , with a catch in her voice . " Only I had hoped to take him home with me . It would have made such a delightful Christmas for us all . You do n't know how much we love those pretty creatures . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite right to make any such arrangements , after having asked the superintendent to buy it , and he agreeing ? Would n't he be the one to say something about it ? " " Amy , you 're incorrigible . You 're a radical . A thing is either absolutely right or it is absolutely wrong  --  according to your standard . You 'll be in trouble as long as you live , for you 'll find nobody else with such antiquated notions as yours . There are a great many things that are expedient . " " I hate expedient things . I like just the easy , simple ' no ' and ' yes ' that was my darling mother 's rule . I 'm glad I 'm at least a birthright Friend . " Mr. Wingate was silent . He seemed to drop into a profound reverie , and the girl hesitated to disturb him , eager as she now was to be away . Finally , as she had made up her mind to speak , he did so himself . " Amy , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes  --  between ourselves . For mother 's sake we can never let it die . " " Will thee use it to me now and then ? It was the habit of my boyhood . Salome was my oldest friend . We 've played together in this very room , again and again . She was my good angel . Until  --  No matter . You are her child . Not like her at all in face or manner . She was always gentle , and shrank from giving pain . Truthful and puritanical as she was in her ideas , she had the tact , the knowledge to say things without hurting those whom she corrected . She corrected me often and often , when we were young , but she hurt me  --  never . Now , you  --  heigho ! " " Now , I hurt  --  thee . Of course . I speak first and think afterward . But does thee know , cousin Archibald , thee is the very queerest man I ever met ? " " Have you  --  has thee  --  known many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side and so  --  so  --  not nice on the other . Like a half-ripened pear . But I am sorry for thee . I wish I could do thee good . Do I speak it as thee wishes ? " " Indeed , yes . It is music , even though the words are unflattering enough . Well , I 'll not keep thee longer . And I do n't ask you to call attention to this whim of mine by saying ' thee ' in public , " he remarked , himself falling back into the habit of their intercourse . " No ; if I say ' thee , ' it is to be always , whenever I remember  --  like a bond to remind me I must be kind to thee for my mother 's sake . If she did thee good , I must try to do thee good too . " " In what way ? " Amy reflected . The first , most obvious way , would be by cheering his solitude . Yet she hesitated . The thing which had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had no right , until she consulted them , to commit herself . Yet she disliked to leave this lonely old fellow , without trying to make him glad . She sat down again in the chair from which she had risen and regarded him critically . " Oh , cousin Archibald , if thee were only a little bit different ! " " Thee , too ! " he laughed  --  actually laughed ; and the action seemed to clear his features like a sunburst . " Oh , of course . Well , it 's this way . To-morrow 's Christmas , is n't it ? " " So I 've heard . " " And somebody  --  Teamster John  --  has sent Cleena ' the furnishing of a good dinner , ' she told me . I do n't know when we may have another such a meal , one that thee would think fit to eat . I 'd like to ask thee to come and share it with us , instead of staying here alone , all grumpy with the gout . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going home to tell my people everything . About the picture and the donkey and all . If , after that , they agree with me that it would be nice to ask thee to spend the holiday with us , I 'll bring thee word . If I do , will thee come ? " Mr. Wingate leaned back in his easy-chair and hugged his gouty foot for so long and so silently that Amy grew impatient and rose . " Anyway , I must go home . I 've been here ever so much later than I meant to stay . Good-by . " " Wait ! How impetuous you  --  thee is . Well , I 've received a great many invitations to dine , from the banquets of bank presidents down to the boiled dinners of my own workmen , but I doubt if I ever received one so honest and so honestly expressed . " " Will thee come , if thee is asked ? " " Yes ; I 'll come  --  if I 'm asked . Do n't thee bother to walk all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night I have heard nothing to the contrary , I shall understand that I am expected to dine with my tenants at ' Spite House . ' At what hour , please ? " " On Christmas , dinner is usually at three o'clock . And , if thee pleases , it is no longer ' Spite ' but ' Charity House . ' My mother changed all that . Thee must not dishonor her wishes if thee loves her . " A wonderful , an almost beautiful change passed over the old man 's face . " Amy , thee speaks as if she were here still . " " She is to me . She always will be . Good-by . " She was gone , and the house seemed bigger and emptier after she had left it . But Archibald Wingate would not have had anybody know with what almost childish anxiety he waited the striking of the clock , as the hour of nine drew near . He had been judged a hard and bitter man . He was very human , after all . The small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strange way , wherein he might happily walk , and in secret he blessed her for it . But he was a man who liked his own will and to follow his own road still ; though he might do his utmost to bend that road in the direction she had elected . Meanwhile , he would have his supper sent in and sitting at ease before his own hearth-blaze review many plans . So he did , and after the supper a comfortable nap , from which he roused with a start , fancying the old clock in the hall was striking the hour . " Eh ? What ? Is it nine already ? That timepiece must be fast . " " It 's only me , sir , Marshall , with a bucket of coals . And , if you please , there 's a young person outside insists upon seeing you , sir . Am I to bid him go away until morning ? " In his disappointment the master 's face really paled . Marshall noticed it and wondered , but he knew enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be one of the times , and he therefore made no comment , nor even inquired for the master 's health . " No , do n't send anybody away . I fancy that was never the custom at Fairacres , on Christmas Eve , be the visitor who he might . We 'll not disturb the old ways , more than we can help . After all  --  Bid the messenger come in . " CHAPTER XXII . TWO WANDERERS RETURN . The " young person " to whom Marshall referred in such contemptuous terms was Lionel Percival Jones . He so announced himself , as he was ushered into the presence of the great man . " I 've come to bring a letter from Amy Kaye . " " Indeed ; would it not sound better if you said ' Miss Kaye , ' or ' Miss Amy ' ? She is a kinswoman of mine . " Lionel Percival was astonished . He had prepared himself for this visit with the utmost care . He had oiled his curly auburn locks with a scented pomatum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore his most aggressive necktie and his yellowest shoes , also his Sunday suit of clothes . With the exception of the necktie and the pomatum , he would not have attracted attention to himself anywhere , and so would have been well dressed . With these , he seemed to be all-pervading . He had instantly , by means of them , offended Mr. Wingate 's taste , and put himself at disadvantage . " Why , I 'd just as lief say ' Miss , ' but she 's a mill girl , same as my own sister . I did n't go to mean no harm . " The mill owner winced . Then inquired :  --  " Is there an answer expected ? " " Yes , sir . " " Very well . Wait here . " The master of Fairacres limped into the adjoining room and turned his back toward the door between , hiding his face from the lad 's observation as he read . " Humph ! She left it open , which is correct enough with reliable messengers . Probably , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , "  --  in which he wholly wronged the bearer . But Mr. Wingate had yet to learn that even lads who attire themselves atrociously may still be true gentlemen at heart , and sin in taste through ignorance only . This was the note :  --  " DEAR COUSIN ARCHIBALD WINGATE : My father and Hallam will be very happy to have thee dine with us to-morrow , Christmas Day . Cleena says that dinner will be served at three o'clock . If thee knew her as well as I do , thee would understand that she means not a minute before nor one afterward . If thee pleases , I would rather not have any ' business ' talk of any sort to-morrow . I would like it to be a day of peace , as my mother always kept it for us . Thee may meet some other guests , but we will try to make thee happy . " Good night , " AMY . " It was a very cheerful and smiling old gentleman who returned to the room where Lionel Percival waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation ; for since Amy had set him the example , the mill owner considered that she regarded such formality essential . Then he called in Marshall and bade him see that the messenger had a bit of supper before his return walk , which proceeding made the valet stare , and the boy feel exceedingly proud . It would be something of which to boast among his comrades at the mill . The morning proved a cloudless one , mild and merciful to such as suffered from gout , and Mr. Wingate drove himself to " Charity House " in his own little phaeton . He felt this was an occasion when Marshall 's too solicitous attentions might be in the way . He held a debate with himself , before setting off , whether he should or should not add to the feast from his own larder , and he decided against so doing by the simple test of " put yourself in his place . " But there was plenty and to spare . Teamster John did nothing by halves . Those who have least of this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared each dish with her best skill and waited upon her guests with smiling satisfaction . Afterward , in the kitchen , she and John discussed the strange reunion of their " betters , " and Cleena speculated upon it in her own fashion :  --  " Sure , there 's never fish , flesh , nor fowl could withstand the loving ways of me little colleen . And to hear them talkin ' together , like lambs in the field . Them  --  " " I never heerd lambs talkin ' , " observed John , facetiously . " Then it 's deaf ye 've been belike . Oh , me fathers , if here does n't come me own Gineral  --  Napoleon  --  Bonyparty ! Where have ye been avick , avick ? " she demanded , pushing hastily back from the board and hurrying out of doors . " Well , it 's proof o ' yer sense ye comes back in due time for a bit o ' the nicest turkey ever was roast . But it 's shamefaced ye be , small wonder o ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . Come by . Wash up , eat yer meat , an ' give thanks . To-morrow  --  I 'll settle old scores . Come by . " Yet when Fayette entered the kitchen and learned from John who were the guests in the dining room beyond , he scowled and would have gone away again . However , he had forgotten Cleena . That good woman , having received her prodigal back , did not intend to relinquish him . She saw his frown , his hasty movement , and shutting the door put her back against it . " You silly omahaun ! If your betters forgives an ' eats the bread o ' peace , what 's you to be settin ' such a face on the matter ? Come by . Be at peace . There 's the blessed little hunchback eatin ' cranberry sauce cheek by jowl with her ' boss , ' an ' ca n't you remember the Child was born for such as you , me poor silly lad ? Come by . " Fayette " came by " at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not resist the savory odors of the tempting food Cleena offered him . Yet in his heart there was still anger and evil intent ; and though he was amazed to find Mary Reese a guest at the Kayes ' table , as well as their " mortal enemy , " Mr. Wingate , he made no further comment , and as soon as the meal was over retreated without a word to his chamber and shut the door . " It 's like he might ha ' just stepped out yesternight , he drops into ways so quick , " said Cleena . " But he 's not the same lad . He 'll give somebody trouble before long . You do wrong , woman , to harbor him . He 's vindictive and dangerous . " The trustful Cleena laughed the teamster to scorn . " Faith , give a dog a bad name an ' he 'll earn it . Let the lad be . In old Ireland we call such the ' touched of God . ' We judge not , an ' that 's the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put that in your pipe an ' smoke it . " Surely , John thought , there was a deal of good sense and heart kindness in this stalwart daughter of Erin . He was Yankee himself , to the backbone ; yet , as he pushed back from the table , satisfied and at ease , he pulled from his pocket a small paper parcel . It was his Christmas gift for his hostess , and intended to suggest many things . She was bright enough to comprehend his meaning , if she chose . Would she ? She gave no sign , if she did , as she unrolled the package and placed its contents  --  a small flag of Ireland and its mate , in size , of the United States  --  behind the kitchen clock , where the blended colors made a bit of gayety upon the whitewashed wall . " Long may they wave ! " cried the donor . " Troth , I 'm not seein ' no wavin ' . They 're best as they be , with the timepiece betwixt . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mine 's here . So here I bides till I 'm no longer wanted . " " It 's a biggish house , " quoth the undismayed suitor . " There 's room in it for me , too , I cal'late . " But if Cleena heard this remark she ignored it , passing swiftly into the dining room to remove the dishes of the first course , and substituting the luxury of a basket of fruit which she had accumulated somehow , as only herself could have explained . Maybe there is no trivial thing that so greatly helps to bridge over a trying situation as good breeding . The breeding which is really good , out of the inner life : kindness and the reluctance to inflict pain . It was such breeding that enabled the oddly assorted company at that Christmas dinner table to pass the hours of their intercourse not only in peace , but with absolute enjoyment . Finally , when the elders pushed back their chairs , Mr. Kaye proposed that Amy should sing some of the old-time ballads familiar to the childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his mother 's guitar and tuned it , and his sister placed herself beside him . " Ah , how well I remember that little instrument , " cried Mr. Wingate , " and the commotion it caused among the Friends . Music used to be the most ' worldly ' and undesirable thing , but they are more tolerant now . Give us ' Lang Syne , ' youngsters . It 's the song for the day and  --  this hour . " It was . They sang it lustily , and Amy was amazed to hear how finely that deep voice of their cousin could fill in the pauses of her own treble , sweet but not strong . Then there was " Annie Laurie , " and " Edinboro ' Toon , " and " Buy my Caller Herrin ' , " and others ; till Cleena drew John to the door to listen and applaud , forgetting for once the big pile of dishes standing unwashed upon her kitchen table . " For , aye , it 's a time o ' peace , thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never a doubt I doubt . What 's a bit o ' idlin ' when a sight for saints is afore ye ? If Fayetty , now  --  " But Fayette was not there . Neither was he in his own room when Cleena sought him there . He had left it while she was off guard and had made his escape unseen . Forces of good and evil were tormenting him : the struggle to do right and please these good friends , and the greater yearning to seek the wrong path to revenge . Yet , after all , what was this poor human waif to these happier folk ? So he asked himself as he sneaked away in the twilight which hid his departure . Had Amy heard the question , she would have answered it promptly : " Much , Fayette . Everybody one knows is something to one 's self . " But she did not even hear of his brief visit , for , having discovered his fresh defection , Cleena decided to keep the matter to herself . It was getting quite late when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fairacres , and as he went he pondered of many things . Once or twice he fancied he saw a lurking shadow in the road , that was not due to either bush or tree which bordered it . But he thought little of the matter , so engrossed was he with the recollections of the evening . " Queer , what a pleasant time I had . Yet we are all , practically , enemies . Each side feels that the other side has been at fault . Anyway , I seem to hear Salome saying : ' Judge not my children by the mistakes of their parents . ' Nor will I ; of that I am resolved . I 'll give even that top-lofty lad , Hallam , a fair show , by and by . I must test him a little longer first , then I 'll begin . That is , if he 's made of the right stuff . As for Amy , she 's a witch . She 's wheedled the heart right out of me with her bright , unflinching , honest eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for the mill folks . ' The right sort of club , with books and pictures and everything helpful . ' The saucebox ! and she earning the mighty wage of two-fifty per week . Well , all in good course . I have n't toiled a lifetime to attain my object , then relinquish it without a little enjoyment of it ; though , after all , possession is n't everything . The struggle was about as enjoyable as the result . But I succeeded ! I am master of Fairacres , of Ardsley Mills , of half all Ardsley township . The old family is still on top . But , I 'll buy Cuthbert 's great picture and burn it up  --  sometime . Hmm . Wonder where that visionary Frederic Kaye is , of whose unpractical schemes I am reaping the benefit . Odd  --  buried himself in California , so to speak , and the only visible proofs that he had ever reached that happy land are a couple of braying burros.  --  Hello ! hello , I say ! Who 's that ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track of the mill owner 's phaeton had suddenly become a reality . His horse was seized , forced backward , the horsewhip wrenched from its socket , and before he could defend himself Mr. Wingate 's head and shoulders felt the cuts of the whip , delivered in swift and furious intensity . " Hold on ! hold  --  on ! What  --  who  --  stop , stop , s-t-o-p ! You 're killing me ! What 's wanted ? It 's murder  --  murder ! " And again after another visitation of stripes , that awful cry of " mur-der ! " The word holds its own horror . No one can thus hear it shouted , in the stillness of the night , unmoved . It affected even the ferocious assailant of the lonely old man , and arrested his further blows . " Murder . " That meant death , prison , everything that was hateful . Even to Fayette 's dull brain there penetrated some realization of what his present deed implied . For this was he who had waylaid an " enemy " on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own wrongs , and his anger flamed afresh . " Thought you could do all the lickin ' , did ye ? How many times did you have me thrashed ? What did you care if the man who thrashed me ' bout killed me ? What was I , only ' Bony , ' out o ' the poor farm ! Ugh , you old rascal ! Take that , and that , and that . Huckleberries ! but it 's fun to settle such scores . " The old horse which Mr. Wingate drove stood quiet in the road , else the matter might have had a different ending ; for had she run and dragged her now helpless master , he would surely have been killed . As it was , she did not move , so there was nothing to deaden the sound of the sharp blows Fayette administered ; and in the silence of the place and night this sound carried far . It reached the ears of a foot passenger , toiling up the mill road toward Fairacres and quickened his pace . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt himself caught by his collar and heard a stern voice demanding :  --  " What 's this ? Hold ! Stop ! This  --  here , in Ardsley ? " Fayette looked up . The man who had gripped him was much taller than he , and seemed in that dim light a giant for strength . The capture brought back all those visions of punishment and the prison . In a twinkling the agile lad had writhed himself free from his short coat and leaped away into the darkness . The newcomer heard a sound of retreating footsteps and mocking laughter , then turned his attention to the injured man in the phaeton . " An old fellow , too , he seems . Hello ! Are you alive ? Hey ! Ca n't you speak ? That 's serious . " The stranger 's actions were alert and decided . He gently raised the bent figure of the unconscious Mr. Wingate to as comfortable a position as he could , stepped into the vehicle , and took up the reins . " If nothing is changed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for such a home-coming . Get up there , nag ! " Not since the days of her youth had the sorrel mare been forced into such a pace as then . The rescuer drove for life and death , and as if all turnings of the old road were familiar to him . Nor did he slacken rein until he reached the front door of the mansion , and sung out in a voice to wake great echoes :  --  " Hello , there ! Come out ! A man in distress ! " This hello reached the stable , where Fayette was loosing Balaam , and roused that intelligent beast to speak his opinion concerning these disturbances of his rest . Marshall , hurrying to answer the imperative demand at the front door , heard the burro 's bray of protest , though he paid it small attention then , because of the nearer demand . Holding his candle high above his head , he slid back the bolts and peered out , but the sight which met his gaze set him trembling like an aspen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happened ? Have they murdered you out of hand ? Ah , but my mind misgave me how ' t would be . To think it  --  to think it ! " " Hush ! Put down the candle . Give a lift ; he 's powerful heavy . Is this your master ? " The servant retreated . This might be the very person who had done the mill owner such terrible injury . He would put his own precious anatomy out of harm 's reach . " Oh , you fool ! Come back . You 're safe . Leave that door open . I 'll bring him in myself . Make way there  --  quick ! " Marshall tried to barricade the entrance to the room beyond the hall by means of his own plump body , and was promptly kicked aside , as the stranger strode past him , bearing the unconscious man upon his shoulder , very much as if he had been a bag of meal . " Is this your master ? " " Y-ye-s . Who  --  are you  --  ordering  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything  --  at once . I 'm Frederic Kaye . " CHAPTER XXIII . FREDERIC KAYE 'S WELCOME HOME . The excitement at Ardsley was intense . Never had its quiet precincts been disturbed by a crime so unprovoked and dastardly . " To strike a man in the dark . " " To waylay an old fellow like that . The man is a coward , whoever he be , that did it . " " Poor old ' boss . ' He was n't to say over lovable , in ordinary , but I 'd pity even a scoundrel got treated that way . " " He ought to be punished with his own stripes . " " Oh , he 'll get what he deserves . Never fear . If old man Wingate had been poor  --  well , you might say . But a rich man has friends . " Such talk all through the mill , on that day after Christmas , interfered seriously with the customary labor . But it was small wonder ; and though he tried to enforce discipline and keep things running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious . The news of the assault upon the mill owner had spread rapidly . At first the story told by the stranger , who had so suddenly and opportunely appeared upon the scene , was given credence . Then , when it was remembered that this stranger , now known to be Frederic Kaye , had been injured and supplanted by Archibald Wingate , a faint suspicion began to rise in men 's minds . Only those who have suffered from it know with what terrible rapidity an unjust rumor grows and spreads . Inoculated by this evil germ , even the fairest judgment becomes diseased . Those who had best known Frederic Kaye , the old people who recalled his frank , impetuous , happy-go-lucky boyhood , here in the town where he was born and bred ; those who had received good from his hand , and nothing but good ; even these joined with the baser sort in considering the night attack upon the mill owner " quite natural . Just what might have been expected . " " Of course no one knows what sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping-off place of creation . " So , instead of finding himself among friends , the returned citizen discovered that he was among enemies , under the basest of suspicions . He had remained all night at Fairacres , with the doctor so hastily summoned there . This gentleman was an old acquaintance , and from him Mr. Frederic , as he had always been called in distinction from Mr. Kaye , the artist and his brother-in-law , learned the history of the past weeks . Yes , even of years . " It 's a pity , a great pity ! When I failed to pay what I owed on the property here , and Salome , my sister , saw that I would lose everything unless somebody came to my aid , she did so . I hoped , I fully expected , to be able to return what she advanced . All the world knows now that I was not . " " She was not the first person who has been ruined by injudicious indorsement . " The Californian winced . His home-coming was proving a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than disappointment was yet in store . " Well , bad luck has pursued me . I have lost in every speculation I ever undertook . The last I tried was the evaporation of fruits . There 's money in it , if I had the capital  --  " " Then you did not know how badly things were going with your sister ? " " I never dreamed it . You knew her well  --  Salome was never a whiner . If she had even intimated the straits which she was in , I would have thrown up every chance and come back at once , to put my shoulder to the wheel in some shape . I would n't have permitted it . " " How happen you here just now ? " " My niece , Amy , wrote me of her mother 's death . It was a brief , heart-broken little letter . I have it here . It brought me home , but I still fancied that home was this house . " The gentleman took from his pocket a small envelope and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , extremely short and gave only the facts . " MY DEAR UNCLE FREDERIC : Our mother is dead . She is buried at Quaker cemetery . My father and Hallam are well . So is Cleena . I do n't know how to write to you because you are really a stranger to me . The burros are both well . Your loving " AMY KAYE . " " There , that 's all . It was enough to bring me clear across the continent , however . My heart aches ; I should have come sooner . Oh , for one sight of Salome 's beautiful face before  --  " He dropped his head on his hand and a sob shook the strong frame . The doctor rose and busied himself about his patient . He respected the brother 's grief , and he liked this man , unthrifty and neglectful as he might have been . Then Marshall made a sign , and the physician left the room so quietly that Mr. Kaye did not hear him go . Outside , in the hall , the valet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he live ? " he questioned in a whisper . " Time will tell . I hope so , " was the unsatisfactory response . " Well , if he do n't , that 's his  --  murderer . " The other sprang back as if he had been struck . " Man , take care what you say ! How dare you ? " " Ai n't it reasonable ? Did n't he say he was the man that owned the mill , this house , everything before master did ? Who else had a grudge against the poor old man ? " " Lots of people , I reckon . It wo n't hurt him to tell the truth . He was as testy as a snapping turtle  --  you know that . Plenty of folks disliked him . Most likely the person who attacked him was a tramp who hoped to find money . By the way , did anybody look to see if there had been robbery as well as assault ? " " I did . No ; there was n't anything stole , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  why it must have been  --  " Dr. Wise laid his hand on Marshall 's shoulder . " Look here , man , you stop that talk . Not another word of it . How dare you , I say how dare you , thrust suspicion upon an innocent man ? I 'd stake my life on the integrity of any Kaye was ever born . Unfortunate this returned wanderer may be , but  --  If you let me hear one single word more of such fol-de-rol , I 'll make it hot for you . Understand ? Have n't we got enough on our hands to keep your master alive ? There must be quiet here , absolute quiet . It 's your business to have it maintained ; and if you do n't , I 'll have you punished as accessory to the deed . Hear me ? " All this had been delivered in the lowest tone possible , yet each syllable was as distinctly enunciated as if it had been shouted . The doctor knew Marshall . He chose that idle threat of " accessory " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was all very well , so far as it went . Unfortunately , the doctor was not the only person to whom the valet had already announced his suspicion . There were other servants in the kitchen , and they had been swiftly poisoned by his opinion . So that when , after a sleepless night of watching beside his kinsman 's bed , Frederic Kaye set off for " Charity House " and his relatives , he was even then a marked man . Into the sacredness of reunion , when the little family on the knoll were discussing all that had befallen them , on either side , and the two men were renewing old affections , while Hallam and Amy were forming new ones for this new uncle , there came an alarming summons . A local officer of the law presented himself before the group and on behalf of the public safety arrested the stranger . " Arrest me ? Why , what in the name of justice do you mean ? " " Just what I say . For the attack upon a peaceful citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there by your villainous hand , " repeated the sheriff , solemnly . He so seldom had opportunity to exercise his office that he now embellished it with all the dignity possible . " Indeed , take care of your words , friend ! It was a case of rescue , not attack . You are slightly mixed in your ideas , sir . I found him suffering a terrible horsewhipping at the hands of somebody whom I do not know , who slipped away from me when I seized him , and disappeared in the darkness . I was too anxious over Mr. Wingate to notice , or even care , which direction the rascal took . But  --  aha , it 's too absurd ! " " Remember that whatever you say will be used against you , " cautioned the officer of the law . " Let it . I could ask no better treatment . " " You say you grabbed a fellow . What was he like ? " " It was too dark to see distinctly . He appeared rather tall and slim . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he laughed harshly as he ran . Somehow , that laugh gave me the impression that the man was demented . But I have nothing else to judge by , and I would not be unjust . The thing for which to be thankful is that Dr. Wise hopes my kinsman 's injuries are not fatal . " " Hmm . All the same , sir , you will have to go with me . " Frederic Kaye turned toward his friends a countenance which expressed as much amusement as annoyance . Cuthbert Kaye had risen , and his face was white with indignation . The sight of this , determined his brother-in-law to yield quietly to the inevitable . He had heard much during his night with Dr. Wise of the artist 's recent condition , and he felt it would be criminal to let him become excited now . So he laid his hand affectionately upon the trembling shoulder , and remarked , with laughing disdain :  --  " Why , lad , do n't think of it . It 's a ludicrous mistake , of course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to go with this gentleman ; and I doubt not I 'll be back in time for dinner . Why , Cleena , woman , take care ! It 's delightful to find you so loyal to your ' black sheep , ' but fisticuffs wo n't answer , nor even a shillalah . " This was a diversion , and everybody laughed . For Cleena had advanced threateningly toward the sheriff , raising her rolling-pin , that she happened to have in hand , as if she would bring it down upon his offending head . Her hand dropped to her side , but her eyes did not cease to hurl contempt upon the officer , as , under cover of the merriment resulting , Frederic Kaye himself led the way out of the house toward the " bar of justice . " Because Cleena fancied that Amy had taken cold , the girl had remained at home that morning , but she now begged to be allowed to return to the mill . " I want to go and see Mr. Metcalf . He 'll be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , and I 'd rather tell him the story myself . " " If you go , I will too , " said Hallam , quickly . " I 'll have no holidays you do not share . " " Nonsense ! Your work is ' piece work . ' If you get behind at one time , you can make it up at another . The superintendent told me you could soon bring it home to do , if you wished . " " But I shall not wish  --  not for the present . Let us both go . " Mr. Kaye looked up as if he would remonstrate . Then he took up a western newspaper that their guest had laid down , and began to read . But his children had seen his glance , and interpreted it to themselves by a swift exchange of their own . Amy 's eyes spoke to her brother 's , as plainly as words :  --  " We must n't leave him alone to-day , " and Hallam 's had telegraphed back :  --  " No , I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , father , Hal is not half so necessary to the success of Ardsley Mill as I am . He 's going to help you mount those sketches this morning , while I hunt up Uncle Frederic , and try to get a ' day off ' to visit with him . Cleena must dish up the remains of the yesterday dinner for us , and we 'll keep Christmas over again . Is n't it just lovely , lovely , to have one 's relatives turn up in this delightful fashion ? First , Cousin Archibald , behaving just like other folks ; and now this romantic arrival of the long-lost uncle . Good-by . I 'll be back as soon as I can . " Mr. Kaye and Hallam repaired to the upper floor as Amy went away , but Cleena remained standing for a long time , motionless in the middle of the room . Her head was bent , and her gaze fixed , as if she were studying some matter deeply . Finally she roused with a mighty sigh and stalked out of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's an ' up an ' down , so fast it makes a body dizzy in their wits . That boy , Fayetty , one day as good as a fine fish o ' Friday ; the next  --  eatin ' me heart out with the worry . Never a doubt I doubt ' t was himself belabored the old man on his road home . There 's bad blood ' twixt ' em . But I 'll aye see if he 's in his bed the now . " So she ascended to the back chamber that Fayette used . To her knock there came , at first , no response ; but she kept on with her tapping and interspersed this with coaxing tones , and finally a voice answered her . " What you want ? " " Yerself , avick . " " Well , you ca n't have me . " " Can I no ? It 's two makes a bargain . " " Clear out . " " After you is manners for me . Come by . " " Leave me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have ye heard the fine doin 's ? No ? " " What doings ? " " The lad 's back from foreign parts , Miss Amy 's uncle . He 's the one has donkeys in his pocket . Heard ye ever o ' him ? " " Where 's he at ? " " Faith , I d ' know . Belike he 's after takin ' a stroll about , meetin ' old friends . What for no ? Come on an ' help me get a fine dinner out o ' scraps . " " Suppose he 'd give me one ? " " Never a doubt I doubt , he 'll give ye all ye deserve . Come by . There 's kindlin ' to split an ' praties to peel , an '  --  Whist ! What 's that I hear ? " Fayette 's curiosity was very strong . It had led him into trouble more than once . It now induced him to open the door and peep through . " What 's that , Cleena ? Anything happenin ' ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " " Sure , if ye 're askin ' , I 'm believin ' it 's Willyum Gladstone happenin ' down in your minin ' hole . " " Huckleberries ! " The door flew open , Fayette rushed by as if he could not move half fast enough . It seemed to Cleena he cleared the stairs with two bounds , and an instant after she heard him hurrying into the cellar at the same headlong pace . " Hmm . I thought that 'd fetch him , " she chuckled . Then she suddenly remembered that she had once heard the lad speak of using " giant powder , " or some such explosive in his work of the underground passage . She had strictly forbidden this , and had carefully watched lest any suspicious material might be brought upon the premises . She had even persuaded Teamster John to examine the trench and the articles which Fayette had placed there . He had found nothing wrong , and the pick and the shovel had been so long disused that they had rusted . Of late Cleena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt , while she was busy at other things . " Alanna , the day ! " Cleena followed her leader only a trifle less swiftly , and reached the top of the cellar stairs just in time to receive a whirling object plump in her arms . The object was the incipient statesman , and in a second more the half-wit had also reached the kitchen floor and had shut the door behind him . " I 'll teach him to interfere with my gold mine ! " CHAPTER XXIV . FAIRACRES IS CLOSED . " Oh , Mr. Metcalf , may I come in ? " The superintendent was alone in his office and admitted Amy at once . " Such strange things have happened , I 've not come to work to-day , but to ask your help . My Uncle Frederic  --  " " Sit down , child , you are breathless with haste . You need n't talk . I have heard your news . Dr. Wise has sent me a message . I am expecting him here immediately . " " Is n't it dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his grave face emphasized his words . He knew Archibald Wingate better than anybody else could know him . He was the rich man 's confidential employee , from whom no weaknesses were hid . He believed the mill owner to be vindictive , and he had heard his often-expressed contempt for the " whole family of Kaye , so far as its men are concerned . " Of course , this had been some time ago ; before Fairacres had become Mr. Wingate 's home . Since then his enmity toward his relatives had seemed to slumber , it had even altered to a sort of friendliness ; yet Mr. Metcalf had no faith in the endurance of this friendliness should any test be put upon it . The attack of the night before had pointed suspicion very strongly toward one of " the Kayes , " and should the victim recover , he would , doubtless , prosecute to the full extent of the law the person who had assaulted him . " Do you know how he is ? " " Of whom do you ask ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sorry for him . If I had n't to work , I would go and take care of him , if he 'd let me . " " I do n't think he would . Besides , you would not be either strong or wise enough . He must have trained nursing , the best obtainable . I hear that he has recovered consciousness and is resting quietly . What complications may arise one can not foresee . He has been a high liver , and he is an old man ; but I hope for the best . I hope it not only for his sake , but everybody 's concerned . " " Was n't it queer that that man , that officer ,  --  a sheriff he called himself ,  --  should come after my uncle ? It frightened my father , so Hallam stayed with him . I 'm sorry to be away from my place to-day , but Cleena fancies I have taken cold . Then , too , since Uncle Frederic came , of course I should devote myself to him . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even under his sorrow about my mother he is as sunshiny as possible . He 's like a fresh west wind that ' airs ' a house so wonderfully . I do want you to see him ; and I came to ask if you 'd just go and explain to that sheriff how silly it is to suspect him . " Mr. Metcalf regarded Amy for a moment in silence . With all her good sense , she was as ignorant as a child of many things in practical life . He answered her very gently :  --  " I expect to see him soon , that is my intention . Dr. Wise and I will become his ' bail ' , so that he can soon be set at liberty . " " I do not understand you . What do you mean ? " " Why , this : your uncle has been arrested upon suspicion of waylaying and assaulting Mr. Wingate . He will be imprisoned unless somebody becomes surety for him , that he will appear at court when summoned to stand his trial and prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know this , though extremely disagreeable for me to speak of it . " Amy 's face paled as he talked . She did not wonder that her father had been frightened . The thing was horrible , and the disgrace of it crushed her . She bowed her head beneath its weight , and sat silent so long that the superintendent was moved to rise and comfort her . " Do n't take it so to heart , my child ; there is , of course , some great mistake . The thing is  --  to find out who the real assailant was and bring him to justice . This , unfortunately , will be a difficult matter . " " No ; I wo n't mind it . Why should I ? If he had done this wicked thing , I should be right to feel shame ; but he did n't . Oh ! I 've just thought of something that might help . Uncle Frederic said he caught the man by the collar , and the man slipped out of his coat and ran away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Several persons , my own messenger among others . There is no trace of any garment anywhere near the highroad . If we could find that , as you say , it would simplify matters greatly . Come with me ; I heard Nanette wishing she could show you her Christmas gifts . To hear her describe each , one would imagine she could see them . She is so interested about Balaam , too . She wonders where he is , and if he misses Pepita as much as she would miss one of her numerous sisters . When Dr. Wise has been here and we have concluded our business , I will call for you , probably , with your uncle . I have a new horse I 'm anxious to try , and things are so unsettled here to-day  --  " " Unsettled ? " " Yes ; Ardsley does n't often have such a sensation as its wealthiest citizen being horsewhipped . It 's difficult to get the hands to work regularly . It 's just as well you do not try , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of questions , idle as the people who would put them . " In his kind heart he wished to save her not only the questions , but the shadow which might rest upon her because of her misjudged relative . By nightfall , or earlier , he was determined to have the Californian set at liberty . It was an outrage that one who acted the good Samaritan should receive such reward , and he believed that two as influential townsmen as Dr. Wise and himself could , by their indorsement of the prisoner , turn the tide of public opinion in his favor . So Amy went again to the Metcalf home and forgot all her cares in the midst of its bright young people . The hours went swiftly round , and it was not till the gate clicked and a trio of gentlemen came striding up the path that she remembered how anxious she had been . Then she sped out of the house and flung herself into her uncle 's arms . " Oh , I 'm so glad they found out their mistake ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metcalf , may I show him his own little Pepita , that was ? And thank you for helping him to explain , or for the ' bail , ' and everything . Thank you , too , Dr. Wise . Do you know how Mr. Wingate is ? " " Improving . He 's pretty badly scared and shocked , but I think he will come out all right . " " Can he tell who struck him ? That would clear everything up all right . " " Yes ; it would be a simple solution of the matter . I am hoping he will be able to tell , after a while ; but for the present my object is to prevent , as far as possible , his recalling the incident . He must not be excited , else there may be fever . But all in good time , I think . Now Mr. Metcalf has invited us to ride behind his new horse . I have an hour of leisure , and I propose to show this old Ardsley boy the changes a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear anything about a small girl named Amy being one of the party ? " " Indeed , you did . Oh , what a treat ! A real Christmas gift . To ride behind a brand new horse , beside a brand new uncle , in a brand new carriage , is enough to turn my head ; so forgive me if I 'm silly  --  sillier than common . And oh , Mr. Metcalf , ca n't Nanette go too ? She 's so little she takes up no room worth mentioning , and I love her . " It was a merry party . Amy believed that all the morning 's trouble had been overcome , and did not realize that being out on bail was in itself sort of an imprisonment to a man of honor . Until the real culprit was found Frederic Kaye would still be under suspicion ; yet he could enjoy his parole , and this ride had been purposely planned by his friends as a means of influencing that variable public opinion which had first promptly misjudged him . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past all its business places , and lingered by the haunts of the village gossips , that Ardsleyites might see and comment . " Well , if that do n't beat all ! " exclaimed Mrs. Hackett to her customers . " There 's Dr. Wise and the ' Supe ' driving Mister Fred all over creation . I guess they do n't believe anything against him , bad as things look . I do n't know as ' t is right , either . I guess I 'll wait and see before I make up my mind . " But having already spread the " news " by means of every villager who had visited her place of business that morning , this was rather late in season to stem the tide of rumor ; though on the principle of " better late than never , " it may have done some good . When the ride was over and the Kayes deposited at the door of " Charity House , " Amy was in the wildest of spirits . It seemed to her as if the world were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her . The gentlemen accompanied Mr. Frederic into the new home and spent an hour delightfully with the artist , amid his pictures . Then Cleena , aided by Amy , brought in a tray of luncheon , and they stayed to share it . " Blessings on Teamster John 's turkey . What a lot of comfort it has given lots of folks ! " remarked Amy to Cleena , in the kitchen , as she surveyed the neatly arranged tray . " Yes , so be . Arrah musha , were the man as sensible as his fowl I 'd know . But , colleen , keep an eye to that back door . Fayette 's behind , in the store closet . It 's behind he must stay or there 's mischief a-brewin ' . " " Indeed , I wonder he is n't putting himself forward , to attract Uncle Frederic 's notice , as he always does of strangers . Well , poor lad , I fancy the introduction can wait . When you 've carried in the tray , I 'll go and serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the guests departed , Hallam became absorbed in the new magazines that his uncle produced from his valise ; while the elder Kayes dropped back into the reminiscences that were so interesting to themselves and so dull to Amy . Try as she would , now that all was quiet , she could not keep from her mind a picture of Archibald Wingate , riding home from a pleasant visit and suffering such mischance . " My first little dinner-party , too . I must go and see him . I must tell him that I am sorry . I must offer to help . " So , after a while , as the afternoon waned , Amy put on her outdoor things , and telling only Cleena her errand , set off for Fairacres . She was admitted by a strange servant , and was passing straight toward the room which her cousin occupied when she was met and prevented by Marshall . " If you please , miss , he 's allowed to see nobody . " " Not even me ? Surely , I will not disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that will hurt him . I just want to satisfy myself how badly he 's injured , and maybe smile at him . Just that little bit . Oh , Mr. Marshall , is n't it so sad ! I 'm so very , very sorry . " " Yes , and well you might be , miss . No , not even to look at him . He 's not to be worried by nobody . " So Amy went sorrowfully home again , and as she had to resume her labor in the mill at such an early hour the following day , she could not repeat her visit until another night came round . Frederic Kaye had gone to the mansion , however , and had been coldly assured by the officious Marshall that " the master was doing well . " This bulletin had been issued through the upper half of the old-fashioned door , which opened across its middle , and to effect an entrance the caller would have had to force the bolts of the lower half . The valet regarded the Californian with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-founded ; and he had not forgotten the feel of the stranger 's boot-toe on the night of the accident . So he kept a safe barricade of the premises , and Frederic also went away unsatisfied . For several days these visits were repeated , with similar results ; but when Sunday came round and she had daylight for her purpose , Amy again hurried to Fairacres . " I 'll see him this time , if I have to climb over Marshall 's objecting shoulders , " she merrily cried to Cleena , as she departed . But when she reached the old homestead she found it desolate . The light snow which had fallen overnight lay everywhere undisturbed . No paths had been cleared nor entrances swept . The windows were closed and shuttered as Amy never had seen them . Even the stables were shut up and deserted ; and after a half hour of vain efforts to arouse somebody , the disappointed girl returned to " Charity House . " " Troth , ye went away like a feather , an ' you come home like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's gone . I ca n't see him . I ca n't tell him . Oh , I 'm so sorry , so sorry ! " To comfort her , Uncle Frederic paid a visit to Dr. Wise , and came back with news that was not very satisfactory . Without consulting the physician , Mr. Wingate had suddenly decided to go south for the winter . Marshall had attended to everything . The horses and cattle had been sent from Fairacres to one of the outlying farms belonging to the estate . There was no reference to future return , and Mr. Metcalf had been instructed to settle all accounts . Beyond this there was no mention of anybody , and no address was left except that of the mill owner 's city bankers , who would forward any necessary papers . Mr. Wingate had gone away for absolute rest , and wished not to hear from Ardsley unless under extreme necessity . So Amy 's dream of a reunited family , of that peace and happiness which should exist between Fairacres and " Charity House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans took its place , and she returned to her mill work on the Monday , too busy and eager to spend time in useless regret . " The best thing about life , " observed this wise young person to her Uncle Frederic , " is that it has to keep right on . There 's so much to do , and the days are so short , if a body grieves one moment he 's sure to laugh the next . And , uncle , I 've such a lovely idea about a ' club ' for the mill folks . To take the place of one that  --  does n't seem to help them much . I believe you 're the very man to arrange everything , and that you were sent home just in time . " " Wh-e-w ! A Daniel come to judgment ? No , a faithful daughter of a brave , unselfish woman . You 'll never be Salome , little girl , but maybe you will be an improvement even on her . All her good sense with a little more  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fancy , " laughed she , and sped down the hill to join Gwendolyn for her walk millward . CHAPTER XXV . MYSTERIES AND MASTERIES . " Sure , Mister Frederic , I 'd be proud to show ye the cellar that 's doin ' below . Would he mind comin ' the now ? " " A ' cellar below ' is surely in its proper place . I 'll be delighted to view it , Mistress Goodsoul . " " Alanna , it was ever yourself had a jest an ' a twist of a body 's words ! To my notion , it 's a tidy job , but I sometimes misgives it 's no all right for the house . " " Then it surely should be looked after . Who 's doing it for you ? " " That silly one I was tellin ' you about . He 's  --  he 's  --  " The woman glanced over her shoulder , as if she feared to be heard . This was a curious circumstance in the case of one so frank as she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so mysterious , Cleena ? Secrets afoot ? But it 's after Christmas , not before it . " " Come by . " He followed her gayly down the stairs into the one central cellar , and from this slightly farther into another , being opened toward the side . She carried a lighted candle in her hand , and pointed with pride to the neatness of the work as far as it had proceeded . " Nobody could ha ' done it finer , eh ? " " It seems all right . The walls will have to be supported , of course , though it looks a solid rock . Old Ingraham obeyed the Scripture injunction in letter , if not in spirit . What does Cuthbert think of this ? " " The same as of most things  --  nothin ' at all . So long as he 's his bit pictures an ' books to pore over , the very house might tumble about his ears an ' no heed . There 's been no nerve frettin ' nor crossness since the mistress was called  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's aye good ye 're come home , Mister Fred . " " And it 's good to hear you say so , old friend . Yet if it suits you just as well , I 'd prefer to have you say it up in the open . I 'm not a lover of dark cellars , or of holes that may be cellars some day . Come out of it ; it gives me the ' creeps . ' " " Ye believe it 's all safe , eh ? " " Safe enough so far . " " Come by . If you like not this place , you must e'en bide the kitchen a bit . I 've somewhat to speak to you . " Cleena started back over the way they had come , and Mr. Kaye was following her , when he stumbled against something soft , and fell headlong in the mud ; but he was up again in an instant , no worse for the accident save by the soil upon his clothing . He had grasped the thing over which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello ! Seems to me I 've seen this garment , or felt it , before . That peculiarity of a cloth coat with a leather collar is noticeable . Whose is it , Cleena ? " " Fetch it , " she commanded tersely , and he obeyed her . Once in the better lighted kitchen she extinguished the candle , carefully closed all the doors , and seated herself near her visitor . She had taken the coat from him , and laid it upon her own knees . Her manner was still full of that mystery which consorted so oddly with her honest , open face . " I thought so . I thought so , so I did . " " Very likely . " " Cease yer haverin ' , lad . There 's matter here . " " Considerable . Upon my clothes , too . The matter seems to be of the same sort  --  rather brown and sticky , what the farmers call ' loom . ' " " Know you whose coat this be ? " " Never a know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nonsense with this old friend of his youth . " It 's Fayetty 's . " " Your superior cellar digger ? Whew ! " He had now become quite as serious as she desired . " Cleena , this is a bad business . This coat was on the back of the man who horsewhipped Mr. Wingate . " " I thought it ; but , mind you , me lad , he 's not for punishin ' . " " Hold on , he certainly is . Do n't you know that I  --  I , a Kaye , am under suspicion of this dastardly thing ? Of course you do . Well , then , I 'm going to step out from under the suspicion with neatness and despatch . How long have you been hiding this , Cleena ? " " The poor chap 's been here ever since . Only once a day he slips out , but he 's back by night . Oh , he 's safe enough the now . " " Glad of it . Like to have him handy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , I 'll walk into the village and inform the sheriff , or somebody who should know . " " You 'll do naught like it . " " Why , Cleena , woman , have you lost your good sense ? " " Have I saved it , no ? Hear me . I know ' t was me poor little Gineral Bonyparty ' t did the deed . I knew , soon as I heard the tale o ' the coat . You 're no so stupid yerself . You recognized it immediate . It was a part o ' his uniform he wore a-paradin ' . His notion ' t would save the collar clean o ' the jacket I fixed him . He 's never no care in all his hard life till he met up with me . The poor little gossoon ! " " Cleena , Cleena , turncoat ! Was n't I once , on a day gone by , another ' poor little gossoon ' ? But come , drop nonsense ; it 's a disgracefully serious business for me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' the family I say it . The lad 's for no punishin ' . Not yet . You 're big an ' strong , an ' uncommon light o ' heart . It 'll do ye no harm . The suspicioned you must be till  --  Wait lad . You loved the mistress , Salome ? " " Why , Cleena , you know it ! " " Love you her childer ? " " Dearly ; for their sakes I must shake off this obnoxious misjudgment . " He shrugged his shoulders as if the obloquy were a tangible load that could be shifted . " Hallam , the cripple , that 's walked never a step since a diny dony thing , an ' a bad nurse set him prone on the cold stones o ' the nasty cellar house where her kind lived . That winter in the town , an ' me mindin ' the mistress with Miss Amy a babe . How could we watch all the time ? He must have the air , what for no ? An ' her with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damp stones she 'd put him , whiles off with her young man she 'd be trapesin ' , an ' him made a cripple for life . " " Yes , Cleena , I remember it all . And how , as Amy tells me , almost a fortune has been spent to restore him . But if ever I earn enough to try again , I 'll never rest till every doctor in the world , who understands such things , shall tell me there is no hope . " " Good lad . Aye , aye , good lad ! " The gentleman looked at her in amazement . This had been the old servant 's term of commendation when he had refrained from some of his youthful and natural mischievousness . She seemed to mean it just as earnestly now . Suddenly she leaned forward and placed her hands upon his knees . " Say it again , avick . You 'd do all in your power for me darlin ' Master Hallam , what for no ? " " What idleness to ask ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The Kayes are aye proud , in troth . Yer honor , lad ; even yer honor ? " " Hmm , well  --  yes . Even my honor . " " Hark to me . " For five minutes thereafter Cleena talked , and not once did her listener interrupt . Her words were spoken in that sibilant whisper that is louder than ordinary speech , and not one of them was lost . When she had finished , she rose and demanded , laying her hand upon Mr. Kaye 's shoulder :  --  " Now , Mister Fred , will ye leave me gineral be ? " " Yes , Cleena . For the present , till a final test comes , he shall be safe from any interference from me . I 'll take him under my personal protection . I 'll make myself his friend . He shall have a fair chance . If he fails  --  " " He 'll no fail ! he 'll no fail , laddie ! Such as him is the Lord 's own . Whist , alanna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking stealthily , and casting furtive glances toward that part of the building where the guest had hitherto remained . Apparently satisfied that the coast was clear , he crept to the door and tapped it twice . Cleena nodded her head , and Frederic Kaye opened to admit the boy , who would have retreated when he saw the stranger , had not his arm been caught and held so firmly he could not writhe himself free . " Leave me alone . What you doin ' ? " " Why , I have n't had the pleasure of meeting you since Christmas night . " " ' Twas n't me . I never done it . Leave me be . Huckleberries ! I 'll smash ye ! " " Why , Fayette , I 'm astonished . Be quiet , listen . I know you  --  I know all about you . You have got to behave . You must stay here and do exactly what Cleena and I tell you to do . You 'll be treated well . I 'll show you how you can make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , though  --  upon the one condition that you simply behave correctly . You are wise enough to understand me . If you disobey or prove tricky  --  well , I have but to hand you over to the law and you 're settled . Do you understand ? " " You mean , if I do n't mind , they 'll jail me ? " " That 's it , exactly . You 're cleverer than I hoped . " " All right ; I 'll do it . Say , I believe Balaam 's sick . " " Balaam ? Have you got him , too ? Are you a horse thief as well as highwayman ? Well , poor fellow , it 's lucky your lot is cast in this peaceful valley instead of on the frontier . Where is he ? " " I rode him to a place I know . There was plenty o ' fodder once , but it 's been took . He hai n't had much to eat , an ' maybe that 's it . I was bound old Wingate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , call nobody names . That 's not allowed . And now you travel after Balaam . If he 's too sick for you to manage alone , I 'll go with you ; if not , you must do it . How far away is he ? " " Not more ' n a mile . " " Fetch him . I 've something to tell you , for your own benefit . I 'll teach you how to grow mushrooms , down in that cellar you 're digging . Well-grown ones will bring you a dollar a pound . I know , I 've raised them . I 'd made a fortune only I love daylight and hate darkness . If you can stand the underground part just for fun , you 'll make it pay . " " Huckleberries ! I 'll get him . I 'll hurry back . " As if he expected the new enterprise to begin that very night the lad started down the hill . Already there was a manlier bearing about his ill-shaped body . The necessity for hiding which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free lad again . An hour later Frederic Kaye saw him reappear , riding the apparently restored burro , and smiled grimly . " Hmm . Well , I 'm in for it . I 'm to remain under the cloud for an indefinite time . If it succeeds  --  I 'll not regret . If it does n't , maybe the Lord will square it up to my account , against the thoughtless neglect I showed Salome . Now , I 'll go out and interview my old acquaintance of the Sierras . I wonder is his voice as mellifluous as erstwhile ! " " Br-a-a-ay ! Ah-umph ! A-h-h-u-m-p-h ! ! " responded Balaam , from afar . CHAPTER XXVI . A PICNIC IN THE GLEN . It is amazing how fast time flies when one is busy . At " Charity House " all were busy , and to all the winter passed with incredible swiftness . To Amy each day seemed too short to accomplish half she desired , and each one held some new , fascinating interest in that study of life which so absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the lengthening of the days , getting a little lighter in the mornings , week by week , so we can see the sun rise and such things , as we walk to work  --  I 'd never think of it , ' cept for you . " " Now you do think of it , is n't it interesting ? " " Yes , I like it . Things seem to mean something , now I know you . Before , well  --  ' pears like I did n't think at all ; I just slid along and took no notice . " " But it 's so wonderful . Everything is wonderful ,  --  even the way the months have gone . Here it is spring , the bloodroot lying in a white drift along the brookside , and the yellow lilies opening their funny tooth-shaped petals everywhere in the woods . Yet only a minute ago , as it seems , the dead leaves were falling , and I was on my way for the first time to work in the mill . I belong there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten how it used to be when I was so idle . " " Seems to me you could never have been idle , Amy . Anyway , you 've got on splendid . The ' Supe ' says he never had a girl go ahead so fast . Is n't it grand , though , to be out of the mill this lovely day ? Saturday-half means ever so much more fun now than it used to do , and does n't cost half so much money . Do n't worry you half so much either , as it did to go shopping all the time . Say , Amy , I 've about got Mis ' Hackett paid up . " " I 'm delighted ; it must be wretched to feel one 's self in debt , I think . " " It 's mighty nice to feel one 's self out of it . I 've got you to thank for that , too , ' long of lots of other things . Is n't the club doing fine ? We would n't have had that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , you would . Hallam was as interested as I in the subject ; and as soon as we told Uncle Fred , he was even more eager than we . But it is to father we all owe the most , I think . " " So do I. To dream of a splendid gentleman like him , and such a painter , taking so much time and trouble just for a lot of mill folks , I think it 's grand . I do n't understand how he can . " " Seeing that his own two children are ' mill folks , ' I can , readily , " answered Amy , laughing . " But , indeed , I know he would go on with it now just as thoroughly , even if we were not in the case at all . " This talk occurred one lovely afternoon when the half-holiday made a club picnic a possible and most delightful thing . The two girls , Gwendolyn and Amy , were a little earlier than the others , and were on their way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small piece of wooded ground rising in the middle of the Ardsley 's widest span . From the island to the banks , on either side , were foot-bridges , and in the grove tables and benches had been built by the lads of the organization . It was an ideal picnic ground , and these were ideal picnickers ; for those who toil the hardest on most days of the week enter most heartily into the recreations they do secure . The girls were passing down into the glen where Amy had once lost her way and been rescued by Fayette . It seemed so long ago that she could hardly realize how few months had really elapsed . She spoke of the matter to her companion , who seemed to be in a reflective mood that afternoon , and who again remarked upon the change in the mill boy , also . " Your uncle and Cleena Keegan have made him different , too . He 's as proud as Punch of his mushroom raising , is n't he ? He owes that to Mister Fred ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she owned him . He did n't forgive that thing about Balaam , and seems to feel he has a right to him , same 's Mr. Metcalf has . " " Poor old Balaam , he 's made a lot of trouble , first and last ; but I guess he 's all right now , only Cleena wo n't let Fayette talk of him . She says it 's ' punishment , '  --  the only sort she can inflict . I do n't understand why she wants him punished , anyway . " " Maybe for stealing him that Christmas night out of Mr. Wingate 's stable . " " Possibly ; I do n't know . She 's like a mother puss with her kitten . One minute she pets him to foolishness , the next she gives him a mental slap that reduces him to the humblest , most timid mood .

Say , would n't it be prime if we could get a big library here ? " " Grand ! We will , some day , too . " " My ! You say such things as if you expected them to be . How , I 'd like to know ?

I 'm always finding them , too . There 's one at your very feet . Do n't tread upon it , please . " Stooping , the girl pulled Gwendolyn 's dress away from a tiny green speck , growing in dangerous proximity to the wood road . " What 's it ? " " This baby fern . " " All that fuss about a fern ! " " It 's life , it 's struggle . See , so dainty , so fine , yet so plucky , forcing its soft frond up through the earth , among all these bits of rocks ; never stopping , never fearing , just trusting the Creator and doing its duty . It would be a pity to end it so soon . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is again . I shall never be able to crush anything like that without remembering what you 've said just now . I  --  I wish you would n't . It makes me feel sort of wicked . And that 's silly , just for a fern . " " Gwen , anything that makes us more merciful ca n't be silly . Heigho ! there are the picnickers all coming along the banks and over the bridges . Truly , a goodly company , yet we began with just you and Lionel , Mary Reese , Hallam , and me . Now there are a hundred members , old and young . There 's one of the everyday miracles for you ! " The vigorous young association which went by the name of the " Ardsley Club " flourished beyond even Amy 's most sanguine expectation . Three rooms of " Charity House , " the sunny western side of the higher story , had been cheerfully offered by Mr. Kaye as a home for the club . These rooms he had had fitted up under his own supervision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in hours after mill duties were over . The color mixer had supplied the material with which the once ugly white walls were tinted ; and upon the soft-hued groundwork there had been stencilled a delicate conventional design . At one end of the large room designated the " reading room " a scroll bore the legend which old Adam Burns had given Amy as a " rule of life " : " Simplicity , Sincerity , Sympathy , " and opposite gleamed in golden letters the other maxim : " Love Conquers All . " " Love , Simplicity , Sincerity , and Sympathy , which is the synonym of Love , and forms with it the golden circle , " was adopted as one of the by-laws , and it is true that each member endeavored to keep this one law inviolably . The result was a spirit of peace and goodwill rarely found in a gathering of so many varying natures . It had been Mr. Kaye 's idea to make the affair one of no expense to the members , outside of his own household , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , there are none of us rich enough to do such a thing . There will be lights , firing , musical instruments , books , current literature , games  --  any number of things that cost money . Amy 's idea is fine . A club of the right sort will be a powerful factor for good in this community of mill workers , but it must be made self-supporting . If you give the use of the rooms and will act as instructor along some lines ,  --  art and literature , which you comprehend better than financiering , respected brother ,  --  you will have done your generous share . Amy and Cleena will keep the rooms in order , with occasional aid from the girl members  --  after we secure them . A small sum , contributed by each member , will run the whole concern . People who are as constantly employed as these mill operatives have not the leisure nor means to acquire a book education , but a more intelligent , wider-awake , more receptive class is not to be found . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nature of ' charity ' or mental almsgiving . Your democrat beats your aristocrat in the matter of pride every time , and that is a paradox for you to consider . I relinquish the floor . " " After having exhausted the subject , " laughed Hallam . But the subject had not been exhausted . Amy proposed the matter the very next day , at " nooning , " and secured the members as mentioned by her to Gwendolyn . In a week the membership had doubled ; and as soon as the affair was really comprehended , that it was a mutual benefit organization in the highest sense of the word , applications were plentiful . Uncle Frederic had been a literal globe-trotter , and his journeyings on foot made him able to discourse in a familiar way of things no guide-book ever points out . Nor did Cleena 's good cookery come in for any poor show among these healthy , happy folk . The club paid for the simple refreshments provided at their weekly " socials , " and Cleena prepared them . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made all the needful preparations , and had been so busy she had scarcely remembered to keep a close watch upon Fayette . " But troth , it 's no more nor right he should take his bit fun with the rest , " she remarked to herself , as she pulled the last tin of biscuits from the chimney oven and spread them with sweet butter and daintily sliced tongue . " He 's aye restless betimes ; and  --  but it 's comin ' , it 's comin ' , me blessed gossoon ! " But to whom Cleena 's exclamation referred it would have been difficult to say ,  --  though possibly to Fayette , as her next words seemed to indicate . For the good creature still " conversed with Cleena " in every instance when she happened to be left alone , it being a necessity of her friendly nature that she should talk to somebody . " Me gineral 's never got over the burro business yet , alanna ! An ' it do seem hard how ' t one has so little an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Metcalf now , as fine a man as treads shoe leather , never a doubt I doubt , yet himself judgin ' it fair , since the man Wingate wanted the beast , the man Wingate should have him .

Nobody rides him at all , Miss Amy says ; yet here 's me gineral heart-broke for him ; an ' the cripple goin ' afoot ; an ' all them little Metcalfs envyin ' an ' covetin ' ; an ' all because a man who 's word is law said he 'd take him for rent an ' just kept him , whether or no . But a good job it was when Mister Fred come home , with money for rent an ' a few trifles , but not much besides . Well , where 's the need ? Eight dollars a week is Miss Amy 's wage now , God bless her ! an ' Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit pictures the master 's be 's doin ' constant . Mister Fred 's the knack o ' sellin ' ' em too . Well , if the mistress could see  --  and hark , me fathers ! What 's that ? " Down in the fragrant glen and on the little island the hungry " Ardsleyites " waited long for the promised supper ; and up on Bareacre knoll things were happening that would provide another sensation for the little town , quiet now since the Christmas horsewhipping episode . CHAPTER XXVII . A DOUBLE INHERITANCE IN A SINGLE DAY . Almost before she asked it , Cleena answered her own question . " The powder ! the powder ! It 's Fayetty a-meddlin ' ! Oh , is he killed , the witless gossoon ? " Then she turned toward the stairway leading into the cellar , and from whence she had heard the dull roar , and now imagined she saw smoke as she certainly did smell suggestive fumes . She needed not to descend , however , for at the stair 's head the lad rushed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carried , and thus dispelling her first fear of his personal injury . " Fayetty  --  Fayetty ! Hold by ! What 's amiss ? What 's  --  " He deposited a box upon the kitchen table , plump in the tray of biscuits , and catching Cleena about the waist began to execute a grotesque dance with her for helpless partner . After a moment she was able to extricate herself from his frantic clutch and to demand sternly :  --  " Ye omahaun , are ye gone daft ? " " It 's money , Cleena Keegan ! It 's money ! The cellar 's full of it ! Money , money , money ! Chests full , cellars full  --  oh ! oh ! oh ! " Then did her eye fall upon the box and the spot where it rested , and indignation seized her soul . With one grasp of her strong hands she flung it to the floor , where it fell heavily , cracked , and burst asunder . Both were then too astonished to speak . Fayette 's wildest dreams had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Never in all her life had she seen so many precious coins . They were dimmed by age and moisture , yet , unmistakably , they were of gold , with a few that might be silver . All the fairy tales of her beloved Ireland rushed through her mind , and she regarded the half-wit with a new veneration . " Sure , you 're one o ' them elf-men , I believe ; that different from ordinary you can even make dollars o ' doughnuts . Arrah musha , ' t was a smart decent day when Miss Amy fetched you home to Fairacres ! Sent , was ye , to make the old family rich ; and the marvel o ' cure in your long , lean hands . Troth , I 'm struck all of a heap . " But Fayette was not . He had never been so active . He began to gather up the coins which had been scattered by the breaking of the chest and , for want of something better in which to store them , pulled Cleena 's apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on , silently regarding him . For a few minutes she honestly believed that he was a genuine specimen of the " little people " who were said to make green Erin their favorite home . But when he began to gabble in a hoarse , excited tone of how he had long been expecting this " find " ; how he had watched his opportunity when all the household should be absent that he might disobey and use the explosive that would lessen his labor so greatly , she came back to common sense . Illustration : " HE BEGAN TO GATHER UP THE COINS . " " So you 've been lookin ' for it , have ye ? Well , now you 've got it , but ye might ha ' been killed in the job . What for no ? With Mister Fred gone to town an ' him tellin ' ye most explicit ye should no touch nor meddle at all . Was aught like this found in either of them mushroom ones ? " " I  --  do n't  --  know , " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If there was  --  that man 's  --  got it . It was mine . I begun the digging . I  --  " " An ' he finished , eh ? Well , you take up your pack an ' put it here in my dresser . Then go wash your face . Such a sight ! Hold , did ye any more harm there below ? " " Harm ! harm ! to dig such a treasure as this out of my mine ? Well , if I used only a little bit of powder and got so much , what a lot I might have found if I 'd used more . I 'll bet the whole ground is full . " " Oh , ye silly ! Put that stuff down . It 's makin ' ye lose what little sense you 've got . An ' , me neighbor , look here . See them beautiful biscuits all spoiled the day , the day ! " This reminded the lad that he was hungry . He had been hard at work all day in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set out to make beneath " Charity House . " The first two had been completed , the walls shored , the rich beds for mushroom-raising made upon the dark damp floors . Already these beds were dotted with the white growths , that in a marvellous short time would be full-grown mushrooms and finding a place upon many an epicure 's table . That very hour , even , Frederic Kaye was in the city negotiating for their regular sale at profitable prices ; and wondering not a little , it may be , at the strange fact that " Spite House , " instead of being the barren , unproductive spot at first supposed , would prove instead a veritable mine of support to the whole household . Of that other " mining , " with its anticipated results in gold of which Fayette had sometimes babbled , Mr. Kaye took no account . Old Jacob Ingraham who built the house had been a hard , close-fisted man , if all accounts were true , and not at all likely to deposit his money in the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But of old Jacob 's wife , history said little , and Frederic never thought . Fayette placed the apron in the cupboard , as he had been bidden , and when he would have added the broken box also , Cleena prevented . " Oh , ye dirty boy ! That  --  that mouldy , muddy , nasty thing ! No , no ! No , no ! " and she tossed it unceremoniously into the box of kindling-wood . In the roomy " Dutch " oven in the wall she had baked many of her picnic biscuits , and she regarded the ruin Fayette had wrought among her sandwiches with an air absurdly sad . Now he had no scruples against a bit of dirt , and had already crammed his mouth full of the broken food , when Cleena looked round and saw him . His mouth was distended with laughter as well as bread , and this provoked her still further . Sweeping her long arm over the table , she brushed all the sandwiches into a big pan that stood conveniently near , and remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food do you get till them 's all ate . " " All right . I like ' em . But what 's the picnickers goin ' to do ? " " The best they can . An ' you 're to help . Go wash your hands . " " I have . " " Again , once more ; then show ' em to me . " The lad laughingly obeyed . Then demanded :  --  " What for ? " Cleena replied by action rather than word . She tied a fresh gingham apron about his shoulders and brought the strings around in front so that his mud-stained clothing was entirely covered . Then she led him to her kneading-table and set a bucket of sifted flour before him . " Make biscuit . " " How many ? " " Three hundred . Fall to , measure , I 'll count . " She did . For two whole hours the pair labored in that kitchen , Fayette kneading , cutting out , slipping the pans into the ovens and removing them ; while Cleena spread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original supply had been reproduced . Then she paused and looked up . There stood Teamster John in the doorway , smiling and watching Fayette 's new occupation with genuine surprise . " Shucks ! makin ' a cook out of him ? Ai n't ye rather late with your luncheon ? I drove up to carry the baskets down to the ' Island . ' " " Humph ! Ready they was , fast enough . But  --  man , look here , " and she opened the cupboard door to draw forth the apron of gold . " No , you sha n't ! He sha n't touch it ! It 's mine  --  it 's mine ! " cried Fayette , and snatched the bundle from her hands . He had not tied it securely , and again the long-buried coins rolled into the sunlight and spread themselves over the floor . " To the  --  land 's  --  sake ! " " They 're mine  --  they 're all mine  --  every single one . I found ' em . I blasted ' em out . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasted them  --  out ? From the cellar of this house ? You  --  simpleton ! " " Like to ha ' done it yourself , hey ? " " No ; but I 'm sorrier than I can tell that ever you were let to fool with powder . How 'd Mister Frederic allow it ? " Cleena answered promptly , " He did n't . He strict forbid it . Yes , I know , I know . It was a chance . If me guardian angel had n't been nigh , you might never ha ' seen old Cleena again . Arrah musha , but I 'm that shook up I 'd know ! What say ? Is it time yet for their supper down yon , or what ? " " It 'll be a little late , maybe , but never mind . My , my ! Chests o ' gold ! Who 'd believe it ? Like a story book , now , ai n't it ? And where , in the name of common sense , did you get all this flour and meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Fred . The last day he went to town . He was to buy enough for one picnic , so he brought home enough for two . That 's ever his way . He 's the good provider , is Mister Fred . Bless him ! " " Exactly . Well , I 'll tell you , it is late , so I 'll just drive down to tell the youngsters they 'd better come up here and eat their supper . They 'll be crazy wild for a sight of that chest and what was in it ; and if they do n't come to-day , they 'll be besieging you all day to-morrow . When a thing like this happens , it belongs to the town . " " Do n't neither ; belongs to me . I found it . I 'll keep it . I dare ye ! " " All right , lad . Do n't worry . I would n't touch it with a ten-foot pole . I 've heard of such things afore now , and never once that they did n't bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't kill anybody nor smash up the house with your fool blastin ' . You wo n't get another chance to try , if I have to come right here and stay myself ; " and he smiled sweetly toward Cleena , who ignored the smile , but agreed with the suggestion . " Yes ; that 's right . That 's sense . What for no ? Troth , to-morrow 's a Sunday , an ' not to be disturbed o ' none such havers . What 's a bit of old dollars dug out o ' the mud ? An ' Monday 's me wash . Faith , it 's sense in small matters ye 're havin ' , Teamster John . Drive yon an ' make haste back . I 'll spread me a cloth on the grass an ' each may eat like a heathen , does he like , that same as he was down in the woods . " " But they sha n't touch it  --  they sha n't even see it ! It 's mine . I 'll keep it , understand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad with whom she had to deal . " Whist , alanna , would you hide yourself , then ? Faith , no ; run avick . Put on your Sunday suit , brush yer hair , make yerself tidy , then stand up like a showman at Donnybrook fair , an ' pass the time o ' day with who comes . What for no ? The box an ' the gold must be showed . Such a thing ca n't be hid . Well , then , gossoon , just show it yerself . " So when , not long after , the whole band of merrymakers came trooping over the knoll of Bareacre , they found not only their belated supper spread for them , but a sight to amuse their curiosity in the buried treasure , estimated at various sums by the excited beholders , and with an ever increasing value as the story passed from mouth to mouth . " It will belong to ' Bony , ' of course . " " No ; to the Kayes . He does n't own the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't take it from him . They 're not that sort of folks . " " But they 're as poor as anybody now . " " Archibald Wingate owns the property . I should think it belonged to him . " " The ' Supe ' will probably take it in charge . " So the talk bandied back and forth till poor Fayette 's weak brain was in a whirl ; and amid it all there was one name that fell upon his hearing with a sense of pain ,  --  " Archibald Wingate . " The man he hated . Well , of one thing he was resolved  --  this unearthed treasure might be the mill owner 's , but if it were , he should never , never touch it . Poor Fayette ! So he still stood and proudly exhibited the wonder , and told over and again exactly how he had long suspected its existence , and had watched his opportunity , with this result . Since he was happy and watchful , Cleena felt he was secure  --  for the present . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even for that of Mr. Kaye , who was abroad upon a sketching ramble . There should be somebody in authority present , since Hallam and Amy were both too young , and Teamster John  --  well , he might " do at a pinch . " In any case , he must remain on guard till a better man appeared . This better man did arrive , just as the evening fell , in the person of Uncle Fred , riding up the driveway in old Israel Boggs 's farm wagon . Amy was first to discover their approach and ran gayly to meet them , beginning her tale of the afternoon 's adventure with her very salutation ; but long before she reached the side of the wagon she saw that something was amiss with her jolly uncle . His face was very grave , and even his voice was hushed , so that though his greeting to his niece was even kinder than usual , it startled her by its solemnity . " Why , Uncle Fred , what is the matter ? What has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how come so many here ? I thought the picnic was at ' Treasure Island . ' " She nodded cheerfully to Israel , whose face was even more sad than Frederic Kaye 's , and gave a rapid history of events . Strangely enough , neither of the two newcomers appeared much interested . It was as if some greater matter absorbed them , and their manner subdued Amy to silence ; while the farmer tied old Fanny , and then followed his friend into the front part of the house , quite away from the excited groups surrounding Fayette and his wonderful exhibit . Once inside the shelter of the passage , Mr. Frederic laid his hand upon Amy 's shoulder , and said , very gently :  --  " Prepare for a great sorrow , Amy dear . I have just come from the death-bed of our good friend , Adam Burn . " Never till that moment had the girl known how well she loved the saintly old man . Rarely meeting , he had still exercised over her young life one of its most powerful influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uncle Fred , it ca n't be . It must n't be . He was so good , so kind , so  --  " " Altogether lovely . Yes , dear , all that . Old Israel , here , needs comfort . Talk to him a little . " So she led the heart-broken Israel into the farthest room , and sitting down beside him persuaded him to speak with her of the one that had passed on , and in the act to find relief . Then she slipped away a moment and found Hallam , who , when he had heard this later news , quietly dismissed the club and brought the happy holiday to a reverent close . " Land ! that makes all such ilk , " said Teamster John , pointing to Fayette 's glittering heap , " to seem of small account . What 's a litter of gold alongside of such as him ? " And not one among them all who had ever known Adam Burn found anything now worth discussing save the goodness and simplicity of their dead neighbor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone back to the desolate Clove , to make such arrangements for the old man 's burial as his friends at " Charity House " had deemed fitting , Uncle Frederic remarked , casually :  --  " By the way , Amy , Mrs. Burn ( ' Sarah Jane , ' you know ) told me a bit of news , to the effect that you are the old man 's heiress , because of your name that was his wife 's . She says he gave you a sealed letter before he left Ardsley , which letter explained everything ,  --  where the will was to be found , and the few directions necessary for the settlement of the estate . Your father and I are trustees , she thinks , until you come of age , but you are the heir . Good night . " " No , no , uncle , I do n't want to be ! I want nothing that is gained by his death . And  --  I lost that letter , anyway . " " Lost it ? That 's serious . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " CHAPTER XXVIII . ONE WONDERFUL AUTUMN DAY . The months flew by . The summer came and went . It was the hour for closing on a " Saturday-half , " a whole year since Amy Kaye first visited the mills of Ardsley , and now she felt as they were a part of her very life . Beginning at the bottom she had industriously worked her way upward till she had just been promoted to the pleasant and well-paying task of " setter , " in the big clean room , where the open windows admitted the soft air of another Indian summer . Away , at the extreme end of the long apartment , was a sunshiny office , lately constructed for the personal use of Archibald Wingate . This office was partitioned from the setting room by a glass sliding door , and through this , as Amy now lifted her eyes , she could see the broad back of her relative bending above a desk full of correspondence . At every setting frame there are two operators , for left hand and for right ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her comrade , and a more sunshiny pair of workers could be found nowhere . For Hallam , also , it had been a busy , happy year . Like Amy , having begun with the humblest task and smallest wage , he had now advanced to be bookkeeper in one department , while he still retained his work of coloring and preparing the patterns for use in the weaving of the famous Ardsley carpets . He looked a far stronger , healthier lad than of old , and his disposition to think upon the dark side of things had now no time to develop , for activity effectually prevents brooding . Fayette was still a member of the Kaye household , and seemed to belong there as much as any of the others . He had been busy , too , all the year through , with his mushroom-raising , his gardening , and now that the autumn had come round again , with odd jobs at the mill . His deftness would always procure him employment of some sort , yet only that morning Mr. Metcalf had remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can never trust ' Bony . ' He seems as honest and reliable as possible for a time , and then , suddenly , he will do something to disappoint me . I do n't like his demeanor toward the ' boss . ' Ever since Mr. Wingate returned , late this summer , and took to coming here every day , ' Bony ' has come too . Have you noticed ? " " I know he comes . I had n't connected the two comings , however . I guess he 's all right . There 's a splendid side to that poor lad 's nature , if you but knew it . Some day , I hope before very long now , he and I are to surprise the world . " " Why , Hal , you 're as gay as a blackbird . What 's the surprise , eh ? Too precious to disclose even to me ? " " At present , yes . In a little while , a few days  --  Heigho ! " and the lad looked significantly toward his crutches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superintendent did not observe the glance . His mind was full of misgiving . Within a day or two he had had occasion to suspect that the half-wit had some uncanny scheme on hand . The lad 's dislike of the old mill owner appeared to grow with the passage of time . The dull brain never forgot an injury , and it always seemed to Fayette that Mr. Wingate had wronged him . From the old days of his " bound out " life on the farm , when whippings and punishments were of almost daily occurrence , to the present , there had been no diminution in the mill boy 's resentment . Now there was this later injury , or injustice , as he believed , about the money found in the cellar of " Charity House . " The facts were these : the glittering coins had , when estimated , been of about one thousand dollars ' value . To Fayette this seemed an enormous sum ; to Mr. Wingate , a trifle . In the chest with the treasure had been also a time-yellowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Ingraham , and decreeing that the property thus hidden had been placed by her own hands in the wall of the cellar of " Spite House " for the " benefit of my nearest of kin . " The document , in itself , was as curious as its hiding-place , and proved that the ancient dame had been a keen observer of men 's failings , if not their virtues . " For I have seen , in this , my lifetime , that gold profits a man nothing . It is ever a bone of contention , and he who has it is poorer than he who has it not . I hope this chest will do him good who finds it ; and if it is never found , then the earth will be so much the richer by this small portion of the wealth it has lost . In any case , to prevent evil , and , if possible , to secure a blessing , I have said one prayer over each coin herein disposed , and so , in duty to my conscience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old well of this Bareacre knoll . " The letter had further added that nobody , not even Jacob Ingraham , had known of this bestowal of the chest , because had anybody , " most of all , he , " so known , it would have been excavated and its contents scattered . Now Archibald Wingate was , on his mother 's side , the last direct descendant of Mrs. Ingraham , and the property was clearly his . To him , as soon as he returned from his prolonged stay out of town , the broken chest and intact contents had been given by the superintendent , who , Mr. Kaye promptly decided , would be the proper guardian of the treasure until his employer returned . There had been a terrible scene with Fayette when Cleena told him this decision , and for several days thereafter the lad had not been visible . Some thought he had gone off in one of his wanderings through the woods and fields ; but the truth was , he had been kept under lock and key by the energetic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , herself , that :  --  " Sure , it do be right . Will I lose all the good we have gained for the sake o ' bad temper ? The end 's in sight ,  --  the blessed end o ' the secrecy , an ' the weary struggle o ' keepin ' me gineral 's nose to the grindstone , and now to leave go ? Not while Cleena Keegan draws a free breath , an ' can handle a silly gossoon , like him yon . " From the first it had been a strange and powerful influence that this good woman exercised over the foundling she adopted , and fortunately his imprisonment was not so very long , else it would have been impossible to conceal it from the rest of the household ; not one of whom did , however , suspect such a proceeding . When the object for which she had restrained him of his liberty seemed quite gained , Cleena let Fayette go ; and , oddly enough , after his liberty was granted him , he no longer cared for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but teeming with the rich vegetation resulting from his own labor , guided by Frederic Kaye 's trained judgment . The summer had proved a most interesting as well as busy one to both these gardeners . The results of their mutual labor were harvested and stored for the family 's winter use , and Fayette had returned to the mill . Idleness , or the want of that regular employment he had enjoyed , now reawoke the dark thoughts which had disturbed his clouded brain during the time of his " retreat " under Cleena 's compelling will . This day , when Amy watched her cousin through the glass partition , and waited with Mary for Hallam to complete his own task in a room adjoining the private office of Mr. Wingate , Fayette was hanging about the mill , as if himself waiting for some one . Amy called to him once , and received a surly answer :  --  " I 'll go when I get ready . I ai n't hurting nobody  --  yet . " " Of course not , who 'd suppose so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods after hours . There was a frost a few nights ago . There may be hickory nuts to gather . " " Gather ' em , then , if you want ' em . I do n't . I 've got other fish to fry . I 'll fry ' em , too . " " Well , you 're cross , ' Fayetty , me gineral . ' I 'll not wait much longer , even for Hal . You can come home with him , and help him bring the patterns he is to show father , please . " " I thought you wanted to see Mr. Wingate , too , Amy , " observed Mary , " about that legacy of yours . You 're the queerest girl . Any other would be wild to have things fixed , but you do n't seem to care a bit . " " Why should I ? We are very comfortable at ' Charity House . ' Mrs. Burn , dear Adam 's daughter-in-law , has gone abroad again . If she had time , she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter of instruction will sometime be found , and that will make all clear . We do n't like law , and Adam would have hated it . No ; we 'll wait for a time longer , but I promised father I 'd consult Cousin Archibald , and see when he would meet either father or Uncle Fred to discuss it . " Meanwhile , old Israel and his wife are doing just the same at Burnside as if their master were still there . All I could think of taking the property for , it seems to me , would be to give my father such a lovely home again . " " Well , Amy , I must go . I want to finish reading that book Mr. Kaye lent me , this afternoon . I 'll see you at the club to-night . Good-by . " With a kiss and a hand pressure , which revealed the depth of their friendship , Mary departed , and Amy turned to the open window to watch the cloud shadows drift over the lovely valley , wherein the Ardsley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things , she became conscious , in an idle sort of fashion , that Fayette had passed out of doors , and was walking close beneath , or along the building 's wall , and in a stealthy manner , suspicious in itself . " Heigho ! What now , I wonder . He 's up to some mischief , I 'm afraid . How queer he is at times . Why , even when he was told that Mr. Wingate knew him for the person who horsewhipped him last Christmas and had refused to take any notice of it , except to thank Uncle Fred for his rescue  --  even then Fayette would not say that he thought my cousin good . All he did say was : ' Well , he better not . He knows too much . If he locked me up or had me fined , I 'd lick him again soon 's I got out . He ai n't no fool . But that do n't make me feel any different . He ai n't jailed me , but he 's got my money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' blasted , to the risk o ' my life . He keeps it , when he 's got a bank full , they say . Kept Balaam , too , or give him to one of them Metcalf youngsters . Well , his time 'll come . I 'm not forgettin ' , if I do keep my mouth shut for a spell . ' " Recalling this speech , Amy tried to put herself in the half-wit 's place , which effort made her pity him the more , yet watch his present manoeuvres none the less closely . But presently he disappeared in a distant lower doorway , and she forgot him and returned to her happy day-dreams . Fayette had bided his time . On such an afternoon , at such an hour , he judged that nobody would be in the mill building save the distant watchman and that indefatigable toiler , Archibald Wingate , with whom was the half-wit 's present business . He had seen the last whisk of Mary 's blue skirt disappearing above the back-stairway , and , knowing that Amy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had departed together . So he entered the little basement door gleefully . All seemed propitious , yet he meant once more and carefully to examine the preparations he had made , to see if there was any flaw anywhere . He was so absorbed , so excited , that he scarcely breathed as he crept slowly along the inside of the wall , just as a moment before he had passed along its outer surface . At one spot he paused and tried a simple-looking tube that had been brought from the outside , through a convenient aperture , into the inside of the building . The thing looked harmless , yet it ran along the groove where the floor and wall joined , clear into that cheery inner office , where Archibald Wingate sat that very moment , signing his name to one of the most generous letters of his life . " There , " he reflected , as he leaned back in his chair and tossed aside his pen ; " there , that is foolish enough to satisfy even my impractical small kinswoman , bless her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's  --  a thousand dollars ; and when I double it by another thousand , which has never been buried by any ancient ancestress , it makes a tidy sum for a foundling lad . Poor ' Bony , ' he hates me like poison . I wonder , when he finds out that I 've done this for him , when I place it in his hands myself , and tell him , furthermore , that I have asked Fred Kaye to send west for several more of those burros he 's given us a sample of , and that one is for the ' Rep-Dem-Prob ' himself  --  I wonder , will there rise in his stunted heart some perception of what life should mean ; of what it shall mean , during my last brief hold of it , to me ? and all because of a girl 's bright trustfulness and love . " It was a day for musings . Even Fayette , intent on evil , had his own  --  like Amy and the lonely old man in the silent office . He wondered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be blown up . That day when I found the money he 's took from me , if I 'd had a bigger charge of powder , would I ha ' knowed what struck me , if it had gone off sudden ? Hmm . I almost hate to do it . He seems  --  he 'll never guess , though , and he had n't any right . He 's been again ' me from the first . I 'll do it . He hai n't had no mercy  --  I wo n't , neither . " So he crept softly back to the low entrance , and stooping , struck a match . The match burned well , and in an instant had communicated its own flame to the cheap fuse that ran along the wall . In the far-off office , concealed beneath the mill owner 's desk , there was already waiting a powerful explosive , which Fayette had purloined from the store of the workmen who were excavating for the new wing of the building . In a moment more the fuse would have burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of whose enormity the dull criminal had no real comprehension , would have been committed . But Hallam had caught the prevailing mood . He , like the others left lingering about the silent building , had fallen into a reverie which , judging by his bright expression , was full of happiness . For many months , and for the first time in his life , he had kept a secret from his father and Amy . If that can be called a secret which was known also to Cleena , to Uncle Frederic , and to Fayette , upon whose aid alone the success of this mystery had depended . The lad had been faithful . At most times his help had been rendered freely , out of love and sympathy ; at others there had been compulsion on Cleena 's side and from the other one of the quartette , who had himself suffered false blame and the disgrace of suspicion because of the secret . " To-morrow , please God , it shall end . I could n't bear to tell them , who love me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old surgeon said it might be a miracle would be enacted for my benefit . Well , it has , it has ! I 've known it , really , almost from the beginning , though it 's been so hard and at times so seemingly hopeless . But if I had n't loved them even more than myself , I would n't have kept on trying . To-morrow  --  the experiment in their presence ! Will it ever come ! " The lad stood up and arranged the papers in his own desk . Then he heard , or fancied that he did , a slight sound in the deserted building . The corps of operatives had been well drilled to watch for any sign of that dreaded element , fire , and he was alert now ,  --  the more that , following this , there was a slight odor , pungent and more alarming than even the first sound . He wheeled about and  --  what was that ? In the dimness of the angle where it lay , away out toward that closed office with its unsuspecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping progress . For an instant Hallam gazed at it astonished , the next he realized its full meaning and horror . Could he reach it ? Was there time ? With a shriek of warning he rushed forward ,  --  stumbling against , leaping over obstacles ,  --  gaining upon that menacing point of fire and fume , which now seemed to race him like a living thing . The miracle was wrought  --  two miracles ! A few more seconds , and it would have been too late ; but now the lame walked and , as it were , the dead came back to life . Hallam 's shriek , the uproar of overturned obstructions , reverberated through the empty building and brought Archibald Wingate , Amy , and poor Fayette face to face with the panting , excited rescuer . All comprehended at once what had been attempted and how prevented . The mill owner laid an iron grip upon the half-wit 's shoulder , who made no effort to escape ; for at last , at last , there had penetrated to his dim intelligence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he saw the once crippled lad , whom his own hands had restored to health , thus fling away his life with unstinted hand , that he might save the life of another ,  --  once his enemy also ,  --  there had roused within the dormant brain of the foundling a sudden perception of Hallam 's nobility and his own baseness . Therefore , stunned by this new knowledge , he stood humble and unresisting . Amy 's great heart comprehended just what and how her poor protege was suffering . With her , to think was to act . She sprang to him and laid her small hand on his other shoulder , and the tender sympathy of this touch thrilled him more than the hard grasp of his master . " Oh ! but Hallam  --  Hallam  --  you walked ! walked ! you ran ! You  --  you  --  who never  --  " Her voice choked , ceased , and she turned from Fayette to fling herself headlong into her brother 's arms . For the first time in their lives he could receive her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Gently at first , then violently . His crutches were  --  nobody cared where , though certainly not at hand ; yet he stood fixedly , resisting her attacks , and again catching her to him with that overflowing joy that only such as he could guess . " But I do n't understand . Tell  --  tell ; not here , though . Is all safe ? No danger any more ? " " No , " said Fayette to her demand , " there ai n't no danger . Not ' less the fuse had burned out to the end . It 's under the desk . He 'll find it . I  --  I  --  but it 's put out . I  --  " " You did n't mean it , did you , boy ? You could not . You did n't understand . " " No , I did n't , I did n't , " whimpered the stricken fellow . Mr. Wingate relaxed his hold . How could he retain his fury against such an enemy ? It was too unequal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Hallam read these unspoken thoughts . " For my sake , Cousin Archibald , forgive him . It is he who has made me able to save you this day , even though it was he who put you in such peril . Months ago , Amy read in a paper how a lad was cured whose case was just like mine . There was only will power on the cripple 's part , and the daily , sometimes hourly massage by one of those persons whose physical magnetism , or whatever it is , was strong . ' Bony ' was such a person , and I just such a cripple . We began . For weeks I could n't move my legs without using my hands to help . Then one day I found , just after the rubbing was over , that I could push one foot along the floor a tiny way . That gave us both courage . He has been untiring . We were soon on the road to what I believed , though with lots of set-backs , would be a cure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Fayette be arrested or punished for assaulting you . He took the blame himself , if the boy would stick to me . Cleena knew , too  --  " " And not us , father nor me ! " exclaimed Amy , in a hurt tone . " No ; that was to be my blessed surprise for you two . It was to your own suggestion , which I suppose you forgot soon after , with the newspaper scrap you brought , that I owe the beginning . It was Cleena kept us at it . She would n't let us give it up ,  --  no , not if she had the whole crowd under lock and key on a bread and water diet ; eh , Fayette ? " The shamefaced fellow looked up , with a slight gleam in his eye , then dropped his gaze again . Hallam went on : " To-morrow , the First Day that mother loved , I was going to make an experiment before you all  --  my surprise . I have practised in private continually , and uncle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you before ; but I kept it till the anniversary  --  you know . " " Ah , " said Archibald Wingate , with a sudden recollection , " so it is . She was my best friend , my best beloved . You are her children . All my hard middle life seems to have slipped out of my memory , like a bad dream , and I am back in our youth-time again , with Salome and Cuthbert and Fred ,  --  all gay and glad together . I wonder , I wonder what she would bid me do to you , poor fellow , " he finished , regarding the abject natural with a pitying air . " I know ! Forgive him , else thy Salome and my mother were not one . " " Amy , thee is right . Come into the office , all of you . " " Is it safe ? " she asked , hanging back . " We 'll make it safe . ' Bony , ' or Fayette , take that stuff you put under the desk and step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep hole . I used to fish there as a lad . I can see if you obey . Drop that death powder into the stream and come back . " Fayette obeyed , and they watched him , shivering . But when the water flowed on after an instant , undisturbed and merrily singing its deathless song , they breathed deeply and with complete relief . " Look here , Fayette ; you think I 've been a hard man . So I have  --  so I have . You 've been a bad boy too , eh ? " " Yes ; I wo n't never  --  " " Of course you wo n't . Look here , I say . What 's this  --  this heap of stuff I took out of the safe ? Did you ever see it before ? " " Yes ; it 's the money I blasted out . " " Well , if it were yours , would you promise never again to blast anything or anybody or anywhere ? Your very own to keep forever , if you liked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you promise , I mean it . " " Oh , I do  --  I do . I 'll keep my word . I meant to try and I did . But it 's over . I 'm glad ; I was n't happy , never . I promise , whether or no , money or not . " " I believe you 'll keep that promise : Hallam and Amy , here , are witnesses . Now , listen : I , too , promise . I 'll not only give you this old hoard , but this besides . " He swept into view a pile of golden eagles , larger than any there save himself had ever seen , and placed it beside that time-worn lot of similar material . In bestowing his gift he had provided to have it in such shape as he knew the half-wit would best comprehend . " This is for you , also . It is just as much more as you found . I give it to you because my little cousin here has taught me it is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles , in this new hand-bag , and ask Mr. Metcalf to take care of it for you . You trust him , do n't you ? " " Yes  --  yes , " answered Fayette , in breathless eagerness . " Now , the condition : if you ever again , by word or deed , do any sort of injury to any human being or to any helpless animal , I will have you punished , punished in full for all you have done wrong in the past . Do you understand ? " " Yes , " sobbed the grateful and greatly excited youth . Somewhere he had heard , maybe from Cleena 's lips , something about heaping coals . He felt at that moment as if the living coals were lying upon his own poor head . " Then go ; and if it will give you any pleasure to know it , I believe that you are now about the richest of the mill operatives living in Ardsley village . " Stumbling , through his tears , and truly far more grateful for the prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and full forgiveness , Cleena 's Fayetty went . As his footsteps died away , Amy , who seemed given to outbursts to relieve her full heart , threw her arms about the old man 's neck and kissed him over and over . " That 's better , child , that 's better . The first time thee planted it on my nose , I seemed to have a dim perception that this was not the regulation feature for such gifts , but it answered ; though I like them better on my cheek , child . Thee 's improving . Now let 's go home . Yes ; it 's the carryall . There 's room for us all . On the way I 'll tell thee  --  " " No , no ; wait till we get home . Do n't let 's leave anybody out any more . By thy face I can see it 's something delightful thee is going to tell . Oh , make the old horse travel , travel  --  fast , fast ! " CHAPTER XXIX . CONCLUSION . On half-holidays Cleena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its enjoyment were usually brought the best appetites of the week as well ; for there was leisure and talk and laughter , and that interchange of experiences which kept their family life so united . Archibald Wingate joined the party at this present half-holiday dinner ; yet even with such cheerfulness about him could not but shiver now and then , as he recalled his narrow escape of the afternoon . To have taken his meal alone , on that day , would have been to suffer greatly . But Amy had brought him in and placed him in the seat of honor , and amid the general rejoicing over Hallam 's wonderful recovery and surprise , they had made him feel that he was a sharer . They had just drawn back from the table , and were going into the sitting room , when there came a tap at the door that Cleena answered . It was a small tap , very low down on the panel , but it was given due importance ; for was n't the visitor Master " Willyum Gladstone Jones , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " manners " ? So they all paused to wait the child 's important entrance , and to smile over Goodsoul 's greeting :  --  " The top o ' the evenin ' to you , Mister Jones . An ' what may be givin ' us the pleasure of a visit from your lordship the now ? A what ? Speak up ; a box is it ? Miss Amy 's box . Never a doubt I doubt you 've made messes of its insides , by the way . No ? Then your improvin ' , to that extent I must even be givin ' ye a bite o ' this fine apple pie . Hmm ; exactly . Well , give the young lady her bit property , again ' I slips on a plate an ' teaches ye how to eat decent , as ye should . " So the little fellow , who had just been promoted to his first trousers and felt as all boys do in such a case , walked proudly across the room and offered Amy a japanned casket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I have n't seen it for ever so long . I used to keep my few letters in it . I wonder if they 're here now . " " Ev'y one . My mamma seen ' em all . She said the top one  --  I do n't know . Somefin . " " Arrah musha ! but I remember one day , long syne , he was aye botherin ' an ' I set him to orderin ' the box neat an ' nice . He must ha ' took it away with him an ' me not payin ' no attention . Well , a box o ' such truck 's neither here no more there , I forecast . " Amy had stopped to admire the new garment , fashioned from an old one of Hallam 's , and having thus satisfied the little one 's innocent pride , now opened her recovered keepsake . She lifted the letters idly , dropped them , and again catching one that had , indeed , lain upon the top , sprang up and waved it overhead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam ! " " No ; is it really ? To come in such a way  --  " " On such a day  --  oh , Hal ! " She caught her brother 's hands and wrung them in delight , then ran to her father and placed the letter before him . He looked at it critically . " Yes ; that is Adam Burn 's handwriting . His own familiar seal . These people who have had it in keeping  --  " " I hided it . Zen I dugged it out . Same like Fayetty , " explained Sir William , between mouthfuls . " The blessed baby ! that explains . " " Let us go into the parlor and read it . It is yours , daughter ; you must yourself break the seal . " " Oh , I 'll break it fast enough . " " Hmm . Young lady , I thought you were the girl who did n't want to be an heiress , " commented Uncle Fred , teasingly . Amy 's face sobered . " You are right . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow were fresh ; but now I do . Just think of all the comfort for all you folks in that lovely home . " " Then I must lose my tenants , eh ? " asked Mr. Wingate , smiling . " Thee 'll lose nothing ! Wait . If thee has plans to tell , so have I. " The letter was a simple one , plain , and leaving no room for any sort of legal difficulty . Amy could enter upon her heritage that day , if she wished . The place where the will was stored was designated , and they knew it would there be found . But after the reading a little silence fell upon them all . The old mill owner was the first to break this . He did it almost reverently . " Speaking of wills , and after the events of the day , I 've been thinking of mine . By the way , Amy , I suppose thee 'll cease to work for me now . " " I do n't see why I should , unless my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that afterward . Tell us thy plans , please . I 'd like to hear them . " " And I 'd like to have thee make them for me . " " Make them ? I ? " " Yes ; in truth and deed . If thee were me and had as much money as I have , and were just such a lonely , childless , forlorn old man , what would thee do , that would accomplish the most good ? according to thy judgment , which I have found a fairly sound one . " The elder Kayes listened in astonishment . They had been prepared by various matters for a great change in their kinsman , though not for one so radical . But the father began to perceive how this change had been wrought , and his heart gave thanks for the devoted , sunshiny daughter who seemed to shed an influence for happiness and goodness on all whom she knew . It was due to her , he believed , that this new Archibald had replaced the old . " Does thee mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Let me hear . If it is possible , I will carry out the wishes thee expresses , knowing they will be all for the benefit of somebody deserving . " " Well , then , I 'd help the unpractical Kaye family to get settled at Burnside Farm , on the condition that for my services I was given a big , delightful room in the old farmhouse , to live in and with them , forever and ever and ever , so long as the dear Lord permitted  --  that 's if I were thee , Cousin Archibald . " " But would that ne'er-do-well Kaye family take in an old curmudgeon , does thee think ? " " Never . A curmudgeon is a thing they detest . They 'd take in a nice , fat , old fellow , whose heart was so big it made his body grow to hold it , and who meant to do all the good with his money that his money would do , and not leave it for anybody to squabble over after he died . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd got a niche at Burnside , I 'd take ' Charity House ' and remodel it into a Modern Industrial School . I 'd have ' designing ' taught , in regular classes , by a well-known artist , named Cuthbert Kaye . I 'd have agriculture under the instruction of another expert , Frederic Kaye . I 'd have a school of scientific cookery  --  not by you , my Cleena , but by somebody who hates pies and adores oatmeal and et cetera . No , really , I do think the mill folks should understand more about foods and their uses . They 'd save so much money and  --  dyspepsia . " " Hurry up . Where do I come in ? " " At the mercantile college end of the establishment , learned brother . There should be a splendid library , a gymnasium , a swimming pool  --  " " A swimming pool on the top of Bareacre knoll ! " " Please do n't interrupt , Hal . It 's impolite . I 'd have it  --  somewhere . I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already ordered , " cried Archibald , forgetting everything in his enjoyment of her happy face . " Am I to continue ? May I let my fancy riot ? " " Yes , indeed ; give thyself full freedom for once . " " Then I 'd take beautiful Fairacres , that has been a happy home for generations , and I 'd make it a Happy Home , with capital letters . I 'd call to it all the tired and ailing mill folks in the country . I 'd make its disused studio and book rooms into a hospital , and where father painted his picture of pain , that he destroyed , let all pain be soothed ; and all the other big chambers into havens of rest for other girls who , unlike me , have no fathers , nor Uncle Freds , nor Hallams , nor Cousin Archibalds , nor anybody . I 'd have Mary Reese trained to be its Little Mother ; and Archibald Wingate should be full manager of all , beloved and venerated , reaping the happiness he has himself bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ! and if I were not out of breath ! There ! have I ' rioted ' enough ? " Mr. Wingate turned his head sidewise and looked admiringly upon the unselfish girl who had planned so much for others , and had not , apparently , remembered to plan anything for herself . " Yes ; thee has rioted enough . But , little one , if thee pleases , if my other kinsfolk here so please ; if the dead past is indeed the dead past , and the future may be our happy own , there is no reason under the blue heaven why thee has not prophesied aright . What say , my friends ? Shall Amy 's word be that which the Spirit has moved her to say ? Shall we make it real and tangible , this beautiful , helpful dream of hers ? You are all interested alike . You are my next of kin . After me you will inherit  --  or these others whom she has named . Was Amy 's word the true Word , Cuthbert ? The word Salome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word , Archibald . Let it be as Salome 's child has spoken , " said Cuthbert Kaye , grasping his kinsman 's hand . And all Ardsley now knows that as it was then agreed , so it is , and will remain . * * * * * A DAUGHTER OF THE WEST THE STORY OF AN AMERICAN PRINCESS By Evelyn Raymond 347 pp .
