 | IF we were asked suddenly whether we should like the privilege of having our name pass into the language as a common noun or verb , probably the instinct of most of us would be to reply , blushingly , that on the whole we rather should . Our first thought would be of the honorable distinction implied in the existence of such words as daguerreotype , hansom , mackintosh , macadam , cardigan , and spencer , while it might not be till later that we recollected the ghastly notoriety of Dr. Guillotin , the embarrassing fame of Captain Boycott , and the half-ludicrous , half-tragic woes of Dr. Osier . The owner of the name at the head of this paper has had , nolens volens , to taste both the bitter and the sweet of such lexicographical popularity ; he has had to be prepared for either fate . It certainly can not be other than pleasant to him to hear the word " Baedeker " used as a synonym for guide-book , especially when ( as is very often the case ) it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this pleasure must have been clearly dashed when a German judge decided that the process of transmigration was so complete that another firm might publish a so-called " Baedeker " for Berlin without any infringement of copyright . This Berlin " Baedeker " has been followed by others equally innocent of connection with the  | real Simon Pure , among which I remember a " Neu-Yorker Baedeker , " prepared for the German-speaking visitors to Gotham ; a " Baedeker de la Republica Argentina , " in Spanish ; and a ' Himmels-Baedeker , " or Baedeker for heaven . On the last of these I believe the worthy German publisher could look with perfect equanimity , feeling that here at least there was no poaching on his preserves and recognizing that with regard to the pilgrimage to the Elysian Fields even Baedeker is but as other men . Curiously enough , it is in France that the popularization of the name has gone farthest . A Frenchman will say , " Je ne me ferai pas le Baedeker du panorama , " meaning that he will not give all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Chamber of Deputies who does the honors of the capital for his provincial constituents . They have even coined a verb baedekeriser . " In spite of the fact that " Baedeker " now nearly monopolizes the field among the synonyms of guide-book , I fear I can not make the claim that Baedeker was the earliest representative of the kind of volume that we now associate with the name . This eminently practical invention must be ascribed to England , the pioneer and leader among the traveling nations , and Herr Baedeker himself ( as will appear further on in this paper ) would be the first to admit the fact . Baedeker 's claim must be one of excellence , not priority , and must rest on the fact that he has bettered his model ? that it is a case of survival of the fittest . It is enough if Baedeker be recognized along ( say ) with its technological schools , as one of the proofs that the dreamy and philosophical Fatherland is not without its triumphs in the severely practical world . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the origins of the tourist 's guidebook , properly so called . Doubtless the young Athenian consulted his Herodotus when about to visit the land of the Nile , and unquestionably the educated Roman would look into his Pausanias before starting for a visit to Athens ; but it is clear that it would hardly be exhaustive to call either of these works a handbook for travelers . Numerous so-called itineraries were prepared in the Middle Ages , especially for the use of pilgrims ; but their contents are seldom of the practical nature that we might expect from the name . One of the earliest was a small anonymous MS. found at Einsiedeln in Switzerland , and dating from about the time of Charlemagne . This is devoted to Rome , and mentions many of the classical ruins the pilgrims would see in passing from church to church . It also gives a list of about eighty classical inscriptions . One of the most populaiof these medimval itineraries was the so-called " Mirabilia Urbis , " another handbook to Rome , dating from the twelfth century and in vogue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Baedekerian exactitude may be gathered from the fact that it describes the Colosseum as vaulted over with a sky of gilded bronze , and takes the well-known statue of Marcus Aurelius to represent a Roman giant who saved the city by kidnapping the diminutive king of a besieging horde of Oriental barbarians . The want of practicality in these medimval itineraries often began with their very title , which sometimes carefully concealed the true ? nature of their contents . One of the quaintest , issued in 1439 , was entitled " Ain hubscher Tractat wie durch Gottfrid on Pullen das gelobte Land gewonnen ist " ( A fine treatise , showing how the Promised Land was won by Godfrey de Bouillon ) . In the sixteenth century began to appear guide-books or itineraries intended for secular travelers , such as scholars , antiquarians , soldiers , merchants , and even wandering journeymen . Traveling now became recognized as a necessary part of the education of the higher classes ; and many of the published books of travels undertook to give hints for the guidance of the future followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing that this new movement was not without its reaction . Thus Elector Frederick III . of Brandenburg ( 1700 ) issued an edict against traveling , and Marperger ( about 1720 ) proposed that a tax should be levied on every traveler leaving his native land . Three of the best-known English works of this class are Coryatt 's " Crudities hastily gobbled  | up in Five Month 's travels in France , Italy , etc. " ( 1617 ) , the " Itinerary " of Fynes Moryson , and Howell 's " Instructions for Foreign Travel " ( 1642 ) . Coryatt finally dedicated his travelworn shoes in the church of his native village of Brockdon , and no doubt breathed a sigh of relief at his happy exit from the perils he had undergone . The contemporary reader must have found much to interest him in Coryatt 's book , but the little that would have been of practical service to him is more than outweighed by a mass of absolutely impertinent matter , such as various long epistles in Latin and Greek . Moryson 's " Itinerary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of its name , is perhaps the least practical of the three . At least it is hard to see the use of his dissertations on episcopacy and politics , and his anecdotes , though amusing , are scarcely Baedekerian in their helpfulness . The following is a sample : " Everyone knows the tale of him , who reported hee had seen a Cabbage under whose leafes a Regiment of Souldiers were sheltered from a shower of mine : Another who was no Traveller ( yet the wiser man ) said , hee had passed by a place where there were 400 brasiers making of a cauldron , 200 within , and 200 without , beating the nayles in , the Traveller asking for what use that huge Cauldron was ? he told him , Sir it was to kyle your Cabbage . " The objects of interest on which these books laid special stress are often very different from those starred in Baedeker . This difference is especially striking in the matter of scenery . Erasmus did not even look at the . Alps when crossing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem he was writing on old age ; and Thomas Burnet , in 1681 , speaks of the Alps as having " neither form nor beauty , neither shape nor order . " Evelyn , in his diary ( seventeenth century ) , alludes to the " horrid craggs " of Switzerland ; another Englishman , writing in 1812 , declares his  | preference for Richmond Hill over Lucerne , Lamanus , or the Lake of Morat . Perhaps we can hardly even now quarrel with Lord Essex 's advice rather to go one hundred miles to speak with a wise man than five miles to see a fair city , but fortunately it is often possible to combine the two . Dr. Johnson 's taste for scenery was distinctly of a Cockney order , even though we do not press too far his assertion that the finest view in Scotland was that of the highroad leading to London . Sir Walter Scott was one of the first popular writers in whom the love of beautiful scenery is strongly in evidence ; and his poems and romances were undoubtedly powerful factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ebel 's " Guide or Manual for Switzerland , " published in 1793 , contains a few small maps and some practical hints , but it is arranged in the form of a gazetteer , is spread over four volumes , and is weighted.with sundry most impractical moral essays . Still , such as it is , it is probably more like a modern guide-book than any of its predecessors . Goethe 's friend Knebel published in 1747 a book on European travel , with notes on the best routes and lodgings . Richard 's Passagier auf der Reise , " issued in 1801 , proved so serviceable that it lived to see a nineteenth edition in 1861 . Meanwhile the growing prosperity of Great Britain was fostering the national propensity for travel and giving occasion for the production of aids thereto . Even the poet Wordsworth wrote a " Guide to the Lake District , " in regard to which he was asked by a country parson , desperately anxious to please , " whether he had ever written anything else ? " Paterson 's " British Itinerary , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the spread of railways interfered with its usefulness , is arranged in the form of a thin ribbon of road , with the points of interest to the right and left of it duly marked . Mrs. Marianna Starke , known as " Jack Starke " from her manlike costume , published her " Letters from Switzerland " about 1814 , her " Travels on the Continent " in 1820 , and her " Information and Directions for Travellers on the Continent " about the same time ( fourth edition 1824 ) . The year 1814 saw also the appearance of Galignani 's " Picture of Paris , " the first English handbook for that city . Boyce 's " Belgian Traveller " appeared in 1815 , and Brockdon 's Excursions in the Alps " in 1833 . The Travellers ' Club , the condition of membership in which is to have traveled at least five hundred miles in a straight line from London , was established in 1815 . Albert Smith 's famous lecture on the " Ascent of Mont Blanc " may also be noted here as among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That none of the pseudo-guide-books above mentioned was quite satisfactory may be gathered from a very cursory examination ; and we have besides such direct evidence as that of Cardinal Wiseman , who , writing in 1839 , complained that the English guide-books then in existence were all likely to mislead the traveler in a thousand points . But a new era was now to begin , and its inaugurator was undoubtedly John Murray , of London , second of that name . In 1829 , as a young man , he made a prolonged tour on the Continent , during which he took many practical notes on points in which he himself felt the inconvenience of lack of guidance . On his return he persuaded his father , the wellknown publisher , to issue his observations in the form of a " Handbook for Holland , Belgium , and North Germany . " This book , published in 1836 , was the first of the now well-known series of " Murray 's Guides ; " it was also the first English work to use the English form of the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work , and among the first to recognize its great practical significance , was a young German of Coblenz , who , like Murray himself , was a publisher and the son of a publisher . Karl Baedeker was born in 1801 at Essen am Ruhr , where his father , Karl Gottschalk Diederich Baedeker ( d. 1841 ) had his book-shop and printing-house . Like the Rivingtons of London or the Elzevirs of Holland , the Baedekers had been connected with the making and selling of books for several generations , the founder of the dynasty being the court printer , Dieder- ich Baedeker , of Bielefeld , who died in 1716 . Karl Baedeker served his apprenticeship at Heidelberg and Berlin , and had also attended sundry university lectures before he set up for himself at Coblenz in 1827 . Among the very first of his ventures was the taking over of a small book by Professor S. A. Klein , giving an account of the journey down the Rhine from Mayence to Coblenz , and described on the title-page as a " handbook for hurried travelers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in French ( 1829 ) . In 1836 , as above mentioned , appeared Murray 's first handbook , and the sight of the numerous English travelers following the footsteps of " Childe Harold , " with this work under their arms , suggested to Baedeker the desirability of providing his German countrymen with similar guidance . The second ( 1836 ) and third ( 1839 ) editions of Professor Klein 's Rhine were edited by Karl Baedeker himself , and the beginning of the transition to the Baedeker of to-day is clearly evident in this volume , all unlike as it is in external appearance to the little red vale-mecum of the modern tourist . Its yellow covers are freely adorned with Prussian eagles , knights in armor , peasant girls , and the like , while inside are various engravings of scenes on the Rhine . Baedeker 's " Handbook for Belgium and Holland , " published in 1839 , is avowedly modeled on the practical English guide-book of Murray , and the preface duly expresses the obligation of its editor to " the most admirable traveler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Baedeker 's " Handbook to Germany , " first issued in 1842 , stall acknowledges its obligation to Murray ; but it is at the same time a kind of declaration of independence , inasmuch as it goes on to say that the editor is able to make use of the frame only of his model . In other words , the differentiation of Baedeker had distinctly begun ? a differentiation which is emphasized in another sentence of the preface to the effect that the editor purposely refrained from longwinded descriptions of scenery or objects of art , because he considered it presumptuous to anticipate the feelings of the traveler in regard to them . Karl Baedeker was himself an ardent traveler , with an especial predilection for wanderings on foot , and , like Hahnemann , the homeopathist , he took all his own doses before experimenting on the bodies of his patients . His own experience thus showed him in what points it was desirable to modify his English model for German tourists , and , besides , gave him the opportunity of collecting a large mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use in his English handbooks . Mr. Murray did not fail to thank Baedeker for this courtesy , and the relations of the two publishers of guide-books seem to have been of the most friendly nature down to Karl Baedeker 's death in 1859 . These relations , however , became more and more of an absolutely equal and reciprocal character , and the later handbooks published by the elder Karl Baedeker and all those since published by his sons are perfectly independent works . Indeed , they are far more likely to have been a source of information than vice versa , as I believe I am correct in asserting that two or three carefully revised new editions of Baedeker 's handbooks have generally appeared to one of Murray 's . It is a curious fact ( and I have good reason to believe it is a fact ) that the elder Karl Baedeker was so far from anticipating the great success the guide-books would attain that he rather expected that his sons would give up publishing them . Instead of this , the guide-books now practically comprise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early date which he still retains being a few historical primers . Baedeker also acts as the publisher , on " commission , " of the German Palestine Society . Baedeker 's " Germany , " of 1842 , was the first of his handbooks to wear the red linen dress which is now so familiar . It contains one map and eight plans of towns . The asterisk of commendation seems to have been first used in 1853 , and the convenient arrangement of numbered and lettered squares on the plans made its appearance about the same time . The first Baedeker for " Switzerland " is dated 1844 ; the first " Paris , " 1855 . At the time of the older Karl Baedeker 's death the series consisted of  | nine volumes , all of which were written in German . The first of the French and English translations of the Baedeker guide-books , which soon became of equal importance with the German originals , seems to have been a French version of " Switzerland , " issued in 1852 . A spurious French translation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought forth an authorized version in 1865 . The first English edition seems to have been " The Rhine , " issued in 1861 , and the next " ? Switzerland , " which appeared in 1863 . All the early English editions were prepared with the aid of Mr. John Kirkpatrick , a Scottish advocate , who was elected Professor of Constitutional Law and History in the University of Edinburgh in 1881 , when ( it is interesting to notice ) Robert Louis Stevenson was among the unsuccessful candidates . A glance at any of these English " Bae , dekers " will clearly demonstrate their claim to be independent works , while the more recent handbooks , such as " Greece , " " Egypt , " and " The United States , " had not the slightest connection with Mr. Murray 's books either in inception or origin . The war was carried unmistakably into the enemy 's country when the English edition of Baedeker 's " London " appeared in 1878 , to be followed by " Great Britain " in 1887 . Murray 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rhine " as Baedeker 's English representative , but in the second edition ( 1864 ) it has given way to that of Williams &; Norgate . For many years the English agents have been Dulau &; Co. , of Soho Square . A comparison of the first edition of " The Rhine " with the last ( 1906 ) shows that in forty years the size of the book had almost doubled ( 260 pages as against nearly 500 ) , while the number of maps and plans had increased from 25 to 81 . And the other handbooks have undergone similar transformation . If the space at my disposal were unlimited , it might be interesting to analyze at some length the less obvious differences between the early and the later Baedekers . The trend towards the severely practical is shown by the disappearance of the twelve attractive views of Rhenish castles and scenery with which the first edition of " The Rhine " was embellished . The preface of the same handbook sounds a personal note not afterwards characteristic of Baedeker in the statement that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great part of his wardrobe " by putting his clothes and boots outside his door to be brushed . It also mentions " douceurs in various shapes " offered , and offered in vain , by hotel-keepers ; and a reference to the German edition shows that one of these " shapes " was Victualien ? presumably sausages . The maps and plans of these early editions seem to be nearly all by Ed . Wagner , father of the Ed . Wagner who makes the plans now in use . In precision of execution they resemble the maps and plans of the present handbooks , but , being generally printed in black or neutral tints , they do not make so brave a show - as their successors . To complete the history of the Baedeker firm , we may note that in 1872 its seat was removed from Coblenz to Leipzig , the great focus of the book trade in Germany , where it forms one of fully five hundred booksellers and publishers . After 1859 the head of the firm was for a time Karl Baedeker the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " first ascents " of Swiss peaks . The present chief representative of Baedeker is Fritz , a younger brother of Karl the second ; and with him are associated two of his sons , who are probably the first young men whose education and training have been expressly designed to fit them for the editing and publication of guidebooks . It is , perhaps , a little difficult to say wherein Baedeker differs essentially from all preceding guide-books , or what it is that has made it , so to speak , le Bernier cri in this branch of literature . Most of the tendencies Baedeker represents may be traced , in their germs at least , in many of the books I have named earlier in this article . He has , as it were , simply advanced some deliberately taken steps along the path they were uncertainly treading , and has crystallized the idea of practicality floating more or less  | dimly before their eyes . The chief merit of the elder Karl Baedeker seems to me that he was the first to formulate clearly for himself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first is written to inform and amuse readers who may never leave their armchair ; the latter is prepared for use on the spot , and so omits much that is necessary to a logically complete account , leaving the eye of the traveler to fill up the gaps . From the writer 's point of view this is a severe se ' f-denying ordinance ; but it is perhaps true , as Mr. Harris phrased it , that the more interesting a guide-book is away from the object and before you have seen it , to that degree it fails in its purpose . An enlightened Edinburgh reviewer said as early as 1873 that a guide-book " is not to be treated like a work of pure literature , although its composition may often demand rarer qualities than are required for that ; " and Karl Baedeker was the first deliberately to give up the attempt to combine the two incompatible excellencies . Mme. de Stael describes traveling as " un des plus tristes plaisirs de la vie ; " and our final judgment on Baedeker will depend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition or on the noun it qualifies . But if we do travel , we must , I think , feel grateful for so trustworthy and so compact a guide . In this respect at least we may exclaim " The good of ancient times let others state , I think it lucky I was born so late I "
