txt 1 00 The Soverane Herbe preceding two , with oblong stem leaves and a white flower . It is popular with English gardeners , but its smoking use is confined to Persia , its flavour being too mild for all but the Oriental palate . The tobacco prepared from it is known as Shiraz , the place of its chief culture . For his inspiration the smoker practically depends upon the Nicotiana Tabacum , the other two varieties supplying only a very small proportion of the world 's tobacco . Though a perennial plant , tobacco is grown annually from seed . I t flourishes best in a rich , deep , moist soil and a temperate climate , between 4o ? and 5o ? latitude . Though naturally a tropical plant , tobacco acclimatises itself in any country , but that grown in its native tropics yields , of course , the best crop , the leaf deteriorating the farther north it is grown . It is estimated that nearly two million acres of the earth 's surface are devoted to tobacco culture . The cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant and experienced attention . The rich , moist soil is exhausted of its mineral constituents by the plant in a remarkable degree , more so , in fact , than by any other plant . It is these minerals which form the ash of burning tobacco . On an average four pounds of smoked tobacco yield one pound of ash or mineral matter . Tobacco absorbs from the soil even the chlorine of common salt , which it not only does not require , but which actually spoils the tobacco for smoking . Careful manuring of the ground and alternation of crops is therefore necessary , as a single crop of tobacco The Tobacco Plant 1 0 I robs the ground of all its mineral constituents . Lime yields a large but rather poor crop . The best manure is naturally tobacco-ash , for it is simply the restoration to the earth of the minerals the plant absorbed from it . Just as four pounds of tobacco yield one pound of ash , so will one pound of ash yield four pounds to tobacco again . It is almost surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes for dressing the growing crops . But the practical difficulties in thus raising tobacco , Phoenix-like , from its own ashes , are insurmountable . The best soil is alluvial , or a light loam with plenty of potash . New land gives a large crop of coarse , strong leaves , and old soil a smaller but better and sweeter tobacco , provided it has been well dressed with potash . The plants are annually sown from seed , of which Linnwus counted 40,000 in a single pod . Some months before sowing-time the beds are broken up , drained , dug round as for asparagus , and a fire lit on the ground to destroy all weeds . The seed is extremely minute , a hundred thousand , it is calculated , going to the ounce ; this quantity about fills a thimble . half an ounce is the usual quantity of seed allowed per acre , and it is mixed with ashes or sand to assist its equable distribution . Between the middle of March and the beginning of April seeds are sown in America , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climates it is necessary to sow the seed in hot-beds . The soil must be kept moist , but not wet , by watering . The bed is covered with manure , ashes , // and cut straw and branches of trees , with the triple object of nourishing the plants , preserving them from ants , and protecting them against cold . In India it is also necessary to shield them from sun and rain . In a week 's time the plants , no bigger than pinheads , appear above the ground . In two or three weeks ' time they are carefully thinned out , and after seven or eight weeks ' growth they are as big as crown pieces and ready for transplanting . The field is hoed into square hollows with alternating square hillocks , two or three feet apart . A warm , rainy day early in May is chosen and the plants , carefully drawn from their nursery bed , are planted out singly in a hillock . Each plant is allowed an area of some three square feet , so that an acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad leaves are grown , yield half a pound of tobacco each , or Soo pounds per acre . The process of transplanting and the care of the plants afterwards is a very tedious and anxious one . A single night 's frost at any stage of growth kills them completely . In such case the planter renews his crop from a reserve sowing . The ground must be kept scrupulously free from weeds , lest they should deprive the plants of any of the nutriment the soil contains . The attacks of insects must also be guarded against and their raids stopped . Lime and sawdust are scattered around the roots to form a quarantine ring , and on many plantations turkeys are kept for the sake of the destruction they wreck among things that crawl . One of the greatest enemies of the planter is the horn , or tobacco worm , that commits great devastation // among the leaves of the tender plant . Every morning and evening the plants are examined and all intruders destroyed . The quality of the soil , the kind of manure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of seed , all exert great influence on the kind and quality of tobacco produced . Equally important is the method of pruning . Escaping the terrors of frost , the injuries of careless handling and the attacks of insects , the plant grows rapidly ; but its growth must be checked and directed to produce a profitable crop . No plant can produce more than twelve healthy leaves of good quality . To prevent the energies of the plant being devoted solely to the attainment of great height , strong stem , big flowers and capacious seed capsules , to the consequent starvation of the leaves , the stem is nipped off with the finger-nail ; this partially closes the wound and is better than any instrument . The tip of the stems and every flower-bud are ruthlessly removed to confine the energies of the plant solely to the growth of leaves . It is on the same principle that gardeners prune trees and direct the energies of a vine to the growth of a few first-class bunches of grapes . In Turkey alone this course is not pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in Turkish tobacco ; hence its mildness , the nutriment being evenly distributed , and not , as in American plants , directed to the leaves only . As a consequence of removing the flowers and buds the plant throws out shoots , or suckers , and these as soon as they appear are snipped off to keep r o+ The Soverane Herbe all the nutriment in the plant . The great object the planter has in view is the production of well-developed leaves , and to this end his constant care is to concentrate all the energies of the plant in their production by the ruthless nipping in the bud of all its superfluous attempts to flower , to grow to a great height , or to propagate itself . in the old days of Virginia a custom sprang up of resetting fields with these suckers ; the tobacco thus grown was naturally poor in quality , as the soil could not produce a firstclass double crop . In order to preserve and maintain the high standard of their tobacco the planters prohibited the practice , enacting that crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Its enforcement was rarely necessary , for the good name of their tobacco ? the wool Virginian ' being a warrant for quality  --  was too valuable to be tampered with . The leaves of the tobacco plant naturally grow in three grades . Those nearest the roots are the strongest , since they have the first call upon the sap of the plant ; leaves half way up the stern are of medium strength , while the topmost are the mildest . Hence the planter obtains a strong , medium or mild crop , as he requires , by pruning the plant at any part . To obtain strong and full-flavoured tobacco he snips off the upper leaves ; the removal of the lower ones gives him a crop of medium strength . When leaves of a uniform quality and strength are required the plant is allowed to grow untouched . First the lowest leaves are gathered , and for eight or ten days the whole strength of the plant is directed to the improvement of the remaining higher leaves . When The Tobacco Plant 1 0 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength to those already gathered they are stripped , and the upmost leaves left to strengthen , in this way obtaining a crop of uniform quality . Even when approaching maturity the plant is liable to disasters . Very wet weather produces a blight known as firing ' , and the extreme heat and drought infects the leaf with hard , brown spots , which perforate the leaves and destroy the value of the crop . Thus from the day of sowing to its final harvesting the tobacco plant demands and receives constant care , attention , and the judgment experience alone can bring . About the beginning of September the crop is gathered . As they ripen the leaves become rougher , thicker , and of a yellowish-green colour . The gathering of the leaves requires great judgment , and is always entrusted to the most experienced hands . Reference has already been made to the gathering of the leaves at intervals to obtain uniformity of quality . As a rule the plant is cut down at once by severing the stem close to the ground . Only such plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being left for a short time longer , but the planter has always fear of frost before his eyes . Cut down in the early morning , the plant is carefully laid on the ground and exposed to the heat of the sun for the day , the juicy , brittle leaves thus becoming wilted , or flaccid , and bendable without breaking . Before evening the leaves are carefully collected and stored in sheds . Then comes the curing of the tobacco , as fully important and anxious a process as any of the preI o6 The Soveranc 1-lerbe ceding ones . It is this curing , or fermentation , of tobacco which gives the leaf its well-known and varied flavours . There are various methods adopted , and by them the final flavour of the herb is determined . Tobacco-leaves simply dried have no more odour and taste than any other dry leaf . The gathered leaves are first dried . In Asia they arc simply dried in the sun ; in Europe in hot-houses of 7o ' or So " Lahr. , while in America both methods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the first or natural method the leaves are simply hung in well-lit and ventilated sheds , spitted on poles like herrings . Every tobacco-leaf thus has a hole at the base of the stall ; by which it has been suspended . The reader may be again reminded that the leaves ate bigger than cabbage-leaves , being a couple of feet long by one and a half broad . After six or seven weeks ' suspension the leaves are thoroughly dried . The more common method is a combination of artificial and natural means . After being partially dried in the sun the leaves are finished off in sheds by the heat of smouldering fires of bark and rotten wood . Then comes the process of ' sweating . ' The leaves are heaped on the floor of the shed and covered with matting . The mass of tobacco gradually sweats , ' or becomes damply warm , this being due to the evolution of heat and water . To prevent overheating the leaves are turned every twenty-four hours , thus insuring equable curing ' and guarding against firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In The Tobacco Plant I 07 six or eight weeks ' time the tobacco assumes a warm , brown colour , though it is still flavourless . The essential fragrance of tobacco is produced by fermentation . To understand this process some knowledge must be had of the leaf . It consists of three parts ? the upper skin , the lower skin , and the intervening cells . The upper cuticle is a thin , transparent , colourless , tough substance , very like waxed tissue-paper . The lower cuticle is a similar but coarser skin with tiny , short , bulbous protuberances . Between the two skins is a honeycomb-like collection of cells containing sap . It is this sap which gives the colour , flavour and taste to tobacco ; the skin is merely an envelope , and , burnt , forms the ashes . At first in the growing plant the sap is a pale green ; as the plant matures it becomes a bright emerald , and later of an olive shade . In the sweating process the sap is decomposed by the heat into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final process of fermentation evolves the flavour of the tobacco . When by sweating ' the leaves have become warmish brown , they arc formed into bundles of six or ten leaves , secured by a leaf . These hands ' are collected and stacked . The inherent heat and moisture of the closely-massed leaves sets up fermentation and the tobacco undergoes a radical change . To prevent the mass of tobacco reaching too great heat ( 9o ? is the limit ) , it is constantly stirred , the inmost hands being brought to the edge . Various mixtures are used to promote fermentation and proi o 8 The Soverane Herbe duce certain flavours . With some choice tobaccos the Americans use cider , but the natures of the dressings are trade and firm secrets . When to stop the process is a matter of the utmost importance . With some tobaccos a day and a half 's fermentation suffices ; require others much longer ; in scarcely any two cases is the period the same . Fermentation must be stopped when the tobacco attains a certain temperature . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Experience and a keen judgment are the only guides . If the tobacco is heated too much the leaf becomes very dark and harsh in quality , while insufficient fermentation results in musty tobacco . Imperfect curing causes black leaves , produces ammonia products and imperfect combustion . Various methods of curing apply to various tobaccos . Light leaves arc cured entirely in the open air ; yellow leaves are cured in sheds by charcoal fires , and heavy , dark tobacco by open wood fires , the smoke of which chokes the pores of the leaves and preserves them . The process of fermentation , or curing , is caused , according to the recent investigations of Herr Suchsland , a German scientist ( described by Mr. G. Clarke Nuttal in the Contemporary Review for July , 1899 ) , by bacteria . The heap of fermenting tobacco contains a complete flora of fungus life , and the microbes drawing nourishment from the leaves produce organic changes in the whole , in a manner analogous to the action of yeast on dough . The flavour of tobacco has long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the microbe is known to be the cause of the heating and fermenting . The fragrance of tobacco is produced by the omnipresent and omnipotent microbe . The Havana flavour is produced by bacteria indigenous to Cuba , that of Manila by a Filipinos microbe , while Virginia , Turkish and all other varieties of tobacco are the work of other microbes . The susceptibility of tobacco plants to local conditions has long been known , Havana plants cultivated in Germany producing strictly Teutonic tobacco , and inversely the German plant transported to Cuba producing the finest Havana leaf . Herr Suchsland shows that these changes are due , not to the climate and soil in themselves , but to the different microbes indigenous to Cuba and Germany . By introducing the bacteria discovered in the fermentation of Havana tobacco into a fermenting heap of German-grown leaf , the latter became in all respects as the best-grown Havana leaf . The West Indian microbe turns German tobacco into Havana , and the German microbe transforms the fragrant Havana into the weak , hay-like Teutonic weed . A patent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany , and smokers are promised the finest brands of tobacco , flavoured by microbes to order , at nominal prices . When sufficiently cured ' the leaves are placed to dry . When elastic and dry enough to bear handling and pulling like a kid glove , they are removed from the poles on which they have been spitted . American dealers then strip the leaves of the mid-rib . The leaves are then bunched together into hands ' of half a dozen each , and packed together in rows until sufficiently dry for export . The process of fermentation continues slowly in the leaf for some time , even when dry . It is this full development of the properties of the leaf that leads to the storing and seasoning of cigars . It should be noted , however , that only good tobacco improves with age ; had tobacco deteriorates . When dry the hands are packed for export . In America they are first blended , all the brands being the result of more or less blending of various growths . The hogsheads , or scrolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet high and hold 1,000 pounds . The ' hands ' of tobacco are laid in alternate rows , and when the seron is a quarter full the mass is pressed down by hydraulic power , the barrel finally containing a mass so compact that crowbars and mallets are needed to split off the tobacco in wedges . In the early days of smoking , tobacco was grown in England for home consumption . Early in the seventeenth century a considerable trade in English tobacco ? a weak brand known as mundungus ? was done with Turkey . In 1621 , however , James I. prohibited its culture in England , not merely to check the practice of smoking but also to increase the revenue from the import duty on tobacco . Charles I. maintained the prohibition , but the law was a dead letter during the Commonwealth . Tobacco was grown so largely in Gloucestershire that in 1655 the county hangman complained of unemployment , men being so busy cultivating tobacco that they had no The Tobacco Plant i i 1 time or inclination for sheep-stealing , etc . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extending the law to Ireland , which hitherto had been exempt , under a penalty of 40s. for every rood planted with tobacco . The universities and physicians were excepted and permitted to plant half a pole of land annually , for use in physick or chirurgery . ' In 1684 the penalty was raised to ? 10 per rood ? 4o an acre . These laws did not apply to Scotland , where tobacco was largely grown about Kelso and Jedburgh . With the secession of the American colonies went the chief objection to the home growth of tobacco ? the injury to the trade of the colonies . During the War of Independence tobacco was grown in England to supply the home demand . The planters in the Vale of York and Rydale in the North Riding were severely punished for their breach of the law , the tobacco being publicly burnt by the hangman , and themselves fined L30,000 and imprisoned . The tobacco crop in Scotland was purchased by the Government at the fixed price of 4d. a pound , thirteen acres near Kelso yielding Li @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivation of tobacco was again prohibited in England , though half a rood might be planted for medicinal or insecticide purposes . The same Act removed the prohibition from Ireland , permitting the growth of tobacco for home consumption . Wexford tobacco was very highly esteemed , its price being three times that of Virginian . In 1827 , doubt arising as to the legality of tobacco culture in Ireland , Parliament affirmed its legality . I I 2 The Soverane 1-Ierbe In 1830 , however , the culture was deemed to be reaching too large proportions , a thousand acres then being planted with tobacco , and its growth was prohibited . Tobacco can not now be grown for manufacturing purposes in any part of the United Kingdom . The climate is not unsuitable for tobacco culture , for colder and damper Holland grows tobacco both for home consumption and export , while France and Germany also supply themselves with tobacco . Southern Ireland , Cornwall and Devon are said to be especially suitable for the cultivation of tobacco . In 1886 permission was obtained from the Inland Revenue Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result was fairly successful , it being proved that Ls per acre could be obtained . Last year experiments were made with fair success in Ireland . The proposal , however , to cultivate tobacco in earnest , under the supervision of the Revenue officers , has met with little approval , as is natural , considering the extent to which the country relies upon the tobacco import duty for its revenue , nearly one-tenth of the Exchequer receipts being from this source . When the question of permitting the growth of tobacco in Ireland was raised in the House of Commons in 1881 , Mr. Gladstone said : I regard any prohibition of the growth of any agricultural product at all as being very unsatisfactory , and I am at all times open to any statement or suggestion tending to show that if that prohibition were removed we could satisfactorily levy a duty on the commodity when grown at home as we levy it when imported . The Tobacco Plant I. 13 It is upon agriculturists , not smokers , that the prohibition weighs . As far as smokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lack of heat and moisture essential to the growth of really good tobacco would result in the production of leaf of mediocre quality only . Two-thirds of all tobacco smoked in this country came from the United States and the remaining third from the four corners of the earth . The chief tobacco-growing States are Kentucky , North Carolina , and Virginia , in the order named . Kentucky produces more than half of the tobacco grown in the States . There are more than sixty varieties of American tobacco . Leaf for the old-fashioned , once and ever popular shag ? the purest and best of tobaccos ? is grown in Kentucky and South Indiana . Bird's-eye is prepared from Virginian and North Carolinan tobacco . Virginian tobacco , the first introduced into England , is a strong-flavoured , deep-mottled brown and unctuous leaf . It is strictly a pipe tobacco , being unsuitable for cigars and snuff . Maryland tobacco is light in colour , and little smoked now . Florida supplies a fine leaf used for cigar wrappers , and Connecticut a coarse cigar-filling leaf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brown-black , fine-cut tobacco ? is grown in Louisiana . Its cultivation and preparation are in the hands of one firm , who prepare only 175,000 pounds a year . It was first raised by Pierre Chenet , of whose name Perique is a corruption ; he was one of Longfellow 's simple Acadian farmers , ' who left Grand Pre for S // Louisiana . Much spurious Perique is made in England . During the last half-century many new brands have been placed on the market , chiefly of the lightcoloured , mild type . Though these are now so common , they are of comparatively recent origin . Old smokers of the dark , full-flavoured tobaccos despise the modern taste for mild , light tobacco . Indeed , for purity and the true flavour of tobacco the older brands are t he best . M uch of the light-coloured weed now sold is weak , immature stuff . The discovery of how to produce it was in nearly every case an accident , and the result of , strictly speaking , improper methods of culture . Take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee . About 185o some planters sowed their tobacco in poor soil , and as a result of the poverty of the ground it grew up a light-coloured , sapless plant . Cured with charcoal-fires , the leaves became a lemon colour and very sweet . Considerable difficulty was found in disposing of this poor , weak crop , but as no better soil was obtainable it continued to be grown . To the surprise of planters , manufacturers and retailers , the light weed caught the taste of the public , who preferred it to the rich , full-flavoured , dark , matured tobacco . Between 1870 and i88o the demand for light tobacco increased largely , and now the dark , full-flavoured tobacco has proportionately a very small sale . A mild , light tobacco very popular nowadays is White Burley . This brand arose in 1864 , from some Red Burley plants coming up white and sickly .

It shared the public demand for mild tobaccos , and the plant was grown for what had hitherto been regarded as defects . The cultivation of mild , light tobacco was very profitable to planters . Poor soil and no manuring was needed for its growth ; lightness and mildness were the qualities demanded , and to obtain these it was only necessary to starve the plant and prevent its vigorous and healthy growth . Cigars are of course synonymous with Cuba , though all are not by any means Havanas that are cigars . The decay of the sugar industries in the British West Indies has led Jamaica to take up the culture of tobacco , which with climate and soil similar to that of Cuba should do much to restore the island to prosperity . Jamaica cigars are highly praised by some connoisseurs . South America grows considerable quantities of tobacco , in Paraguay , Brazil and Venezuela . Kanaster tobacco , the favourite brand two centuries ago , is grown on the Varinas River . It is so called from the k'naster or rush baskets in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that from the American continent he receives two-thirds of his supply of tobacco , he is generally ignorant of the source of the remaining third . Japan is not usually regarded as a tobacco-producing country , but the land of the Mikado grows big , dark leaves , which are largely used for cheap cigars to the delectation and ignorance 8 ? 2 // of ' Arry . China sends a very light-tissued , flavourless tobacco ; it is insipid smoked by itself , and is chiefly used to give a bright tint to smoking-mixtures . Sumatra and Indian tobacco is used for cigars ; the former leaves are exported carefully folded to prevent evaporation . Borneo tobacco is steadily gaining ground . The famous Latakia comes from Syria ; its place of origin is the Laodicca mentioned by John in the Apocalypse , Latakia being the modern form of the name . It is an ugly , dark tobacco , the leaves being strung and plastered together , as is all Syrian and Greek tobacco .

Turkish tobacco is a small leaf , about 4 inches long by O. , inches broad . The best Turkish is grown in Salonica . The so-called Egyptian cigarettes are made of ' imported Turkish , for the cultivation of tobacco in Egypt was prohibited in 1891 . Very large crops of tobacco are grown in Holland , France and Germany . Holland sends us more tobacco than any other country but the United States . Dutch tobacco is not a poor brand , for it commands a shilling a pound in bond . Large numbers of German cigars are smoked in England . Large quantities of tobacco are grown in South Africa , and by its consumers Boer tobacco is held to be superior to all others . It looks like tea , but is palatable , cheap and pure .

Considerable attention is now being paid to the culture of tobacco in New South Wales , Australia . Hitherto the culture has been chiefly in the hands of the Chinese . It being recognised that the poor flavour of Australian tobacco is largely due to the inexperience and faulty methods of curing , an American expert has been engaged to advise Australian tobacco-planters , and he regards the prospects of the colony as second to none . Half the tobacco consumed there is now home grown . In Canada increasing areas are being devoted to the cultivation of the herb . The price of tobacco on the plantations or in bond in this country varies from 3d. to 18s. a pound ? the latter for cigars . Japanese leaf costs 8d. a pound , United States tobacco averages 8d. a pound , Dutch is. , and Turkish Latakia 2S . Gd . a pound .

Practically all the tobacco smoked in Britain is imported in the leaf and prepared here . The imports of manufactured pipe - tobacco are insignificant , cigars constituting the bulk imported under the heading ' Manufactured . ' Tobacco can be imported only at such ports in Britain as possess Custom Houses , in vessels of not less than too tons burden , and in quantities of not less than 950 pounds as merchandise . Excise officers are empowered to board any vessel carrying tobacco as cargo within twelve miles of the coast , to examine the bill of lading and cargo , and to batten down the The Manufacture of Tobacco i i 9 hatches to prevent surreptitious sales of the dutiable tobacco .

On being unshipped the tobacco is conveyed direct to the bonded warehouses . No duty is paid as yet ; it is stored there , and samples , about four pounds of each consignment , are sent by the Excise to the manufacturers who have purchased the tobacco through brokers . The manufacturers can obtain any quantity of their tobacco on paying the duty . This they do from time to time , drawing on their bonded stock as necessity requires . Much tobacco is kept in bond for two or three years , to mature and season before withdrawal for manufacture . Manufacturers have always a large reserve stock , buying the leaf two or three years ahead . There is never less than ? 2,000,000 worth of unmanufactured tobacco in the custody of the Revenue officials .

American tobacco is imported in huge hogsheads , containing from 900 pounds to 1,400 pounds of leaf ; Japanese , Dutch , and most other tobaccos are packed in bales . 1 20 The Soverane Herbe An average hogshead contains tobacco intrinsically worth X35 .

The case of wood is split off and the tobacco stands revealed ? a solid cylinder into which the leaf was compressed on the plantation . With crowbar and wedge the hard , dry mass is split into cakes which girls take and gently separate into their component bunches or hands ' of leaf . The assortment of the leaves for manufacture into the various kinds and brands of tobacco is an art demanding the highest judgment and skill . Tobacco is selected for colour , aroma , body , and drinking power ? the ability to absorb water without becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a badly burning tobacco , and a light leaf to modulate a dark tobacco . The lighter leaves arc used for cut and flake tobaccos , and the stronger for cake and twist . No special growth of leaf is alone used for any brand . Nearly every variety and brand of tobacco is a compound of many different leaves . In reality every tobacco is a mixture and formed by a union of different growths of the sovereign herb . Your favourite honey-dew or navy-cut is compounded of light leaves of Kentucky , Virginia , and Missouri , with a leaf or two of Dutch or Asiatic tobacco , as the ambrosial mixture is of Virginia , China , and Latakia . No tobacco is elementary ; indeed , even the apparently simple shag is a blend of some six or seven different growths to obtain the established flavour . Java , Dutch , Japanese , Greek and other non-American tobaccos are chiefly The Manufacture of Tobacco 121 used as toning and flavouring ingredients , and never smoked au naturel . In the parlance of the tobacco trade all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose during the Civil War of the United States , when the output was - severely checked . Holland , Java , Japan , China and other tobacco-growing countries were called upon to supply the deficiency , and their leaf was used to eke out the American . So firmly established was the American herb as tobacco that other growths were regarded as substitutes , and are so called to this day ? a name which in lay minds has given rise to erroneous ideas of adulteration . Wetting down ' is the first process of manufacture after the hogshead has been separated into its component bunches or hands ' of leaves . These are taken to a cool cellar to be wetted and thoroughly softened . The workman , with the deftness of long experience , sprinkles them with water , and taking up the leaves in armfuls , throws them in layers in troughs , somewhat as hay is tossed to dry . The point of this process is the thorough and even moistening of the leaves so that they may regain their natural softness and elasticity . Skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' some tobaccos absorbing more water than others , while an eye must always be kept on the Revenue restriction of moisture to 30 per cent . The popular idea that in this wetting saltpetre is added to assist combustion is totally erroneous . The inherent dampness of tobacco is termed by the trade initial moisture ' ; the amount of water added I2 2 The Soverane Herbe in the course of manufacture is dubbed moisture on . ' The inherent amount of moisture in tobacco strikes an average of 15 per cent . This allows to manufacturers a maximum addition of water of 17 or IS per cent. , to remain inside the Government limit of 3o per cent . moisture . For twist and cake tobaccos full advantage is taken of this , a good drinking ' leaf being selected for these brands . On the other hand , some flake and cut tobaccos contain only 5 per cent . of added moisture . On an average tobacco ready for smoking contains moisture to the extent of 25 per cent . Tossed into layers and sprinkled with varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of days . Absorbing the moisture , the dry , shrivelled tobacco of the hogshead uncurls itself and becomes moist and pliable like a kid glove . In the stripping-room the leaves are then smoothed and stretched to their natural size . Most American tobaccos are imported stripped of the thick central stein . Such as are not , are so stripped , ' the soft and pliable leaf enabling the swift , unerring fingers of the girl-workers easily to tear away the midrib . The feat appears easy , but like many , it requires practice and skill to tear out the rib quickly and cleanly without jagging the leaf . For some brands , such as bird'seye , twist , cake , and some mixtures , the midrib is not removed , but chopped with or incorporated in the tobacco . Wetted down , ' stripped , ' smoothed and opened out , the leaf is ready for cutting into the shag or flake for which it is destined .

The old process of compressing these into solid cakes for cutting is obsolete except for navy-cut and flakes . Now the leaves are piled loosely and bulkily in the trough of the cutting-machine , which is similar in principle to the old-fashioned chaff-cutter , though of course worked by steam . Slowly-revolving rollers draw the leaves between them , and compressing the loose heap of 12 or 14 inches deep into a solid cake of 2 inches , carries it under the guillotine knife . This , descending with rapid stroke after stroke , shears the tobacco-glacier into shavings , which a revolving-drum carries forward . The long , keen blade cuts from 300 to 400 strokes per minute. , and the loose , broad leaves fed into the end of the machine fall away , in the shavings which all smokers know , from the knife at the front .

To the mere layman the shavings seem as fine as before , but the experienced workman , noting the rather rough cut , slips off the driving-belt , unscrews the long , heavy blade , and inserts a newly-sharpened one . The stoppage is merely momentary , for the cutter ' stops the machine , unships the knife , bolts in a fresh one , and has the machine shearing away tobacco again in less than thirty seconds . The stroke of the knife can be adjusted to a nicety . 1 24 The Soverane Herbe For superfine shag and the finest cut tobacco the knife cuts fifty strokes to the inch , each shaving of tobacco being thus one-fiftieth of an inch in breadth . Rougher navy-cut and flake tobaccos are cut at twenty or even fourteen strokes per inch . As they conic from the knife coarse flakes and cuts are dried and packed into tin boxes for sale . Shag and other fine-cut tobaccos for pipe and cigarettes are carried from the machine , whence they emerge in long , close shavings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife , is placed in long , shallow troughs , and heated to 20o or 400 " F. bya multitude of gas-burners playing on the under surface . So hot are these pans ' that the dry bits of tobacco actually scorch . Workmen , taking the ( lose , damp tobaccoshavings , knead and toss them on the broiling surface until the flakes are thoroughly separated . Thus steamed , pulled and kneaded , the thin , longitudinal shavings emerge into a mountain of hair-like tobacco such as the smoker presses into his pipe . In wetting down ' the leaves the drying of this stoving process is taken into account . Then the shag or fine-cut honeydew , which in their soft , warm state can be pulled into long-drawn threads , for all the world like silk , must be dried . The hairy tobacco is spread on gauze and blasted by a current of air to expel the steam and cool it , an electrically-driven fan accomplishing this in three or four minutes instead of the twenty-four hours of the old process of spreading and natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture into cigarettes . The Manufacture of Tobacco 125 This damping and cutting process , with minor variations , is common to all loose or cut tobaccos . Shag , the oldest of cut tobaccos , is prepared from strong leaf , very finely cut into strips of one-fiftieth of an inch , and steamed and kneaded . Returns ' is made in the same way from light-coloured and mild tobacco . It is so called from being originally prepared by returning ' shag for re-cutting . Bird's-eye is similarly prepared , but for its manufacture the leaf is not stripped of its mid-rib . The leaves are cut up intact with the central stalk , and it is the sections of these , supposed to resemble birds ' eyes , that give it the name . All fine honeydew and cuts ' are thus shaved into flakes , to be kneaded and steamed and pulled into the familiar hair-like mass . In the same way , also , the increasingly popular smoking mixtures ' are now prepared . Though every brand of tobacco is more or less an amalgam of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of quite recent invention . Like so many discoveries , the mingling of strong and dark , light and mild , tobaccos was the work of necessity . Twenty or thirty years ago a IIuddersfield gentleman was travelling home from London . After leaving King 's Cross he discovered that his store of pipetobacco was nearly exhausted and would not suffice for the journey . He found , however , that he had a cake of tobacco which he occasionally chewed . To eke out ammunition for his pipe during the journey he cut up the cake and mixed it with his flake tobacco . The mixture was greatly to his liking what he had smoked of necessity he continued to smoke of free choice . Meeting a friend employed in a Liverpool tobacco factory , he offered him his own-made mixture , singing its praises loudly , as smokers are wont to laud their favourite brand of burning . The tobacco-man smoked thereof ; enjoyed vastly , and so realized the value of the idea that within a very short time the first smoking mixture was placed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tobaccos in their cut state , just as many smokers make their special vanity by buying half an ounce of Latakia to mix with an ounce of gold flake . 1low difficult is the thorough intermixing of the two every smoker knows . Manufacturers now insure the absolute amalgamation of the dark , coarse leaf with the finer body of the mixture by assorting the leaves before cutting . Kentucky or Virginia may form the body . To this are added a few leaves of the light-tissued Chinese herb to brighten , and some dark , blunt Latakia and stubby cigar-brown Java or Japanese leaves to flavour . This bundle of varied leaf is placed in the machine , compressed into one mass by the rollers , and cut into shavings to be kneaded and pulled into a perfect mixture , as shag . By this method a mixture of perfect union and long , silky strands is obtained , with none of the dusty and fragmentary character of tobacco mixed after cutting . The manufacture of flake tobaccos is the same , except that the tobacco is pressed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar slices . The Manufacture of Tobacco 127 They are dried and packed in boxes in the long narrow sections into which the knife shears the tobacco-cake . Little of the popular navy-cut is now prepared after the nautical manner . The generality of it is marine only in name , being pressed and cut like ordinary flake tobacco . For true naval tobacco one must make a raid on the Royal Navy . The Admiralty serves out tobacco-leaf to Jack at a charge of Is. a pound , this leaf being duty-free . ( No duty is exacted on tobacco consumed out of England ; before sailing , captains of merchant ships requisition from the Customs tobacco free of duty for consumption on the voyage . ) The bluejacket of the Royal Navy buys tobacco in leaf from the ship 's stores . He damps the leaves ? old hands use rum to strengthen and flavour ? and lays them neatly lengthwise , one on top of another . This bundle he rolls up into the shape of a cigar , thick in the middle and tapering at the ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tightly secured with thick cord , neatly and tautly wound round from end to end . In three weeks or so the leaf is welded into a solid , torpedo-shaped plug , which is cut into small , square slices and rubbed up for the pipe . This is true navy-cut . But scarcely any of the tobacco sold as such is so prepared , being pressed and cut like ordinary flake tobacco . Originally all tobacco was prepared , like true navy-cut , by hand ; in the not remote past each smoker carried his plug of tobacco about with him , and cut it up as the occasion and his pipe demanded . r z S The Soverane Herbe From a strictly chronological point of view this account of the manufacture of tobacco should have commenced with cake tobacco . The herb smoked by Elizabethan worthies was ' pudding , ' roll , ' and twist . ' These hard tobaccos are the forms in which ' the weed of glorious feature ' was originally prepared . They were compact and convenient for carrying about , the smoker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for chewing and smoking . The plug known as earotte in the seventeenth century was a roll , about to inches long and 3 inches thick , sweetened with treacle . It was for such a roll of Virginia that Sir Roger de Coverley called at a tobacconist 's on his way to Westminster Abbey . For cake tobaccos strong and ' coarse leaves are selected . The ultimate form of the tobacco permits the use of short , broken leaves , though these are not necessarily of inferior quality . But the leaf drinks well , ' and moisture to the full legal extent of 3o per cent . is added . With a duty to pay of 3s. per pound , naturally every scrap of tobacco is carefully hoarded . Until recently such of the midribs , removed from the leaf for shag , etc. , as were not ground into snuff were returned to the Customs , and the duty which had been paid thereon was claimed and received by the manufacturer . Now these refuse midribs are crushed between the rollers of a machine and the flattened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be noted that even the refuse and sweepings of tobacco factories are collected and returned to the Customs for drawback . The Manufacture of Tobacco 129 The sweepings are analysed for dust and extraneous matter , and the duty of 3s. per pound refunded on the wasted tobacco . Pigtail , ' thick twist , ' Irish roll , ' etc. , are prepared in one way , differing only in the thickness of the spin . The leaves , having been well damped ? cake tobacco absorbs three times as much water as some flakes ? are placed on the table at the end of the spinning-machine . Under the nimble fingers of the girl attendant the long , damp leaves are shaped into a continuous rope , which , passing under wooden rollers and their smoothing , tightening touch , is wound on a huge spindle , revolving obversely , so as to twist the tobacco-rope . Very curious is this evolution of the leaf into a long , smooth cable . From this spindle the rope is spun into serpentine coils , forming circular cakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . The Customs now limit the oil in cake tobacco to 4 per cent . In former days 20 per cent . was allowed , and inserted . It is told how Northern manufacturers used to sell cake tobacco at less than the price of leaf , so free was their lubrication . The cakes of coiled tobacco are covered with tarred rope and heavily pressed in batches . For a day or two the cakes are subject to hydraulic pressure varying from 50 tons to ioo tons . They are then cooked ' in a steam-stove , and pressed at the same time for six hours , and left for a day or two to cool . The brown rope , as which the twist ' started , is now a serpentine-coiled cake , the jet-black colour being due to the oil , the steam and pressure , and the 9 13 0 The Soverane Herbe tobacco-juice . The paper enveloping the cakes during the cooking ' and pressing is the black tobacco-paper used by gardeners for insecticide puposes . Nailrod ' and plug ' are made by pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cooking . Roll and cake tobaccos is greatly favoured by soldiers , sailors and artisans for its full flavour , its suitability for chewing and its portability . Waterloo Charges , ' a curious form of hard tobacco , were very popular just after the downfall of Napoleon . " These charges were readymade fills for the pipe , being shaped like the end of a cigar , and exactly fitting the bowl . But though the cartridge has superseded the old powder-flask and ramrod loading of fire-arms , the ready-made charges for pipes flourished for a time only . In this country flavouring and sweetening of tobacco is forbidden , save under Government supervision . Cavendish ? so called from its inventor , Cavendish , an admiral of Queen Elizabeth and the ancestor of the ducal house of Devonshire ? and Negrohead owe their special existence to the addition of sweetening . Until 1863 their importation into and manufacture in the United Kingdom were prohibited . They may now be prepared in bond , under Government supervision , and must be sold in packages bearing an Excise stamp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large quantities arc imported from America at a duty higher than that on other manufactured tobacco . The manufacture of cavendish is , in the main , The Manufacture of Tobacco 13I similar to that of ordinary flake tobacco , the distinguishing feature being the addition of flavouring and sweetening matter . These sauces ' are trade secrets , but they are usually analogous to liquorice . Connoisseurs used to find in cavendish the purest and sweetest flavour , as the tobacco was not subject to all the wettings and pressings that other tobaccos undergo . Now , however , that cavendish is cut and flaked like other tobaccos , that virtue can no longer be claimed for it . As any tobacco containing sweetening comes under the Customs ' designation of negrohead or cavendish , the bright-flake sweetened tobaccos , now very popular , are so-called , though they scarcely resemble true cavendish , which is very black and strong . Large quantities of loose tobaccos are now put up into packets , ready to be handed across the counter to the smoker . This is of quite recent origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his herbe ' weighed out to him from bulk , as he still has his cheese and bacon . After describing the manufacture , Fairholt merely says , ' the tobacco is then sent in casks to the shopkeeper . ' Large quantities are still sold from the scales , but the sale of packeted tobacco is increasing every year . The packing-room is one of the most interesting features of a tobacco factory . Into tins , whether t-ounce cases or 4-pound canisters , tobacco is , of course , packed by hand , girls weighing out the flakes into portions , enclosing in paper , and placing in the neat tin boxes of familiarity . Cigarettes are encased in the same way . But in the wrapping of tobacco I 3 2 The Soverane Herbe into paper packets steel machinery has superseded feminine fingers , though a considerable amount is still done by hand . Nothing mechanical is more pretty than this neat and unerring packing and enfolding of tobacco at the rate of sixty packets per minute . At a table before the machine sit three girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the calibre of the machine . Almost instinctively the girl picks up the right quantity of tobacco , weighs it on the scale , and with accurate aim shies it into one of an endless chain of little buckets travelling up and round . The bucket carries the tobacco up to the top of the machine , and turning f ( ar the descent , drops its burden into a funnel . Through this the tobacco falls on to one of a series of paper wrappers coming from the other end on an endless band . Metal fingers and clutches turn ul , the paper over the tobacco , which , drifting onward , other clutches neatly fold , tuck in the ends with inhuman precision , and drop out the packet complete . The packing-machine is uncanny in its steel skill ; one gazes at the process with awe and wonder . Here mention may be made of the practice and penalties of adulteration . It is as old as the habit of smoking . Ben Jonson declaimed against tobacco sophisticated to taste strong ' by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In those days , when tobacco cost 1os. per pound ( multiply by three for modern value ) , smokers were fain to eke it out by adding a quarter of a pound of coltsfoot The Manufacture of Tobacco 133 ( still patronized by juvenile smokers ? the first trial of many a veteran ) to half a pound of tobacco . Adulteration is strictly forbidden and heavily punished . By Act 5 and 6 Victoria , ? 30o is the ' fine for using any substance whatever but water in the manufacture of tobacco , cut or cigars ; ? zoo is the penalty for dealing in adulterated tobacco or for having in a factory sugar , honey , molasses , treacle , leaves of herbs or plants , powdered wood , weeds ( ground or unground ) , roasted grain , lime , sand , umbre , ochre , or any substance capable of being used to adulterate or to increase the weight of tobacco or snuff . To-day the adulteration of tobacco may be said practically to have ceased . Leaves of every tree and plant steeped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco , together with peatearth , bran , saw-dust , and various meals , with alum , lime , saltpetre , and red and black dyes . A few years ago a man summoned for manufacturing cigars without a license escaped conviction by pleading that his cigars were not made of tobacco , but of cabbage-leaf and brown paper . Cigars have been found to be made of 75 per cent . lime-leaves , Io per cent . tobacco-steeped paper , 11 per cent . tobacco and 4 per cent , gunpowder . Adulteration of tobacco may now be said to belong to the past . The annual Report of the Government Laboratory furnishes proof conclusive of the purity of tobacco . Of ninety-five samples of tobacco analysed only twenty , all of foreign manufacture , proved to be adulterated . It is in the matter of moisture that 134 The Soverane Herbe most sins are committed , and such are the result of accident rather than of deliberate purpose to defraud the public . The smoker who buys packet-tobacco of eminent firms need have little fear of being fumed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture of tobacco an annual license at the rate of ? 5 5s. per 20,000 pounds is required . Though the price of tobacco in bond varies from 3d. to ' Ss. per pound ( the latter for cigars ) , the duty is 3s. or 3S. 2d. , according to moisture , on all leaf . On tobacco for manufacture into common shag or into rare cigars the duty is the same . A sidelight may be thrown on the prime cost of tobaccos . Take first the case of common shag , retailed at 3d. per ounce . leaf for this costs 7d. per pound , and contains 15 to 16 per cent . of inherent moisture . Duty adds 3s . But the manufacturer , adding 20 per cent . of water , reduces the net cost to 2s. iod . per pound , which is sold across the counter at 4s . This is made up of : Duty , 2s. 5d. ( calculating addition of moisture and so reduction of dutiable tobacco ) ; leaf ( bone dry ) , 6d. ; water ( 30 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and retailer 's profits , 7d. ? total , 4s . Tobaccos sold at 4d. per ounce are cut from leaf costing iod . per pound , and containing 14 to 15 per cent . natural moisture . Duty adds 3s . Water is added to 25 per cent. , and the prime cost reduced to 3S. 4d. per pound , to be sold for 5s. 4d .

As to the addition of moisture , it must be noted that leaf , as imported with 15 per cent . moisture , is altogether too dry for smoking . Wetting down to 20 per cent . at least is essential to good smoking . It will be noted that though the retail prices vary from 4s. to 6s. per pound , the profits vary from 7d. to Is. 7d . The lower the price , the greater is the pro-portion of duty . The difference in price between shag at 3d. and a smoking mixture at 7d. per ounce is due not to the tobacco itself but the preparation . For a fancy mixture the smoker has to pay a fancy price , altogether out of proportion to the intrinsic value . For a shilling spent on 3d. shag and 4 : ! d. flake , the values respectively received are : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I 3 6 The Soverane Herbe writer , to disillusion the public of their idea that the extra value is in the tobacco itself , but the fact is such is not the case . The highest-priced Havanas and tobacco consist only of selected leaf . ' Fifty years ago all tobacco smoked in Britain was very dark , strong , and full-flavoured , and uniform in colour . in the last thirty years a very remarkable change has taken place , and now light-coloured , mild tobacco almost monopolizes the market . As we have shown in the previous chapter , its production and consequent sale was the result of the carelessness of planters . Its general demand arose about 187o-188o , and has extended so greatly t hat t o-day a really good , full-flavoured ( lark tobacco is rare . Whether this is the result of a perverted taste is an open question ; certainly old smokers sigh in vain for the full-flavoured , coarse cut of their youth . As to the hygienic aspect , smoker 's throat ' and the indigestion produced by over-smoking arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best antidote for over-smoking is to act upon the advice of Hippocrates and cure one smoke by another ? smoke stronger tobacco . It satisfies the appetite for smoking ; delicate moss-leaves ' and mild cigarettes are merely spoon meat , and leave the craving untouched . Probably the demand for mild tobacco is an instance of the weakening of the national taste consequent upon the enervation of wealth : claret is preferred to port , flannelette to flannel , snippety reading to literature , the music-hall to the drama , and the cigarette to the pipe . On the other hand , it must be stated that since the demand The Manufacture of Tobacco i 37 for lighter tobacco began adulteration , has become extremely rare . The taste for tobacco varies greatly in accordance with climate and physique . In the tropics mild , aromatic tobacco is smoked . The sturdy Northmen , with robust taste strengthened by cold and toil , rejoice in very strong tobacco . On the Continent lighter tobacco and cigars are smoked than in England . Indeed , it would be physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that he cremates his garden-grown tobacco . Even in the small area of the United Kingdom the climate and local temperament greatly influence the consumption of tobacco . In the South of England light , mild tobaccos are smoked ; the Eastern and Midland counties fill their pipes with a medium coloured dark flake . The farther north the darker and stronger becomes the tobacco . In the North of England strong mixtures and black cake tobacco are favoured . When you reach Scotland you find that four out of every five smokers charge their cutties with black twist . In Celtic Wales and Ireland cake and dark tobaccos likewise form the bulk of the trade . It is curious , too , that removal to a warmer clime results in a change of tobacco . The most veteran pipe-smoker lays aside his briar in sunny Italy and puffs the dainty , airy cigarette . In such a land of beauty and sun the pipe is felt to be out of place , the cigarette the only possible smoke in an atmosphere of natural indolence and luxuriance . ( ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking has been already described . The inhalation of the sacred fume was regarded as synonymous with the inspiration of the spirit of the gods . At first the medicine- or mystery-man brooded over the fire inhaling the smoke of the tobacco-sacrifice . This clumsy method was soon superseded by the use of the tobago or Y-tube , which obviated the fumigation of the whole head . Then came the use of the long reed , which , stopped at one end , constituted the pipe in its primitive and simplest form . Thus was evolved the pipe . The natural stages in the evolution of the pipe can still be seen in various parts of the world . The African savage , when // pipeless , digs a small hole in the ground , beats down the earth hard , lights some tobacco in it , and thrusting a hollow reed below it , sucks up the smoke . The poorer Chinaman advances a stage farther when he makes a simple pipe by boring a hole near the end of a joint in a slender bamboo , and places and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first rough pipe the Indian rapidly improved as smoking passed from the ceremonial into the practical stage , from use as incense and a source of supernatural guidance into the daily comforter and helpmeet , not of the medicine-man only , but of the whole Indian people . From them all nations have adopted the pipe , the first as it is the best mode of drinking tobacco . The true smoker regards all as mere dawdling save the pipe . Nor is the reason far to seek . The smoking of cigars or cigarettes is merely a practice ? a habit . Pipesmoking is a cult . The one is polytheism or polygamy , the other pure theism or monogamy . In all nations and countries the pipe is , and ever will be , the only smoke of the true , ardent Nicotian . To him smoking is more than a mere burning of a herb , the inhalation of the fume , the expiration of smoke ; it is more than a mere physical performance : it is spiritual and mental as well as material ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deed . In the Indian grave-mounds of the Mississippi Valley there have been found specimens of the primitive : pipes which prove the practice of smoking to be literally older than the hills . The antiquity of these mounds , and hence of the pipes , is shown I 40 The Soverane Herbe by the enormous trees , centuries old , as their sectional rings testify , growing on them . The number of pipes which have been found proves smoking to have been universal in remote times , while their variety and delicacy of carving testify to the artistic skill of their makers and users . These primitive pipes are generally carved out of pieces of brown porphyry , and are of great polish and strength . The base is about 5 inches long and 11 inches broad , while the bowl is slightly more than t inch high , with a diameter of half an inch . Such appears to have been the primitive pipe , but smokers soon improved on this form , as hundreds of relics testify . In the same hard Stone have been found quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , birds , fishes , and reptiles , with an astonishing fidelity to Nature . The most interesting of these , as throwing light upon the antiquity of smoking , is that known as the elephant pipe . ' It is thought that this tuskless elephant is in reality the mastodon , and shows smoking to have been practised by the very earliest inhabitants of America . With remarkable truthfulness to Nature , early smokers carved their pipes into representations of a heron holding a fish , a hawk grasping a bird in its talons : into figures of bears , wolves , panthers , squirrels , snakes , and other incidents and sights of the chase . All these carvings face the smoker , and do not , as in modern clays , decorate the bowl at the opposite end for mere ostentation . These so-called pipes are really the bowls of pipes . A reed or hollowed ash-stem from 2 feet to 4 feet Pipes 14.1 long was fitted into the base of the bowl , through which the smoke was drawn . Not until European influence began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pre-European pipes invariably consist of two parts . These pipe-bowls are all made of stone ? of granite , porphyry , or basalt . The method of manufacture was thus described by Catlin in 1841 : They shape the bowls of their pipes from the solid stone , which is not quite as hard as marble , with nothing but a knife . The Indian makes the hole in the bowl of the pipe by drilling into it a hard stick , shaped to the desired size , with a quantity of sharp sand and water , kept constantly in the hole , subjecting him therefore to very great labour and the necessity of much patience . ' The stem was made of a young ash-stalk , the pith of which had been drawn out . Among the Indians smoking was more than a mere habit or practice : it was intimately connected with their national , social , and religious life . In every event the pipe had its significance ; war was instituted by sending round the tribe the reddened pipe of the chief to summon his warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the calumet ; it was the Indian 's constant companion in every circumstance of life , and in death it was buried with him with his bow and arrows , so that he might not be tobaccoless in the happy hunting-ground . The passing of the calumet from mouth to mouth , the solemn inspiration of one puff of smoke , was the pledge of peace and amity , the gage of honour between all whose lips touched it . The Norsemen 142 The Soverane Herbe pledged their honour and friendship in draughts of mead ; similarly the Indian pledged his faith and amity in the smoke of the peace-pipe . And of the two it can not be denied that the latter is the more poetic . The sacredness and significance of smoking appears , however , not to have dwelt in the tobacco , for in its absence red willow-hark and other herbs were used , but in the pipe . Pipe-smoking from the beginning has been and is a cult . The quarry , the Coteau des Prairies , in Wisconsin , from the red-stone of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , and stubbornly defended by them against the invasion of the white man . To-day it is still reserved to the Indians , and the Sioux , in whose reservation it is , permit no white man to cut pipestone there . The stone , known as catlinite , after Catlin , the first white man who saw the place , is of a red colour , resembling steatite , and is easily worked , giving a fine polish . From the smoker 's point of view it makes a good pipe , smoking very sweet and cool . Some pipes are found for two smokers ; on both sides of the bowl there are openings for the insertion of stems , and thus two people could smoke the same pipe . To all Indians the quarry is sacred ground . The Indian legend of the Flood says that when , many centuries ago , a great deluge arose and destroyed all peoples , the red-men of all tribes gathered together at the Coteau des Prairies to escape the waters . The Flood rose and rose , and gradually submerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red-stone. // From this stone their pipes were and are made . From the legend that the stone was the flesh of their common ancestors the quarry is considered sacred and neutral ground , and belonging equally to all tribes . Thus their differences and quarrels are forgotten at the tomb of their fathers ; the stone from which their pipes were fashioned was the flesh of the ancestors transformed to stone by the Great Spirit . Thus , whilst smoking there or elsewhere , their pipes reminded them of their common humanity , ae-1 bred peace and amity . Longfellow opens The Song of Hiawatha ' with the legend of the institution of the peace-pipe : On the Mountains of the Prairie , On the Great Red Pipe-stone Quarry , Gitche Manito the Mighty , He the Master of Life descending On the red crags of the quarry , Stood erect and called the nations , Called the tribes of men together . From the red-stone of the quarry With his hands he broke a fragment , Moulded it into a pipe-head , Shaped and fashioned it with figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reed for a pipe-stem With its dark green leaves upon it , Filled the pipe with bark of willow , With the bark of the red willow . And erect upon the mountains Gitche Manito the Mighty Smoked the Calumet , the Peace Pipe , As a signal to the nations . ' 14.4 . The Soverane Herbe The tribes saw the signal and obeyed it , all assembling in full war-paint and arms : All the warriors drawn together By the signal of the Peace Pipe , ' and stood Wildly glaring at each other , In their faces stern defiance , In their hearts the fends of ages , The hereditary hatred , The ancestral thirst of vengeance . ' The Master of life admonishes them for their wrath and feuds , and recounting his gifts of lands , streams , bear , bison , and all other pleasures and necessities of life , asks why they are not contented , and why they hunt each other . Ile commands the warriors to bathe in the river , wash away their warpaint , bury their weapons , and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and live henceforth as brothers . They obey , and emerging from the river In silence all the warriors Broke the red-stone of the quarry , Smoothed and formed it into Peace Pipes , Broke the long weeds by the river , Decked them with their brightest feathers , And departed each one homeward , While the Master of Life ascending Through the opening of cloud curtains , Through the doorway of the heaven , Vanished from before their faces In the smoke that rolled around him , The Pukwana of the Peace Pipe . ' Pipes ' 45 1And pipe in mouth the nations of to-day , like the tribes of America , meet on a common ground , that of tobacco , their common friend and consoler . It was not mere fancy and poetry , beautiful as is the sentiment , that made the Red Indians regard smoking as symbolic of friendly intercourse and a guarantee for peace . In fact as well as fiction , physically as well as poetically , smoking is peaceful and amicable . The calumet , or peace-pipe , is the most sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to generation . The bowl is made of the sacred red-stone ; the stem , 4 or 5 feet long , is fastened to the bowl by leather thongs , and gaily decorated with the brightest eagles ' feathers , tufts of ribbon , and glass beads . Each tribe has its distinctive pipe , and an Indian can tell to what tribe a pipe belongs as easily as a soldier recognises the regiment of a fighting man from his uniform . The calumet was only smoked to ratify treaties and peace , and then with much ceremony . After the conditions of the treaty of peace had been settled , the chief solemnly brought in the calumet , and removed its wrappings . Filling and lighting it , he pointed the stem to the north , south , cast , west , to the sky , the earth , and the fire , as an offering to the spirits ; then solemnly inhaling one puff of the smoke , he passed the pipe to the next brave . He likewise gave his assent and oath to the agreement by inhaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circle of sitting braves . No more inviolable pledge and sacred oath could an Indian give than that of the io 1 46 The Soverane Herbe calumet ; rarely or never was it broken . The pipe of peace , which has become an English idiom , dates its institution , as we have seen , from the legendary period of Indian history . All the early travellers in America noted the custom . The Chevalier Montgomery , the French Governor of Canada in 1645 , confirmed treaties with various Indian tribes by smoking the pipe of peace . The pipe of war entailed no such ceremony . The Indian brave , after scalping his enemy with his tomahawk , sat down and smoked a pipe out of the same weapon . The back of the steel head is fashioned into a pipe-bowl , and the reed handle , being hollow , forms the stein .

In France tobacco was first used as snuff , smoking coming from England much later . The Spaniards , learning the practice from the Caribees , smoked a tobacco-leaf twisted up in an outer leaf of maize ? the first cigarette . This was the general custom in the West Indian Islands , pipe-smoking being confined to the mainland . Before the Spaniards explored the Continent they had acquired this manner of smoking , and did not abandon it for the pipes used in Mexico and South America . But the first English smokers graduated in the art // of drinking tobacco under the able tuition of the North American Indians . Like them , as Hariot distinctly states , they smoked from pipes of stone , and introduced the same instruments and manner of smoking into England . At first the poorer classes in England were fain content to drink tobacco from a walnut-shell , through a straw . The richer habitues sported silver pipes . It was soon found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clay . These appear first to have been made about 1590 . The German Hentzer , whose account of smoking in England in 1598 has been quoted , notes with surprise the ' use of clay pipes . Twenty years later Dr. Neander , of Bremen , in his Tabacologia , ' praised the English mode of taking tobacco through clay tubes in imitation of the Indians . A French-man , writing in 1688 , says that the English invented the pipes of baked clay which are now used every-where . ' From England the Dutch learned the rnanu-facture of pipes , and as late as the last century all the tools used in pipe-making in Holland bore English names . The first pipes were extremely small , and their curious pear-shaped bowls held only a very small quantity of tobacco . This , doubtless , was due to the high price of the herb . The stems were about 3 inches long , though some were twice the size . Under the bowl was a flat heel or spur , enabling the pipe to be stood upright on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years one pipe served a whole company , being passed from man to man round the table . r 4 8 The Soverane Herbe These primitive pipes of England are from time to time brought to light in excavations . Their extreme smallness led to the belief among the rustics that they are the pipes of fairies . They are so called in England , and the Scots similarly christen them Celtic or elfin pipes . They are regarded as mascots , and preserved as lucky charms in both countries ; but the Irish , believing they belong to the cluricaunes ( mischievous elves ) , and are unlucky , destroy them . To the pretensions of antiquaries , founded upon the discovery of these pipe among ancient relics , that smoking was practised in Britain before the sixteenth century , attention has already been paid . However great the temptation , it is impossible for the smoker to believe that the soldiers guarding the farthest fortress of Imperial Rome in bleak Northumbria consoled themselves on their long , cold watches with a whiff from a blackened cutty , or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dudeen . The oldest pipes discovered , in whatever company in Britain , have been of the Elizabethan stamp and pattern . Broseley in Staffordshire has been noted for its clay pipes from the time of Elizabeth to the present day . Vauxhall , Derby , and Bath were other centres of the pipe manufacture , and Ben Jonson testifies that in his day Winchester pipes were accounted superior to all others . So rapidly did smoking gain ground and the demand for pipes created so flourishing a trade , that in 1619 ? less than forty years after the introduction of tobacco ? the pipe-makers received their charter // of incorpoPation from James I. The Company of Pipe-Makers consisted of a master , four wardens , and twenty-four assistants . Their arms were : Argent on a mount in base vert , three plants of tobacco growing and flowering , all proper . Crest : A Moor , in his dexter hand a tobacco-pipe ; in his sinister a roll of tobacco , all proper . Supporters : Two young Moors proper , wreathed about the loins with tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pipe-Makers ' Company was Let brotherly love continue . ' The guild was dissolved about a century ago . All pipes then were made of clay , though occasionally some were made of iron or brass . The pipe of Miles Standish , a little iron thing about the size of a common clay , is still preserved in America . Sometimes a sumptuous smoker had a pipe specially carved out of wood . There is such a pipe beautifully decorated in the style of the seventeenth century in the Kensington Museum . These , however , were exceptions to the rule . Until forty years ago a pipe meant a clay , and of the various varieties and shapes there is an interesting collection in the British Museum . The two famous makers of pipes in the seventeenth century seem to have been Thomas Gauntlet and Jolin Legge , large numbers of pipes bearing their trade-marks and initials having been found . The small barrel-bowled short pipes of Elizabethan times held their ground with little variation until the Revolution , when England began to smoke bigger bowled pipes with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advent of William III . The Irish and Scotch , however , remained true to the smaller , shorter dudeen and cutty . Long clays with straight stems tipped with sealing-wax were intro duced by the Dutch about 17oo . These aldermen , ' as they were called , held much larger quantities of tobacco than the old ones , proving that under the tuition of the Dutch past-masters in the art of drinking tobacco , the smoker 's appetite was grow ing bigger . These long clays were those from which the wits of Queen Anne 's reign inspired the fragrant fume , and for which Sir Roger de Coverley and Addison called at the Club . Only the best pipes were waxed at the end , while smokers prevented the cheaper ones sticking to the lips by steeping the steins for some minutes iii a tankard of ale . Pipes were valuable , and their destruction a serious matter . When the smoker of to-day breaks his clay , he promptly buys another , nor does he ever dream of cleaning a blackened pipe by burning out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when clays were so valuable that when smoked foul they were thrust into the grate until red-hot , and purified for subsequent reblackening instead of purchasing new ones . Inns , clubs , and coffee-houses provided pipes for their customers as they now provide seats , tables , and pots . Corpora tions likewise purchased pipes by the gross for the inspiration of the City Fathers . At these smoking resorts all fouled pipes were carefully collected and sent periodically to the bakehouse to be rekilned . Pipes i 5 i In old municipal records there frequently occurs the entry ' For burning fowle pipes is . ' In inns these renovated pipes were afterwards used in the taproom , parlour customers being provided with new clays . About the middle of the eighteenth century makers ceased to produce the long Dutch-modelled pipes , and returned to the smaller and handier clays , thus showing that smoking was decreasing among the leisured classes , who had patronized the graceful , long pipe . The lower classes still smoked , and for their workaday use the pipe-maker catered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plentiful , pipes were formerly costly . As recently as 1882 clays ? true , they were moulded with figures ? cost sixpence each . The decoration of clay pipes with effigies , figures , busts of . animals , and celebrities was formerly very common . To be carved in effigy on a pipe was the hall-mark of notoriety in bygone days , as to be cartooned by Punch or have . a collar or necktie called by one 's name is now . From a collection of clay pipes it would be possible to write a history of the heroes and events of the last two centuries . The Duke of Wellington , Nelson , Pitt , were thus immortalized ; the introduction of railways , the Crimean War , the Civil War and abolition of slavery in America were all thus commemorated on pipebowls . The head and bowl of pipes were frequently quite distinct , the wooden stem being inserted on occasion by the smoker . The danger of breaking clays in the pocket was thus greatly reduced . Carved I 5 2 The Soverane Herbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally lends itself to decoration , the true smoker believes beauty unadorned is adorned the most ; he needs no further recommendation for his pipe than the tobacco it holds . To the Austrians smokers are indebted for the discovery of the virtue of the meerschaum . More than a century and a half ago there lived in Pesth a shoemaker , Karol Kowates , who earned as much by carving pipes for wealthy smokers as by making shoes . Among his pipe patrons was Count Andrassy . While on a mission to Turkey in 1723 the Count was presented with a lump of meerschaum . Its lightness and porousness suggested its suitability for construction into a pipe , and he handed the meerschaum to Kowates with orders to that effect . Out of the clay Kowates cut two pipes , one for the Count and one for himself . Ills hands were naturally waxy from his craft , and in smoking his meerschaum the pipe became waxed at various points . He found that wherever the pipe had been touched with wax a spot of clear brown colour appeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe , which by dint of smoking assumed a most beautiful and even colour , while also smoking much sweeter than before . This , the first meerschaum pipe , is still preserved in the Pesth Museum . Meerschaum immediately came into fashion and use as the pipe of the connoisseur and gentleman . Our grandfathers highly valued their meerschaums . Collections of finely-coloured and carved pipes were made , as much as L500 being paid for a fine specimen . Pipes 5 3 Every precaution was taken by smokers to er ure the perfect colouring of their meerschaums . ' I he bowl was covered with a little coat of wash-leather , or swathed in flannel to prevent it being scratched or heated by the hand ? fatal to perfect colouring ? and the cleaning was entrusted to competent hands only . In 1819 Sir Walter Scott wrote to his eldest son : As you hussars smoke , I will give you one of my pipes , but you must let me know how I can send it safely . It is very handsome , though not my best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey , and then you shall have that also . ' The bowls of the original meerschaums were large , and the long stem consisted of a cherry-wood stick terminating towards the mouthpiece in a flexible tube like that of a hookah . Nothing can exceed the sweetness of an old meerschaum , originally good and well cared for , while its rich brown tints , indicative of its blood , delights the artistic eye as much as its smoke , enriched by the very essence of tobacco , pleases the palate and charms the soul . Both meerschaum and clay pipes arc now rarely seen , having succumbed before the cheapness and excellence of wooden ones . These are the productions of the last thirty years . Fairholt , writing in 1859 , said : Wooden pipes have been introduced into England , and pipes made of briar root are now common in our shops , but expensive , the bowls costing about three shillings each . ' A Veteran of Smokedom ' in 1865 declared : Of wooden pipes little need be said . They were much in vogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // has decidedly diminished . If they do not heat so rapidly , their absorption is very defective , and they always look dirty . ' The last quarter of the century has seen a complete change of attitude with regard to pipes . The briar is omnipresent and omnipotent ; it is practically indestructible , and in appearance is equally superior to the clay , which with the meerschaum is essentially a reclusive and philosophical pipe , unfitted for the rush and strain of modern life . The introduction of the neat , workaday briar has contributed in no small degree to the renaissance of smoking . Rare as is pipe-smoking in France now , it was popular a century ago . When the French adopted the clay pipes of England they beautified them . Some beautiful pipes carved with figures of men and beasts were made at Sevres . Even more than in England the clay pipe of France , with its decorated bowl , reflected the flowing tide of men and affairs . The pipe of the Revolution was draped with the tricolour , and Liberty , lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immortelles with the motto , Morte pour la Patrie . ' The Napoleons likewise adorned pipes ; Liberte , Egalite , Fraternite ' ( true smoking watchword ) , likewise inspired the smoker with Utopian dreams . The literary inclined smoked from the counterfeit head of Victor Hugo . The patriotic Italian puffed from a pipe the bowl of which was supported by a Roman soldier trampling upon the Austrian eagle . Pipes were likewise decorated with symbolical figures and mementoes of the chase , the theatre , and the ale- // house . But a whole book would be required to deal adequately with the curious decorated pipes of France , Germany , and Holland . In Latin countries , as we have already pointed out , the pipe is the exception rather than the rule . The monopoly of the Cuban and Manila tobacco crops until recently possessed by Spain accounts for the absence of the pipe from the Peninsula . The apology for tobacco supplied by the R6gies of France and Italy suffices in a cigarette , but is impossible in a pipe , though the effervescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stolid , philosophical pipe . Smoking has been defined as the medium through which the German introduces the external air into his lungs . Tom Hood declared he should be afraid to trust a sentimental Prussian to himself without a pipe and tobacco . No nation has experimented more in pipes than have the Germans . The pipe at which they have arrived consists of four parts ? the kopf , to hold the tobacco ; the ahguss , or reservoir , to catch the nicotine secretions ; the stem , and the mouthpiece . The reservoir is an absolute necessity , as the china bowl is impervious to the oils distilled by smoking . The German , with a characteristic carefulness English smokers might well copy , regularly cleans his pipes . Most of the pipes hold from an ounce to a quarter of a pound of the weak , hay-like tobacco . The long bowl is decorated with a carving or gaudy picture ; wealthy smokers lavish gold and gems upon its embellishment , frequently to the value of ? ioo . In no way does the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unwieldy , and must necessarily be held in the hand . It is an execrable smoker , being a mere tobacco still , for the china bowl is absolutely inabsorbent . As great pipe-smokers are the Dutch , with not dissimilar pipes . The bowl is pear-shaped , with a long straight stem , which necessitates holding it in the hand . A handsome pipe is a common wedding present ; it is smoked on the nuptial day , and then carefully laid aside , to be smoked only in future on the anniversary of the day when the happy couple were made one . The Austrians are also great pipe-smokers . Besides inventing the meerschaum , Austria also produced the first of a long race of those tormentors of pupillary nervous smokers , patent pipes . They date from 1689 . In that year Jacob Francis Vicarius , an Austrian physician , made pipe stems of glass , with capsules of sponge to absorb the nicotine . Only dawdlers and puffers of tobacco favour such puerile devices ; the smoker remains true to his simple , unhygienic pipe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes , some being encrusted with gems to the value of Cr , 000 . Your honest smoker , as Izaak Walton would have said , cares not whether his pipe costs sixpence or sixty pounds ; he values it by the pleasure it yields him . Hard smokers shun costly , ostentatious pipes , and patronize simple , workmanlike tools . The Swiss smoke a queer pipe . It is in five distinct parts ; the bowl , covered with a metal lid to prevent the Alpine winds scattering its contents , fits // into a hollow ball , which acts as a reservoir for the juices , the stern entering it at an acute angle . Where the mouthpiece , forming another angle , joins the stem there is carved a grotesque horse 's head . The pipe is made entirely of black horn , mounted with German silver fittings . The carved apple-wood pipes of Berne smoke splendidly , being very sweet and cool . Many and strange are the forms the pipe assumes in different lands . In the far north very small metal pipes , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laps very frequently form the bowl of a pipe by hollowing out the tooth of a walrus . The Danes of Amager Isle smoke a pipe made up of a 6-inch bowl and a 12-inch stem ; as it comfortably holds a day 's allowance of tobacco , it saves time , for the Dane is incessantly smoking . The Chinese pipe consists of a tiny white metal bowl , with a stem from 3 feet to 5 feet long , made up of as many joints . The rich Chinaman smokes a handsome little water-pipe made of brass or silver . In opium pipes , it may be noted , the bowl is in the centre , not at the end of the stem , and opium is burnt in a flame , not smoked like tobacco . Corean pipes are also of brass , but with longer and flatter bowls . The small pipes with reed stems of Japan are similar , but scalloped and ornamented round the bowl . Only the poetic and luxurious Orient could have invented the hookah and narghile . The former is the Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musical hubble-bubble , the smoking of which is as lotus-eating . The hookah and narghile 15 8 The Soverane Herbe are frequently spoken of as one and the same pipe . This is not so ; the hookah stands on the floor or divan , while the narghile ( literally cocoa-nut ) is a hand-pipe . The metal fittings of these pipes are frequently of gold and silver ; the flexible tubes , from 5 feet to to feet long , through which the smoke is drawn , are covered with velvet and encrusted with precious stones and gold filigree work . The waterbottle is of the finest cut glass , and is handsomely decorated with diamonds and other gems . The hookah smoked by the Shah of Persia on state occasions is so studded with diamonds , rubies , emeralds , etc. , that it is worth L8o,000 . This pipe , as is the case in all 0i iental courts , has its suite of attendants , its guardians and cleaners , while to the Master of the Pipe is entrusted the duty of lighting it for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also highly decorated , the velvet tube being covered with gold filigree , and the bowl with gems . Kif , a greenish narcotic plant , is generally preferred to tobacco ; it resembles opium both in the manner of smoking and its effects . The bowl of the Egyptian pipe is of a fine red clay , polished like agate , and the cherry-wood stem has an amber mouthpiece decorated with gold and gems . It is a clumsy , barbarously splendid affair . Waterpipes similar to the Turkish and Persian makes are also common . Of late the cigarette has supplanted the pipe to a very considerable extent in the East , much to the lamentation of the professional pipecleaners. // 9 ment through the long cherry-wood stem from the red clay bowl of their pipes as do their Sultans from the most gorgeous thing in hookahs .

The Kookies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pipes with reservoirs to catch the tobacco juices . When the reservoir is full they swallow the nauseous oils with gusto , esteeming it tho best part of tobacco ! Many Indian villages have a welcome pipe , ' which , kept alight , is offered to passers-by to smoke to the health of the community ? for a consideration . The Russian peasant drinks tobacco from a roughlymade pipe of wood tipped with copper , and lined in the bowl with tin . The dog-wood stem is secured to the bowl by leather thongs . A most curious pipe is that of the Kirghiz . It consists of three bowls surmounting each other on a stem of the usual Eastern length . The Zulus have a similar two-bowl pipe , made of wood and lined with tin . How these queer instruments originated it is difficult to say . Perhaps the smoker 's appetite is so inordinate that one bowl does not suffice , or it may be a patent method of blending the fumes of various kinds of tobacco . The fertility of necessity is abundantly demonstrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed already . In a similar manner the Bechuanas beat a branch or twig into the ground horizontally . At one end they dig a small hole , and draw out the stick , leaving a little tunnel . In the 16o The Soverane Herbe excavation they place and light tobacco , and inhale the smoke through the passage made by the twig . The natives of the Zambesi fasten up one end of an antelope horn , and about a third of the way up fit a big block of wood , which serves as the bowl , the smoke being drawn through the horn . Very similarly the people of New Guinea plug a straight bamboo at one end , and , boring a hole , cram the tobacco down . The Kafurs frequently smoke a rough water-pipe made from a cow 's horn ; when tobacco fails them , dagha , a kind of hemp , is smoked . Some African tribes affect a huge iron pipe nearly 4 feet long . Thus the pipe assumes many shapes and forms , and is made from such different materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , horn , cane , bamboo and stone . There are fine collections of pipes from all parts of the world in the British awl Guildhall Museums , and also specimens of the mound pipes of America and of old English clays . Salisbury Museum possesses an especially valuable collection of the ancient American stone pipes . Mr. William Bragge of Birmingham , who died in 1884 , gathered together no less than 7,000 different pipes of all dates and countries . It is much to be regretted that on his decease this fine collection was permitted to be broken up instead of being secured for the British Museum . Indispensable to the pipe was the tobacco-box , now completely displaced by the rubber pouch . The boxes were made of metal , silver , iron , copper , brass and tin , and of ivory , mother-of-pearl , tortoiseshell , bone and wood , curiously and artistically carved . At Hertford House is a box , traditionally said to have Pipes i6r belonged to Raleigh . It holds a pound of tobacco , and is pierced with holes to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to be carried in the pocket , and contained , in addition to the weed , a pipe , tongs for holding a live coal , flint and steel , and a pipe-picker . Gallants prided themselves on their tobacco-boxes . The spruce coxcomb ' of the reign of James I. Never walked without his looking-glass In a tobacco box or dial set . ' Tobacco-boxes were bequeathed to friends as souvenirs , and sweethearts ' gave him a ' bacca-box marked with her name . ' They were given and exchanged as tokens of friendship and in recognition of esteem , as were snuff-boxes in the latter years of the eighteenth century . When smoking fell into disgrace tobacco was rarely carried by smokers . They called at inns for a tankard of ale , a pipe , and a paper of tobacco . Indiarubber pouches are of quite recent invention , and were brought into use by the practice of smoking out of doors . If the pouch has been introduced , one of the smoker 's tools has dropped out of use . The tobaccostopper for pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tobacco and the greater prodigality of this age have made its use obsolete . Formerly , when tobacco was 8s. or los . a pound , smokers burned their tobacco to the very bottom of the bowl , instead of following the modern wasteful , if healthy , practice of throwing away the residuum . The stoppers were made of wood , bone , ivory , II // mother-of-pearl , brass , silver or gold , in various forms and shapes . Such heroes as Cromwell , Nelson , Wellington , etc. , and the heads of dogs , horses , stags , foxes , etc. , adorned tobacco-stoppers in effigy . Some smokers wore rings provided with a stud for ramming down the contents of a pipe . The relic-hunters of those days frequently carved their stoppers out of the wood or material of some famous tree or article . Taylor , the water-poet , ' made himself two or three tobacco-stoppers out of a dead branch of the famous Glastonbury thorn . Shakespeare 's mulberry-tree was preserved in the same form . When viewing Westminster Abbey Sir Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Wimble were with us and saw those two chairs it would go hard but he would get a tobacco-stopper out of one or t' other of them . ' CHAPTER IX HOW PIPES ARE MADE The cult of pipe-smoking ? Making of clays ? Meerschaum : where found ; its manufacture ? Wooden pipes ? The briar : where grown , how made ? Mouthpieces ? Amber ? Vulcanite and horn ? Choosing a pipe ? The Lancet 's advice ? Cleaning pipes . Sweet smoking pipe , bright glowing stove , Companion of my still retreat , Thou dust my gloomy thoughts remove , And purge my brain with pure heat ) Tom HOOD . THE pipe-smoker regards his clay , meerschaum , or briar with an affection of which the cigar-smoker is totally ignorant . His pipe is more to him than a mere smoking instrument . A cigar is merely a bundle of tobacco-leaves , the means of wiling away an idle hour . When smoked it is forgotten , for its very entity has gone , and its place in the smoker 's thoughts is taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each smoke it yields enriches and endears it to its owner . The cigar is the chance acquaintance of half an hour ; the pipe is the companion and friend of countless smokes and of years . It is the adviser and comforter of affairs which the smoker I I ? 2 164 The Soverane Herbe reveals to not even his dearest human friend . The smoker idealizes his pipe , and endows it with a personality . I le dislikes to , nor does he , regard it as ever having been made by the hands of man and the steel of machinery . Without in any way wishing to destroy this ideal , a book on tobacco would be incomplete without an account of the way pipes are made . Though pipes arc fashioned from such varied materials as wood , stone , bronze , iron , and other metals , clay , china , asbestos , horn , and other vegetable and mineral products , pipes of clay , meerschaum , and wool ( form the overwhelming majority . As has been pointed out , clay pipes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until thirty years ago . liroselcy , in Staffordshire , has been famous for its pipes and clay from the days of Elizabeth . Now all the clay of which white pipes are manufactured comes from Newton Abbot and Kingsteignton in Devonshire . It is sent to all parts of England and the world in rough lumps , about the size of quartern loaves , weighing some 28 pounds each . At the manufactory these lumps are first dried , for the clay absorbs water only when crumbling . The clay is next moistened with water , worked up with a spade , and beaten by an iron bar until it is of the consistency of putty . Masses of So or 90 pounds are served out to the actual pipe-maker . The workman cuts off a piece of clay according to the size of the pipes he is then making , rolls it into the shape of a cigar or stick , and then , with boards fastened to the How Pipes are made i 6 5 palms of his hands , rolls it into the approximate shape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffer , and is moulded . Taking the roll ' in his left hand , he thrusts a wire up it to form the passage for the smoke . It is then placed in a metal mould . This is composed of two valves tightened together with a screw , a stopper , ' or block , in the shape of the bowl being forced into the solid head of the roll . The moulds vary , of course , in shape , as churchwardens , cutties , plain , or fancy pipes are being made . They are placed in racks for another ten hours ' gradual drying , and passed on for trimming . This work is done by women , and consists in again wiring the stem , and with a curved metal burnisher trimming off the seams and edges resulting from the two-fold nature of the moulds . At this stage the pipes are stamped with the maker 's or wholesale dealer 's name . After a day or two 's natural drying the pipes become chalk-white , ' and ready for baking . Packed in coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three gross , they are placed in the kiln . Nearly 200 naggers of pipes are kilned at once , the fire being maintained for seven or eight hours , and twelve or fourteen allowed for cooling . In the early days of pipe-making only twentyfour gross of pipes could be baked at once , but now from 350 to 400 gross are burned at a time , with only t per cent . breakage . The meerschaum is the queen of pipes , though it is no longer regarded as the only pipe for a gentleman . Its delicate and fragile nature accord little with the sternness of this masculine age , and it has now given place to the briar . Meerschaum , literally the foam of the sea , ' is a white mineral , composed of magnesia , silica , and water . When first mined it is soft , though dry , and , forming a lather , like soap , was used by the Tartars in washing . I t varies greatly in density , some lumps floating and others sinking in water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its softness , lightness , purity , and power of absorption that recommend it to smokers . Meerschaum is found in Italy and Spain , but the best and largest quantities come from Eskishur and Natolia in Asia Minor . It lies in lodes and veins , and is dug from marl-pits at a depth of 50 or Go feet . The lumps vary in size from a pigeon 's egg to that of a quarters loaf , the largest blocks being worth over X20 . When brought to the surface it is quite soft , but soon assumes a stiffer consistency . It is packed in boxes of about 50 pounds for export , the price varying from 2s. to 16s. a pound according to the size and quality of the pieces . At the factory the pieces are first cut on a circular saw into the rough size of pipes , each piece being carefully planned out in order to utilize it to the best advantage . After soaking in water , a workman takes the block of meerschaum in hand , and carves it into the approximate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stein drilled , and the whole turned on the lathe . After drying in an oven the mouthpiece is affixed , and the pipe is passed on to the polishers . Glass-paper having removed all roughness , it is im-ryi* : // mersed in hot fat , polished with rags and a special powder . Another bath in hot wax follows , the time of immersion varying from five minutes to an hour , according to the density of the meerschaum . It is the wax which , acting upon the meerschaum , results in the tobacco effecting the fine rich tints so well known and admired . A final polishing with powdered chalk completes the meerschaum , which is then ready for the burning embraces of tobacco . The transformation of the rough sea-foam into the graceful and polished meerschaum entails much care and skilful labour . A plain pipe can be made in three days , but on carved ones months are spent . The decoration of meerschaum is an art , and employs hundreds of workmen . Vienna is the headquarters of the meerschaum manufacture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Attracted by the higher wages offered in England , there are many Germans engaged in the manufacture of meerschaums in London . They frequently earn from L4 to L6 a week . Imitators of meerschaum arc very many . Rurnt gypsum slaked with lime or a solution of gum-arabic forms a hard plaster which , smoothed and polished with oil , assumes a marble-like surface . A very fair imitation of meerschautn is also made of hardened plaster of Paris , polished and tinted with a solution of gamboge and dragon's-blood , afterwards treating it with paraffin-oil or stearic acid . All the cheaper meerschaum pipes , cigar- and cigarette-holders are made of these or similar compounds . There is no absolute test for meerschaum , and experts are fre1168 The Soverane Herbe I quently unable to distinguish the natural from the artificial . In absorption and colouring properties the imitation is equal to the real article at one-half the price . It is estimated that about half a million real meerschaum pipes arc turned out yearly , and twice that number of artificial meerschaum . Meerschaum pipes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard smoking there is nothing to beat a good briar . Granted a good briar is rare , but when obtained what can beat it ? Unlike the meerschaum , one need not handle and smoke it gingerly , in fear of breakage ; finger-heat does not spoil its colouring , so swaddling ; clothes are superfluous . Of course , the briar will not yield the rich shades of the foam of the sca , but the pleasure of the smoker as lie secs the darl:cning wood is not less than that of the meerschaum devotee . The meerschaum is the pipe for the study and house ; it can not be smoked out of doors . But the briar is equal to every occasion . At home , or in the open , in the wind or sun , on land or sea , the briar is ever ready . Sturdy , needing no case , practical and philosophical , it is emphatically the pipe of the Briton . It is not surprising that the wooden pipe is of recent invention , for the wood must possess many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet light . It must be sapless and inodorous , or when heated the fragrance of the tobacco would be lost . And while not essential , it is a desideratum that the fibre should be gnarled , mottled , or grained , and susceptible of a high polish . No native British timber possesses these necessary F How Pipes are made 1 69 qualifications . The root of the French heath-tree , bruyere , corrupted into briar , is really the only suitable wood . Cocus , a very dark wood , is used for cheap pipes , but though very hard , splits easily . Myall wood from Australia emits a pleasant odour of violets , is absorbent and hard , but brittle . Maple , juniper , and cherry-wood are used to a small extent . There are few woods which have not been tried at one time or another , but the result of all experiment is to confirm the fact that briar is practically the only wood suitable for pipes . La bruyere , from the roots of which pipes are made , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , Italy , Spain , Algeria , and Corsica . It has no connection with the briar , the English word being merely a corruption of the French name . Its cultivation is extremely simple , consisting of the regular pruning of the tops in order to promote the growth of the roots . The best briar grows on the hill-sides near Leghorn , the second quality in Corsica , and inferior kinds in Jura and Algeria . Only the root is used , the wood growing above ground being useless , as it is very brittle , and splits immediately it machine knife touches it . In gathering the crop , the plant has to be torn or dug up , roots and all , and it is said that in ten years the supply will be exhausted . The roots are often larger than a man 's body , and weigh hundreds of pounds . The wood is remarkably beautiful and finely veined , as the examination of even the cheapest pipe shows . It is remarkably tough , does not char , and is practically incombustible. 17o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco , burning at a low temperature , gives off less nicotine , making the briar a most hygienic pipe . Ten or fifteen years ago the majority of briar pipes smoked in FIngland were made in France and Germany , but English manufacturers now supply their own land and other countries with briars at cheaper prices . About 400 tons of briar-root are imported to London annually . Nurcmburg and Kuhla do a big trade in briars , the average annual output from each place being 500,000 pipes . The briar is imported in sawn-up , roughly-shaped blocks , 3 or 4 inches square , ready seasoned , the bags holding between a00 and Soo blocks each . At the factory they are first sorted out in sizes for larger or sniallcr pipes , and then steamed in vats for twelve hours , to give them the familiar yellowishbrown tint . The workman takes a block in hand , decides into what form it can best be fashioned , and places it in the boring machine . This has three knives ; the middle knife , revolving 4,000 times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the two outer ones cut away the wood on the outside , forming it into the shape of a pipe . The roughly-formed briar is then placed in a lathe used for cutting irregular forms . A metal pattern of the shape the pipe is designed to become is fitted in ; the circular cutting tool , with its peculiar knife-like teeth , is set in motion ; the briarblock turns with the metal model , and is mechanically cut to pattern . The pipe is then finished with coarse and fine sandpaper ( by machine ) , and a final // polish given by a pumice-stone wheel . The hole through the stem is bored by a steel wire , having a cutting tip , turned rapidly by a lathe . Another machine cuts the thread in the end of the stem to screw the mouthpiece ; the silver band or mount , hall-marked at the Government Assay Offices , is fixed and the mouthpiece attached . The pipe is then polished by the naked hand with a preparation of rouge and olive-oil , and is ready for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a briar are three ? good figuring and veining of wood , freedom from knots , and density . In its natural state the briar is of a light colour , and a darker hue is obtained by polishing with linseed or olive oil . This accounts for the peculiar oily condition of many dark briars , rendering their smoking for some time most unpleasant . If the smoker prefer a dark briar he will find that a light one soon assumes a deeper hue , and smokes much more sweetly than a greasy , artificially-darkened one . A briar pipe goes through no less than eighty-four processes in its manufacture . Only S per cent . of all turned out are perfect and of the first quality , eleven out of every twelve pipes being rejected from the premier class for flaws . Only experts can detect the tiny cracks in the unsmokcd briar , through which tobacco juices will ultimately ooze . These imperfect pipes dre assorted and priced according to their merits or demerits . That small but essential part of a pipe , the mouthpiece , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , infinitely superior to vulcanite // or horn . There is no occasion to narrate the history of amber , which was eagerly sought for and prized by the civilized nations centuries before the Christian era . Ir . these smoking days mouthpieces are regarded as the sole end of amber ; but the Greeks , Romans and Egyptians prized it as a gem , wearing amber jewellery , while the wealthiest drank out of amber wineglasses . The old legend declares amber to be the petrified tears slicd by the sisters of Phaeton at his sad death . Amber is merely the fossilized gum or resin of pine-trees . L'ope 's wonder how the devil ' hairs , straws , dirt , grubs ; u1d worms got into the amber is easily removal by modern science . The fly got into the amber when the gum was liquid , and became enveloped and preserved in it by petrification . Over Soo species of inserts and ioo plants have been discovered enveloped in amber . Amber is found literally all over the globe ? in France , Holland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siberia , China , India , occasionally near Cromer in Norfolk , but principally on the shores of the Baltic . It is always found in conjunction with brown coal or lignite . In Eastern Prussia it is mined , as is coal , but elsewhere it is simply dug from the soil or picked up from the cliffs . It is very valuable , costing from 8s. to C12 per pound . Fine large pieces are worth more than their weight in gold . The largest known piece , preserved in the museum in Berlin , weighs 18 pounds , and is valued at - 1- 7,000 . Amber is found in pieces varying from the size of a pea to that of a large potato . When first dug up it // is a very pale yellow , but the longer it is exposed to the light the darker it becomes , in course of years turning a rich ruby tint . Owing to its high price , very little real amber is made into mouthpieces and pipe-stems . The blocks are cut by hand , and the necessary bend made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very delicate , and demand much skill . The amber shavings are carefully preserved , the larger chips being used in the preparation of a very fine varnish for oil-paintings and the smaller fragments ground up to make incense for Roman Catholic churches . There is a belief prevalent among smokers that the imitation amber mouthpieces consist of go per cent . real amber chips and shavings with a io per cent . composition to harden and combine it . But the makers of the best imitation amber guarantee that it contains no amber at all . The composition of the imitation is a trade secret ; the amber ' is so good that only experts can distinguish it from the genuine product . But its looks are its only recommendation ; the cheap kinds are , in fact , positively dangerous , and frequently produce diseases of the mouth and gums . So rare is amber nowadays that it is practically impossible to get a pipe with a genuine amber mouthpiece . Except for appearance vulcanite mouthpieces are little inferior to amber . Cut vulcanite , indeed , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulcanite tips are rough to the lips . Horn mouthbits are made from the horns of Brazilian bullocks . As only the solid tips of these can be used , the rest being hollow , 174- The Soverane Herbe some idea can be formed of the enormous number of bullocks required to tip the pipes of smokedom . After being boiled for ten minutes , the horn is straightened on a lever , then turned on a lathe , bored , and the screw cut . A second immersion in hot water enables the tip to be bent to any angle , and , filed , polished and burnished , it is fitted to the pipe . A pipe of quite Arcadian simplicity is the corncob . It is simply the hollowed-out cob of an ear of Indian corn or maize with a stein inserted near the bottom . It is a feather-weight pipe , and though smoking rather rawly at first , it develops into a splendidly cool and sweet smoker . They are not lasting nor beautiful pipes , for the porous bowl soon becoiues blotclied and saturated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavour they can not be beaten . Your honest smoker does not lay aside his old pipe in a hurry . It is with a sigh of sorrow that he perceives his faithful old briar is getting used up ; the cracks in the bowl can no longer be winked at . That the tip is nearly bitten through and quite jagged with teeth-marks is impressed upon him every time he puffs it ; the internal economy and joints of the briar are choked with nicotine , and even the indulgent smoker can not but recognise that the days of service of his faithful pipe are nearly over . It is a pang to part with it , but an accident robs the pain of half its bitterness by making it compulsory , not voluntary . Your true smoker does not choose a pipe hastily ; it is a matter requiring consideration and judgment . The companion of his thoughts , the counsellor of his // plans , his partner in joy and sorrow , is not to be hastily chosen . He recognises the gravity and responsibility of a pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not court treachery and faithlessness by a hasty choice that leads to quick repentance . He once bought a pipe which taught him a lesson . At first it smoked beautifully , and he congratulated himself on his luck and judgment . Then came a fall ; the brute turned nasty , would not smoke smoothly , and , perforce , he was compelled to throw it aside . All the trust he had reposed in it was betrayed ; henceforth he selected his pipe as he would a wife ? for wearing qualities and faithfulness . A pipe is the very image of true friendship ; it grows better and sweeter with age . There are physical as well as social considerations to be taken into account in choosing a pipe . In this respect we can not - do better than quote a recent paper in the Lancet on the respective hygienic merits of pipes : A soft clay is invariably cool smoking , because the acrid oils obtained on the destructive distillation of the tobacco are absorbed instead of collecting in a little pool , which must eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the mouth . An old wooden pipe or briar , so dear to inveterate smokers , becomes " smooth smoking , " because the pores of the wood widen , and so absorb , as is the case with clay and meerschaum , a large proportion of the tobacco oils . A hook-shaped pipe must be better than a pipe the bowl of which is on the same level as the mouth , for the simple reason // that in the former a considerable quantity of the oil is kept back in the U-shaped part of the pipe , while in the latter the oil travels easily down the stem . Ebonite stems are in general objectionable , because they commonly spoil the true flavour of tobacco smoke . We know instances where ebonite stems have produced distinctly objectionable symptoms in the threat . Bone or real amber makes a much more satisfactory stem , or the pipe should be of wood throughout . Amber substitutes , and especially celluloid , should he discarded entirely as dangerous . Pipes of special construction can not be regarded with much favour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually contain a so-called nicotine absorber . Those smokers who re ( luire such auxiliary attachments had better not smoke at all . ' The I ancet 's condemnation of hygienic pipes accords with the opinion of all true smokers , by whom they are regarded as beneath contempt . A man who smokes a hygienic pipe would only kiss his wife through a respirator , lest her salute should convey disease-germs into his system . Pipes should be cleaned regularly after each smoke , and the dottle ' of tobacco removed , otherwise it will become sour . The Mexican has a simple and economical method of cleaning his pipe . Filling the bowl with brandy , he stirs the liquid until it is thick with the reeking tobacco-oils , and then tosses the broth down his throat with a smack of the lips that tells of supreme gusto . It would be useless to recommend this mode to English smokers . Of other ways the thrusting of a How Pipes are made 177 red-hot wire oK of a feather up the stem , and blowing the smoke from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief for the operation , are well known . The forcing of steam from an engirre through a pipe is an excellent method ; any engineer will clean a pipe thus for a few pence . Another way is to fit into the bowl a cork , through which a hole is bored large enough to make it fit tightly on to the nozzle of a soda-water syphon . Holding a basin under the mouthpiece , force a little soda-water through the pipe , which is thus washed of its oils . It is ' impossible , however , entirely to rid a wellsmoked briar of its accumulated oils . I2 CHAPTER X CIGARS WHETHER the cigar or the pipe was the original form of drinking tobacco is a somewhat vexed question . The first smokers seen by Columbus were puffing rolls of tobacco ; it was only on the mainland of North America among the Red Indians that the pipe was in general use . In the off-lying islands and in Southern America the leaves were rolled up and smoked direct . Taking into considera tion the ceremonial use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the original mode of inhaling the smoke , and that the cigar was the // perfected instrument . The additional fact that in the West Indies smoking was of little religious significance , having passed from a sacred rite into a pleasing practice , supports the belief that the cigar was a stage ahead of the pipe . The lighted fire-brands noted by the Spaniards were indeed merely the later form of a pile . The Red Indian placed the powdered tobacco in the end of a reed ; the Caribs and other islanders rolled up a tobacco leaf in a dried leaf of maize , for it was a cigarette rather than a cigar . The variety of tobacco indigenous to the West Indies by the shape and size of its leaf made this the most natural form of smoking . The word ' cigar , ' and hence cigarette , ' applied to twisted rolls of tobacco is of some interest . Most probably it is derived from the Spanish cigarar , to roll . A more fanciful derivation traces its origin from cigarrel , the Spanish word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a kind of grasshopper whose droning noise is said to induce slumber . The first Spanish smokers are said to have indulged in the practice in orchards , and thus the word caJaros came to denote the tobacco from the place where it was consumed , while there was also the common resemblance in that , as the orchard was the pleasant resting-place , so was tobacco peaceful and reposeful . Another explanation is , that when tobacco was intro duced into Spain the plant was cultivated in the orchard , or cigarrel . But the true derivation of the word is undoubtedly cigarar , to roll , cigar being a roll of tobacco . In the countries of the New World occupied by
