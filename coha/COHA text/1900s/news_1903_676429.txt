BISHOP POTTER THINKS HEXTON VICAR CRAZY . Replies to English Clergyman 's Protest Against St. Mary 's ? Would Have Police Throw Him Out if He Disturbs Service . Bishop Henry C. Potter has made prompt reply to the open letter sent him by the Rev. R. C. Fillingham , vicar of Hexton , Hertfordshire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. G. M. Christian , rector of the church of which complaint was made , advising him to apply for a detail of police , and in case the Hexton vicar and his followers present themselves and interfere , to direct the police to throw the party into the street . Bishop Potter writes to Mr. Fillingham from Cooperstown , in Otsego County , as follows : Reverend Sir : In the public prints of yesterday I find a letter from you addressed to me : and later this letter reached me through the mail . You call yourself a clergyman of the Church of England , but I doubt it . For a clergyman is , usually . a gentleman . and aware that he may not print a private letter until its receipt has been acknowledged by the person to whom it is addressed . That you are a lunatic is much more likely ; for only a lunatic could suppose that the Church in New York is governed by the laws of the Church of England , or that you could compel me or any incumbent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obey , the laws of the Church of England. - The rector of the Church of St. Mary the Virgin possesses my respect and confidence , and . though his modes of worship may be as little to my taste as to yours , he is not following them without my privity and knowledge . I have advised him , therefore , to apply for a detail of police . end have instructed him , in case you and your followers venture In any way to interrupt or interfere with his services , - to direct the police to throw you and your associates into the street . Happily , we have a law in the State of New York which deals summarily and effectually with disturbers of public worship . Very truly yours , H. C. POTTER . Bishop of New York . Upon receipt of Bishop Potter 's letter yesterday the Rev. Mr. Fillingham addressed one in reply , and . notwithstanding the Bishop 's comment on persons who make letters public before those to whom they are addressed have received them , he made his letter public at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one . His reply follows : Right Reverend Sir : ' Lam in receipt of your extremely violent and insulting letter of yesterday 's date . I suppose so extraordinary a production was never before penned by : a professedly Christian minister . You are , or affect to be , unaware that open letters are frequently written to public men . You are also unaware . apparently , that the Church of which you are an officer has declared that she has no intention of differing in anything from the doctrine , discipline . and worship of the Church of England . I suppose you are also unaware of the fact that the ritual of St. Mary the Virgin does differ absolutely from that discipline and worship . I will not follow you in your own choice expressions and describe them as " lunacy . " but it is certainly a singular exhibition or I note that you condone and are privy to the illegalities and Idolatry practiced by the rector of St. Mary the Virgin . I also note your threat of physical violence  --  that you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' throw " us into the street . but I can assure you that no threat will affect those who are prepared not only to act but to suffer in the cause of Protestantism . Very truly yours , R. C. FILLINGHAM . This heated correspondence grew out of a letter which Mr. Fillingham addressed to Bishop Potter recently concerning the services which the writer said he witnessed last Sunday morning in the Church of St. Mary the Virgin , ' Forty-sixth Street . ' between Sixth and Setenth Avenues . die tiesribed the sacrifice 3f the mass , the burning 91 incense , and the elevation of the host ; de . Oared all to be contrary to the , doctrine of the - Anglican Church , . of which ihe Protestant Episcopal Church claims not to have departed from , and called the whole ceremony profane and idolatrous.
