 |p897  WE suppose that the large holdings of land are the effect of wrongs and abuses now wholly in the past , and that the causes for their increase are no longer operative , but are something like those geological laws by which the strata under them formed themselves . Once , however , in driving through the most beautiful part of England , which I will not specify because every part of England is the most beautiful , I came upon an illustration of the reverse , as signal as the spectacle of a landslide . It was the accumulation , not merely within men 's memories , but within the actual generation , of vast bodies of land in the hold of a great nobleman who had contrived a title in them by the simple device of enclosing the people 's commons . It was a wrong , but there was no one of the wronged who was brave enough or rich enough to dispute it through the broken law , and no witness public-spirited enough to come to their aid . Such things make us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of graft , which may really be of feudal origin . Doubtless the aggression was attacked in the press , but we all know what the attacks of the press amount to against the steadfast will of a powerful corporation , and a great nobleman in England is a powerful corporation . In this instance he had not apparently taken the people 's land without some wish to make them a return for it . He had built a handsome road through their property , which he maintained in splendid condition , and he allowed them to drive over his road , and to walk freely in certain portions of their woods . He had also built a magnificent hospital for them , and it seemed rather hard , then , to hear that one of the humblest of them had been known to speak of him in whispered confidence as a " Upas tree . "  |p898  Probably he was not personally a Upas tree , probably the rancor toward him left from being bawled after by one of his gatemen at a turning we had taken , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unjust . There was no sign , such as everywhere in England renders a place secure from intrusion . The word " Private " painted up anywhere does the effect of bolts and bars and of all obsolete man-traps beyond it , and is not for a moment that challenge to the wayfaring foot which it seems so often with us ; but the warnings to the public which we make so mandatory , the English language with unfailing gentleness . You are not told to keep your foot or your wheel to a certain pathway ; you are " requested , " and sometimes even " kindly requested " ; I do not know but once I was " respectfully requested . " Perhaps that nobleman 's possession of these lands was so new that his retainers had to practise something of unwonted rudeness in keeping it wholly his where he chose . At any rate , the rule of civility is so universal that the politeness from class to class is , for what the stranger sees , all but unfailing . I dare say he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manners of the lower class , where they have been touched by the upper , have been softened and polished to the same consistence and complexion . When it comes to the proffers , and refusals , and insistences and acceptances between people of condition , such as I witnessed once in a crowded first-class carriage from London on an Oxford holiday , nothing could be more gently urgent , more beautifully forbearing . If the writers of our romantic novels could get just those manners into their fiction , I should not mind their dealing so much with the English nobility and gentry ; for those who intend being our nobility and gentry , by and by , could not do better than study such high-breeding . VII . If we approach the morals of either superiors or inferiors , we are in a region where it behooves us to tread carefully . To be honest , I know nothing about them , and I will not assume to know anything . I heard from authority which I could not suspect of posing for omniscience that the English rustics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand be saints for all that I can prove against them . They are superstitious , it is said , and there are few villages or old houses that have not  |p899  their tutelary spectres . The belief in ghosts is almost universal among them ; as I may allow without superiority , for I do not know but I believe in them myself , and there are some million of American spiritualists who make an open profession of faith in them . It is said also that the poor in England are much spoiled by the constant aid given them in charity . This is supposed to corrupt them , and to make them dependent upon the favors of fortune , rather than the sweat of their brows . On the other hand , they often can not get work , as I infer from the armies of the unemployed , and , in these cases , I can not hold them greatly to blame if they bless their givers by their readiness to receive . If one may infer from the incessant beneficences , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon another , there are more good objects in England than anywhere else under the sun , for one only gives to good objects , of course . The oppression of the subscriptions is tempered by the smallness of the sum which may satisfy them . " Five shillings is a subscription , " said a friend who was accused of really always giving five pounds . The English rich do not give so spectacularly as our rich do , that is , by handfuls of millions , but then the whole community gives more , I think , than our community does , and when it does not give , the necessary succor is taxed out of its incomes and legacies . I do not mean that there is no destitution , but only that the better off seem to have the worse off more universally and perpetually in mind than with us . All this is believed to be very demoralizing to the poor , and doubtless the certainty of soup and flannel is bad for the soul of an old woman whose body is doubled up with rheumatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil that ensues from giving something to people who have nothing ; but I dare say the Dissenters are also guilty . Just how much is wanted to stay the stomach of a healthy , pauper , it would be hard to say ; but now and then the wayfarer gets some hint of the frequency if not the amount of feeding among the poor who are able to feed themselves . One day , in the outskirts ? they were very tattered and draggled ? et Liverpool , we stopped at a pastry-shop , where the kind woman " thought she could accommodate " us with a cup of tea , though she was terribly pressed with custom from all sorts of minute maids and small boys coming in for " pennorths " of that fright/ ful variety of tart and cake which dismays the beholder from million shop windows in England . When we were brought our safer refection , we noted her activities to the hostess , and she said , " Yes , they all want a bit of cake with their tea , even the poorest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their afternoon tea the last meal of the day , she laughed at the notion . " Last meal ! They have a good supper before they go to bed . Indeed , they all want their four meals a day . " Another time , thriftily running in a third-class carriage from Crewe to Chester , I was joined by a friendly man who addressed me with the frank cordiality of the lower classes in recognizing one of their sort . " They do n't know how to charge ! " he said , with an irony that referred to the fourpence he had been obliged to pay for a cup of station tea ; and when I tried to allege some mitigating facts in behalf of the company , he readily became autobiographical . The transition from tea to eating generally was easy , and he told me that he was a plumber , going to do a job of work at Llandudno , where he had to pay fourteen bob , which I knew to be shillings and mentally translated into $3.50 , a week for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader who multiplies fourpence by twenty , to make up the difference in money values , will find to be the wages of a good mechanic in the first Edward 's time , five.hundred years ago . On this he professed to live very well . He rose every morning at halfpast four , and at six he had a breakfast of bread , butter and coffee ; at nine he had porridge and coffee ; at one , he had soup , meat and eggs , and perhaps beer ; at night , after he got home from work , he had a stew and a bit of meat , and perhaps beer , with Mother . He thought that English people ate too much , generally , and especially on Sunday , when they had nothing else to do . Most men never came home without asking , " Well , Mother , what have you got for me to eat now ? " When I remembered how sparely our farm people and mechanics fared , I thought that he was right , or they were wrong ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyspeptic , and he hale and fresh , though the difference may have had as much to do with the air as the food . I liked him , and I can not leave him without noting that he was of the lean-faced , slightly aquiline British type , with a light mustache ; he was well dressed and will set up , and he spoke strongly , as North Britons do , with nothing of our people 's husky  |p901  whine . I found him on further acquaintance of anti-Chamberlain politics , pro-Boer as to the late war , and rather socialistic . He blamed the labor men for not choosing labor men to office instead of the gentry who offered themselves . He belonged to a plumber 's union , and he had nothing to complain of , but he inferred that the working-man was better off in America , from the fact that none of his friends who had gone to the States ever came home to stay , though they nearly all came home for a holiday , sooner or later . He differed from my other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it must be owned their race seemed to have acquired merit with him through the tip of two sovereigns which his last employer in Llandudno had given him . On the other hand , he had no love for the Italians who were coming in , especially at Glasgow . In Glasgow , he said , there were more drunken women than anywhere else in the world , though there was no public-house drinking with them as in London . This , so far as I got at it , formed his outlook on life , but I dare say there was more of it . VIII . I was always regretting that I got at the people so little , and that only chance hints of what they were thinking and feeling reached me . Now and then , a native observer said something about them which seemed luminous . " We are frightfully feudal , " such an observer said , " especially the poor . " He did not think it a fault , I believe , and only used his adverb intensifyingly , for he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country people , who have at last mastered that principle of the feudal system which early enabled the great nobles to pay nothing for the benefits they enjoyed from it . But my other friend , the plumber , was not the least feudal , or not so feudal as many a lowly ward heeler in New York , who helps to make up the muster of some captain of politics , under the lead of a common boss . The texture of society , in the smarter sense , the narrower sense , is what I could not venture to speak of more confidently . Once I asked a friend , a very dear and valued friend , whether a man 's origin or occupation would make any difference in his social acceptance , if he were otherwise interesting and important . He seemed not to know what I would be at , and , when he understood , he responded with almost a shout of amazement , " Oh , not the least in the world ! " But I have my  |p902.  doubts still ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cultivated and agreeable man servant to get on in London society , as for an artist or poet to feel at home in the first circles of New York . Possibly , however , London society , because of its almost immeasurable vastness , can take in more of more sorts of people , without the consciousness of differences which keeps our own first circles so elect . I venture , somewhat wildly , somewhat unwarrantably , the belief that English society is less sensitive to moral differences than ours , and that people with their little taches would find less anxiety in London than in New York lest they should come off on the people they rubbed against . Some Americans , who , even with our increasing prevalence of divorces , are not well seen at home , are cheerfully welcomed in England . Perhaps , there , all Americans , good and bad , high and low , coarse and fine , are the same to senses not accustomed to our varying textures and shades of color ; that is a matter I should be glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do if he comes to inquire into such mysteries . One can never be certain just how the English take us , or how much , or whether they take us at all . Oftenest I was inclined to think that we were imperceptible to them , or that , when we were perceptible , they were aware of us as Swedenborg says the most celestial angels are aware of evil spirits , merely as something angular . Americans were distressful to their consciousness , they did not know why ; and then they tried to ignore us . But perhaps this is putting it a little fantastically . What I know is that one comes increasingly to reserve the fact of one 's nationality , when it is not essential to the occasion , and to become as much as possible an unknown quality , rather than a quality aggressive or positive . Sometimes , when I could feel certain of my ground , I ventured my conviction that Englishmen were not so much interested in Americans as those Americans who stayed at home were apt to think ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister , whom I met in the West of England , he received it with surprise and refusal . He said that in his own immediate circle , at least , his friends were interested and increasingly interested in America , what she was and what she meant to be , and still looked toward her for the lead in certain high things which Englishmen have ceased to expect of themselves . My impression is that most of the most forward of the English Sociologists regard America as @#  |p903  a back number in those political economics which imply equality as well as liberty in the future . They do not see any difference between our conditions and theirs , as regards the man who works for his living with his hands , except that wages are higher with us , and that physically there is more elbow-room , though mentally and morally there is not . Except a little in my Unitarian minister , and this only conjecturally , I did not encounter that fine spirit which in Old England used to imagine the New World we have not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman who had lived in Canada , and who , gentleman-bred as he was , looked back with fond homesickness to the woods where he had taken up land , and built himself a personable house , chiefly with his own hands . He had lived himself out of touch with his old English life in that new country , and had drawn breath in an opener and livelier air which filled his lungs as the home atmosphere never could again . IX . Yet he was standing stiffly up for himself , and strewing his convictions and opinions broadcast as the English all do when pressed by circumstance , while we , with none of their shyness , mostly think our thoughts to ourselves . I suppose we do it because we like better than they to seem of one effect with the rest of our kind . In England one sees a variety of dress in men which one rarely sees at home . They dress there not only in keeping with their work and their play , but in the indulgence of any freak of personal fancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Bath for instance ; you will encounter in a short walk a greater range of trousers , leggings , caps , hats , coats , jackets , collars , scarfs , boots and shoes , of tan and black , than you would meet at home in a month of Sundays . The differences do not go to the length of fashions , such as reduce our differences to uniformity , and clothe , say , our legs in knickerbockers till it is found everybody is wearing them , when immediately nobody wears them . Only ladies , of fashions beyond men 's , gratify caprices like ours , and even these perhaps not voluntarily . In the obedience they show to the rule that they must never wear the same dinner or ball gown twice , it was said ( but who can ever find out the truth of such thing ? ) that they sometimes had sent home from the dressmakers a number of dresses  |p904  on liking , and wore them in succession , only to return them all but one at last as not liked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in society . I do not know just what is to be inferred from a social fact or statement like this , but I may say that the devotion to an ideal of social position is far deeper with the English than with us . Whether we spend more or not , I believe that the English live much nearer their incomes than Americans do . I think that we save more out of our earnings than they out of theirs , and that in this we are more like the Continental peoples , the French or the Italians . They spend vastly more on state than we do , because , for one thing , they have more state to spend on . A man may continue to make money in America , and not change his manner of living till he chooses , and he may never change it . Such a thing could not happen to an Englishwoman as happened to the elderly American housewife who walked through the magnificent house which her husband had bought to surprise her , and sighed out at last , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl ! " The girl would have been kept from the beginning of her husband 's prosperity , and multiplied , till the house was full of servants . If you have the means of a gentleman in England , you must live like a gentleman , apparently ; you can not live plainly , and put by , and largely you must trust to your life-insurance as the fortune you will leave your heirs . It can not be denied that the more generous expenditure of the English adds to the grace of life , and that they are more hospitable according to their means than we are ; or than those Continental peoples who are not hospitable at all . X. A thing that one feels more and more irritatingly in England is that , while with other foreigners we stand on common ground , where we may be as unlike them as we choose , with the English we always stand on English ground , where we can differ only at our peril , and to our disadvantage . A person speaking English and bearing an English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not it shows , it proves , that there is something wrong in him . Our misfortune is that our tradition , and perhaps our inclination , obliges us to be un-English , whereas we do not ourselves to be un-French , or un-Italian , for we are so by nature . The effort involved in distinguishing ourselves breeds a sort of annoyance , or  |p905  call it no more than uneasiness , which is almost as bad as a bad conscience ; and in our sense of hopeless perdition we turn vindictively upon our judge . But that is not fair and it is not wise ; he does not mean to be our judge , except when he comes to us for the purpose ; in his own house , he is civilly unaware of putting us to any test whatever . If you ask him whether he likes this thing or that of ours , he will tell you frankly ; he never can see why he should not be frank ; he has a kind of helplessness in always speaking the truth ; and he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who would say of his King no more than that he was a good little man , and most useful in promoting friendship with France , was inclined to blame us because we did not stay by at the time of our Revolution , and help them fight out as Englishmen the fight for English freedom . He had none of the loyalty of sentiment which so mystifies the American , but plenty of the loyalty of reason , and expected a Utopia which should not be of political but of economical cast . But one was always coming upon illustrations of the loyalty of sentiment with which of course one could have no quarrel , for their patriotism seldom concerned us , except rather handsomely to include us . The French have ceased to be the hereditary enemy , and the Russians have now taken their place in the popular patriotism . I always talked with the lower classes , when I could , perhaps because I felt myself near them in my unworthy way , and one evening in a grassy lane I made the acquaintance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was in the livery-stable line , but he had been a soldier many years . Upon this episode he became freely autobiographical , especially concerning his service in India . He volunteered the declaration that he had had enough of war , but he added , thoughtfully , " I should like to go out for a couple of years if there was any trouble with Russia . " The love of England comes out charmingly in the swarming of English tourists in every part of their country . Americans may sometimes outnumber them at the Continental shrines , but we are in a pitiful minority at the memorable places in England : in fact we are nowhere beside the natives . I liked their fondness for their own so much that I never could feel the fine scorn for " trippers " which I believe all persons of condition ought to asinane . Even when the trippers did not seem very intelligently  |p906  interested in what they saw , they were harmlessly employed , for a scene of beauty , or of historic appeal , could not be desecrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , especially at the holiday seasons . The English are , indeed , great holiday-makers , even when past the age of putting their arms around one another 's waists . The many and many seaside resorts form the place of their favorite outings , where they try to spend such days and weeks of the late summer as their savings will pay for . It is said that families in very humble station save the year round for these vacations , and , having put by twelve or fifteen pounds , repair to some such waterside as Blackpool , or its analogue in their neighborhood , and lavish them upon the brief joy of the time . They take the cheaper lodgings , and bring with them the less perishable provisions ; and lead a life of resolute gayety on the sands and in the sea , and at the pier - ends where the negro minstrels and the Pierrots , who equally abound , make the afternoons and evenings a delight which no one would suspect from their faces to be the wild thing it is . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloyed , " there is no forecast of it in their demeanor , which is as little troubled as it is animated . The young people are even openly gay , and the robustness of their flirtations adds sensibly to the interest of the spectator . Our own public lovers seem of a humbler sort , and they mostly content themselves with the passive embraces of which every seat in our parks affords an example ; but in England such lovers add playful struggles . A favorite pastime seemed to be for one of them to hold something in the hand , and for the other to try prying it open . When it was the young man who kept his hand shut , the struggle could go on almost indefinitely . I suppose it led to many engagements and marriages . When the young people were not walking up and down , or playfully scuffling , they were reading novels ; in fact , I do not imagine that anywhere else in the world is there a half , or a tenth part , so much fiction consumed as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innutritious lightness of pop-corn ; I had never the courage to look at the volumes which I could so easily have overlooked ; but I am sure it was all out of the circulating library . As there were , of course , ten young women to one man , most of the girls had to content themselves with the flirtations in the  |p907  books , where , I dare say , the heroines were always prying the heroes ' hands open . On every seat one found them poring upon the glowing page , and met them in every walk with a volume under the arm , and another clasped to the heart . At places where the band played , and they were ostensibly listening to the music , they were bowed upon their books , and the flutter of the turning leaves almost silenced the blare of the horns . By what inspiration they knew when " God Save the King " was coming , and rose with a long sigh heaved in common , I should not be able to say . Perhaps they always reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that closing number , or perhaps they felt its imminence in their nerves . The fiction was not confined to the young girls , however . Both sexes and all ages partook of it ; I saw as many old girls as young girls reading novels , and mothers of families were apparently as much addicted to the indulgence . I suppose they put by their books when they took tea , which is the other most noticeable dissipation in England . But I can not enter upon that chapter ; it is too large a theme ; I will say merely that as the saloons are on Sixth Avenue , so the tea-rooms are in every part of the island . XI . It had seemed to me in former visits to England that the Christian Sabbath was a more depressing day there than here , but from the last I have a more cheerful memory of it . I still felt it dispiriting in London , whence as many fled from it as could , and where the empty streets symbolized a world abandoned to destruction ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the markets and fairs in the avenues given up to them were the scenes of an activity which was not without gayety , and certainly not without noise ; and when the afternoon came , the lower classes , such as had remained in town , thronged to the public houses , and the upper classes to the evening parade in the Park . As to the relative amount of church-going , I will not even . assume to be sure ; but I have a fancy that it is a rite much less rigorous than it used to be . Still , in provincial places , I found the churches full on a Sunday morning , and all who could afford it hallowed the day by putting on a frock coat and a top hat , which are not worn outside of London on week-days . The women , of course , were always in their best on Sun/ day . Perhaps in the very country the upper classes go to church as much as formerly , but I have my doubts whether they feel so much obliged to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example to their inferiors . Where there are abbeys and minsters and cathedrals , as there are pretty well everywhere in England , religion is an attractive spectacle , and one could imagine people resorting to its functions for aesthetic reasons . But , in these guesses , one must remember that the English who remained at home were never Puritanized , never in such measure personally conscienced , as those who came to America in the times of the successive Protestant fervors ; and that is a thing which we are apt to forget . The home-keeping English continued , with changes of ritual , much like the peoples who still acknowledged as their head " the Bishop of Rome . " Their greater morality , if it was greater , was temperamental rather than spiritual , and leaving the church to look after religion much more than our Puritans did , they kept a simplicity of nature impossible to the sectaries always taking stock of their souls . In fact , the Calvinists of New England were almost essentially different from the Calvinists of Holland , of France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light , as they trusted , they were darkened by the forest , into which they plunged , to certain reasons which the children of darkness , as the Puritans believed the non-Puritans to be , saw by the uncertain glimmers from the world about them . There is no denying that with certain great gains , the American Puritans became , in a worldly sense , provincialized , and that if they lived in the spirit , they lived in it narrowly , while the others who lived in the body , lived in it liberally , or at any rate handsomely . From our narrowness we flattered ourselves that we were able to imagine a life more broadly based than theirs , or at least a life from which theirs must look insufficient and unfinal , so long as man feels within himself the prompting to be something better or higher than he is . Yet the English life is wonderfully perfected . With a faery dream of a king supported in his preeminence by a nobility , a nobility supported in turn by a commonalty , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with a system of government kept , by assent so general that the dissent does not matter , in the hands of a few families reared , if not trained , to power ; with a society so intimately and thoroughly self-acquainted that one  |p909  touch of gossip makes its whole world kin , and responsive to a single emotion ; with a charity so wisely studied , and so carefully applied , that restive misery never quite grows rebellious ; with a patriotism so inborn and ingrained that all things English seem righteous because English ; with a willingness to share the general well-being quite to the verge , but never beyond the verge , of public control of the administration ; with all this , the thing must strike the unbelieving observer as desperately perfect . " They have got it down cold , " he must say to himself , and confirm himself in his unfaith by reflecting that it is very cold . XII . The best observer of England that ever was , he whose book about the English makes all other comment seem idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always find ahead of us when we look back for him , was once , as he relates in a closing chapter of " English Traits , " brought to bay by certain great English friends of his , who challenged him to say whether there really were any Americans with an American idea , and a theory of our future . " Thus challenged , I bethought myself neither of Congress , neither of President nor of cabinet ministers , nor of such as would make of America another Europe ... . I opened the dogma of no-government and non-resistance , and anticipated the objections and the fun , and procured a kind of hearing for it . I said , It is true that I have never yet seen in any country a man of sufficient valor to stand for this truth , and yet ... ' t is certain , as God liveth , the gun that does not need another gun , the law of love and justice alone , can effect a clean revolution . . . . I insisted . . . that the manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference to a gentleman ; that as to our secure tenure of our mutton-chop and spinage in London or in Boston , the soul might quote Talleyrand , Messieurs , je n'en vois pas la necessita . ' " In other words , Emerson laid before his great English friends a programme , as nearly as might then be , of philosophical anarchism , and naturally it met with no more acceptance than it would if now presented to the most respectable of his American readers . Yet it is never to be forgotten that it was the English who , with all their weight of feudal tradition , and amidst the nightmares to which their faery dream seemed so long subject , invented the only form of Democratic  |p910  Christianity the world has yet known , unless indeed the German Mennonites are the same as the earlier English Quakers were in creed and life . In the pseudo-republic of the Cromwellian commonwealth the English had a state as wholly without liberty , equality and fraternity as in the king-capped oligarchy they had before and have had ever since . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonwealth , or any resembling ours , which can no longer offer itself as an eminent example . The sort of Englishmen of whose respect we can make surest are those English thick-and-thin patriots who admire force and strength , and believe that it is the Anglo-Saxon mission to possess the earth , and to profit by its weaker peoples , not cruelly , not unkindly , yet unquestionably . The Englishmen of whose disrespect we can make surest are those who expect to achieve liberty , equality and fraternity in the economic way , the political way having failed ; who do not care whether the head of the state is born or elected , is called " King " or called " President , " since he will presently not be at all ; who abhor war , and believe that the meek shall inherit the earth , and these only if they work for a living . They have already had their will with the existing English state , until now that state is far more the servant of the people in fetching and carrying , in guarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the republic which professes to derive its just powers from the consent of the governed . When one encounters this sort of Englishman , one thinks silently of the child labor in the South , of the monopolies in the North , of the companies which govern while they serve us , and one hopes that the Englishman is not silently thinking of them too . He is probably of the lower classes , and one consoles one 's self as one can by holding one 's head higher in better company , where , without secret self-contempt , one can be more openly proud of our increasing fortunes and our increasing territory , and our warlike adequacy to a first position among the nations of the world . There is no fear that in such company one 's national susceptibilities will be wounded , or that one will not be almost as much admired for one 's money as at home . I do not say quite , because there are still things in England even more admired than money . Certainly a very rich American would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be so much considered as an equally rich Englishman who was also a duke .  |p911  I can not name a nobleman of less rank , because I will not belittle my rich countryman , but perhaps the English would think differently , and would look upon him as lower than the latest peer or the newest knight of the King 's creation . The King , who has no power , can do almost anything in England ; and his touch , which is no longer sovereign for scrofula , can add dignity and give absolute standing to a man whose achievements merit it , but who with us would fail of anything like it . The English system is more logical than ours , but not so reasonable . The English have seen from the beginning inequality and the rule of the few . We can hardly prove that we see , in the future , equality and the rule of the many . Yet our vision is doubtless prophetic , whatever obliquities our frequent astigmatism may impart to it . Meantime , in its ampler range there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial ; but the English can not doubt the justice of what they have seen without forming an eccentric relation to the actual fact . The Englishman who refuses the formal recognition of his distinction by his prince is the anomaly , not the Englishman who accepts it . Gladstone who declines a peerage is anomalous , not Tennyson who takes it . As part of the English system , as a true believer in the oligarchically administered monarchy , Gladstone was illogical , and Tennyson was logical .
