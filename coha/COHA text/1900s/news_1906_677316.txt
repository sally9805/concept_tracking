txt Dr. Julian P. Thomas , the balloonist , arrived in this city last night after one of the most perilous trips that has been accomplished in this country since the aerial craze began . He traveled more than 300 , perhaps 300 , miles in a balloon , rising to a height of 8,000 feet and going through E. thunderstorm In upper air . His time in the air is fourteen hours and a half , which would be considered remarkable even in Paris . The balloon which Dr. Thomas brought from France some two months ago holds about 60,000 cubic feet of gas . It ascended from 188th Street and Locust Avenue , the Bronx , at 8 o'clock on Sunday evening . It landed at 8 o'clock yesterday morning , ten j miles south of South New Berlin , in Chenango County , just across from Otsego . The moment the balloon went up it was caught by an met breeze which bore it right over the city . According to Dr. Thomas everything was clear below until the balloon , at ate altitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist fell upon the earth and everything was blotted out . The great silk gas bag crossed the Hudson without the aeronauts seeing the river . Allowed the Balloon to Drop . " In order to ! Ind out just what we were doing , " said Dr. Thomas , " we allowed the balloon to descend without checking it until we found that we were over Hackensack . There was little air at that time . " The earth of course was completely shut out from us , and it was the first time that I had seen things like this . It was as if the world had vanished and a pall spread below us . Here and there white ridges stood up , and now and then between these s=hadowy hills waves of fire passed . The air had been close all day , and about 9 o'clock at night the thunderstorm which had been threatening broke . " Charles Levee , my assistant , and I were then over Little Falls , had sunk to about 200 feet above the earth , and had come within close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have an answer to our request to notify our friends that all was well but that things were looming in the distance . " Then the thunderstorm broke It was remarkable . Below , around and above us there were clouds . Every flash of ? lightenning showed us ridges of vaporous mountains . The electric fire trickled hither and thither and the thunder , so close to us , was more deafening than a man on earth can understand . It was a continuous roar . Between the flashes and the peals , which were probably rumbles on earth , we could hear the lowing of cows and the bleating Of sheep , but no human voice . It seems to me that the human ' voice does not carry upward or animals must be able to see through the clouds . It was one of the things that I could not understand . " We allowed the anchor to trail about 1 A. M. , when the wind suddenly turned to the east . We disliked the idea of going back upon our course , as at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me what we should do . He , being an expert in ballooning , knew there was little danger of our being struck by lightning . I thought differently , as the wet ropes were charged with electricity . Every time I touched one It shocked me in a way that was more than a gentle reminder . The balloon seemed to have become a part of the storm . That was why there was so little danger . Balloon Landed in a Tree . " As we were drifting rapidly eastward , however , we opened our valve for a moment . The balloon shot down . We did not know what we were going to hit in the black plain below . Presently there was a crash and we found our basket in a , tree . A moment before we had heard the wash of waves . What the water was I do n't know , but it felt good to be in a tree . " We had not touched the ground , and as soon as the storm abated it was our intention to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having touched the earth . " We could not sleep , however . ' The rain hissed around us . Once I got up and told Levee there was a man in the wood cracking a whip . He laughed and turned over to sleep again . I was not satisfied . I listened , and there came distinctly to my ears at intervals a sound as of some one cracking a whip . I aroused Levee again , and he said it was merely the water dripping through the balloon from the valve to the skin . Each drop of water produced a cracking sound . " About 8 o'clock in the morning the storm ceased . We were not yet ready to go up , but while we were still trying to sleep the wind caught the gasbag suddenly , and we were whisked upward . Next minute we sank again . The drop of a sandbag took us right above the wind , and then we made our record height . We arose to 8,000 feet . " When we reached this height , which was nearly Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggested that perhaps we were too high . We dropped a little . The earth was still covered by a pall . while out of the east there was a gray light stealing . " We kept up at a great altitude until about 8 o'clock . Our clothes began to freeze and our feet got so cold that I thought it impossible for them ever to get warm &again.; I told Levee that the sun would soon come out and warm us , but it did n't . Finally we decided to descend . We had only three bags of ballast left , and could not go much further anyway . Leveeopened-the valve , particularly when again we heard water washing  --  and the sound of water produces a sensation in an sewonaut that can hardly be described . emr gasbag came down like a thing , of lead . We landed in an open field and were lucky enough to escape with our lives and the balloon intact . " We found that the place where we had landed was a farm at a place called Butternut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the basket , and we were pretty hungry . " The farmer  --  Miller was his name  --  entertained us royally , after which we started for South New Berlin in a buckboard . It was only when we got to South New Berlin that we found a telephone , and then a connection after divers troubles . " We were in Otsego County . We traveled 150 miles in a bee line , but , allowing for our kinks and driftings hither and thither , I guess we made at least 300 , breaking American records both in height and distance . I think that 's all . " Mrs. Thomas said that she had had a rather anxious time until yesterday afternoon , when her husband telephoned to her and- explained that telephones were scarce up that way . The aeronauts arrived in town about 9 o'clock last night .
