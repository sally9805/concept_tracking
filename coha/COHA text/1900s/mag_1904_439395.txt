GEORGE HILLARD , writing to Prescott in January , 1844 , spoke of " that warns heart of yours which makes those who have the privilege of being your friends entirely forget that you are a great historian , and only think of you as a person to be loved . " Subsequent forgetting has been of a different kind . For most of us , the historian has swallowed the man . We think of Prescott in his study , though for but few of us , even there , do his twenty pairs of old shoes piled on a step-ladder cause the face of Clio to relax ; but we scarcely realize him at all in the nursery . That boon companion of children ; that rich and spontaneous nature ; that most charming of hosts and most welcome of guests ; that devoted son , that fond father , that sportively benignant grandfather ; that loyal friend , good citizen , helper of the poor ; that man in whom gentleness dwelt with strength , and whom kindness clothed as with a garment , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknesses and engagingly whimsical traits , ? the winning personality has been too much lost in the stately historical writer . This is due partly to the inevitable fading of personal tradition with the lapse of time . Those who knew Prescott in his radiant youth and sunny manhood are gone . In his family the memory of the authentic man survives , but for the world at large there remains only the written record . That , so far as the histories are concerned , necessarily yields but a feeble light . upon the man behind the book . An author may unlock his heart in a sonnet , but certainly can not in a history of dead centuries . And even in Prescott 's formal biography his real personality is somewhat elusive . Ticknor was Prescott 's lifelong friend , and a most painstaking biographer . Hehad ample material , and used it conscientiously , ? it is not necessary to say discreetly , for not a line that Prescott wrote needed to be suppressed for fear of hurting the feelings of the living or of the friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote the Life . His own view of society and of literature , always severe , had deepened into something like austerity ; and for him to have brought out vividly the playful , jocose , and warmly human aspects of Prescott 's character would doubtless have seemed to him very much like taking liberties with the Muse of History . At any rate , the awful dignity of historical composition , and the weighty responsibilities going with life in that " pale of society " where Ticknor drew his well-regulated breath , are the main personal impressions which one derives to-day from the official biography of Prescott . The rest is there , no doubt , by implication , and fugitively . Prescott 's social charm is asserted , though without detail ; his light-heartedness at home , his vivacious wit in conversation , his grace of manner , his innocent fondness for the good things of life , ? all are affirmed by Ticknor , but in a slighting way which prevents these qualities from taking the place which they ought to have in the picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prescott 's journals and letters , illustrating the true nature of the historian in habit as he was , Ticknor passed too hastily . Prescott was not only well born but happily born . His heredity was nicely fitted to his problem of life . From his mother , Governor Wolcott thought , he derived his " unfailing spirits . " In Pierce 's Life of Sumner there is record of a conversation at dinner , where Webster , Ticknor , Sumner , and Prescott were present , among others . The talk turned on the question what most vitally shaped // men 's characters and activities . Some of the eye , and that , as he wrote home , said one thing , some another . " Mr. I must abandon my profession forPrescott declared that a mother 's influ ever . " But even that could not daunt ence was the most potent .

Sir John Hobhouse last Saturday evening insisted upon it you were as blind as a mole , and being a quiet man , I was obliged to let him have his own way . " The truth is that Prescott always had precarious vision in one eye , which he was able to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time ; and even so , frequent intervals of complete blindness fell upon him with the recurrence of his disease . The oculists of the day assured him of the sufficiency of his one feeble eye for all the ordinary purposes of life , provided he would give up his literary labors . But lie quietly refused to pay the price . Holding himself to a rigid regimen , carefully observing every precaution that his own experience or the skill of physicians could suggest , lie yet preferred the joys of his intellectual pursuits to the certainty of eyesight . Again and again in his journals we find him calmly contemplating the possibility of absolute and permanent blindness . Even then there is no expression of regret or slackened resolution ; only a weighing of the possibility of his being able to press on with his work when wholly dependent upon the eyes of others . " The obstacles , " he wrote in 1830 , " I do not believe to be insuperable , unless I become deaf as well as blind . " As to the actual extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own private records are worth pages of description : January 16 , 1831 . " I can dispense entirely with my own eyes . " June 26 , 1836 . " The discouragements under which I have labored have nearly determined me more than once to abandon the enterprise . I met with a remark of Dr. Johnson on Milton at an early period , stating that the poet gave up his history of Britain , on becoming blind , since no one could pursue such investigations under such disadvantages . This remark of the great dobtor confirmed me in the resolution to attempt the contrary . . . . I must not overstatethe case , however , for certainly my eyes have not been high-gravel blind all the while . " March 24 , 1846 .

" It was not really quacking , though Prescott suffered many things of many physicians . His case seemed to be prefigured in Voltaire 's Zadig . The great impostor Hermes , in whose person the whole faculty was satirized , declared , " If it had been the right eye I could have cured it , but the wounds of the left are incurable . " One entry more from the journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ? metaphorically speaking ? Cervantes fought at Lepanto ? with one hand crippled . " For more than thirty years Prescott employed private secretaries . They read to him , made notes for him , and , hardest task of all , deciphered and transcribed his own blind man 's writing , ? his noctographs . In the latter form nearly all Iris composing was done . He himself described the writing contrivance . The apparatus , he wrote in a letter to the publisher of the Home. ; of American Authors , consisted of " a frame of the size of a common sheet of letter-paper , with brass wires inserted in it to correspond with the number of lines wanted . On one side of this frame is pasted a leaf of thin carbonated paper , such as is used to obtain duplicates : Instead of a pen , the writer makes use of a stylus , of ivory or agate , the latter better or harder . The great difficulties in the way of a blind man 's writing in the usual manner arise from his not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when his lines run into one another . Both these difficulties are obviated by this simple writing case , which enables one to do his work as well in the dark as in the light . " It is a fact , however , that one difficulty remained . Prescott sometimes forgot to insert the sheet of paper , and then , as he once wrote , lie would proceed for a page " in all the glow of composition " before finding that all had been in vain . With characteristic good nature , he alluded to this occasional contretemps as one of the " whimsical distresses " of his method . Of the resulting manuscript , let one of his secretaries speak . Mr. Robert Carter , who was engaged by Prescott in 1847 , had assigned him as his first duty the task of familiarizing himself with the noctograph writing . " I was appalled , " he wrote afterwards , " by its appearance . It was nearly as illegible as so much shorthand . I could not make out the first line , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Prescott wrote to R. W. Griswold in 1845 . He said that the characters of his noctographs " might indeed pass for hieroglyphics . " His secretaries managed to interpret them , but " sometimes my hair stood on end at the woeful blunders and misconceptions of the original which every now and then found their way into the first proof of the printer . " It may be added that the noctograph original of this very letter to Griswold is preserved among the Prescott papers , and is itself a fine example of his most inscrutable writing . The resource of dictation was distasteful to Prescott . He did , indeed , dictate his short memoir of Pickering , but his secretary states that he " did not like the method , and never again resorted to it when writing for the public . " Prescott 's own account of the matter is as follows : " Thierry , who is totally blind , urged me by all means to cultivate the habit of dictation , to which he had resorted ; and James , the eminent novelist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility in composition . But I am too long accustomed to my own way to change . And , to say truth , I never dictated a sentence in my life for publication without its falling so flat on my ear that I felt almost ashamed to send it to the press . I suppose it is habit . " The outward effects of Prescott 's partial blindness were not so important as its influence in shaping and making beautiful his character . No one can read the remarkable record in his journals of the way in which he turned from a dim world without to a radiant world within , took himself in hand , and forged laboriously in the dark the tempered weapon of his mind and heart , without becoming persuaded that his strength was plucked from his very disabling . It was this view of the matter which led the Rev. N. L. Frothingham to say of 1nm after his death that the mischance which robbed bins of eyesight could " hardly be called a calamity , so manfully , so sweetly , so wondrously did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest purposes of a faithful , scholarly , serviceable life . " On Prescott 's tomb , as on that of another gentle scholar and intrepid invalid of New England , might have been written , " Meine Trtibsal war mein Glfick . " The making of the man lies open to us in Prescott 's letters and especially in his journals . Never was there a sharper reminder of the physical basis of life ; never , also , a more reassuring proof that , after all , it is the soul which doth the body make . In Prescott 's case , the process clearly began with the physical . His bodily crippling gave him an intro deleted material // going , how one of Prescott 's intimate friends could speak of a certain " stoical " basis in a life of which the outward manner was only case and smiling amiability . This man , all rippling with grace and good nature , who , as Professor Parsons said of him , " could be happy in more ways , and more happy in every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " had the power of gripping himself silently and in secret , and snaking himself lord of his own fate . Yet he was no methodarian . His rules were aids , not fetters . Even his dietary was not inflexible . " How can you eat that , William ? " his wife would sometimes call out at table , seeing him wander into forbidden dishes . He would laugh away the warning , and affirm that the only way he knew he had rules of eating was by occasionally breaking them . During his English trip in 1850 , he stood up nobly for the honor of his country 's digestion , and was a valiant trencherman at the endless breakfasts and dinners to which he was invited . Sydney Smith had- sent word to him in advance that , if he visited London , lie would be drowned in claret or turtle soup . " I believe I can swim in those seas , " wrote Prescott in his journal . His wonderful social charm was instantly recognized by the best English society . He was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New York . " If I were asked , " said Theophilus Parsons , " to name the man , whom I have known , whose coining was most sure to be hailed as a pleasant event by all whom lie approached , I should not only place Prescott at the head of the list , but I could not place any other man near him . " It was not that he was a professional Miner-out , still less that even more portentous person , the professional teller of stories and retailer of smart sayings . Prescott used to make horrible puns , but his social manner had its immense attraction mainly through unfailing kindness , unerring sympathy , and vivacious good spirits which nothing could depress . It was his simplicity and spontaneity which delighted everybody . Mr. G. T. Curtis , writing to Mr. Hillard , says : " Prescott , the historian , not yet an author , was at that time in the full flush of his early manhood , running over with animal spirits , which his studies and self-discipline could not quench ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsequences , recovering himself gayly , and going on again in a graver strain which soon gave way to some new joke or brilliant sally . Wherever he came there was always a fillip ' to the discourse , be it of books or society , or reminiscences of foreign travel , or the news of the day . " Sometimes this unstudied impulsiveness of his betrayed him into an unconscious malapropos . " What have I said ? " he would cry out when lie saw his wife , who kept a dutiful watch upon these lapses of his , looking at him severely . Naturally , such a fresh naivet4 would but lay additional stress upon his original unlucky remark . Once a titled Englishwoman was arguing with him in his own home on the subject of Americanisms . She objected strongly to our use of the word " snarl " in the sense of confusion . " Why , surely , " spoke up Prescott in all innocence , " you would say that your ladyship 's hair is in a snarl ? " As such unfortunately was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plastered hair ? the visitor had to cool her wrath by remembering that her host was blind . Samuel Eliot describes the home life of Prescott at his country place in Pepperell . Here he passed the happiest part of his existence . Work went on as usual , but did not seem to be his principal interest . This lay in " the enjoyment of the family and the friends forming a portion of the family ; the drive or the walk ; the gay dinner ; the evening with readings , but oftener and more delightfully with games and songs . " One game in particular was an especial favorite with Prescott . It was called Albano , because introduced by some young friends of his who had played it in Rome . It was really only a variant of Puss in the Corner . The players chose geographical names from the four quarters of the globe ; but the one that Prescott took , and which was never shouted without provoking tumultuous outbursts of glee , was Nessitisset . It was the name of the stream flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute which once occurred at Pepperell between Prescott and his uncle , Isaac Davis . The old gentle . man complained of growing deaf , but Prescott maintained that his uncle 's hearing was as good as his own . To test it , he had his wife hang an old-fashioned watch at the end of the rosin , and the two men advanced slowly toward it to determine which could first hear the ticking . ? Do you hear it , Davis ? " No . " " Neither do I. " So on , step by step , until in amazement Prescott put his ear actually to the timepiece . " Susan ' . the thing is n't going ! " he cried to the sly woman who had stopped it . This boyish spirit and welling gayety Prescott carried into his work as well as his social relaxation . Use of his secretaries wrote that whenever he came to describe some stirring scene , like a battle , he would humorously key himself up to it by bursting into song . One favorite was a ballad beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was fond of music . Sentimental songs would sometimes set him weeping . " They are only my opera tears , " he would explain . This was one sign of that " simplicity in which nobleness of nature most largely shares , " to quote the words of Thucydides which Professor Felton applied to Prescott after his death . Such tributes could be multiplied . " One of the most frank , amiable , warm-hearted and open-hearted of human beings , " wrote Hillard ; and added , " Of all men I have known he was the most generally beloved , the most universal social favorite . " It might be said of Prescott , as Sydney Smith said of Mackintosh , that " the gall-bladder was omitted in his composition . " " Not a single unkind or harsh or sneering expression , " testifies one of his secretaries , " could be found in any of the hundreds of letters I wrote at his dictation . " The same may be said of his private journals . Not a line of them needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhaustless benevolence which can stand the searching test of impressions made upon children and servants . Prescott was not a hero to his valet , but he was something better , ? a man to win undying respect and love . All his private secretaries left his service with regret , and ever retained for him the most affectionate regard . Prescott 's self-discipline was applied as rigorously to his moral as to his physical or mental nature . His habit was to keep by him a complete inventory of his moral qualities , ? chiefly a list of the faults which he set himself to strive to correct . Slips written by his own hand , and seen by his eye alone , he kept in a large envelope , each one containing a record of something he had found amiss in himself . Over this card-catalogue of failings he would periodically go , ? usually on a Sunday morning after church , ? and conscientiously check up his moral account . One besetting defect mastered , its record would be blotted out ; a new weakness detected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept up this recurring self-examination , and after his death the envelope was found , marked , " To be burnt . " To ashes the whole was reduced . Not enough to snake a moment 's blaze , ? the sum of the faults of one so universally loved . " The only man , " wrote Hillard , " whom we never heard any one speak against . " In the early journals there are some traces of the struggle of Prescott 's spirit to find itself . " Since the age of 23 , the most wretched period of my life was when my passions and temper controlled me , the most happy when I controlled them . " // " Without answering for others , I may say that these qualities of mind are su cient for my happiness : ? " I. Good Nature . II . Manliness . III . Independence . IV . Industry . V. Honesty . VI . Cheerful Views . VII . Religious Confidence . " On one occasion , as if bursting into a " let us hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 6 ( P. S. I have been perfectly contented , light-hearted and happy , ye last two weeks ? with my BOOKS 7 hrs . DOMESTIC SOCIETY ? &; Benevt Feels ( Not thinking of it ) Not VANITY " Prescott 's athletic training of mind and pen for the task he set himself can be but barely alluded to here . He knew to the full " what belonged to a scholar ; what pains , what toil , what travail , conduct to perfection . " The records of his rigid discipline from his twenty-sixth to his fortieth year remain as proof of what would otherwise seem , considering his handicap , the incredible amount of work he got through . With the certain prospect of indifferent health and dependence upon the eyes of another , he yet attacked light-heartedly a mass of reading which would have taxed the rudest physique . His toils were undertaken , moreover , through no necessity , ? except the spur of a noble mind , ? since his father 's ample means assured him comfort and even luxury . Yet we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting down in 1822 to the following self-imposed task : " I am now , " he wrote in his journal , " twenty-six years of age , nearly . By the time I am thirty , God willing , I propose , with what stock I have already on hand , to be a very well-read English scholar ; to be acquainted with the classical and useful authors , prose and poetry , in Latin , French , and Italian , and especially . in history ; I do not mean a critical or profound acquaintance . The two following years , 31-32 , I may hope to learn German , and to read the classical German writers ; and the translations , if my eye continues weak , of the Greek . And this is enough for general discipline . " For German he had later to offer Spanish as a substitute ; his dim eye and the aid of his secretary having proven , greatly to his disappointment , inadequate to mastering the tongue of the learned . All told , however , in those acquisitive years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even of his own family , he put an immense amount of material behind him . The record of it remains , ? not simply a bare catalogue of books , but analyses and criticisms , often very full and always careful ; for , as he wrote in describing his own method and purpose , it was obvious to him that " superficial considerations are not worth recording , as the recollection of them can in no way add to the solid stores of knowledge . " To his reading , and especially to his writing , Prescott held himself faithfully , and constantly reinforced his resolution by admonitory entries in his journal . One amusing resort of his to flog himself along was his habit of imposing fo upon a failure to complete a given task by a clay fixed . This contrivance he appears to have taken up while still in college . Very early in his journals we find traces of the custom . Thus one of his " Maxims of Composition , " written down almost at the beginning , reads : " Pay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? if you look over the last 3 lines you have written , except it be impossible , after trying , to recollect them ( you may at last 3 words ) , if you review any except 2 pages when I begin to write in the day . . . I may read what has been written on the same day in which I take this liberty , provided it shall be absolutely necessary to write further . " Later , he transmuted his system of forfeits into a plan of making wagers ( the odds heavily against himself ) with his private secretaries . A memorandum of one of them survives , and runs as follows : " June 4th , 1846 . This memorandum is to witness that a bet of one dollar to fifty dollars has been made between E. B. Otis and Wm . H. Prescott Esq. , the latter betting fifty dollars that he will read for , compose and write one hundred pages of his History of Peru in a hundred days , the clays to be counted from the fourth ( lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance for the excepted clays hereinafter specified .

If the History , including the Postscripts , should not hold out , but should fall short of the second hundred pages , the wager shall be construed pro rata , that is , Mr. Prescott shall lose his second bet of fifty dollars unless he finishes the remainder of his History at the rate of a page a clay , ( reckoning the days from the expiration of the first hundred clays ) for every clay after the determination of the first wager till the work is finished , with the following exceptions .

EDMUND B. OTIS . " Days excepted June 7-21 , 23 , 20 , 28 . July 0-14 " Prescott always took this betting on his own industry with perfect seriousness . Sometimes he would radiantly greet his secretary with , " You have lost ! You owe me a dollar . " And lie would exact payment . Occasionally he would , with woe-begone countenance , produce and pay over to the protesting secretary the twenty or thirty dollars he himself had lost . It was Prescott 's one " oddity , " remarked a friend . Madame de Sdvignd , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J e reviens it nos lectures : c'est sans prdjudice de Cldopatre a romance in twelve octavo volumes que j'ai gagd d'achever ( vous savez comme je soutiens mes ga , geures ) : je songe quelquefois deli viesst la folic que j'ai pour ces sottisesWith his warm social nature , and the constant invitations and increasing duties as host and as representative of American literature thickening upon him , Prescott often found it difficult to adhere to hours and plans of work . His friend Gardiner gave one instance of the way in which pleasure struggled with his rule of quitting any company in which he might be by ten o'clock : ? " Mr. Prescott was the entertainer , at a restaurateur 's , of an invited company of young men , chiefly of the bon vivant order . He took that mode sometimes of giving a return dinner , to avoid intruding too much on the hospitality of his father 's roof , as well as to put at ease the sort of company which promised exuberant mirth . His dinner hour was set early ; purposely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good season . But it proved to be a prolonged festivity . Under the brilliant auspices of their host , who was never in higher spirits , the company became very gay , and not at all disposed to abridge their gayety , even after a reasonable number of hours . As the hour of ten drew near , I noticed that Prescott was beginning to get a little fidgety , and to drop some hints , which no one seemed willing to take , ? for no one present , unless it were myself , was aware that time was of any more importance to our host than it was to many of his guests . Presently , to the general surprise , the host himself got up abruptly , and addressed the company nearly as follows : ' Really , my friends , I am very sorry to be obliged to tear myself from you at so very unreasonable an hour ; but you seem to have got your sitting-breeches on for the night . I left mine at home , and must go . But I am sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , ? especially as I leave behind that excellent representative , ' ? pointing to a basket of several yet uncorked bottles , which stood in a corner . Then you know , ' he added , ' you are just as much at home in this house as I am . You can call for what you like . Do n't be alarmed , ? I mean on my account . I abandon to you , without reserve , all my best wine , my credit with the house , and my reputation to boot . Make free with them all , I beg of you , ? and , if you do n't go home till morning , I wish you a merry night of it . ' With this he was off , and the Old South clock , hard by , was heard to strike ten at the instant .

He had Isis private pensioners as well , some of whom were a legacy , so to speak , from his lady bountiful mother . One of his secretaries tells us that he regularly gave away one tenth of his income . The latter was figured , in the late forties ( of course , after his father had died ) at upwards of $12,000 a year . For the times , it spelled luxury . Prescott 's methods in almsgiving were not always , one fears , such as would commend themselves to the Charity Organization Society .

In the latter part of the evening , as I was talking with the Duchess of Leeds ? one of the Catons ( Louisa ) who has grown coarser , with a bad complexion ? a rather striking-looking Jewish cast of physiognomy , with long love locks , attracted my eye , and she said , " That is Disraeli ; would you like to know him ?

To all which I replied with wonderful presence of mind , " Your Royal Highness does me honor . " I was introduced , by the bye , at Hallam 's , the other day to a gentle- 332 Prescott man whom I thought he called Lord Aberdeen . Hallam in introducing me made a little flourish about my being already known , etc. , and as I like to give tit for tat on such occasions , as far as may be , I said , " And the name of the person to whom I have the honor of being introduced is also known wherever the Anglo-Saxon race is to be found .

He told me that it was recommended to print the Italian on the opposite pages of Rose 's translation of Ariosto , in order the better to understand the English I " TO MR . SUMNER . LONDON , Sept , ' MU/. 4 , 1850 . . . . Just seen old Rogers , for the last time ? Cato the Censor Atticized .

The mention of Sumner 's name sug .. tt gests not merely a long and stanch friendship of Prescott 's , but the question of his political sympathies . It was precisely of him , I believe , that John Quincy Adams made the remark , " A great historian has neither politics nor religion . " As regards the first , at any rate , Prescott is commonly thought to have been as the Man . colorless in life as he was in his writings . Ticknor dismisses this aspect of the man in a cold phrase or two . Nor would it be just to give the impression that Prescott ever took such keen interest in that passing pageant of present politics which makes future history , as did , for example , Dr. Arnold . Brought up a conservative Whig , and kept by his physical limitations and chosen pursuits from the hurly-burly of public affairs , it was only late in life that he showed signs of being deeply stirred by the conflicts of political doctrine which foreshadowed the civil war . He admired Sumner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston turned its very cold shoulder upon the man whose radicalism , Ticknor said , had placed him outside " the pale of society . " Apropos of this early obloquy , Prescott wrote to Sumner in 1851 , reminding him how Judge Story had suffered from " the bitterness of party feeling , " and adding , " Boston is worse than New York in this respect . " Yet Sumner understood perfectly that Prescott did not go with him politically . Writing to Lord Morpeth in 1847 , he said , " Prescott shakes his head because I have anything to do with the thing slavery . His insensibility to it is a perfect bathos . This is wrong ; I wish you would jar him a little on this side . " Yet it was only six years later , when Sunnier made his great speech in the Senate on the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , that Prescott wrote , " I do n't see but what all Boston has got round ; in fact , we must call Sumner the Massachusetts Senator . " Brooks 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slavery spirit had before done . " You have escaped the crown of martyrdom , " he wrote to his friend , " by a narrow chance , and have got all the honors , which are almost as dangerous to one 's head as a gutta-percha cane . There are few in old Massachusetts , I can assure you , who do not feel that every blow on your cranium was a blow on them . " And when the Senator returned to receive the homage of Boston , Prescott and his family waved a welcome to him , as the procession passed , from the balcony of their Beacon Street house . Calling on Sumner the next day , the historian told him that if he had known there were to be decora-tions and inscriptions on the houses , he should have placed on his these words : " May 22 , 185 ( 1 . " Then I , and you , and all of us fell down , Whilst bloody treason tiourish 'd over us . " Sumner , on his part , was loyalty itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relations " had for years been of peculiar intimacy . " " This death , " he wrote to Longfellow , when , in France , he heard of Prescott 's end , " touches me much . Perhaps no man , so much in people 's mouths , was ever the subject of so little unkindness . Something of that immunity which he enjoyed in life must be referred to his beautiful nature , in which enmity could not live . " To the widow , five years later , Sumner wrote , on occasion of the publication of Ticknor 's Life of Prescott : " The past has been revived . . . . I have felt keenly how much I was permitted to enjoy , and how much I have lost . Those evenings in the darkened room in Bedford Street , with the kind , sparkling , intimate talk on books , history , friends abroad and at house ; the pleasant suppers below , where were the venerable parents , so good and cordial ; then as I became absorbed in public affairs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me on my return from Washington ; our free conversation on public affairs and public men ; and perhaps more than all things else his tender sympathy as he eat by my bedside , revealing how his heart was moved , only a short time before the summons came to himself , ? all these I think of , and in selfish sorrow I grieve that he is gone . " To piece out the account of Prescott 's political associations and gradual changeof view , the testimony of his private secretary , Mr. Robert Carter , may be cited . Speaking of their first acquaintance ( 1847 ) , he wrote , " He was a conservative Whig as I a Free Sailer . " But he adds , " Ten years later , I had the pleasure of knowing that he voted for Fremont for President , and for Burlingame for Congress , notwithstanding his high personal esteem for his friend and neighbor , Mr. Appleton , the candidate opposed to Burlingame . " It would be a mistake to class Prescott among abolitionists , or even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature did not fail to thrill under the indignities heaped upon the free North is made manifest in a letter which lie wrote to an Englishwoman in 1854 : " We have had most alarming doings here lately in the fugitive slave line . . . . A regiment of the militia was called out , the streets in certain quarters were closed against passengers , and swords and muskets were flashing in our eyes as if we had been in a state of siege . I am rather of the conservative order , you know , but I assure you it made my blood boil to see the good town placed under martial law so unceremoniously for no other purpose than to send back a runaway negro to his master . It is a disagreeable business at any time , and it was only a strong conviction of the claims which the South had on us by virtue of the Constitution , which made us one nation , that induced our people to sign the famous Compromise act of 1850 . But the Nebraska Bill looks to us so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great apathy in regard to our enforcing our own part of the contract . Then the thing was carried here with such a rash hand . The town was turned over to the military by the mayor . . . . Every petty captain of a militia corps was left to act at his own discretion . In one case the guns were leveled to fire on the multitude without any notice to warn the people of the danger ; and it was by a mere mei- dent that a bloody fray did not take place , which , if once begun , would have put us in mourning for many a ( lay . Old Boston has rather a relish for rebellion , and when it lay in the path , as it seemed to do here , it required some restraining grace not to pick it up . . . . I am told the government was quite willing we should dip our fingers in rebellion . It knows it can not have any support , and for that reason would be very glad to put us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nebraska business has called up a feeling which , though not Free Soil , or Abolitionist , is so near akin to them that they can all work in the same harness . " It is , in truth , in Prescott 's English correspondence that we find the workings of his mind on American politics most clearly revealed . At one time , he is enlisting the sympathies and receiving the contributions of English friends in behalf of a slave , ? presumably a fugitive . At another , he is discussing with the Duke of Argyll , or with Lord Morpeth , the fatal drift of slavery toward the extinction of human rights . Not immediately upon these themes , but on others which , after all , were kindred with them , a couple of unpublished letters are of interest . TO AIR . R. C. WINTHROP . May 30 , 1847 . . . . Everything has gone well for you here , no extra session of Congress , and none like to be . We ride on , conquering and to conquer , as you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many I should think from the positive manner they speak of them expect to find the palace of the old Aztec still standing . The Mexicans have missed it in fighting pitched battles instead of trusting to a guerilla warfare . My friend General Miller , who has much experience of the Spanish-American character , told me that the guerilla was the only way by which they could fight us with success ; and ifthey pursued that system they would be invincible . They may trouble us yet in that way ; but the capital and seaports seem destined to come into our hands . But what shall we do with them ? It will be a heavy drag on our republican car , and the Creole blood will not mix well with the Anglo-Saxon . Then there will be the slavery question as a firebrand which will keep you but enough next winter in the Capitol . TO C. CUSHING . Bos-roN , April 3 , 1S48 . MY DILUZ . SIR , ? I should sooner have thanked you for your friendly letter from the environs of Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my narrative and the subject of it . And I shall be very glad if the result does not lead to the detection of greater inaccuracies than those you have pointed out . You have closed a campaign as brilliant as that of the great conquistador himself , though the Spaniards have hardly maintained the reputation of their hardy ancestors . The second conquest would seem a priori to be a matter of as much difficulty as the first , considering the higher civilization and military science of the races who now occupy the country , but it has not proved so , ? and my readers I am afraid will think I have been bragging too much of the valor of the old Spaniard . I hope we shall profit by the temporary possession of the capital to discover some of the Aztec monuments and MSS . The Spanish archives everywhere , both public and those belonging to private families in Old Spain and in the colonies , are rich in MSS. , which are hoarded up from the eye of the scholar as carefully as if they were afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collections have been somewhat opened in the Peninsula . But such repositories must exist in Mexico , and Senior Alaman , formerly minister of foreign affairs , has communicated some to me , and made liberal use of // others in his own publications . If you meet with hint you will see one of the most accomplished and clever men in Mexico . But I hear he was in disgrace a year since from his royalist predilections . Could you oblige me by saying to him if you meet him that I am very desirous to send him my Conquest of Peru , and if he can let me know how to do so I shall do it at once with great pleasure . Have you met on the spot any of the Mexican translations of my Mexico ? The third volume of one of them contains and is filled with engravings taken from old pictures of the time of the Conquest , at least so it purports . This edition alone contains also some very learned and well-considered criticism on different passages of the work . I trust that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that Mexico will accept our propositions for peace . It has been a war most honorable to our arms , as all must admit , whatever we may think of the wisdom of the counsels that rushed us into it . At the end of one of Prescott 's noctograph letters to his wife , written from Philadelphia in 1828 , appears a sentence printed with most painstaking care . It , was to please the four-year-old at home , who , be was sorry to hear , was suffering from a cold , and it ran : " I love little Kitty , and will buy her a workbox in New York , if she is a good girl . " But on February 1 , 1829 , this eldest child , Catherine Hickling Prescott , died . The event was , to her father , not only a source of profound sorrow , but the occasion of driving him to a close examination of the foundations of his religions faith . " The death of my dearest daughter , " he wrote in his journal , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task of composition , I have been naturally led to more serious reflection than usual , and have occupied myself in reviewing the evidences of the Christian religion . " To this work , withcharacteristic thoroughness , he devoted many weeks . In company with his father , " an old and cautious lawyer , " he read thoroughly the various standard works on the " Evidences . " His conclusion was that the Gospel narratives were authentic , though lie did not find in them the doctrines commonly accounted orthodox , and deliberately recorded his rejection of the dogmas of " eternal damnation , the Trinity , the Deity of Christ , Election , and Original Sin . " Theologically , therefore , he confirmed his belief in that more liberal form of Unitarianism in which he had been reared . Practically , his life was one of those which make observers say that its creed ca n't be wrong , so reverent and pure was it , and so filled with goodness . Yet it was this gentle and tolerant man , abounding in all charity of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magazine dubbed a " bigot , " while the Dublin Quarterly Review breathed a prayer for his " conversion from spiritual error . " Prescott 's sole comment in his journal was : " As I have always considered charity as the foundation of every honest creed , whether religious or political , I do n't believe I deserve the name of bigot . " If suffering fools gladly and bearing with the infirmities of the weak are evidences of true religion , Prescott was entitled to something like canonization . From the earliest burst of his fame to the end of his life he was peculiarly beset by aspirants seeking his counsel or patronage . When , in 1840 , his kinsman , Henry Prescott of Newfoundland , wrote to express his gratification at seeing the family name raised to literary distinction by Ferdinand and Isabella , he begged to invite the historian 's benevolent attention to some accompanying poems by the writer 's daughter . A more flattering poet was Mr. William Henry Leatham of Wakefield , England . He wrote in 1841 to request permission to dedicate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Siege of Granada . Three years later , the same volunteer correspondent sent some verses of his own on Montezuma ? suggested by reading the Conquest of Mexico . Lowell thought at one time of writing an epic on the exploits of Cortds , but he surely could never have sounded the lyre in Mr. Leathanes strain , in which , to quote himself , " human gore was seen to pour like water int the sun . " To show what are the unwritten penalties of fame , a few of the lines inflicted upon Prescott may be cited : ? Another English writer to whose impossible appeals Prescott made wonderfully considerate responses was Dr. Dunham . That worthy but dull man , having failed to support himself by his pen in his own country , had the happy thought of setting up as a literary man in America . Prescott 's kind but frank discouragement of the proposal casts an instructive light upon the conditions of authorship in the forties . TO DR . DUNHAM . BOSTON , January 30 , 18-44 . MY DEAR Silt , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangsthe Man . so darkly over your prospects , now that you are again on your native soil . I was in hopes that , once more among your friends , and ire a country where men of letters are sufficiently numerous to make a distinct and important class , your just claims would be recognized . It is impossible for a foreigner , like myself , to judge of the expediency of the plans you suggest for the future maintenance of your family . And I am grieved to be obliged to say that I think it would be in vain to look for a contribution towards it here . There are so many projects that appeal so directly to those most liberally disposed in our community that their resources seem to be preoccupied . With respect to contributions to the newspapers , I fear there will be as little chance of success in that quarter . You might indeed furnish articles one literary matters to a respectable Journal like our North American . But the compensation is too inconsiderable to furnish an inducement ; since it is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give two dollars a page to a popular writer who would contract for a certain amount of pages per annum . I know not whether this is ever done by the present editor . Should you send anything to me for that Journal I shall have much pleasure in handing it to the Editor , and ascertaining whether he would be inclined to make an engagement with you for the future . Our newspapers do not press often into their service writers who have drunk deep of the good wells of learning , and a penny-a-line manufacturer of casualties will find more encouragement with most of them than a man of learning . I have suggested it to one of our most respectable editors , but he has given me no encouragement . W. H. PRESCOTT . Opening in 1858 a new volume of the journal which he had kept for more than forty years , Prescott wrote on the inside of the cover , " Literary Memorandum // Book No . XIV ? and , as I eschew long entries , probably the last . " Less than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On February 4 , 1858 , he suffered a slight stroke of apoplexy . Though his strength slowly returned , the remainder of his life was passed in something of a shadow , ? yet his spirit continued undaunted and his brightness undimmed . Parting from his wife in merry laughter on January 23 , 1859 , he went into his study . The blow fell swiftly ; he was heard groaning , was found absolutely unconscious , and died in a few hours . As grieving Motley wrote , " The night of time had suddenly descended upon the unfinished peristyle of a stately and beautiful temple . " Before burial , the body of Prescott was taken , in accordance with a request he had made , to lie for a time in his library . The best of all ages looked down upon him from their books , but not one of those " lettered dead " was manlier or purer than Ise .
