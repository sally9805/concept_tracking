 |p1284  SOME years ago I was one of a small party of men and women prominently identified with the international Socialist movement who met in Paris for friendly intercourse and greetings on the eve of a somewhat remarkable international conference . In that party there were writers of world-wide celebrity , scientists of world distinction and authority , orators whose words have thrilled Parliaments , worried Governments and coursed along the cables from continent to continent ; political agitators and conspirators whose work has kept busy the secret police of half a dozen nations and whose biographies are largely told in police records , and some , like myself , less known either to fame or infamy . That party will never be gathered together again , for some of its members have entered the Great Unknown . After the manner of our restless kind we sat and talked all through the night and parted only when the workaday world began its bustle and noise . Each of us told the others the story of our lives , with their most important experiences , with a frankness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's scalpel could have laid our lives bare more relentlessly than did we of our free choice . There was , of course , considerable variety in our experiences , but there was also a notable similarity which was much commented upon . One , the oldest and best beloved of us all , summed up the results of what he called our " confessional debauch " by saying : " How wonderfully alike , after all , are human experiences , but how different really have been the experiences that seem alike ! " I am reminded of the incident and the sage aphorism by the charmingly frank story of my anonymous comrade , " A Socialist . " I shall not speculate concerning his identity nor reveal my own , my hope being that he will include me in his circle of comradeship as unreservedly as I include him . And in telling why I left the ministry and fellowship of the Church , why I have turned from it with renewed conviction that for me it has neither spiritual life nor inspiration when , time after time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church represents the worst kind of infidelity ? unfaith to the common life of the world ? I want to be as frank as I am with my own soul . And even as there is no bitterness in m heart toward the Church , I want this record to be as free from it . My boyhood history divides itself into two periods . Born in the lap of luxury and ease , ministered to by a small army of servants and already superciliously proud of my family heritage , I yet knew by the time I reached my " teens " the pangs of poverty . It was not the comfortable " poverty " of the poor-rich , but the real kind ? the harrowing , grinding poverty that blights and damns . I became a boy wage-worker . That is all I need tell of my boyhood ; it is set down only that what follows may be better understood . I worked hard by day for bread , and harder still by night , whether for glory or for higher reasons who shall say ? Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devote myself to the ministry ? to preach the Gospel of the Christ whose pure , sweet life has always  |p1285  held for me so much enchantment . To that end I worked my way , alone and unaided , through Oxford , and its diploma , facing me as I write , calls up memories of a long and anxious struggle . I joined the ministry of one of the great Nonconformist bodies . My experiences in the years of toil and poverty determined my choice ? it was essentially more the Church of the common people than was the State Church , in which more than one ancestor had won lasting honor and distinction . My first appointment was to a large and rather wealthy church in one of the great industrial centers of England , and I at once achieved considerable success alike as preacher and pastor . To my success as preacher the files of the denomirational papers of the period bear witness , and my success as pastor may be gauged from the fact that the membership roll was nearly doubled in the first two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed into a Men 's Sunday Afternoon Association of over one thousand . At these services I dealt honestly and fearlessly ? tho not always wisely , I now think ? with all sorts of topics , social , religious , political . Nothing was too secular for my concept of religion . I believed that the Church had a great mission to perform in the solution of the grave social problems of the day . " Social Christianity " was a phrase much in vogue then and I probably overworked it . But one thing I proved , to my own satisfaction at least ? that I had rightly diagnosed that disease of the modern Church whose chief symptom is failure to attract the masses . I had shown the answer to the question , " Why do so few of the workers attend church ? " to be that they would attend whenever the Church interested itself in their engrossing life-problems . My church was filled to overflowing and there was never a question of " empty pews . " But my ministry was short lived . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary choice . Almost from the very first Month there had been difficulties in my own mind which grew to insufferable proportions . My whole being revolted against the cruel , inhuman doctrine of Eternal Torment , of the preaching of which there seemed to be a temporary revival . With all my strength and enthusiasm I preached the idea of " a decent , civilized , humane God , " much to the consternation of some of the most influential members . Still , in justice to them , I must say that had there been no other difficulty than this of doctrine I should probably have remained in the Church . Probably , too , I should have succeeded in my efforts to implant in their minds and hearts a better and lovelier conception of the great All Father . Such is my belief even now . But there were other and greater difficulties than this of doctrine . I found my spiritual life drooping and dying in the arid soil of the Church . Among the members there seemed to be little faith in the teachings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Human Brotherhood which Jesus taught . It seemed to me then , as it seems now after the lapse of years , that their " religion " had little or no influence upon their lives . I soon found that the most unscrupulous and corrupt politicians in the city were among the most influential members of my own congregation , and some of the worst employers and oppressors of the poor . It all came to me as a revelation when a workingman member of the congregation asked me to help him find employment . I knew him to be a good workman , for his former employer , a prominent member and official in the Church , had told me so . Why , then , was he unemployed ? He had been discharged , without a reference , for no other reason than that he had supported the candidature of a certain candidate whose election the employer wished to prevent . So this " Christian , " because he could not control his soul as well as his body , had discharged his " brother " ! In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the Brother-Christ , in vain did I plead even for a satisfactory reference to enable him to obtain a living for his wife and four children . The employer was obdurate and resented my efforts . " Business is business , " I was told , and " nothing to do with the Church " or the pastor . In the end the workman had to break up his little home and move to another city . Henceforth I kept asking myself the old , old question : " Can a man be brother to his master or the master  |p1286  brother to his employee ? Are not the very terms significant of a social relationship which excludes the possibility of brotherhood ? " I was not yet prepared to answer in the affirmative , but a few more experiences led me to that . There was a strike among the employees of a great factory owned by some people in my congregation ? people who had been very good to me and treated me as their son . I investigated the cause of the strike and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe my friends knew of these conditions , so I went to them hoping that I might be of service to the men and women workers . But here , again , I was repulsed ; my friends knew all that I knew and a good deal more , but they were not interested in the fate of the workers , many of whom were fellow church members . With them , too , " Business was business " ! Here , then , in this failure to vitalize their Christian professions and in the urgent need of the struggling and defenseless workers I recognized the call of Christ to leave the Church and its creeds for the truly religious work of social reconstruction . Accordingly , one Saturday , soon after the strike began , I sent a special invitation to the strikers ' meeting urging all who could to attend my church on the following morning , when I should preach upon the issues of the strike . How they flocked into the church , crowding it to the utmost limit ! And how I preached ! With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Laodicean Church for text I tried to voice wronged Labor 's cry , " I will spew thee out of my mouth . " That day I left the ministry and next day joined in the active leadership of the strike . My life was , it seemed to me , consecrated to a wider ministry henceforth . I was not yet , however , a full-fledged Socialist , and could not yet satisfactorily answer the questions concerning brotherhood which had so long haunted me . That came later as the result of earnest study and association with two Socialist workingmen among the strikers . These men were desperately poor and theoretically atheists , but I had never met men more truly religious in the Church . Their profound faith in the great cardinal Christian principle of Human Brotherhood was an inspiration to me ? an inspiration which abides even to this day , after long years of strife , disappointment and association with cynicism . I am persuaded that had Christ come to that city these men would have welcomed him and assisted him , while the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could answer the Great Question . I felt in my very soul that no man could be Brother to the Master of his Bread , and no man could be Master of another 's life and at the same time know him for his Brother . I was henceforth a Socialist . When the strike ended ? in our defeat ? I had to face the problem of getting a living . I had no trade and no commercial training . I was a maker of sermons and had voluntarily and religiously closed the market for my wares . Temporarily I became a laborer at the docks for the princely wage of four dollars a week . Night after night I dragged myself home too tired to eat , my back aching terribly and my hands torn and bleeding . I missed the ease and refinement of my old life , I missed many things which my $2,000 a year had made possible , but I gained self-respect and spiritual peace . Without thought of price or financial gain I had a new pulpit in my spare time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street corners . Quixotic , you say ? Well , perhaps so ; but if I had to go through life again under the same conditions I should pray for strength to do the same . I knew what the " Blacklist " meant in those days and the hunger and suffering the " Blacklist " brings with it . Many a night have I slept in some doorway or beneath some arch . Socialism did n't pay and , thank heavens , there was no opportunity for the professional Socialist agitator . Many times I have given Socialist lectures while desperately hungry and afterward in my pride have refused to accept " carfare " from my comrades , tho I was thus obliged to walk many miles . I have known scores of others to do the same thing . I do not defend it , nor do I criticise it . I merely set it down as an interesting phase of many a Socialist agitator 's life . But such poverty is hard to bear , especially for one who has known the sweets and comforts of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , " hunger is a terrible trial . Perhaps , therefore , it was just as much the latter ? or even more so ? than the conviction that the ministry claimed my life which induced me to accept an invitation , delicately proferred by a good friend , to preach in a Unitarian Church with a view to accepting its pastorate . Two Sundays I preached there , four sermons in all . I shall never forget the agony of soul I suffered the night that preceded the day upon which I had to give my decision to the Church committee . They liked my preaching and I liked their intellectual freedom tremendously . My love for the ministry of the pulpit drew me on ; poverty pushed in the same direction . On the other hand , the Socialist ideal beckoned me to the field of strife and sacrifice . Fear held me captive . When I entered the meeting of the committee I did not know what my answer was to be , tho I felt most inclined to accept the appointment . But I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to Socialism , poverty and freedom . Why this decision ? the reader may ask , and I can only reply , because I saw in this church practically identical social conditions . Here , too , the masters of other men 's lives vainly babbled of a Brotherhood they could not feel , and here , too , I felt the old spiritual asphyxiation . I knew that there was no way in which I could be free to voice wronged Labor 's demands and to fight its battles while I remained in the pulpit , and if I kept silent my conscience must forever accuse me of the betrayal of my own soul . I had kept faith with my soul ? I was free ! Newspaper work , so much easier for me than laboring at the docks , tho not without its hardships , kept me from real poverty during the next few years , but the conflict between Socialism and material interests was never far away . Sometimes one had to refuse to write ? even under the cover of anonymity ? things opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when siknee was not golden , but black and treacherous . And the fact of being a known Socialist was enough to keep a good deal of grist from one 's mill . One never got far above the line of bare subsistence , but there was always comparative freedom and , above all , the joy of the most loyal and splendid comradeship . From England 's great poet-artist down to the unlettered comrade at the dockgates looking for work there came only comradeship , loyal and inspiring comradeship . Years have widened the circle , till now its circumference includes many lands , and I aver that of all that my life has known of spiritual good " the dear love of comrades , " of which Whitman sang and which the Socialist movement more than any other comprehends , must be accounted best and most precious . I had been away from the Church several years after my experiment with the Unitarian Church when an intense longing for the ministry again beset me . Could I find a congregation willing to give me complete freedom ? An old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that I could . " You will find a great change in the Church now ; the old conditions no longer obtain . There is not the same narrowness ; the Church nowadays recognizes its social obligations . " This and much more to the same effect led me again to the pulpit , in a smaller church of my old denomination . No man ever entered the service of the Church with more earnest desire to give himself unreservedly to its highest and best work or with greater longing for the anchorage of its faith . But in vain . In less than three months I was outside again . I had found the old conditions still prevailing . There was no real belief in the Gospel of Brotherhood . Earnest enough about the welfare of the souls of Hottentots in Africa , these Christians cared little or nothing for the bodies or the souls of the men , women and children of their own town . In a dim way they realized that salvation of the souls of these fellow creatures at home could not be accomplished except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Here was the Slum-lord and the Work-lord , here , in the Church of Christ ; corrupt and selfish political power was ensconced in the pews . I was helpless in the pulpit . So long as my bread came from these sources I was prevented from attacking the roots of the evils which mocked my preaching and distressed my soul . Could I accept my salary knowing that it came in large part directly from the oppressors of the poor ,  |p1288  and that I could not accept it upon other terms than keeping silent upon the real causes of social strife and misery , without shame and humiliation ? I answered these questionings of my soul when , for the third and last time , I stepped out from the ministry , free ! I came to America and devoted myself to teaching and to such literary work as I had time for . From coast to coast I have lectured for Socialism , and my vote and influence in the last election went for Mr. Debs . I have not been hired to speak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as I have found far more comradeship and spirituality in the Socialist movement than in the Church , so have I found far greater liberty . And with the growth of material prosperity my love for Socialism has also grown . Naturally , I have studied carefully , as carefully as an outsider may , the situation of the Church here in relation to the social problem . I have discussed the question with scores of ministers of various denominations and I have not been able to find that conditions are better than in the Old World . Sometimes , indeed , I have thought them worse . I know at least a dozen men in this country who have been forced to leave their pulpits on account of their Socialism , and I know more than twice as many who would gladly leave the Church if they could , so keenly do they feel the oppression by which they are hampered and confined . Caged bird never yearned for the freedom of the fields with greater earnestness than many of these men are to-day yearning for independence , economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church it is only so in the sense that the Church life as I and many others know it is its own arraignment . I have but set down my personal experiences . No one , I think , can justly say that I have judged the Church hastily or harshly . Drawn to it by the purity of its ideals , by the matchless beauty of the life of its founder , Christ , I have been repelled by its unfaith , its hypocrisy and mammon worship . Despite its often loudly proclaimed materialism , I have found more of the spirit of Jesus in the political Socialist movement than in the Church . Like " A Socialist , " I have tried both ; but , unlike him , I have found that I can be a better and more useful Socialist outside of the Church ; aye , a better Christian in the Socialist Army fighting for the Commonwealth of Emancipated Labor than in the pulpit . How true are dear Liebknecht 's words : " How wonderfully alike , after all , are human experiences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike ! "
