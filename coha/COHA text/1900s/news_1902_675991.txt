txt A blaze which , according to Agent Mason of the Phoenix Steamship Line 's pier , at the foot of . Seventh Street , lioboken , started on the north side of the pier among a. pile of wicker baskets . Oct fire to a pile of cotton bales . A few minutes later billows of flames swept along the pier and enveloped the British Queen , a liner of the Antwerp service berthed there . Less than half an hour later the entire shed . the liner , and many lighters and barges moored alongside the pier and steamship were ablaze , and a fire that on a small scale resembled the great Hoboken conflagration of June , 1900 , was under way . It was just twenty minutes to 8 o'clock when the quartermaster was preparing to go forward to ring eight bells , that Patrick Hussey , a watchman on the pier , discovc-red about midway of the pier that the cotton was on fire . In an instant the flames had dashed along the pier , and In less than five minutes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , longshoremen , sailors , &c.,; who were on the pier made a wild rush to reach the street outside and escape the doom that was impending . Nearly every one succeeded in getting to the street by way of the pier . but a few had to Jump into the water , to be rescued a minute later by willing hands from the Naval Reserve training ship Portsmouth and tugmen and longshoremen who happened to be in the vicinity . One of those that had jumped into the water was Hussey , the watchman . When rescued he was found to be badly burned and suffering from the Inhalation of smoke and flame that had enveloped him on the pier while giving the alarm that resulted in so many lives being saved . He was taken to St. Mary 's Hospital , where he was said to be in a precarious condition . Another man , a Swede , and a member of the crew of the 111-fated liner , also jumped overboard , and was half drowned when pulled out of the water . A woman and child on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only saved by the presence of mind of the husband and father , who threw a bale of cotton into the water and then flung his loved ones upon it . They were rescued a few minutes later by members of the crew of the Portsmouth . Missing last night from the ship 's roster were said to be Chief Engineer William Scott , and Constans Dietca , a fireman . All the rest of the crew were reported as accounted for . CREW WERE DISCONTENTED . The fact that most of the crew of the British Queen went ashore in the earl . afternoon accounts for the apparent small loss of life . The firemen , stokers , and most of the sailors left the ship shortly after 5 o'clock . They went away in small groups , swearing at the treatment they had experienced on the ship and were loud in their complaints that they had been given little or no food . Three of them , Donald Edwards , Charles Graves , and Peter Ferendur , firemen , were arrested in the afternoon and locked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barn of the British Queen , and Frederick Rudolph , the cook of the vessel , whom they are accused of assaulting . Members of the crew declared that most of their breakfasts had been of mush and ship 's biscuit with poor coffee , and that they had had meat only three dines on the trip . They described this as being all bone . They said that with the exception of small allowances of potatoes their food had been entirely of salt meat . Among those most outspoken against the bad treatment alleged by the sailors were two stokers , Gerald Pierre Van Wyn Berghe and Frank Van Atchteren , both of Antwerp . The complaints of the sailors were heard long before the fire , and ledao reports that it might have been of incendiary origin . The two sailors from Antwerp after the fire said that this was impossible , for it was an unusually good crew , and though there was ' reason for dissatisfaction , yet there was not a man aboard who was an Anarchist or who would dare to tempt the sure death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire to a ship . The British Queen was half loaded , and there were on the pier at the time the fire started about a hundred men , while in the liner and under the hatches placing the cargo were about one hundred and fifty more , it is said . When Hussey gave the alarm , work of getting the cargo aboard was proceeding briskly . Not a soul was prepared for the alarm , smoking on the pier being strictly forbidden , and a sharp lookout kept all times for the least possible sign of anything that might start a fire . Suddenly Hussey 's voice rang out clear and strong . " Fire ! fire ! " In a moment every man on that pier and inside the black hull of the liner , remembering the terrible story of the North German Lloyd disaster that had taken place just a few blocks below . made a dash for the street . The crew scrambled down the gangplanks or jumped from the sides of the vessel to the dock , many of them alighting on the cotton that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started for the opening that led to the street . With the exception of the chief engineer and fireman , all managed to make good their escape . The pier was hardly clear of the men when the flames curled through the openings in the pier , and lashing over the sides of the British Queen ignited her upper works . For a few minutes the fire spread with marvelous rapidity , and then , about 9 o'clock . suddenly appeared to die out . and those on both shores of the river thought that the worst was over . In about ten minutes , however , the flames shot heavenward again , not to die out until the pier was a mass of smoking ruins , the ship , nothing but a charred shell , and all the lighters and barges that had been moored close to her , absolutely destroyed . SWEPT OVER THE LINER . Then the flames that had swept over the port side of the British Queen and traversed her to the starboard side , dipped down toward the water and ignited the barges Economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other with SOO barrels of alcohol . Next two grain elevators and four lighters caught , and the fire was almost close enough to touch the places where the China steamship Heathburn had been moored a few minutes previously . Tile skipper of the Heathburn had realized the danger , however , and had , with the assistance of a number of the numerous tugs hovering around , been towed out into the stream away from the danger zone . Before the Heathburn had been pulled clear , she had been relieved of her crew , by the authority of the customs officials of the United States . Like all China ships , the Heathburn carries a Chinese crew , and a number of Treasury officers were on duty to see that none of them managed to land in violation of the Chinese Exclusion act . When the Orientals saw the flames they became panic-stricken and the officers of the ship and Treasury agents saw that the proposition before them was one that required all the firmness and presence of mind they possessed to cope with . The Chinamen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , in order to get them ashore and to a place where they would have no chance to land illegally . are said to have brought their pistols into use and forced them to the street and to the Hamburg-American piers at the points of their weapons . Once on the Hamburg-American pier the Chinamen became somewhat calmer , and later were taken to the Salvation Army headquarters . on Hudson Street , where they were cared for last night . OTHER SHIPS TOWED TO SAFETY . On the opposite side of the Barber Life pier to the i lea thburn was the steamship Norge. which likewise was pulled into the river soon after the fire started . Just beyond the Norge and on the southern side of the Holland-America pier was the transatlantic passenger liner Maasdam. that got ie Alonday from Rotterdam She was pulled out of the danger zone and spent the night in the Hudson . Beyond the Holland-America piers were the piers of the North German Lloyd COMpany that have been and are being built to replace those that were destroyed in the memorable conflagration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Monday with 2.300 passengers , and the Karlsruhe . Both were held in plate by only a single hawser. and arrangements had been perfected to pull them into the river at the first sign of impending danger . The Phoenicia of the hamburg-American Line . which is scheduled to sail this morning . was berthed at that company 's piers and had many of her passengers on board . The officers assured them they were in no danger . and that the company- had taken all precautions for their safety , and there was no excitement on board in consequence . This ended the seen , of excitement to the south of the burning liner . To the north of her . and teerthed on the north side of the adjoining ; pier . which is a ' recreation one , was the New Jersey Naval Reserve training ship Portsiteeith . The Portsmouth was never in clanger and she was not moved from her berth . On the south side of the recreation pier and next to the Phoenix Line eves the barge Peter Ritter .

There were several daring rescues to be Credited to a few of the naval militia on the Portsmouth , stationed just above the blazing docks . Under command of Lieut . Davenport they lowered a boat and went tight in among the blazing lighters and burning ship . In this way they managed to save several persons who had jumped tato the water . ASSISTANT IVATCHMAN 'S STORY . John Carroll , who is in St. Mary 's Hospital with the four other sufferers , and who te the only one of them who is able to tell just wnat did happen , was an assistant p. ? atchman on the dock .

Then the whole dock teemed to he on fire and retreat to the shore was cut off by bursting barrels of ail . lie was knocked down by one explosion and . regaining his feet . saw a stream of oil pouring toward him . A sheet of flame shot high over his head and at the same instant he saw the British Queen ablaze from stern to stern . He jumped into the water and in a very short time was surrounded by burning lighters and saw , a tittle ahead of him . Hussey floating . but a  --  narently dead . There was a woman , Ors . Anderson , wife of the Captain of the barge Tonawanda , with her little girl on a cotton bale floating not far from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of blazing oil that seemed to shoot like a reflection from a mirror between them . He turned to avoid the floating fire . and to his horror there Was another between him and the blazing pier . He turned again and saw the first streak of oil almost consumed , a flicker here and there on the water . Utterly exnausted and chilled through by the icy water he turned over hoping to float tor a mniute , but his clothing and heavy boots made him sink when he stopped his exertions . As he came up it was into a streak of the flame . He went under again , made a few vigorous strokes swimming under the water , and came up again to the surface . He had cleared the streak of flame , but had no strength left to struggle longer . Just then his coat was caught by a boathook , and he was dragged into the launch from the Portsmouth . He remembered seeing the woman and the little girl in the launch and his friend Hussey . Hussey seemed horribly burned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and five children , and then he lost consciousness . The next thing he knew was when he came to in St. Mary 's Hospital . Capt . Andersen , his wife . Mathilda , and baby girl , a Swede , supposed to be Janssen , an ablebodied seaman of the British Queen , and four longshoremen were taken to St. Mary 's Hospital . The condition of Mrs. Andersen , the bady girl , and the Swede is serious , and Hussey is expected to die . The four longshoremen were treated and left the hospital without giving their names or addresses . All of those injured are suffering from burns , immersion , and shock . The Captain or the British Queen also is a patient at the hospital , suffering from dropsy . He was removed from the ship yesterday afternoon , and has not been told of her loss , as he is in a very serious condition . He may not know of the loss of his boat for several days . and may never hear of it , for the chances of his recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the scene when the alarm was given , and made unusually good time in reaching the blazing ship , dock , and lighters . There was plenty of water , but a wind so high that it was at once realized that there was little hope of saving the dock and that there was grave danger that the ducks of the big steamship companies would probably go if there should be a shift in the wind . The fireboats from New York did splendid work , pouring tons of water on the ' lames , but their chief value was in saving the adjoining docks , where they threw tons of water and again and again quenched flames on roofs and on the piling , where the burning oil drifted and started every minute or two a new fire . The loss to the steamship line affected and the other craft that were destroyed last night with their cargoes was estimated as in the neighborhood of $1,000,0 ( 10 . The pier , which was a wooden structure 300 feet long , was totally destroyed , and was said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British Queen , with her cargo which was of about half the capacity of the liner , was estimated at $400,000 .

Good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tall Buildings of New York Views Blazing Steamship and Lighters . Not since the disastrous fire that devastated the Hoboken piers of the North German Lloyd Steamship Company almost two years ago has the North River presented such a scene as it did last night . From 10 o'clock , when the burning craft began to make their way down stream . until after midnight . when the last flitting rays of flame showed where they were being destroyed in the harbor and On the Jersey flats , the waiter was as if illumined by a pyrotechni ? display . in an uneven procession , the British Queen . two barges , and two lighters , each a mass of flames , drifted down the river and into the harbor . From the top of the Lill buildings on this side of the river the , sight was one long to be remembered . The two lighters were laden with cotton and jute , and the reason they succeeded in drifting against this shore was that the tugs and fireboats were so busy attending to the larger and more valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these smaller ones . It was only after the lighters had actually drifted against the docks on this side of the river . and had begun to endanger the shipping amid piers along West Street , that the three fireboats . Zopitar Mills , New Yorker. anti Patrol , ceased to chase the British Queen and turned their attention to the shore which they were supposed to protect . Thet British Queen was never dangerously near this side , for nearly fifty tugs surrounded her as soon as she began to drift . and finally beached her on the flats off Communipaw , just where the North German Lloyd liner Seale was beached two years ago , after more than fifty men and women had perished in her hold . For the two hours during which the fiery procession lasted a canopy of light , alternating from a dim glow to a glare that rendered visible every building on each coast , was thrown over New York , Jersey City , Hoboken , and the islands of the upper harbor . From the wreck of the British Queen pillars of flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miles a light that outlined the sky line of the cities as clearly as if it were midday . Every time the fames shot up from the wreck the fleet of tugs came into plain view around her . Streams of water poured from their hose into the seething mass of it on and steel , showing that the liner 's towering masts were twisted like reeds by the heat . her iron sides warped , her wooden superstructure a crumbling heap of debris . THE LAST GREAT FIRE AT THE HOBOKEN DOCKS . The calamity last night was the second great fire that has visited the Hoboken water front within the last two years , the other being that which destroyed the docks and three ships of the North German Lloyd Steamship Company on the afternoon of June 30. 1900 , and which cost the lives of at least 125 people , besides causing injury to hundreds of others . It was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon of a sultry , hot day when fire was discovered in a load of cotton on Pier 3 of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and within five minutes it had envelopes all the piers of the company and was sweeping over the vessels which were moored to the docks . These ships were the Saaie. a single screw passenger steamer ; the Bremen , a slow passenger and freight steamer , and the Main . principally a treight liner . The Kaiser ? Vilhelm der Grosse had also docked at its pier , but it was hauled out in time , and was only slightly damaged . The Seale , the Bremen . and the Main , however , caught fire before they could be cleared , anti within their burning holds scores of people were caught and burned to death . The Saale and Bremen lay helpless in their berths of fire , and later floated out into the North River . Many of the crews jumped from the blazing ships , trusting to be picked up by tugs . The Saale , on which the loss of life was particularly heavy , drifted on to the Communipaw flats , and the Bremen was picked up by tugs . towed out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where she burned for two days . On the Main , the newest of the boats , and which never got away from her pier , the most horrible , sights were witnessed . A few minutes after the fire started the vessel was a mass of flames , and in every porthole sometimes one , sometimes two or three victims could be seen trying to crawl out . A dense cloud of smoke obscured the vessel for a time , and when it cleared away the bodies were seen hanging apparently lifeless from the same portholes . On this steamer a number of men saved their lives by taking refuge in the coal bunkers . After the fire had burned around them for twenty-four hours they were rescued . The Main burned at her dock until July 3 . The total number of known dead in the fire was 128 , but the exact number was never ascertained . The loss on account of the fire was estimated at over $6.000,000 . The Main and Bremen were afterward rebuilt at Newport News at a cost of about 4,4400,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Shooter Island , where she lay at the pier at the time of the launching of the Kaiser 's yacht , she was examined with interest by tie crowd or sightseers.
