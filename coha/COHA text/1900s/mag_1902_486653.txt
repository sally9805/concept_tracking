It has many times been demonstrated that there is no very formidable difficulty in constructing an instrument weighing about a hundred pounds which shall lift a man , or even two men , up into the air in a fresh breeze , and carry them up into the wind . It is supposed that they could sustain themselves indefinitely , if they were skilful enough , without any particular expenditure of energy , in the same way in which birds ranging in size from the lark to the condor soar . A condor will weigh eighty pounds and will soar all day long without any sign of effort or of fatigue . Various facts go to support the theory of Professor Langley that it is by taking advantage of the puffiness of the wind ( its " internal work , " as he calls it ) that birds soar ; though it is not certain that other factors , of which three readily suggest themselves , may not contribute to the effect . It is quite certain that a considerable weight is one requisite . The most successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rope by which his in-strument ( which was intended to carry only himself ) became accidentally wound round a second man . Le Bris , not noticing what had happened , carried the man up two or three hundred feet into the air , and forward into the wind for a furlong or so , and could apparently have gone indefinitely - further . But when he had descended sufficiently to set his captive passenger free , he found that ' without that ballast he could no longer fly . Thus far , however , no man has found it possible to acquire the necessary skill to manage such an instrument , in advance of getting killed by his blun- ders . The thing has not really had a fair trial . Le Bris was a very poor man , a common sailor , and circumstances prevented his practising on the water , although his machine had been specially constructed with a view to that . Consequently , before he could learn the art , his machine was smashed ; and he lacked the ; cleans to reconstruct it . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type alone , yet , owing to this type reuniting the positive features of the others , his volume contains many facts pertinent to the construction of any airship . As far as our verifications have extended , his numbers are accurate . But nothing more inaccurate and unintelligible than his statements of mathematical rules and formulw can be imagined For example , on pp. 17 and 18 is an attempted explanation of the manner of calculating the elevation from the pressure of the air . Not until one has corrected several misprints , including the uniform printing of exponents as factors , do the difficulties of finding out what the man means ( although the reader knows what he ought to mean ) fairly emerge . They are not confined to any one sentence . A number has been obtained , and , being correct , there is substantially but one way in which it could have been reached ; yet what relation there is between what is said and this operation , one can not make out . So it is , in lesser degree , throughout the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry James will be put to it to tell what his latest contribution to psychological fiction is all about . In the case , the most useful office of the reviewer is to say at once what some of it is about , to declare the situation . In doing so he may acknowledge a sense of indelicacy , even coarseness , much as if he were tearing away the enveloping leaves of a rose just to show its heart , or denuding a much-swaddled infant only to prove that it is all there . As we make it out ( with some vanity of intelligence ) the actual situation imagined by Mr. Tames for what he might call a study of the abysmal in human consciousness is this : An impecunious young Englishman , a journalist by profession , named Martin Densher , is In love with , in fact secretly engaged to , Kate Croy , dependent for a luxurious subsistence on " Aunt Maud , " otherwise Mrs. Lowder , who dwells in splendor at Lancaster Gate . Mr. Densher , humbly conscious that his only talent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Miss Croy a " talent for life , " and becomes , therefore , for the guidance of their affair , a pliable instrument in her capable hands . At an early age she had divined that it is " of the essence of situations , under Providence , to be worked " ; so we behold her in her great situation electing to conceal from Aunt Maud how far she and Densher have gone , trusting to time and her wits to " square " her invaluable relative . Appears upon the London horizon Miss Milly Theale , an American of the richest , already in love with Densher , and , at the dawn of life , in full possession of its resources , stricken with some mysterious and mortal disease . Milly is the " dove , " and has innocently nestled up to Miss Croy , unaware of any relation between her and Densher . When she becomes aware , it is by indirection , with the view advanced that Densher nourishes an unrequited passion for her friend  --  a view that Miss Croy herself resolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ceived the situation to be worked , whereby Aunt Maud may be squared and Densher and everything else she wants eventually secured to her . Exactly what she is driving at nobody can know till he approaches the middle of the second volume , where her plan is explicitly stated . It is Densher who states it . The poor young man feels that be is being pushed in directions too mysterious , through a fog too thick , and demands light . Miss Croy fences thus . " ' Do n't think , however , I 'll do all the work for you . If you want things named you must name them . ' " He had quite within the minute been turning names over ; and there was only one , which at last stared at him there dreadful , that properly fitted . " ' Since she 's to die , I 'm to marry her ? ' " " To marry her , " Miss Croy assures him without blinking . He presses her further : " ' So that when her death has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ? ' " Not in the least flustered , she replies : " You 'll in the natural course have money . We shall in the natural course be free . " The situation , thus baldly stated , seems rather monstrous , but Mr. James saves some from moral indignation and others from nervous shock by swathing his situation in the speculative , wrapping it in the conjectural , and protecting it with infinite precaution from direct judgment . He removes it from contact and conflict with moral preferences and emotional susceptibilities , and presents it voluminously to the intelligence as a subject with a wonderful variety of points for subtle disquisition . The simple or superficial has never engaged his interest , and he has always been blessedly free from a desire to proclaim the obvious . Events and their possible consequences attract him only in so far as they prompt conjecture about how certain imaginable people might face them , what they might conceivably do with them . To read him ( in his later days ) without mystification and utter dissatisfaction there must be a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a cheerfully reciprocal attitude For certain sentences , even chapters , the faithful should not be lured into defence , but declare boldly that the author has taken sanctuary and may be as cryptic as he pleases . In ' The Wings of the Dove ' he frequently retires so deeply within himself that the more he labors to express his meaning , the more involved and incomof his species , while emphasizing a differentiation due to his career . Several chapters included in ' The Virginian ' have been published separately , and are given rather more space in the novel than they are worth to its principal motives  --  characterization of the Virginian . The New England relatives of Molly Wood , schoolma'am at Bear Creek , are hypothetical New Englanders , so fearful of compromising their respectability . Throughout the tale , Molly Wood is never quite good enough for the pains and persistence with which the Virginian woos her , but in the last crisis she Justifies his choice . As a test of character for both , the final moment of conflict between Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it is very quick , and the outcome so satisfactory that one realizes an immense fear of a disappointment . ' The Virginian ' has , we believe , been one of the , most popular books of the season , it deserves to endure through many seasons . The motive of Mrs. Foote 's tale , ambiguously entitled ' The Desert and the Sown , ' is too fanciful , too remote from the common , to permit so much real tragic intensity as she has tried to attach to it . Some ideals of self-sacrifice are a little too finespun for everyday use , and that which animated Adam Bogardus first to wander twenty years in a wilderness , and again to deny his identity , seems to us one of them . At all events , if such fantastically ideal conduct is to appear supremely noble and extract sympathetic emotion , the presentation should be direct , pitched in a serious key , and kept in rather stern poetic isolation from common occurrences . Mrs. Foote 's method of presentation is very defective  --  a matter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong sense of the value of form and knew how to use her subject for all it was worth . In this case she approaches her subject through garrison gossip and chatter about weddings And clothes , and , even after reaching it , she continues to offer the diversion of not very relevant triviality . It is given to few to expose a soul 's tragedy coherently , and the most vivid impression to be derived from ' The Desert and the Sown ' is that Mrs. Foote 's aspiration has flown a little beyond her , power of performance . In the days , now long ago , when Charles Egbert Craddock wrote tales of strange and warlike folk who dwelt in remote mountains , engaging in bloody family feuds , in the illicit distilling of whiskey and in uproarious dances at the cross-roads , some good people were more shocked by the unconventional matter than pleased by the vigorous vivacity of her narration . Surprise when this supposedly bold , bad man turned out to be a woman was great , yet hardly greater than that experienced when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Champion , ' one finds a chronicle , not of wild deeds done under the light of the famous Tennessee moon , but of a good little " printer 's devil " whose bad companion persuaded him to enter a theatre without the preliminary formality of paying for his ticket The consequences of the " devil 's " irregularity were dreadful , and the activity of his conscience points unmistakably to a tendency of his enlightening occupation to convert devils into angels . The inferences , too , that he drew from strange things seen and heard behind the scenes aleclearly beyond the mental range of a small boy whose days are spent in blacking boots , for instance . When he is safely out of his scrape , his cultivated conscience and mind together arrive at a reflection which marks him for a predestined prig . Mr. Gorham , the manager of the theatre , has helped the devil to clear himself of accusation of arson and robbery , but this kind deed , we are given to understand , was prompted by impulse , and was not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his observation of Gorham ' in those days , Ned the devil became more and more aware that impulse is a poor substitute for principle as a basis of action , and that although impulse may serve as an excuse for much that is fierce or weak , it detracts from the merit of what is good . " Miss Murfree 's moral excursion will not , we think , add to her reputation either as an observer or delineator of life . Mr. Joseph Conrad , who has written some stirring tales of the sea , becomes in ' Typhoon ' too obscurely nautical for easy understanding by land-going people . What the captain and the mate , the engineers and the two hundred Chinamen between decks were all about , individually and in relation to each other , while the typhoon was playing with the steamer Nan-Sliam , is matter easily grasped , perhaps , by experienced sailormen , but surely most bewildering to any other . - There can be no mistake , however , about the man at the helm and his business , and we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i5 so vividly presented : " He had flung down his cap , his coat , and stood propped against the gear-casing in a striped cotton shirt open on his breast . The little brass wheel in his hands seemed a bright and fragile toy . The cords of his neck stood out hard and lean , a dark patch lay in the h011ow of his throat , and his face was still and sunken as in death . . . His head did n't budge on his neck ? like a stone head fixed to look one way from a column . " It is a matter of common report that some fortunate men have followed the sea through a long life without encountering a big blow . Captain MacWhirr of the Nan-Shan had been one of these until the typhoon surprised him , and the circumstance is noticed by the author in a way that makes his accumulation of detail and technicalities , his toil and care for great effects , seem singular waste of time . This about Captain MacWhirr comes so natu-rally : " The sea itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seldom looked up , and wandered innocently over the waters with the only visible purpose of getting food , raiment , and house-room for three people ashore . Dirty weather he had known , of course . But he had never been given a glimpse of immeasurable strength and of immoderate wrath , the wrath that passes exhausted , but never appeased  --  the wrath and fury of the passionate sea . . . He sailed over the surface of the oceans as some men go skimming over the years of existence , and sink at last into a placid grave , ignorant of life to the last . without ever having been made to see all it contains of perfidy , violence , and terror . There are on sea and land such men thus fortunate or thus disdained by destiny or by the sea . " The collection of tales which have been written by Mr. Aldrich for magazines may be best described without disparagement as neat little nothings The subjects are thin , requiring for their development neither force nor passion  --  very easy things for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow . The title tale is light comedy of a mechanical sort , and suffers from that blight of affectation or insincerity which affects many American representations of compatriots who are persons of - fashion . A young man who betrays his genuine Americanism by saying to his servant , " If there 's a bottle of Bass on the ice , serve that , " and immediately becomes so Anglo-Indian ( presumably ) as to say to himself : " The boys ca n't have finished tiffin yet , " strikes us as a young man with a false note in his character  --  one who must be living a double life , who , linguistically and otherwise , does n't know " where he 's at . " " An Untold Story " is , from every point of view , the best m the book . The feeling of the scene and of the tragic circumstance in the garden at Budapest is admirably given , and one recognizes a poet in the observation of a group of children , curious , yet afraid , who " stood in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flock of timid sparrows . ' Mr Cable 's ' Bylow Hill ' is a domestic drama , showing how one man 's insane jealousy destroyed the peace and comfort of - several of the most virtuous and amiable - people in the world . The trouble appears to have arisen from the too great amiability of Miss Isabel Morris , who , under pressure , married Arthur Winslow , feeling that she was not too fond , and wishing she were " fond in the old , mad way the word meant when it was young " It may be supposed that Winslow is not quite sane , and that , therefore , in his passion , he is always cowardly and violent The assumption naturally deprives the delineation of his jealousy of the interest with which its development may be watched in a man normally strong and courageous like Othello . The book is very prettily done up with large , clear print , wide margins , and colored illustrations . Several men are prominent in ' The Way of a Man , ' by.Mr Morley Roberts , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to celebrate The book is an example of romance gone mad , and worth notice only because it may indicate that the tale of adventure in revolting South American states is in the death-throe . Bad as it has been , however , it might in decency have been permitted to die without positive ignominy No subject is bad enough to be mauled and battered and travestied with the incoherent fury displayed by Mr. Roberts . Much that is interesting about Jews ( as Jews ) may be gathered from the tales by Mr. Herman Bernstein , collected under the title ' In the Gates of Israel . ' In the heart of New York they live , in the shadow of the Goddess of Liberty , yet moving and breathing under the personal supervision , as it were , of the denunciatory prophets . The marriage broker alone appears quite to escape their gloomy domination , but his clients do not appreciate the joke of his occupation . Mr. Bernstein 's literary manner is direct and sincere , and he shows no desire to sentimentalize the sorrows of his people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he uses ( Hebrew , Yiddish , Russian ) ; but in the interest of the reader he might contrive to do without unpronounceable symbols .
