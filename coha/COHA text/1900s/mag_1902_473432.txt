THE six and twentieth day of Aprill ( 1607 ) , about foure a cluck in the morning , wee descried the Land of Virginia . " The same day wee entred in the Bay of Chesupioc without any let or hindrance . " There wee landed and discouered a little way ; but wee could find nothing worth the speaking of , but faire meddowes and goodly tall Trees ; with such Fregh waters running through the woods as I was almost rauished at the first sight thereof . " The little flotilla which , as thus related , cast anchor off Cape Henry on that fair April morning contained , it may be , many besides Captain George Percy who " found nothing worth the speaking of , " because the " Fresh waters running through the woo &; " did not , like South-American rivers , wash down golden sands to the Bay of Chesupioc . Furthermore , there were no palaces , ornamented with rare marbles and metals still more precious , peeping through the " goodly tall Trees " ; and the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too speedily encountered , were decked upon festive occasions with nothing more valuable than pieces of copper and chains of river pearls . It was a shock and a disappointment ; it was something which the adventurers themselves realized but slowly , and which it required years to bring home to the minds of the London Council for Virginia , that the chief material wealth of the country was to be obtained by agriculture , and not by mining . Happily , though the basis of the enterprise was commercial , and the colonists members and shareholders in a great joint-stock company , lust of gold was not its onlymotive power ; both patriotism and religion had contributed to its inception , and to the carrying out of the project had gone the most disinterested efforts of some of the strongest and purest spirits ever nourished upon English soil . Had the hundred and five adventurers upon the Susan Constant , the Godspeed , and the Discovery been able to rise into the air high enough to obtain a bird's-eye view of the continent of North America , they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no trace of the white man , save a few Spanish settlements on the coast of Florida , and far to the north , perhaps some rude cabins along the St. Lawrence , built by French fur-traders , who now and again came thither in the season . Off the coast of Newfoundland might have been discerned perhaps a number of fishing-boats of several nationalities . Far away eastward , on the southern shore of England , two ships lay nearly ready in Plymouth Harbor for their voyage to the New World . They were the Mary and John and the Gift of God , and under the direction of the Plymouth Company they were to convey to the mouth of the Kennebec the adventurers who , in August of that same year , were there to plant a short-lived colony , and to return home the next spring discouraged by toil and hardship . But east and south from Virginia the West India Isles were thickly dotted with the dwellings of the Spaniard . When Isabella the Catholic lent her jewels to the enterprise of Columbus , she sowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years had at this time failed to exhaust . Billion after billion of treasure had poured from the mines of Mexico and Peru into Spanish coffers since Pope Alexander VI. , as the Vicegerent of Heaven , had bestowed on Spain , the eldest son of the Church , all of the new world I ? a claim which , it appeared , Spain meant to enforce : the Huguenot colony that had invaded the coast of Florida was cut off not merely as Protestant , but as French . Ever since Elizabeth of England had announced the counter - claim that the gift of Pope Borgia was valid only whet , enforced by discovery and the fact of actual settlement and possession , it had been manifest to English statesmanship that the haughty enemy must he met and vanquished on her own ground , and that the most effective blow to her supremacy in Europe would he the establishment of permanent military stations on the Atlantic coast of North America . The experiment had been tried more than once ; but there were other and nearer foes than Spain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island of Roanoke , and his gallant half-brother had perished in a vain attempt to settle Newfoundland . Both these experiments had failed ; nay , even Spain herself had not succeeded in establishing colonies north of Florida . Almost within hail of the Virginia flotilla on that April morning were two abandoned Spanish settlements ; one on the banks of the Potomac , under the Jesuit fathers Segura and Quires , the other under Ayllon on the James itself , bad perished through the savage treachery of the Indian . There had grown up a belief in England that it was practically impossible to colonize North America ; and in 1804 some of those then present in the ships off Cape Henry had been concerned in the futile attempt of the brothers Leigh to found an English colony on the Oyapok River in South America , where malaria had proved more deadly than either Indian or Spaniard . This Virginia expedition was , therefore , wellnigh a forlorn hope ; that it succeeded where all tethers had failed was due to the personality of one remarkable man . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the writers of history that ought not to surprise us . For though not in any sense a politician , but a soldier , he occupied towards the polities of his own day the position of an advanced conservative ? the hardest of all positions to be understood by a later day , when the points at issue in his time have been decided , once for all , by the logic of events . His father had , it may be , served in the wars of France under Lord Willoughby , who commanded the English contingent sent to the aid of Henri de Navarre ; the young John Smith was on terms of friendly intimacy with the sons of that nobleman , of whom one was commanderin-chief of the forces of Charles I. in his struggle with the Parliament . He shared with them the influences which made them loyal till the end of their lives to Church and King , the lofty ideals , the pure morality , which in the Elizabethan days had produced a Spenser , a Sidney , and a Raleigh . Ardent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of his career , he is never without principle ; he never loves fighting or pillage for its own sake ; and after his earliest essay in arms under Maurice of Nassau , he goes forth a second time against the Turk , " both lamenting and repenting to have seen so many Christians slaughter one another . " Upon his return to England , after many adventures , he found the scheme of American colonization become for that time its Quest of the San Grail . The " greater England beyond the wave " was to be first a protest against Spanish arrogance and a stronghold against Spanish encroachment ; next , a refuge for the poor and needy , and especially for those disbanded soldiers whom the establishment of peace had left without employment . It was also to be an outlet for English commerce , and a treasury of real wealth for the nation ; above all , it was to be a nursery where the Protestant faith could grow up in peace , and in loyalty to Church and King . That any government but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant colony , Smith never understood ; that James L was at heart a traitor , reaching forth greedy hands after " the kingdom of Virginia , " that he might use it for the overthrow of English freedom , Smith never believed ; errors of judgment in a sovereign were always chargeable upon mistaken and dishonest advisers , and Smith was too honest a man to fathom the mind of a Stuart . Into the project for colonizing Virginia , therefore , the young soldier , then but twenty - five years of age , threw himself with fervent , patriotic ardor ; but at the landing at Jamestown he found himself a prisoner , accused of mutiny and conspiracy . For he was a person to whom no one could easily remain indifferent ; he inspired at once either a loyal friendship or a fervent enmity ; and he had , as we are told , a strong following aboard the flotilla , scattered on all three ships , whose discontent with things as they were , and warm but injudicious praise of their leader , may have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shred of real evidence could be produced , and on a fair trial be was acquitted and admitted of the Council . The story of this first year of English Virginia is a chronicle of mutual suspicion , distrust , confusion , and anarchy . Wingfield , the first President , an honest man , but unequal to the situation , had in some manner got wind of a plot to hand the colony over to the Spaniard , which may possibly have had other foundation than his imagination . Afraid , therefore , to fortify the locality they had chosen to settle in , or to aria the colonists , lest such a course should in some way work to the advantage of Spain , he thus left the settlement defenceless against the Indians . When a sudden onset of the savages , only repulsed by the guns of the ships , had convinced him of his error in this respect , he still remained narrow , timid , and suspicious . There is no trace , during his administration , of any wise or far-sighted policy in any department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrustful and suspicious , and fundamentally disunited ; the whole colony went mad with the gold-fever , neglecting to provide the necessaries of food and shelter against the fast-approaching winter ; they were further hampered by ? the misunderstanding of the London Council of their situation , who , conceiving from the first accounts sent home to them that Virginia was a land of summer climate and tropic abundance , neglected to supply their real necessities , while sending peremptory demands for the discovery of gold , and also a passage to the South Sea . By the concurrent testimony of many eye-witnesses , John Smith saved the situation and preserved Virginia . TTe was the one man in the colony who could keep order at the fort or deal effectually with the Indians abroad . He understood the savages instinctively , alike for good or evil ; he knew when to trust them , and when to be on his guard against their treachery . He fought them , made treaties of peace and friendship , forced them to trade for corn when they would have far preferred to starve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their territory , and is at the present time our sole authority for the location of their tribes . With a force of only about forty ? faithful soldiers he reduced to obedience and kept in awe all the tribes of the region about Jamestown ; yet his campaigns against them were almost bloodless , and in time of peace his treatment of them was absolute kindness , fairness , and integrity . Had his example in this respect been followed in later years , had his Indian policy been universally adopted , it would have spared American history some of its most blood-stained pages . At home he asserted and maintained steadily and consistently that the policy of the London Company towards Virginia was unwise and mistaken ; that the colony might to be , and must be , if it were to survive , supplied with the necessaries of life until it was able to provide these for itself ; at which time the Company might with some justice begin to expect a return for its outlay . Yet in thus testifying he was but the more loyal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he adhered with military strictness ; even the recommendations of the " Instructions by way of advice , " probably written by the younger Hakluyt , were by him carried out , wherever possible , in their most minute particulars . The Presidency of Virginia , having come to him in due course , gave him an opportunity to spend himself for her more freely than he had as yet been able to do ; but so careful was he in the observance of even the smallest points of law that when at the expiration of his year of office there remained only himself and Captain Martin who were eligible for President , under the terms of the charter , Smith solemnly elected his fellow-councillor , and as solemnly received the tatter 's resignation of the Presidency into his own hands . He was , however , ready to apply the strong hand when a necessity higher than law made it expedient to do so . Three times were the discontented on the point of abandoning the colony and returning to England , and three times did Smith turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice to sink or remain in Virginia . When a ship laden with clothing and provisions for trade arrived at Jamestown in the hour of famine , the President calmly requisitioned her cargo , and used it for the public good , sending home a message to the disappointed own er that he had no money , and could not dispense with the goods . The test of his administration was applied in the moment of its seemingly highest prosperity , when , as he believed , abundance of food had been provided to last until harvest , and the buildings , forts , and manufactures begun under his care were all satisfactorily in progress . Then , at the sudden discovery that the grain had been destroyed in the storehouses by rats and dampness , there began what might have proved another Starving Time ; but the wise and prudent course immediately inaugurated by the President brought the colony through with the loss of only seven persons , who died from sickness rather than starvation . It is indeed the best answer to the detractors from Smith 's merit whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the government of Lord Delaware was successful only by carrying into effect Smith 's plans , and giving heed to the advice contained in his " Rude Answer " ; while the massacre of 1622 would have been impossible had his policy of withholding English weapons from the Indians been strictly followed . There is little wonder that he considered that matters had been grossly mismanaged , and that he urged the King to resume the government into his own hands . Had the counsels of the timid prevailed , had John Smith been absent , or of a different temper from what vke find him , what , we may ask , would in that case have been the result to America ? The correspondence between Philip M. of Spain and his ministers , Zuiliga and Gondomar , in London , which has been translated and published by Dr. Alexander Brown , shows that Spain from the first regarded the Virginia colony with hatred and suspicion . She had lost much of her strength through the damage inflicted on her commerce by Drake , and more by the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enmity of England ; but she did her best , by all the subtleties of diplomacy , to overthrow the infant colony . She maintained a correspondent in the London Council itself , and sent spies to Jamestown , whose depositions are still on record . She was vividly awake , and keenly on the watch , and there is very little doubt that she would have seized upon the abandonment of Jamestown , had such event occurred , as a virtual ceding of the English claim to Virginia . Meantime English enterprise in that direction would have received a decisive set-hack ; the Pilgrims , leaving Holland only thirteen years later , would have gone to Guiana , and there perished of malaria , or survived , if at all , enfeebled and enervated by the climate . The Dutch , attempting the settlement of New Netherlands , would have found the enemy of Holland and Belgium already in possession ; for it is hardly conceivable that , except by the direct interposition of - Providence , Spain , with a foothold and base of supplies already established in Florida and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push her colonies northward and westward . But the hand of Providence was put forth after another fashion , in , as says Edward Arber , * " the fortunate presence of this English captain , so self-denying , so full of resources , and so trained ( by his conflicts and captivity in eastern Europe ) in dealing with savage races . . . . If Smith had died or left earlier than he did , the James River settlement must have succumbed ; for manifestly he was the life and energy of the whole plantation . . . So that for about a couple of years all the glorious possibilities that are still wrapped up in the words United States of America hung , as on a slight thread , upon the hardened strength and powers of endurance , the self-forgetfulness and public spirit , of this enthusiastic young English captain . He has therein given us a noble example not to flinch from duty or sacrifice ; for we never know the great results that may come from our doing the one or making the other .
