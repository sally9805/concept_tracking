txt Without assuming to decide as to the facts , it is permitted to say that , on the facts as he states them , Mr. EDWIN BE-DELL has done well to sue the school at which his boy was severely and cruelly " hazed . " Whatever may be the merits of this particular case , it is best that the responsibility of the managers of a school should be defined as to the reasonable protection of the youngsters committed to their care from violence or from mental torment . If it be found , as the result of litigation , that the responsibility is clear and can be enforced in damages , there is little doubt that some means will be discovered to suppress the cause of action . The moral sense and the ingenuity of the best and brightest teachers can be stimulated through the pocket nerve and problems that seem insoluble without changes in the " nature of boys " will yield to the energy of minds thus incited . Another way which has been found effective in some schools is the institution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of admission to a school to pledge their honor to the maintenance of the standard of conduct established for the school will , when it is left to them to detect , adjudge and punish violations of the pledge , do so with fidelity and a surprising degree of sound judgment . In the first place they are ready to accept in advance as in con- cordance with their own ideas of what is right and decent a standard condemning things that they would readily join in thoughtlessly had they not made up their minds about them beforehand . In the next place , when they are put on their honor and their teachers treat them with frank confidence and respect , the state of war which is natural in boyish minds against authority which seems to them arbitrary disappears . In its place comes a relation of mutual obligation , and a manly boy is generally willing to pay for confidence in himself by justifying it . It is needless to say where , this can be accomplished the lad is learning one of the most important lessons of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and struggles of a man 's life in a wholesome and common-sense manner , There is a sincere belief in the minds of some very intelligent men that hazing has good effect , and , if not carried too far , is " good for the cub , " and there is basis for this belief . But it is not easy to see how any good to the lads hazed can compensate for the evil almost inevitably done to the hazers . Practically without exception the victim of hazing is helpless in the presence of superior numbers and strength . In other words , the action of the hazers is essentially cowardly . Their motives , if not so deliberately bad as sometimes represented , are in no sense good , and to maltreat those who have nothing like a fair chance to resist and almost no chance to inflict injury on their tormentors is not manly , not gentlemanly , is , in fact , cowardly and cruel . We have no desire to exaggerate what are looked on by many as boyish follies only or to judge those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is surely better that instincts of this sort should be checked rather than indulged .
