Among President Roosevelt 's new appointments for the Cabinet , that of Mr. Cortelyou for the Treasury will probably excite the most interest . In that important post Mr. Cortelyou will necessarily be an experiment . That he possesses high executive ability , has been demonstrated in the other Cabinet offices which he has held . Whether he is fitted to grapple with the large questions of fiscal policy or expedient , which confront the head of the Treasury now and will probably be still more urgent and vexatious in the next three years , is another matter . Of financial training , in the sense in which the term is used among business men , he has had none . This lack of experienge is not a fatal defect ; Gallatin , for example , as one of our ablest ministers of finance . We can not help feeling regret , however , that , at a time when the question of currency reform , is coming to a crisis , and when the relations between the Treasury and the market have been complicated by Secretary Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new incumbent should not be a man whose experience and matured financial opinions would in themselves command unquestioned respect . As for the other ai pointments , that of Oscar S. Straus , as head of the Department of Commerce and Labor , is easily the best . Mr. Straus made an admirable Minister to Turkey ; through his connection with the Civic Federation he has been brought into contact with labor leaders and labor questions . Of his broad view of commercial questions , there can be no doubt . Moreover , he can be relied upon to deal with immigration ' questions in a sympathetic spirit . But the best thing is that his appointment places in the Cabinet one of the foremost advocates of peace and arbitration in this or any country . George von L. Meyer will make a diligent Postmaster-General ; but it is chiefly to his wealth and social alliances that he owes political prominence . The navy may suffer from the transfer of Mr. Bonaparte , an excellent secretary , to the Attorney-Generalship . Mr. Metcalf served on the Naval Committee of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bonaparte . The proposal to lend Government money on security of cotton  --  gravely set forth in a speech to the Bankers ' Convention at St. Louis  --  we are inclined to regard as one of the first-fruits of Secre tary Shaw 's recent policy . A few weeks ago the New York bankers wanted to import gold from London. - The rate of exchange being then not quite low enough , if they paid interest on the money involved , to make the operation profitable , the bankers appealed to Mr. Shaw to lend them Government money for nothing . He promptly did so . There was no pretence that the Treasury was in any way benefited by the importation ; there was no assertion even that the Government was restoring to circulation money withdrawn by its surplus revenue ; for , by the terms of Mr. Shaw 's arrangement , the loan of public money was to be repaid at once when the gold arrived . Now comes Charles J. Haden of Atlanta , with his plea to the bankers for loans of Government funds to move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " should we not call upon the Government for aid , as , do the gambling : . stricken banks when pressed by frenzied speculation ? " In our own old-fashioned opinions about the use of public moneys , we can discover a dozen reasons why such a call should meet with refusal , the chief reason being that the placing of Government funds at the service of private business enterprises is demoralizing to all parties concerned . But Secretary Shaw is certainly estopped from using that argument . The conviction of the Standard Oil Company , in an Ohio court , for conspiracy , is virtually a triumph for President Roosevelt , since the United States Attorney-General collected most of the evidence . The Anti-Trust law of Ohio makes every day of continuation in an illegal Trust a separate offence , with a possible fine of $5,000 . Such a penalty rigorous . ly imposed would go far to restore the pretty well shattered- hope that the fine is an effectual deterrent to corporate offenders . But the effect of such a verdict can not be measured in dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the most dangerous and cynical of industrial corporations . We retain our belief that there is very limited help for present evils in mulcting those fictitious and fabulously wealthy personalities we call Trusts . We note that Jack the Giant Killer struck not at the pockets , but at the necks , of his foes . When we see a few high managers of criminal corporations wearing prison garb we shall be within hailing distance ct real reform . We may at least rejoice heartily at the good beginning the law has made with the Standard Oil Company . If it is not difficult to fine its legal entity , there is probably some way also of getting at the real conspirators-behind the charter . " It is not possible to defend a rebate case in the present state of popular opiniOn . " Thus the counsel of the New York Central , at the conclusion of the trial in which the railway was convicted of giving rebates to the Sugar Trust . Plainly , no defence was possible in that case The offence was too flagrant ; - the proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil-may-care spirit of the sandbagger . Yet railroad officials wonder that there is a strong prejudice against their companies , and that Government ownership plans enlist the support not only of demagogues , but of sober men . We re-. gard the conviction of the Central as one of the most important judicial events in years . It will call a halt on ' dishonest railroad managers the coun , try over . Naturally , Mr. Hearst was quick to make use of the verdict in his campaign . He modestly appeared on the platform.at Plattsburgh and read the , dispatch announcing " his " victory . He was entitled to do so , for the Attorney7 General has testified that his information and proof came from Mr. Hearst 's lawyers . This public service must be written down to Mr. Hearst 's credit . The incident shows plainly enough why it is that the cries of the agitator and prom- , ises of the demagOgue no longer pass as unnoticed as the daily noise of the . streets . At the meeting of the New England Association of Colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Tutorial System , " which was introduced a year ago in his college . He stated that at first the students regarded the plan with amuse- - ment and curiosity , and were rather Shy of their new instructors , but that they have since learned to appreciate the vantages of supervision and direction , in their work . They are pleased with the arrangement , which " is now becoming a part of the college tradition . " During the year the library has been consulted as never before . There has also been improvement in discipline . Professor West 's allusion to the previous state of things might give an impression that there has been a change from comparative barbarism to civilization : " No longer are there roving bands - of - students on the campus in the evening , but quiet reigns , and lights are seen in study windows " Anything which could ' have this effect in so short a time is amazingly beneficial . The mere introduction into Princeton of fifty young university graduates , most of whom ' have won distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus to both professors and students . But as President Hadley of Yale , who likes the plan , pointed out not long ago , it is undeniably expensive . The endowment required is $2,500,000 ? a large sum to invest in any academic experiment . Five hundred English teachers , divided into small squads , will begin an invasion of this country next month . They represent all grades , from the kindergarten to the university . This enterprise , like previous ones of the same kind , is engineered by Sir Alfred Mosely . His object , is to familiarize English educators with systems which he regards as superior to their , own . " The American boy , " he has said more than once , " is far better fitted for the battle with the world than is the English youth when he leaves school . " Sir Alfred Mosely adds the further explanation that " with Americans education is mostly along practical lines ; with the English it is along the classical . " Indubitably our educators have been less bound by tradition ; they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be immediately useful in business or the trades . Without denying that these commercial courses are of some value , we may doubt whether they always supply , a mental discipline equal to that of the classics which they replace . If stimulating the mind rather than directly imparting knowledge be the aim of education , the " practical " studies , with their appeal to the stomach , may easily be overdone . Our English visitors will , we trust , remember that in the eighteenth century and the first two-thirds of the nineteenth , Americans , even under the handicap of the studies which Sir Alfred Mosely distrusts , still managed to get on fairly well . The English observers may also discover that with such- opportunities for material success as America offers , boys who are trained in the old classical curriculum , or according is the latest plan of our new schools of commerce , or who have escaped pretty much all formal teaching , still win their . victories in - the battle of life . Dr.-Pierre Janet of Palle , who is now lecturing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wards of Salpetriere , and is the author cf a number of important works on psychology and nervous pathology . " Hysteria " is the subject of the present course  --  a subject upon which he has alrcady published a formal treatise , as well as clinical reports of much value . IL is to be wished that he might ' resume before American audiences the discussion of hypnotism and of dual personality which awakened intense interest nearly twenty years ago in his " L'Antomatisme Psychologique " His explanation of certain obscure cases of " the double self , " by supposing a disintegration of consciousness , is obviously open to criticism ; but in his hands it furnish ed a conception of the real process involved , and in particular gave men of science a working hypothesis with which to approach further investigations . That there are too many . scientific congresses is the complaint of a writer in the Revue Scientillque . While isolation is a bad thing for the man of science , and while it is essential to his usefulness and reputation that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labor , and money are wasted by the multiplicity of these assemblies A concrete example of the incidental abuses is furnished by the same periodical , in its report of the Medical Congress at Lisbon . One of the chief evils was the diversity of language . The reports were distributed so tardily that members of the congress had no time in which to prepare themselves to speak . There were too many reports ' relating to the same subject , which gave rise to tiresome repetitions . Much time was lost in attending fetes and other entertainments . Moreover , a number of eminent men failed to appear personally , and their papers were read for them by others . Yet the desire of attending congresses is keen , and it would be cruel to deprive even modest scientists of opportunities to be heard , or to prevent their hearers from manifesting the Christian graces of patience and long-suffering . There is need of better education among the light-fingered gentry who cut pictures from their frames . That their taste is backward and their judgment doubtful has been recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurer who has just risked State 's prison for the sake of a Meyer von Bremen in the Cincinnati Museum . To choose such a thing when better was to be had suggests an unhappy interference of sentiment with strict business . Even the successful ab'cluctors of the , Gainsborough Duchess ' got , after all , only a more than dubious picture , even if their idea of commer'cial and advertising values seems to have been excellent . In general , - however , picture-stealing can hardly rank as a fine art Safe-cracking seems fairly an intellectual occupation in comparison . Evidently there are obstacles to conducting picture-stealing on a purely artistic basis . Commercial considerations must rightly rule . Moreover , the finest and most renowned pictures can hardly be stolen to advantage , being difficult to sell Such considerations must excuse much that may seem crude in an essentially liberal occupation . To astute museum directors , the debased state of the picture , stealing profession affords an unexampled opportunity . Every musr-um should create at least one gallery of paintings that can be spared . A deaf mute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and upon the doorpost might hang conspicuously a pair of shears . Clemenceau 's reorganization of the French Ministry calls for little comment , except for the assignment of the war portfolio to Gen. Picquart . This is one of those rare instances in which practical politics and poetic justice meet . In a sense , the appointment is a defiance not merely to moribund Nationalism , but to the more respectable Moderate and Clerical sentiment that was on the wrong side of the affaire Dreyfus . It is a gauge of uncompromising Radicalism , and will be hailed with expectant rejoicing by the Socialists also . Otherwise , the Cabinet remains much what it was . M. Briand retains the portfolio of Education and ' Worship , which promises that the Separation act will be carried into effect without faltering , and yet without bigotry or unnecessary proscription . No French Cabinet for many years has been complete without a Socialist member , and now M. Viviani accepts the newly created Ministry of Labor . M. Pichon , the new Foreign Minister , is Resident-General in Tunis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Far East . A former colleague of Clemenceau 's on La Justice , he presumably represents the progressive colonialism so deeply desired on the boulevards , tempered , however , by humanitarian and socialistic scruples . It may fairly be assumed that the Foreign Office will continue the present policy of conciliation with all and of positive friendship with Eng , land and Italy . It is premature to offer a forecast of the Clemenceau regime , but in general it may be said that it usually goes ill with a Warwick promoted to the throne . A man of statesmanlike parts , Clemenceau is evidently relentless towards the Reactionaries and Moderates . Having already shown himself , in the , post-office strike , too much of an authoritarian to please the Socialists , his middle course will clearly be a difficult one to steer . The British Admiralty , by turning out the greatest battleship ever seen , with turbine engines and the phenomenal speed of 23 knots an hour , has completely upset American and Continental theories that the turbines were unsuited to warships . Now the Admiralty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clyde are not cruisers at all , but battleships , with ' as heavy broadside lire as the Dreadnought , and of four knots greater speed . Indeed , these three vessels will actually be seven knots faster than any American , German , or French battleships , as a speed of 27 knots is confidently expected on their trials . Only one or two of our battleships can make 20 knots ; the bulk of them average 17 under service conditions . In other words , the English designers have borne out the prophets who have been looking forward to the clay when the distinction between the armored cruiser and the battleship would cease to be Our Navy Department , which has been for a year planning to outdo the Dreadnought , finds itself compelled to readapt its plans in accordance with the designs of the new English battleships . As a sort of consolation , the American experts are trying to figure out that their twelve-inch guns are about the same as-the British in size and ballistic qualities . From that there is but little satisfaction to be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed obtained for her new battleships , England has more than ever emphasized her naval superiority . No , matter how much her naval rivals may strive to imitate her , England can always get ahead of them by her ability to build , equip , and send to sea a great battleship fully a year before a vessel started in any other country at the same time . The United States is not the only country in which protection is steadily making life harder for the laboring man . In Germany the price of meat has gone up so much that thousands of people are no longer able to purchase any . When prices jumped a year ago , there was a great outcry . The only response from the Government was a  --  statement from the Minister of the Interior that the trouble was temporary , due to a bad crop year . Nevertheless , the price of meat has continued to rise , so that there is genuine suffering . A beef steer which cost $32.45 in Berlin in July , 1904 , cost $34 40 in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . On the 29th of September last , the price had risen to $41.75 . The price of pork has gone up correspondingly . The Berlin Tageblatt proves conclusively that this is due not merely to the increase of population , as the Government has alleged , but that there has been a marked falling off in the possible supply . It points out that , instead of doing something to help the poor by making it easy to import cattle from abroad , the Government , at the bidding of the Agrarians , is doing everything it can to make importations more difficult . In 1895 the importation of Danish hogs was stopped . This was followed in 1900 by the prohibition of all imports of sausage and canned meats . In 1904 , there was the edict against American hogs , - and in the same year a ban upon hogs and ruminants from France , Belgium , Holland , and England . - In the meanwhile , more stringent health regulations have made it even more difficult to import cattle on the hoof . This year have come increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , that the situation is getting worse rather than better . . While the Dutch are seriously discussing ways and means of averting ultimate absorption by Germany , now that hope of a direct successor to the throne seems to have been abandoned , the Belgians , too , are growing panicky in face of the Pan-Germanic movement . The French press in Belgium is greatly exercised over a plan recently set on foot by the German part of the population to secure legal recognition of their native tongue . In 1900- the number of German-speaking inhabitants was only 2 per cent . of the total ; but the ratio may have increased somewhat since then , The claim is based on the constitutional right enjoyed by every Bel , gian to make use of his native language in his relations with the educational , administrative , and Judicial departments of the Government . Admitting , however , their numerical weakness , the Germans declare that they will be content with an official recognition of their rights without seeking to have them enforced . The Flemish repiresentatives in the Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demands of the German-Belgians , possibly because they are convinced of the necessity of offering a check to German aspirations in general . The head that wears a crown may be a very good head for business . In the attacks upon Leopold II . of Belgium , in bis relation to the Congo Free State , fresh revelations continue to be made . Next to the notorious Abir Rubber Company , the most- prosperous corporation in the Congo is the Kasai Company , in which the State , that is to say , King Leopold , owns half of the stock . The State exacts its tax from the natives in the form of rods of copper , shaped , hke a St.- AndreW 's cross , which the , Government receives at a valuation of one and a quarter francs apiece . But ithese crosses are only to be purchased from the Kasai Company , to which the ' Government sells thennat three and one-'Leif francs apiece , and which in turn makes a liandsonie profit on the sale to the natives In other wordS , the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it takes back at one and a cuarter francs , and in addition ; as half-partner in the Kasai Company , shards in the profit on the subsequent sale of the ' copper . Compared'with the King of Pelgium , Abdul Hamid II . appears positively beneficent . The Sultan is the controlling Spirit of a land company operating in the Mesopotamian valley , ahere it - has been expropriating - the richest sections . This is accomplishedIv manipulation of the water supply . The peasant " must make the best terms Le can with the man who can at will cut him off from all irrigation . He sells . his land for a song . " In applying the latest Trust methods to high commerce it is evidently a distinct advantage to be a monarch of some sort . If with the royal functions goes the spiritual headship over faithful millions , so.much the better . Thus the Sultan is under no compulsion from anti-Trust laws to vest the ownership of his land in a holding company , say , at Samarcand or Zanzibar . In a book recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew prophets from Samuel to Malachi were insane . Since certain critics doubt the historical reality of the patriarchs , it is almost reassuring to be told that the prophets r ctually lived even if they-were mad . Of course , if the Oriental language and imagery of the Hebrew seers are taken literally , there are passages in their writings which are not conformed to the every-day experiences of Americans , or even of Frenchmen . Their visions may be interpreted as hallucinations , their denunciation of their enemies as violence , and their ap- , prehensions of coming disaster as delusions But upon such a prinCiple , many modern poets might be consigned to the psychopathic ward , while Dante , Milton , end Bunyan would , like Jeremiah and Ezekiel , be put In the class of raibi , e 's In both ancient and mediaeval times , genius and insanity were thought to be allied Dryden expressed that idea in his famous epigram Of late years such a belief has found support in the writings of ' Ant , Moreau , Lombroso , Nesbit , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of a diseased brain .
