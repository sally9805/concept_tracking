The President ancd , the Secretary of= the NaVynave ngrieracif forward the long-desired planof advanding young men to the fighting line ; - and , send their elders to shore duty , according to information given to Tan TIMES yesterday , and of the eighteen Captains who will command and be responsible for the $100,000,000 worth of armament and equipment to be sent through the Straits of Magellan to the Pacific fourteen will be younger men than those now in command . As the plan now stands , it is said , the following Captains will hold their ships end make the trip : Potter of the Vermont , Vreeland of the Kansas , Osterhaus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval officers of high rank it was said yesterday that Capt . McCrea , commanding the Georgia , might also be kept in his command , making five of the present Captains to stay aboard ship for this cruise . But his date of retirement is 1913 , only six years hence , and it/ is said that his case is in doubt . The Captains who will be sent ashore to make room for younger officers of the same rank are Seaton Schroeder of the iVirginia , Wlllam W. Kimball of the New Jersey , J. B.

The intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rear and put the younger ones in command of the battleships of the fleet became known through an official communication to the first of the Captains to prepare for duty ashore . This communication was put delicately . It informed the particular Captain that his relief from sea duty at this time was in ? no ' way a criticism by the department on his capacity as the commander of a first-class battleship of the United States Navy . The change in the commanders of the ships at this time has so far advanced and so much of detail of the plan has become known in the line of the navy that there is no other topic of conversation among the officers of the fleet which . Admiral Evans will take from the Atlantic to the Pacific . - It was said yesterday by a naval officer of high rank that the plan was to put on shore duty all Captains who had reached an age where they could not expect to be advanced to a Rear Admiralship , and then serve two years before retirement . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but they are close to the age of 62 , when they will have to retire . The plan seems to be to put younger men in command of the big ships , advance them to the grade of Rear Admiral , and halve them in service a longer time at alit grade. , a seems to be the wisdom of the . President and the peeretary of the Navy to push the young men forward , and although it will cause regret , perhaps , at this time , It may prove advantageous in time of trouble .

The work of the . battleships in these manoeuvres will be the first . of its kind ever ordered by the department . Naval officeea are waiting for this practice . with the keenest interest . New range-finding apparatus has been invented in recent years , and where only recently the target practice of the United States battleships at 4,000 yards was considered almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other navy , Uncle Sam 's present proposition is to make world records at 6,000 yards , under full speed and under conditions that promise to test the very limit our navy 's capacity for manoeuvring and gunnershtp . Old Issue of ' RetIrsment In Grade . Back of the shake-up among the Captains of the American fleet is the interesting fact that for years it has been a mooted question/ whether there should not be a new system of retirement , a retirement for age in grade , as it is technically called in the service . A. retire . " meat for age in grade would mean much for the younger officer who has advanced rapidly , bat for the older officer w10 has not : advanced so rapidly it would mean less active duty and less chance . The simple expedient of putting on there duty those officers who will not be able to serve two years In advanced grade before reaching the retirement age is tantamount to the old proposition of advancing the younger and swifter moving set of Officers to the front , where they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the navy . The younger officers are , of course , strongly . in favor of any plan by which they may , gain advantage , and the older officers will see it in just the opposite manner
