txt // It was the time for New York to act , and it did . In the same year it passed a law declaring forfeited any vessel or boat using steam , found navigating against the provisions of the previous laws of the State and a means by injunction was provided against removing any such boat from the jurisdiction of the State , that had been seized . New Jersey could not stand for that , so it passed a law in 1813 and again in 1818 passed other acts to uphold and enforce its statute of 1811 . But the Fulton and Livingston interests went on suing out injunctions and making it quite as ineffectual for a Jersey man to run a steamboat as it was for a New Yorker , without a license such as was called for by the New York statute . " Commodore " Vanderbilt became busy in 1820 in trying to find a way to overthrow the river monopoly . The New Jersey Legislature was only too eager to help and so an act was passed that year which among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " enjoined or restrained by any writ of injunction or order by the Court of Chancery of the State of New York , by virtue or under color of any act of the Legislature of that State , from navigating any boat or vessel moved by steam or fire belonging or to belong in part or in whole to him , on the waters between the ancient shores of the State of New Jersey and New York , the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such writ or order shall be liable to the person or persons aggrieved for all damages , How the Great River Monopoly was Broken f1 expenses and charges occasioned thereby , to be recovered with triple costs , " etc . Here was just the situation the persons attacking the Fulton-Livingston monopoly had sought to create . Two sovereign States had passed laws in direct conflict . ' l'lie Fulton-Livingston interests sued out their injunctions against two boats , the Bellona and Stoudinger , subsequently known as the Mouse-in-the-Mountain . " Commodore " Vanderbilt , who was the owner , was operating them from the Battery in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kull to Elizabethtown , a very short trip , the latter place being in New Jersey . It was indeed nothing more than a steamboat ferry . Thomas Gibbons was the boats ' master , and Ogden , the other party to the litigation that ensued , was a citizen of Newark , N. J. , an ex-Governor of the State , holding a Fulton-Livingston license for the same privilege . The case in New Jersey came before the Supreme Court of that State in 1822 and the Chief Justice ( Kirkpatrick ) promptly held , after discussing State 's rights and Constitutional privileges , that New York had attempted to interfere with the ancient shores of New Jersey and that Mr. Gibbons was entitled to his damages and triple costs under the enactment of that State . The Chief Justice told the parties , however , it was a question that ought to go to the United States Supreme Court and to the Supreme they went , Gibbons appearHow the Great River Monopoly was Broken 43 tribes . " Mr. Webster argued with prevailing force that the State had attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress ; that commerce was navigation and that the Federal regulations must apply . He contended if New York could grant such a monopoly , it might also grant another for other description of vessels ; for instance , for all sloops . If it could grant these exclusive privileges to a few it could grant them to many ; that is , it might grant them to all its own citizens to the exclusion of everybody else . But the waters of New York State , insisted Mr. Webster , were no more the subject of exclusive grants by that State than the waters of other States were the subjects of such grants by those other States . Virginia might well exercise over the entrance of the Chesapeake all the power that New York could exercise over the Ray of New York and the waters on the shore . But . that was not all . It required no greater power to grant monopoly of trade than a monopoly of navigation . Of course , New York , if its acts could be maintained , might give an exclusive right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do the same . The people of New York had a right to be protected against the steamboat monopoly . The appellant had a perfect right to come from New Jersey to New York in a vessel owned by himself of the proper legal description and enrolled and licensed according to the law . // The Constitution made the law of Congress supreme , when State laws came into opposition with them . It was not at all material in that view of the case , whether the law of the State was a law regulating commerce , a law of police or whatever other name or character it might be designated . If this provision was inconsistent with the act of Congress , they were void so far as that inconsistency extended . There were other provisions of the Constitution of the United States with which the law of the State of New York was in conflict . It was provided " that no State should , without the consent of Congress , lay any duty upon tonnage . " New York had authorized Messrs . Fulton and Livingston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They gave licenses out on their own terms and might require pecuniary consideration , or , having ascertained the tonnage of a vessel , regulate the amount of license upon same . That would be a tonnage duty and clearly in conflict with the Constitution . Mr. Webster also urged that the Constitution gave Congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts , to secure to authors and inventors , for a limited time , an exclusive right to their own writings and discoveries . The States might give exercise of their bounty toward authors and inventors and grant them bounties , but to attempt to confer exclusive grants as a reward was not a power to be exercised by the States . Much less could they , under the notion of conferring How the Great River Monopoly was Broken 45 rewards in such cases , grant monopolies incompatible with the exercise of rights held under the laws of the United States . Mr. Oakley , for the monopoly , argued that the power given to Congress by the sovereign State of New York was limited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The State had a right to legislate on all causes of concurrent power , although Congress had acted in the same power and upon the same subject-matter . The State might make it an offense to counterfeit the coin of any foreign country within its territory . New York had provided for the punishment of counterfeiting as had also Congress , all of which showed that Congress considered the power to punish such offenses as concurrent . A patentee obtained nothing by his grant , except an exclusive right , as it related to the Union instead of a right limited to the State together w i t h i more complete and certain remedies to protect and enforce that , right . If he could not use the thing invented against the State law before it was patented , he could nut use it after it was patented , for his grant conveyed no greater right than before existed . It belonged exclusively to the local State Legislatures to determine how a man could use his own without injury to his neighbors . A patentee could not give rights by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A patented boat on a ferry could not be used , the exclusive use of which had been granted by a State // law . A restraint imposed by the laws of New York on the navigation of the waters of the State was merely an internal regulation of the right to transit or passage from one part of the State to another . It was a regulation which , if even indispensable to public safety , Congress could not make . The power to make it , therefore , must be in the State . The State law was , in fact , only a regulation of the internal trade and right of navigation within the territorial limit , of the State . The power to regulate this was exclusively in the State . The State had exercised it in the sauce manner , both on land and water , and the law was valid although incidentally it might affect the right of intercourse between the States . Mr. Emmett , on the same side , undertook to show that New York was not the only State which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1815 , granted to J. L. Sullivan a similar grant for steamboats on the Connecticut River , twenty-eight years after the expiration of his patent , which on February 11 , 1819 , was enlarged for two years . New Hampshire , in June , 1816 , gave him a similar privilege on the Merrimac . Pennsylvania , on the 26th of March , 1813 , gave a similar right to James Barnes , from Wilkes-Barre to Tioga Point , on the borders of the State of New York . Georgia , on the 14th of November , 1814 , gave a similar How the Great River Monopoly was Broken 47 grant to S. Howard for all the waters of that State for steamboats ; and by another act , the 19th of December , 1817 , granted to a company ( probably derived from Howard ) a similar right for steamboats for twenty years . Tennessee had similarly given a right on the Tennessee River . As Congress had no power to regulate the internal commerce of any State , none of its regulations could affect so much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States , nor could it give to any man permission to carry on any steamboat navigation which in its beginning and ending was entirely within the waters of the State , for instance , between New York and Albany , on Cayuga Lake , or Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence or Niagara to Ogdensburg . The only question was as to navigation between foreign countries or another State and New York . If the power of Congress over commerce was exclusive , it must also have exclusive control over the means of carrying it on . No State then would be mad enough to expend large sums in building canals as New York was doing , susceptible of being used for intercourse between the States or foreign commerce , if Congress had the right to regulate the navigation and vessels that were the medium of foreign trade and that between the States . It could not be seriously contended that Congress could regulate the carrying of passengers to any // part of the Union who are traveling to Ballston , Saratoga , or any other place for pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , that would not legalize the interference of Congress as to the mode of their conveyance from place to place . Continuing Mr. Emmett asserted : " If ever the day should come when representatives from beyond the Rocky Mountains shall sit in the National Legislature , if ever a numerous and inland delegation shall wield the exclusive power of making regulations for our foreign commerce , without community of interest or knowledge of our local circumstances , the Union would not stand . It can not be the ordinance of God or nature that it should stand . It had been said by very high authority that the power of Congress to regulate commerce sweeps away the whole subject-matter . If so , it makes a wreck of State legislation , leaving only a few standing ruins that mark the extent of the desolation . The position , however , was not correct . " . . . The quarantine laws were further appealed to to illustrate Mr. Emmett 's position . It was held that they were all considered merely as laws of police . They were laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the nature of that commerce , which it was held must be regulated in some manner by Congress , that it enters into and mixes itself with almost all the concerns of life . The clause in the Constitution authorizing Congress to make laws respecting patents was supposed to present another argument How the Great River Monopoly was Broken 49 against the constitutionality of the State laws . There was no allegation of a patent or a claim of anything entitled to be protected by the patent laws , the use and enjoyment of which had been interfered with by the exclusive grant . If the last steamboat laws , enacted since the North River boats were in operation , had , instead of using a general phraseology forbid any person to use on the waters of the State , steamboats constructed or made in the same manner as those made by Fulton and Livingston , or in any manner before known or used or in any manner invented by a nonresident alien , would there be anything for the patent laws or power of Congress to operate on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so far good . The power to prohibit the use of patented things , either generally or locally , must reside somewhere . Could Congress prohibit the use of locally injurious , but patented things in the waters or the cities or the populous towns of New York ? If not , because it had no power of regulation or prohibition , where did that power reside ? If it resided as it must exclusively in the State Legislatures or subordinate authorities , who but their constitutents could inquire into the motives or propriety or their exercise of that power or the extent to which it should be carried ? A patent could be secured for anything ; if it once issued from the patent office as full of evils as Pandora 's box , if they were as new as those that issued from thence , it was above the // restraint and control of the State Legislature and the Legislature of the United States and of every human authority . The State of New York by a patient and forbearing patronage of ten years to Livingston and Fulton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward and by the subsequent liberality of its contract had called into existence the noblest and most useful improvement of the present day . . she had brought into noonday splendor an invaluable improvement to the intercourse and consequent happiness of man which without her aid would perhaps have scarcely dawned upon our grandchildren . She had not only rendered this service to her own citizens , but the benefits of her policy have spread themselves over the whole Union . . . and the happy and reflecting inhabitants of the States . . . might well ask themselves whether next to the Constitutions under which they lived there was a single blessing they enjoyed from the art and labor of man greater than that they had derived from the patronage of the State of New York to Robert Fulton . Finally came William Wirt of Virginia , the famous Attorney-General of the United States , amid the array of counsel , with the argument in support of Mr. Webster 's , that the State law was in conflict with powers vested in Congress and , even if concurrent , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void . Ile asked the court to " interpose its friendly hand and extirpate the How the Great River Monopoly was Broken 51 seeds of anarchy which New York had sown . The war of legislation which had already commenced will , according to its usual course , become a war of blows . Your country will be shaken with civic strife . Your republican institutions will perish in the conflict , your Constitution will fall and the last hope of the nations will be gone . " Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall was quite equal to the important decision he was called upon to render in the steamboat case . In doing so , he added one more to the important opinions he rendered in fixing fast and sure the legal foundation the young nation required to make its new and untested Constitution a workable , respected organic law . In an opinion fully reviewing the important case before him , and even apologizing for its great length , he held that Congress in being given the power to regulate commerce , was given the power to regulate navigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation had been added to the word commerce already in the Constitution . " But , " said he , " the power to regulate commerce does not look to the principle by which boats were moved . That power was left to individual discretion . . . The act demonstrates the opinion of Congress that steamboats may be enrolled and licensed in common with vessels using sails . They are , of course , entitled to the same privileges and can no more be restrained from navigating waters and entering ports , which are 5Q Old Steamboat Days free to such vessels , than if they were wafted on their voyage by the winds instead of being propelled by the agency of fire . The one element may be as legitimately used as the other ; for every commercial purpose authorized by the laws of the river , and the act of a State inhibiting the use of either to any vessel , having a license under the act of Congress , comes , we think , in direct collision with that act . " This opinion of the Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some additional grounds by Mr. Justice Johnson , rang a death-knell to the FultonLivingston monopoly on the Hudson River and New York Bay . The decree which the United States Supreme Court issued declared " the several laws of the State of New York which prohibit vessels licensed according to the laws of the United States , from navigating the waters of the State of New York , by means of fire or steam , repugnant to the Constitution and void . " It was certainly a great victory . The battle had been fought for years . Fulton had been dead nine years and it was only the Livingston contingent that witnessed the overthrow of the monopoly that had been enjoyed for so long a period . We have already noted how promptly capital became interested in steamboat enterprises and how the rivers became crowded with navigation which continued for a quarter of a century , until the steam railroads began to dispute with the river craft for both the passenger and freight trade . CHAPTER VI STEAMBOAT EVOLUTION ARAPID evolution in steamboat construction followed the breaking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domination of the Fulton-Livingston interests , were quick to develop new ideas that before had no encouragement from capital , which had been debarred from entering that particular field of enterprise . The shipyards of New York and Greenpoint and along the Hudson were more than busy with the large number of boats under construction , and the activity in this line continued for many years . Some of the builders of the larger boats were Henry Eckford , Brown &; Bell , Blossom , Smith &; Dimon , George Collyer , William II . Brown of New York , C. Bergh , Devine &; Burtis , John Englis , William Capes , Lawrence &; Sneden , E. S. Whitlock of Brooklyn , M. S. Allison of Jersey City , William Brown of Hyde Park , Mr. Kenyon of Albany , Morton &; Ed54 Old Steamboat bays rnonds and Van Loan &; Magee of Athens and Marvel &; Company of Newburgh . Robert McQueen and James P. Allaire built nearly all the engines for the river boats constructed before 1830 , but those for the Swallow , Rochester and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundry , a plant noted for its output of machinery . James Cunningham , Ilogg &; Uelarnatcr , Fletcher , Harrison &; Company , ' 1 ' . F. Secor &; Company and the Neptune Iron Works were the most active producers of steamboat engines during the forties and fifties . Following the example set by Fulton in the construction of the boiler for the Clermont , the boilers of all the best boats were built of copper as iron was found to be so liable to burst , and this fact made the construction of new boats very costly . The Clermont 's boiler weighed 4,399 pounds and at 2s. 2d. a pound cost ? 476. 11s. 2d. as is carefully noted by Mr. Fulton in his cash account covering the expenses of building this first steamboat . The boiler of the Chancellor Livingston weighed 44,000 pounds and that of the James Kent 60,000 pounds , which at recent rates would have made the copper in the boiler alone worth nearly $15,000 . As it was , the Kent 's boilers were worth nearly one-third of the cost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were introduced on the boats , the Novelty being the first to have that distinction , and it was some ten years later // that the burning of anthracite coal under the boilers was successfully introduced by Isaac Newton on the North and South America and the expense of fuel was cut down one-half . The large wood-burning boilers had required a prodigal expenditure of cordwood , which also demanded a large amount of deck room for stowage , and the introduction of hard coal fuel was considered one of the greatest advancements made in steamboat building . Another of Isaac Newton 's successful experiments was a small boat , the Balloon , built in 1839 . She was one hundred and sixty feet in length and eighteen feet beam , but was very fast , having extra large paddle wheels for her size . He also designed the Isaac Newton in 1846 and the New World in 1847 and they ran for several years as day boats . In 1855 , however , both were converted into night boats , the latter being lengthened some sixty feet and a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after their alterations , New Yorkers opened their eyes , and they were called floating palaces . Newton had introduced the grand saloon extending through two decks and surrounded with galleries . The New World was fitted up with Corinthian columns and trim and the Newton in Gothic . The saloons were lighted with gas , the cabin furnishings were elaborate and in many respects nothing approaching in elegance the two new night boats had ever before been seen afloat . The many new accom56 Old Steamboat Days modations that these boats afforded travelers not only made a distinctive type for river boats which has since been closely followed , but did much to establish the popularity of the line with which they were identified and which has since been largely retained . The New World continued in the service until her mishap in 1861 and the Newton until she burned in December , 1863 . As early as 1844 there was an iron hull steamer on the river named the Iron Witch- . She was subsequently rebuilt and named the Eric . The hull and engines were both constructed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and twenty-five feet long and twenty-seven feet beam . She ran from New York to Albany . It was not until within a comparatively short time that any further attempts were made to introduce iron or steel into the hull construction of the river boats . All the recent additions to the river fleet have , however , steel hulls and water-tight bulkheads . The boats of the Fulton type were built with their boilers well down in the hull of the boat , but in 1826 , the New Philadelphia appeared with her boilers built on her guards , a form of construction that prevailed for many years . Many still regard the old boats , such as the Mary Powell and Dean Richmond , more picturesque , affording glimpses of the stokers tossing the fuel into the fiery furnaces , than the newer boats which have reSteamboat // verted to the type of boats with the boilers down in the hold of the vessel . It is not at all likely , however , that any more steamers will be built of that variety , as the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been several excellent specimens of that class in service and some smart boats of that description of comparatively recent construction are now running on regular lines . They are apparently too narrow in beam to afford an opportunity for lofty construction , grand saloons and imposing cabin vistas , which the public seem to desire in traveling on the river . All of the old boats were stiffened and hulls made to carry the enormous load of engines and boilers by resorting to a " hog frame . " This was a framework of heavy timbers , built up truss fashion to which lifting rods were attached . These heavy " hog frames " are no longer resorted to in modern built boats and the trusses are entirely out of sight , giving the newer vessels a much neater and smarter appearance . With the advance in mechanical appliances came the steam steering devices , rendering it unnecessary to have four stalwart quartermasters to handle the big double steering wheels in the pilot houses of the larger steamers ; electric dynamos for lights supplanted the cumbersome gas machines that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and feathering wheels have made it possible to so reduce the diameter of the paddles , that it is now possible to walk the length of the lower deck without climbing over the crank shaft or " ducking " to go under it . The evolution of the steamboat from the primitive Clermont , on which Fulton sailed up the Hudson one hundred years ago , to the boats that now daily ply the river , affording every convenience to the passengers to be found in a first-class hotel on land , is truly wonderful . CHAPTER VII OLD RIVER CAPTAINS THE captain of a river steamer in the old days and to-day is by far the most important man on the boat . He must be a trusty , experienced man and should be at all times agreeable to the passengers . Those on the Hudson have been for the most part men of this character and many became popular with the traveling public . Before the days of a la carte restaurants on the boats , the captain had his table in the dining saloon , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trip . Under the present regulations the captains , though always on duty and men of character and ability , are not as much in evidence to the average passenger as in the old days . Capt . Samuel Jenkins commanded the Clermont after she was renamed the North River , in 1808 , the Car of Neptune was in command of Captain Roorback in 1810 and the Paragon , in 1813 , was in charge of Captain Wiswall . These men were , accordingly , the // pioneer steamboat captains of the river . They have been followed by many worthy successors , in whose charge millions of passengers have traveled in safety and comfort . Some of the captains on the steamers in the thirties and forties were H. Moore of the Olive Branch , Fountain of the Niagara and C. Benton of the William Penn , on the Union Line ; Captain Cochran of the Chancellor Livingston , T. Wiswall of the James Kent , S. Wiswall of the Richmond and Benton of the Saratoga , on the North River Line ; Captain Bartholomew of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constellation and Wiswall of the Constitution , on the North River Association Line . Capt.D . Peck sailed the Swift Sure and Captain Seymour the Coramerce , of the Steam Navigation Company ; Captain Peck the Henry Ecicford and Captain Drake the Sun , of the 0 . &; D. Line ; while Captain Sherman had the Chief Justice Marshall and Captain Fitch the New London , of the Troy Line . Captain Cruttenden was one of the last survivors of this class and when in command of the old Constellation he used to boast he never lost a trip or a life , had made one thousand one hundred and sixty-two trips with the old boat and carried over 172,000 passengers . Most of the early river captains reached a hearty old age . Captain Bunker , who ran the Fulton up the Hudson during the war of 1812 , lived until he was Old River Captains .61 seventy-five years of age , dying in 1847 , and must have rejoiced to note the great development in an industry in which he was a pioneer . Another veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sixty-three years old and died in New York in 1836 . He is buried in Hudson . Among the river captains of 1847 were Capt . A. Gorham , commanding the Troy ; Capt . H. J. Kellogg , the Niagara ; Capt . W. W. Tupper , the Columbia ; Capt . R. B. Macy , the Empire ; Capt . W. H. Peck , the Isaac Newton ; Capt . R. G. Cruttenden , the Hendrik Hudson ; Capt . R. H. Furey , the North America ; Capt . Thomas N. Hulse , the South America ; Capt . G. O. Tupper , the Alida ; Capt . A. DeGroot , the Roger Williams ; Capt . J. S. Odell , the Columbus ; Capt . Samuel Johnson , the Thomas Powell ; Capt . Charles Halstead , the Superior and Capt . John Samuels , the Emerald . Many odd characters were to be found among the old captains . Of one it is told he used to boast he paid one hundred dollars to bury his wife and it was worth every cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generally good humored river captains and never came to the dignity of commanding a passenger boat . He was a mighty good navigator , however , and had the reputation of putting things through in spite of wind or weather . Captain Houghton of the old Rochester was one of the // greatest characters among the old captains . He was familiarly known as " Pug " Houghton , his nose suggested the cognomen , and he was a great story-teller . He was a stage driver in Vermont when a younger man and some of his tales of the road were hair-raisers . He used to tell of frightening off some robbers at a wayside tavern with a brass candlestick which he held up as a pistol , and , as if to convince all doubters , he used to say , in the morning the heels of two hoots were found on the doorsill , torn off the bold marauders footwear as the captain had jammed the door to upon them . " Pug " Houghton always had a. knot of passengers about him on the river boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though there were those who claimed he never sailed beyond Sandy Hook in all his life . " Uncle " Daniel Drew , who had two steamboats , and a theological seminary in New Jersey named after him , was an able financier and a good business manager in general . He was greatly surprised on a certain occasion to find one of his captains taking a drink at the bar while the boat was running . The captain was equally surprised at being found at the bar by " Uncle " Daniel . Capt . was , however , a good bluff and held his ground , talking business as he drank his whiskey and in the presence of the owner of the line planked down a quarter on the bar for the drink . " What , " said Mr. Drew to the captain , in surOld // prise , " do you have to pay for your drinks on this boat ? " " Always , " replied the captain , without the quiver of an eyelash . " Fact is , " said he , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most desirable restraint on natural tendencies . " " Uncle " Daniel left the captain quite satisfied he was a very moderate drinker , if he had to pay steamboat prices for drinks , but had the bartender not sought out the captain and restored ' the quarter of a dollar before the end of that particular trip , the chances are ten to one he would have lost his job . One of the best known river captains was Capt . A. L. Anderson who had the Mary Powell built for him and commanded her for years . She was not only the smartest boat on the river in her day , but has always been a " lucky " boat , never having met with a serious accident . She lost one of her smokestacks in a big blow in the Highlands on one of her trips , many years ago , but is said to have finished her trip on time . She was owned for years by the Anderson family , but was recently purchased by the Day Line . There is still a Captain Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Anderson , a son of the original captain , and as he has been running the Powell for over thirty years himself , is in the veteran class . Capt . S. J. Roe , who has commanded the Rip Van Winkle , Drew , Dean Richmond and Adirondack in his // day , is still living , hale and hearty , over eighty years of age , in Albany , N. Y. His memory goes back to the days of the Swallow in 1845 , and he took a party of excursionists down the river in the Belle to view the wreck of the old boat . Captain Post , who ran the St. John , has been dead for a number of years and so has Capt . " Dave " Hitchcock who put the Chauncey Vibbard through by daylight and retained his popularity as a captain as long as he ran upon the river . The captains alone should not . be remembered of the great steamboat days of the thirties , forties and fifties . The times developed many engineers , men of resource and ingenuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impulse of every pound of steam that could be crowded on the boilers , in the great efforts to make records for speed . Many of the older men , on the decline of steam navigation , following the opening of the railroads , took to the deep water business and became chief engineers on ocean steamships and it would be interesting , indeed , if one were able , to follow the old-timers of the starting bar in their wanderings from their river habitat . CHAPTER VIII FAST TIME ON THE RIVER NO sooner had the Clermont made it possible to reduce the time of the journey to Albany to thirtytwo hours , than the steamboat builders began to attempt to make a further reduction . Each succeeding steamer cut down the time of the passage . In 1817 it had been reduced to eighteen hours and in 1826 the Constellation and Constitution had made the trip to Albany in fifteen hours . By 1836 a new boat , the North America , had cut it down to ten hours and the improvement went steadily on until the Chauncey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven hours , beginning and finishing the trip in daylight , which had long been the ambition of the steamboat captains . Now the new Hendrick Hudson of the Day Line leaves New York at 8.30 A. Al. , makes nine landings , arrives at Albany at 5.30 with the regularity of a railroad time table and could , if pushed , do a great deal better . The improvement in time will be readily appreciated Old Steamboat Days the appended statement of the performances of the - timers on the run to Albany : ' he Mary Powell , built in 1861 , many times reconcted and improved and still running , was for years ceded to - be the queen of the river steamers in 1t of speed . She averages twenty miles an hour at imes , and has been pushed to twenty-six miles . n 1884 , the steam yacht Stilletto , built entirely for ed and fresh from the hands of her builders , the Teshoffs of Bristol , R. I. , tried to wrest the laurels n the old boat and succeeded by a narrow margin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cell by two miles , covering the distance in one hour fifteen minutes . It was not a bad showing , howr , for the old river queen and her owners have ays claimed she could have done much better had been put into first class condition for the race . // Similar claims were made for the Stilletto , her builders claiming twenty-seven miles an hour for their boat . The Stilletto set low in the water so as to present as little surface for wind resistance as possible . She was somewhat of the same type as the Vamoose , another boat built for speed in later years . Both were the forerunners in a degree of the motor boats now so popular . This special form of construction had been attempted , however , many years before . Burden built a cigar-shaped boat which he called Helen . Though it was expected she would be very speedy , she turned out a failure and was soon abandoned . In the attempt to turn out fast boats and cut down the time of the river , some boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines and two walking beams were built . The Erie and Champlain were " four pipers , " but they did not realize the expectations of their builders . Even at this late date the Albany and New York of the Day Line only boast of three smokestacks . The improvement in speed has been secured with more perfectly constructed machinery and feathering paddle wheels , than anything else . The old captains were frequently given to speeding their boats , and many tales are told in the pilot houses and engine rooms to this day of the old craft that made sprints in order to hold the record of the smartest boat on the river . // When Hudson River captains raced their boats they did it for all they were worth . Trips that could be made with eighteen cords of wood and twenty-five pounds of steam , would call for twenty-five cords of wood and sixty pounds of steam , if the other boat was a good one and the race was at all close . The steam gauges were plugged and the safety valves were weighted down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be . In the fall of 18:36 , the Swallow and the Rochester had a memorable race , starting from Jersey City at 4 r . M. , November 8th , and it was a hot one . The boats were within a short distance from each other all the way up the river , with the tide against them . The Swallow 's engine became disabled near Hudson and she slowed down for a few moments and then dashed ahead again , but the Rochester reached the Overslaugh Bar , five miles below Albany , first , in eight hours and fifty-seven minutes , and the Swallow in nine hours and two minutes , just five minutes behind her rival . Though the race was the Rochester 's it was generally admitted that the Swallow was the better boat . The North America and the Champlain were always in for a race whenever their sailing hours permitted of it , and each boat had its enthusiastic backers , for the passengers generally became as much interested in these river contests , as the captains themselves . The Columbia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immediately demonstrated to the older craft on the river , she was to be reckoned with . Her spurts with the North America were among the exciting brushes of the period and she crowded the older boat to the rear , making the run to Hudson , where she belonged , in eight hours and a quarter . The Kosciusko and Telegraph were always pushing one another for the record . Many times they tried conclusions and when a race between the two was on , it mattered not if a score or more passengers were waiting at one of the announced landings , the boats rushed by , leaving the hapless people on the dock , so great was the rivalry between the two captains . The Telegraph eventually proved the better boat and kept the record until a newer vessel sent the old speeder to the rear . The rivalry for the speed record became so great between two of the boats , the Oregon , owned by George Law , and the Cornelius Vanderbilt , owned by " Commodore " Vanderbilt , then running on Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged between them , which took place on the Hudson River on June 1 , 1847 . The Vanderbilt was a new boat . The race started at the Battery and both boats got away at eleven o'clock , a great throng of people being on hand to witness the contest . For thirty miles up the river the boats kept side by side , but the Oregon passed the Vanderbilt as she approached the stake // boat off Ossining and was half a length ahead at that point . In passing the Vanderbilt , the Oregon was bumped by her rival and damaged her wheelhouse considerably . On the way down the river the Oregon 's coal gave out , but the captain and crew resorted to tactics that had been followed before , in the days of exciting steamboat racing . The woodwork of the berths , chairs , benches , furniture of staterooms and everything else that would burn was put under the boilers to keep up steam . She finished the race at the Battery about twelve hundred feet ahead of the Vanderbilt , having covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide against her going north and with her on the return . The owners of the Oregon got the $1,000 stake and possibly expended more than that restoring the joiner work on their boat . The Alida and the Hendrilc Hudson had a great race from New York to Albany in 1849 . The first named reached Albany at 2.55 P. M. , having left New York at 7.00 A. M. , made one landing and beat the Hudson by fifteen minutes , both boats having an ebb tide all the way up the river . Captain DeGroot of the Reindeer would never admit there was a boat on the river that could pass him and he was frequently called upon to prove it , which he did to the discomfiture of his rivals . The Henry Clay was designed to beat her , but never did . The New World , with her enormous piston stroke of fifteen feet // which has never been equaled , though fourteen feet strokes were not uncommon , was thought to be a match for the Reindeer , and she proved to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something went wrong with the machinery when he found the other boat was pulling away from him . The St. John wrested the laurels from the Vanderbilt in 1863 and in the same year the new day boat Chauncey Vibbard made Albany in seven and a half hours , which she cut down the year following to six hours and fortytwo minutes . Steamboat racing on the Hudson virtually came to an end in 1852 , when the Steamboat Inspection Bill , passed by Congress , became a law . It was well racing was made unlawful , for it had developed recklessness and a disregard for the safety and convenience of passengers . Then , too , bursting boilers were of too frequent occurrence and there was good reason , though we are apt to smile at their fears with our experience in new and improved mechanical devices ? for sensible people to prefer traveling on " safety barges " having the benefit of steam propulsion without sleeping above an overtaxed boiler . The fear of bursting boilers was the one uppermost in the minds of the early steamboat travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat owners met all objections : The steamboat New London was advertised to leave // that part of the pier opposite the Eagle Tavern , Albany , for New York , one afternoon at 4 o'clock . A prejudice existed at the time against iron boilers , which were thought to be unsafe . It was , therefore , advertised that the New London had a copper boiler , an overnight transformation said to have been accomplished by a liberal application of copper colored paint . The steamboats in their day tried to do what the telegraph does for the newspapers to-day . In 1829 we read that the President 's Message which was sent to Congress on Tuesday , December 8th , reached New York fifteen and one-half hours afterward and was rushed up the river on the steamer Albany and arrived at that city in time to be published on ' Thursday morning , which was an event considered to have been one of " unprecedented dispatch . " It will certainly pay you the next time you journey up the river to take note of the long low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the shore , at the point where the Palisades suddenly terminate as if cut down by some mighty hand . The narrow strip of land looks more like a breakwater than anything else , and close observation will show it is sadly in need of repair . It is now more of an obstruction to navigation than anything else , and should have been removed long ago . The place is Piermont and it is the " pier " that extends such a great distance out in the river . The // " mont " or " mount " is at the shore end of the pier and if you have a pair of marine glasses with you , on looking well up on the hillside you will find a large yellow building that was once a hotel . Both the pier and the hotel are the silent witnesses of the busy , hustling times that once marked the place , but now long since gone . Piermont was the eastern terminal in those days , of the Erie Railway and was the nearest possible point the road could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches down to the Hudson about two miles south of Piermont . About the last place you can note in New York State below Piermont is Snedens Landing , a point of interest , however , for General Cornwallis landed there with six thousand British troops in 1776 and marched on Fort Lee further down on the Palisades . When the Erie Railroad was built under a New York charter , New Jersey put up the bars against the new railway entering that State . It was the talk those days that the old Camden and Amboy road controlled the entire railroad situation in New Jersey . It was certainly a powerful combination , which has since become incorporated in the Pennsylvania Railroad system . At any rate , it was powerful enough to make the Erie get to New York by way of Piermont . This was the reason the long pier was built ; tracks laid upon it and the passenger trains run // out to a steamboat ferry landing . From this point all the passengers were carried to New York City by steamboats and the railroad attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Piermont and the city in the shortest time possible . The freight was lightered down the river . It can readily be imagined what a scene of busy activity the old pier must have been in times past , though one will look in vain for any signs of life there now , with the exception of a few manufactories that have located at the shore end of the pier . The Piermont branch of the Erie is still in existence , find freight cars are brought down the steep grades to the river level at that point for the benefit of local shippers . The old hotel on the hillside has been a school , a conservatory of music and a boarding-house since the busy days when it was a popular hostelry at which fashionable New Yorkers bound west stopped over night , so as to take the first morning trains , without being forced to leave the city at an inconveniently early hour on the Erie 's fast steamboat express ferry from the foot of Duane Street . CHAPTER IX DISASTERS OF RIVER TRAVEL ACCIDENTS have attended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boats have sunk , burned and been in collision on many occasions . Frequently there was an attendant loss of life . Never , however , has there been such a disaster as that of the burning . of the General Slocum , on the East River in broad daylight , June 15 , 1904 , when nine hundred and fifty-eight lives were lost and one hundred and seventyfive injured , or the more recent catastrophe of the Joy Liner Larchmont , on the Sound off Block Island , February 11 , 1907 . Then nearly two hundred souls perished in the icy waters , as the result of the collision between the steamer and the schooner Henry Knowlton . Possibly the nearness of the shores on either side of the river , the more careful supervision of the boats by the operating lines , the watchfulness of the captains or indeed sailor 's luck may account for the comparatively small loss that has attended the navigation // of the Hudson . From whatever cause the fact arises , it certainly is a matter of satisfaction to note the toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and number of passengers transported are taken into consideration . Still the Hudson is a treacherous river to navigate in a fog and at all times there are shoals and rocks for the pilots to avoid . It requires an expert at the wheel to take a boat through the apparently landlocked turns and reaches at the Ilighlands . Much has been accomplished in later years by the Federal and State Governments erecting range marks on the shores , building lighthouses on the most dangerous points and deepening the channel by dykes above New Baltimore . Many a boat has gone aground on the bar below Albany and remained a prisoner there for hours , an experience to which the river traveler of to-day is seldom subjected . The Clermont alone of the three earlier boats on the river , was continued long enough in the service as the North River to receive an honorable discharge by being " broken up . " Both the Car of Neptune and the Paragon sank , the latter in 1825 . The General Jackson on a trip from Peekskill to New York exploded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Commodore " Vanderbilt 's brother Jacob was her captain at the time . The North America became a wreck when moored // to her dock in Albany in the spring of 1839 . She was carried down by the breaking up of the ice in the Island Creek . No lives were lost . The steamboat Swallow , one of the most popular and speedy boats of her time , on her way down the river , in a snow squall , from Albany , on Monday evening , April 7 , 1845 , met with disaster . She was under command of Captain Squires and was known as a night boat . She left Albany in the evening and reached New York the next morning . When near Athens , which is nearly opposite from the city of Hudson , she struck a rock , took fire , broke in two and rapidly sank . There is little doubt but that she was racing with the Express and Rochester . The reporter of the Hudson Rural Repository who , with characteristic enterprise , was on the spot , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , April 7th , the steamboat Swallow , Captain A. H. Squires , was on her passage from Albany to New York , and when opposite this city , in the Athens channel , ran upon a little , rocky island , broke in two , and in a few minutes sank . The alarm was immediately spread in Athens , and a large number of citizens soon rallied to the scene of disaster , and happily succeeded in rescuing many lives . Soon after the steamboats Express and Rochester came down and promptly rendered what assistance was in their power , taking many passengers with them to New // York . The Swallow had on board a large number of passengers , but the exact loss of life is at present unknown the number lost proved to be about fifteen . The night was exceedingly dark , with a heavy gale , snow and rain , and very cold . Our citizens are yet busy about the wreck . " , The rocks on which the Swallow was wrecked made a little island formerly known as Noah 's Brig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs and lumber down the river . It derived that name , according to the " Ilistory of Columbia County , " from the following incident : " One night a large number of rafts were coming down the west channel , one of them being under the command of a man who was known among his comrades by his Christian name , Noah . ' As the rafts neared this point Noah espied in the dim light a dark object riding upon the waters , which he at once decided to be a brig under sail , and as soon as he had approached near enough he hailed it , Brig ahoy ! ' No response . Again , in stentorian tone , his hail rang out upon the night air , but still no attention was paid , and the mysterious craft kept unswervingly to its course . This exasperated Noah , and his third hail was Brig ahoy ! answer , or I 'll run you down ! ' and , as no reply was given , true to his word he did run down the island ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its character . Probably neither Noah 's brig nor his raft sustained serious injury , but // the poor Swallow met a more cruel fate . A large portion of the island has been taken away , and the rock material was used in constructing the embankments of the canal through the middle ground . " The place since the eventful wreck has always been called the Swallow Rocks . The author 's father , Ira Buckman , purchased the old wreck of the Swallow , hauled the material seven miles inland and from it built a fine two-story house at Valatia , N. Y. It is on the old Albany Post Road , is yet standing in a good state of preservation and is still known as the " Swallow House . " The Victory sank in 1845 . She had always belied her name and was a hoodoo from the first : she was built in 1828 and owned largely in Albany . Her engines were too powerful and she was always meeting with accidents . This same company built and put on their line the DeWitt Clinton which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never a success and many Albanians lost all they put into the scheme . The Empire was run into by the schooner Noah Brown in Newburgh Bay , May 18 , 1849 , and twentyfour lives were lost . The loss of the Henry Clay on July 28 , 1852 , was one of the notable and fatal disasters of the river . She had almost reached New York on her way from Albany when she was discovered to be on fire . Her captain headed her for the shore at Riverdale and ran her hard // aground , but unfortunately most of the passengers were at the stern , which was in deep water and imprisoned by the flames . There was a wild panic , the terror stricken men and women fighting for possession of the life preservers and struggling with one another even after landing in the water . Sixty lives were lost , including a number of well-known New Yorkers , among the number being Miss Hawthorne , a sister of Nathaniel Hawthorne , and the calamity cast a gloom over the entire city . The shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded for days with people seeking to recover the bodies of the dead . The Reindeer , one of the larger and popular boats , which bore Jenny Lind in triumph to Albany when making her successful trip through the country , met with disaster September 4 , 1852 . The boilers of the boat burst near Bristol , forty miles below Albany . Six persons were killed and twenty-five others died afterwards of their injuries . These two accidents , following so closely one after the other , resulted in a public agitation that secured the enactment of the Steamboat Inspection Bill of that year . Though the captain of the Clay and the owners insisted there had been no racing , the passengers claimed there had ; ? the coroner 's jury found she had been racing all the way down the river with the Armenia and the disaster was without doubt the result of the woodwork catching fire from the overheated boilers. // The New World sank off the Stuyvesant shore on July 4 , 1861 , on her way from New York to Albany . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . She was raised and repaired at New York and was used during the Civil War , then in progress , as a hospital ship , being stationed in the vicinity of West Point . Her engines were placed in a new night boat for the People 's Line , called the St. John . The Oregon was sunk in collision with the City of Boston , at New York , October 22 , 1863 , and in June , 1864 , the Berkshire burned near Hyde Park with loss of life . The Isaac Newton , on her up-river trip on the night of December 5 , 1863 , exploded her starboard boiler opposite Fort Washington Point , after which she caught . fire and was completely destroyed . Seventeen persons were scalded , nine of whom died . The Francis Skiddy , one of the four pipers with as many boilers , built for speed in 1851 , came to grief on her down trip November 5 , 1864 . She hit a rock near Staatsburg while trying to avoid a large tow and proved to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . Her engines were taken out and for the most part placed in the Dean Richmond , which was new in 1865 , and they are still doing duty in that boat . Though the Skiddy never fulfilled the expectations of her owners as a speeder , she , for a long period , accom82 Old Steamboat Days pushed what none of the present boats are called upon to do : she made a round trip between Albany and New York every twenty-four hours . The St. John burst one of her boilers October 29 , 1865 , a few miles below Albany , and fifteen lives were lost , most of them being passengers . She was repaired and ran for twenty years , one of the most popular boats on the river , finally being destroyed by fire while laid up in winter quarters at the foot of Canal street , New York , in February , 1885 . The St. John rammed and sank the Catskill several years ago off West Sixty-fifth street , New York , and the Onteora not long since ran high and dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without much damage . One of the latest serious accidents to befall the river boats was on October 13 , 1906 , when the Troy Line boat Saratoga ran down the Adirondack near Tivoli . The Saratoga was so badly injured she dropped one of her boilers in the river and it has never been recovered . The Adirondack had much of her forward work carried away , but continued to run for the balance of the season . Each boat lost a man . The Saratoga ended her career on the river then and there . The City of Troy was discovered to be on fire after leaving Yonkers on the evening of April 5 , 1907 . She had aboard about one hundred passengers and a valuable cargo of freight . Captain Briidcr and his crew // made a desperate effort to subdue the fire which originated in the galley in the hold , but without success , so he effected a landing at the Gould Dock at Ardsley . All the panic-stricken passengers were safely landed , but the entire cargo , including several horses , was lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lock , burned to the water 's edge and was a total loss . She was built in 1876 , but several times reconstructed . She was two hundred and eighty feet long , thirty-eight feet beam , and her engines were 1,600 horse power . CHAPTER X FLOATING TOWNS AMONG the most picturesque sights on the Hudson are its floating towns . No more fitting term can be used to designate the long lines of canal boats lashed together four and five abreast and strung out for nearly a half mile , being towed down the river , so slowly that the movement is hardly discernible . The tows , which are made up at the basin above Albany where the Erie Canal enters the Hudson , look very much like floating towns , presenting the regularity of blocks of buildings , with lanes of open water between , not unlike streets in appearance . These clusters of " canalers , " hay barges and ice boats , though of a motley appearance , are always interesting . Home life in its every phase can be noted , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His family is domiciled on the craft from the opening to the close of navigation , and the boat is often maintained as the home when in winter quarters . On one the captain 's wife may be seen washing // clothes just outside her cabin door and on another the entire wash hanging up to dry ; red flannel shirts of the men flutter in the breeze , and on the same lines is the finest of snowy under-linen of both male and female variety . Little shirts and " pettier " also indicate the presence of children , and if you watch for them you will find them on some of the boats , playing with children from the other craft in the tow or running over the decks with their dogs at such a rate , one wonders they do not fall overboard . Some of the cabin roofs are fitted up with gay canvas awnings , hammocks and swings . Bright hued geraniums and other flowers in boxes in front of the cabin windows add to the picture . Sometimes a group of men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant hour eating and listening to the lively music of a concertina or guitar , for it is while the boats are being slowly towed down or up the river , that the " canalers " have a rest and the opportunity to relieve the rather dull monotony of their lives , by these social amenities . Because these people of the canal boats live lives apart and different from others , do not imagine for a moment there is not to be found among them men and women who are quite the equal of the average men and women met with elsewhere . Especially was this the fact in the years that followed shortly after the opening of the Erie Canal . Many young men on the farms and in the mid86 Old Steamboat Days state towns through the Mohawk Valley , married and single , saw in the new waterway opportunities to make a fortune and to travel to the great cities . They invested in canal boats and became both owners and captains . They carried grain and products of all kinds to New York and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some men ran passenger packets on the canal , and the Red Bird and other lines carried many between Albany and Buffalo . Many of the boats , those carrying wheat especially ? for it was before the day of railroads with their huge grain elevators at the terminals ? were kept particularly clean and were provided with roomy cabins in the stern , wonderfully contrived for convenience , in which the captain , his wife and sometimes the children lived comfortably . The mules that towed the boats on the canal were quartered in a stable built in the bow of the boat . The owners of this great inland marine , that sprang into existence on the opening of the Erie Canal , had as many different ideas as to the naming of their boats as come to the minds of parents naming their first born . Some were fancy , some just homely family names after the owner 's wife or daughter ; others were those of heroes and even mythological gods and goddesses were not forgotten . It is on this account if you ever get near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to find the Gladiator of Spencerport bound // more firmly with two-inch hawsers to Elizabeth Jones of Fort Ann , than the marital ties of many couples bind them to-day . General George Washington is apt to be found keeping company with Polly , all the way down the river and if two late stragglers join the tow and are hitched on behind all the rest , it is like as not to prove to be Minerva and Jim enjoying , as it were , for a few hours , only too brief , a tote-d-tote by themselves . This towing of canal boats on the Hudson constitutes a large and profitable business in its own class . It is in the hands of regularly organized companies and the rates are now so thoroughly established that " cut-throating " is a thing of the past . It was not always so , for competition in the towing business was quite as fierce as it was in the freight and passenger business . The time was , when a canal boat owner could get a tow all the way from Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee when competition was not cutting all profit from the business was more likely to be fifteen . Some of the old-time companies engaged in the business was the Schuyler Towing Co. of Albany , the Austin Towing Co. , the Ronan Co. and the Swift Sure Towing Co. of New York . Most of the canal boats rendezvoused in New York at the basin at Coenties Slip , on the East River , and it is at this point that the up-river tows are still made up . // The steamers that pulled these immense tows up and down the river were for the most part old passenger boats , rebuilt and adapted for the purpose by the removal of most of their upper works , saloons and staterooms . The Vanderbilt , Niagara , Norwich , Alida , Cayuga , Syracuse , Connecticut and many others have become tow boats , and if you have ever seen an old cattle boat , the John Stevens , knocking about the river , loaded with livestock for the abattoirs , you will have recognized in many of her lines those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It required nearly a week for one of these tows to make the trip down the river , the progress was so slow . Generally sixty to eighty boats made up a good sized tow , but Capt . Harvey Temple went up the river one time , with a broom on the flagstaff of the old Connecticut , and pulling one hundred and eight canal boats behind her , which made a new record in the size of towing fleets , and so far as the author is informed , still is the largest . These flotillas of canal boats , not so large now as in the former days , are all witnesses of the great importance of the vast system of inland waterways which helped to make undisputed New York 's title to being the Empire State . It has nearly one thousand miles of canals within its borders , the construction and maintenance of which has cost upward of a hundred million dollars . // Of these the Erie Canal , three hundred and sixty-one miles in length , is by far the most important , connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next in importance is the Champlain Canal and Glens Falls Feeder which connects the Hudson with Lake Champlain . These and the other canals have in the past played a great part in the development of the State . The cities on the line of the Erie Canal ? Schenectady , Amsterdam , Utica , Rome , Little Falls , Syracuse and Rochester ? owe much to the waterway that brought commerce to their doors and placed them in ready communication with the rest of the country . Call to mind if you can the many towns in the center of the State , far from the waters of the lakes , rivers or ocean , which have an aqueous termination or suggestiveness in their names and you will realize in a small degree the importance of what the great canal system meant to places that would have been to-day little more than straggling hamlets on dusty country cross roads . With the ocean and the Great Lakes many miles distant you will find in inland New York , Lockport , Gasport , Middleport , Shelby Basin , Eagle Harbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Port Gilson , Weedsport , Port Byron and other " ports , " all witnesses to the developing power of the canal system of the State . The work of building the Erie Canal was begun // under an act of the Legislature , July 4 , 1817 , at Rome , in the presence of Gov . De Witt Clinton , through whose earnest endeavors , exerted at all times and in the face of much opposition , the great improvement was urged to a successful completion . The Governor 's opponents always referred to the vast undertaking in those days as " Clinton 's Big Ditch . " The plans provided for a canal forty feet wide at the top , eighteen feet at the bottom , with a depth of at least four feet of water , which was calculated to accommodate boats of one hundred tons burden . The work had progressed so far that on October 22 , 1819 , the first boat was able to make the trip from Rome to Utica with Governor Clinton , Chancellor Livingston and other distinguished men aboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after eight years of prodigious labor , that the Erie and Champlain Canals were opened and the Hudson was the scene of such a maritime pageant that the people of that period had never dreamed of . On the date named a flotilla of canal boats , all new and gaily decorated , started from Buffalo , on Lake Erie , for New York City . The news of the departure was communicated to the latter city by the booming of cannon located along the line and the signal thus traveled across the entire State and down the Hudson in one hour and twenty minutes . When the boats reached Albany they were received by a great throng // of people , Governor Clinton , the Canal Commissioners and all the State officials . There never was such a ringing of bells and booming of cannon in the place before . The people who had made the trip from Buffalo were escorted to the capitol in a triumphal procession and welcomed by Mayor Hone , of New York City , on behalf of the people of the metropolis . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canal boat packets , convoyed by the Chancellor Livingston , with Governor Clinton and distinguished guests on board the Young Lion of the West and the Seneca Chief , reached New York and were welcomed by the New York Common Council , which met the fleet on board the steamboat Washington . Every vessel in the harbor was gaily decorated with flags , the church bells rang and cannon saluted as the naval procession rounded the Battery and sailed up the East River as far as the Brooklyn Navy Yard . There other vessels joined the fleet , which turned and sailed to Sandy Hook where the schooner Dolphin had been anchored . Here took place the most unique feature of the celebration . As the boats circled round the schooner Governor Clinton poured a keg of the fresh water of Lake Erie into the salt water of the Atlantic and the marriage of the Great Lakes and the ocean was announced as having been duly solemnized . As another token of what the great improvement meant to the civilized world Dr. Samuel L. Mitchell poured into // the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rhine , Danube , Amazon , La Plata , Orinoco , Ganges , Indus , Gambia , Nile , Mississippi and Columbia Rivers . On returning to the city the distinguished State officials were met at the Battery with a procession nearly four miles long , which marched through the principal streets . At night there was a great display of fireworks , the city was brilliantly illuminated and altogether it was the greatest celebration old New York had ever had up to that time . The Erie Canal having demonstrated its great usefulness to the State was enlarged in 1854 to seventy feet at the surface , fifty-six at the bottom , with a depth of seven feet . At the present time a third enlargement and improvement is being made by straightening the course so as to afford a larger capacity to float barges of one thousand tons burden . The people carried the proposition to spend one hundred and one million dollars on the last enlargement , by a large majority at a general election , though many of the best informed maintain the usefulness of canals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad transportation has rendered them obsolete . The people , however , have generally favored maintaining the canals , as the most effectual check they could impose on railroad monopolies . , CHAPTER XI BARGE TRAVEL ON THE RIVER ANOTHER feature of river life in the early days of steam navigation was the barges that carried passengers up and down the Hudson . These generally hailed from some of the small towns on the upper river that could not supply traffic enough to support a steamboat service . At first the barge was , however , conceived to afford passengers the means of travel by steam without being subjected to the dangers of being upon a steamboat , with the attendant possibilities of bursting boilers and other fearful accidents from breaking machinery . The first to appear were the Lady Clinton and the Lady Van Rensselaer and they were called " safety barges . " The barges were boats with a main and upper deck almost as long and commodious as a steamer . The main deck was fitted up with a cabin , extending in some instances the whole length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " state " or sleeping rooms arranged along on either side . Windows looked out on // the water and doorways opened in on the cabin . There was generally a long table in the saloon at which meals were served for fifty cents each to the passengers . The captain of the barge always sat at the head of the table and helped make the meal hour quite an event of the trip . These barges were towed by one of the regular passenger boats up to their home town , where they would be dropped . The " safety barges " were quite popular in their day , for they carried many passengers who were enthusiastic over the pleasure derived from a trip on the water on boats of this character . Thomas L. McKcnney , who was attached to the Department of the Interior at Washington and one of the Commissioners who with Lewis Cass negotiated the treaty with the Northwest Indians , made a barge journey up the Hudson in June , 1826 , on his way to the Great Lakes . He has left us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trip , the reader will surely pardon a somewhat longer quotation than usual : " I left New York , as it was my intention to do , in the Lady Clinton , yesterday morning , at nine o'clock . It was the first time I had ever seen one of these barges . I must say I was struck with the admirable invention , and with the extent and variety and perfection of the accommodations . You have seen steamboats . This barge , in all respects except breadth of beam and // machinery , resembles the finest you ever did see . It took me the first half hour after getting on board to walk through this floating palace . It certainly exceeds anything I have ever yet seen in all that enters into the composition of safety and comfort . Indeed there is a splendor too in the ornamental parts which is very striking and as if the inventive genius of the owners was apprehensive that the ear might grow jealous of the eye that organ had been provided for also , with a fine band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this barge , by saying her buoyancy and great elevation above the surface of the water rendered her liable to turn over . But I doubt whether if she or her sister , the Lady Van Rensselaer , were to glide up and down the North River for a century such an occurrence would happen . Were they visitants of the sea the swells of the ocean might rock them over , but never in my opinion will the North River roll so as to occasion such a disaster . " This beautiful barge is towed by the Commerce , an unusually fine steamboat , and of great power . The connection is by means of two pieces of timber some six feet long . They are fastened to either side of the bow of the barge , and uniting in the form of a pair of compasses , the upper or joint part receives a bolt of iron which rises out of the stern of the Commerce . The connection parts work on swivels , hence none of the motion of the steamboat is communicated to the // barge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movable platform some two and a half feet wide , with hand rails on either side . Openings are made in the stern of the Commerce and in the bow of the barge in which the platform rests . . . " Some of the advantages which the barge possesses over the steamboat are , in the security from the effects of a bursted boiler ? freedom from the heat and steam and from the smell of grease and the kitchen , and from the jar occasioned by the machinery and the enlarged accommodations ? the whole being set apart for eating and sleeping and walking . The cabin in which we dined is below and is the same in which the gentlemen sleep ; and one hundred and eighty persons can sit down at once and each have elbow room sufficient for all the purposes of figuring with the knife and fork in all the graces of which these two instruments are susceptible . At the termination of this immense dining apartment and towards the bow is a bar , most sumptuously supplied with all that can be desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire sides of this vast room ; they are curtained in such way as to afford retirement in dressing and undressing ; there being brass rods on which curtains are projected and these are thrown out at night . In the day the curtains hang close to the berths as is usual . Next above this are the ladies ' cabin and apartments ? staterooms rather ? furnished in the most splendid style , // and in which a lady has all the retirement and comfort which the delicacy and tenderness of her sex requires . " Over the bar and upon this middle apartment or tier is an apartment where the gentlemen dress , shave and read . All around this second story , it being , I should judge , not over two-thirds the width of the boat , and resting on the middle deck , is a fine walk with settees where you can sit when you please and lounge . Then comes , and over all , the grand promenade , with an awning when the sun or rain requires it over the whole . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her best hotels a better dinner than we sat down to yesterday ; nor in a better style of preparation . I suppose our company numbered one hundred . The captain is highly qualified , no less by his masterly knowledge of his duty than by his gentlemanly courtesy , for so splendid a charge ; and the attendants appeared to be the best . Taken altogether I question whether the world ever witnessed anything so perfect in all that relates to the accommodation and comfort and pleasure of passengers . Evidently Mr. McKenney enjoyed his barge trip up the Hudson , and it is quite likely that he traveled on a pass . Some of the passenger barges that plied for years on the river were the Newburgh , Susquehanna and Charles Spear . Their towing steamer was the Highlander owned by the Powell family , which gave the Hudson // two well-known steamers , the Thomas and Mary Powell . The first named , however , never equaled the latter in point of speed . The firm of T. &; J. Powell of Newburgh ran a line of sloops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from that beginning the present daily evening steamboat service to that city came eventually into existence , the owners of the Homer Ramsdell Line ( now included in the Central Hudson Co. ) being grandsons of Thomas Powell . It is believed the propeller type of river boat was especially built to make it more feasible to tow these barges , as the side wheel boats made it very noisy , the revolving paddles splashing the water at the side of the barges all night long . With the propeller wheel at the stern this difficulty , as well as much of the motion , was overcome . Traveling by barge was not always the height of enjoyment and comfort described by the enthusiastic traveler just quoted . Progress was slow and the boats latterly carried a varied cargo of farm products , baled hay and live stock . Calves and lambs bound for the city slaughter houses , and horses for the New York street car lines ? the Third Avenue line had three thousand horses in its stables alone ? frequently made such a chorus of " bahing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep in the " stateroom " in the " grand saloon " on the upper deck . Most , if not all the passenger barges have been taken // from the river , and after being altered , first , to make excursion boats for Sunday school and social club picnics around the cities , finally became hay boats to carry that staple product of the Hudson Valley farmers to the New York market . Doubtless there are grandfathers and grandmothers who may read this , who will be able to call to mind rare midsummer holidays spent aboard the " elegant and commodious barges " William Myers , Walter Sands or the Caledonia , in dancing and merry-making , as they were slowly towed to some popular picnic ground near the great city . Possibly the best conception of what the old passenger barges were like may be found in the floating hospital of St. John 's Guild , the Helen C. Juilliard , which in the summer months can be seen almost daily being towed up the river or down the bay crowded with mothers and babies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the sunshine and breathe the fresh air . The boat is provided with every accommodation in the way of cabin accessories , having been built especially for the purpose . The floating hospital is considered one of the most beneficent charities of the great city . CHAPTER XII THE STEAMBOATS OF TO-DAY THERE is none of the old time competition for the passenger traffic on the river to-day . It has been adjusted between the several lines . Indeed some kind of a traffic arrangement is made between the boats and railroads . The character of the boats and the accommodations have been improved and most all the craft now operating in the passenger service are new , presenting every luxury possible to secure in boat travel . The principal steamboat companies operating on the river at present are the People 's Line night boats to Albany , the Day Line to Albany , the Citizens ' Line to Troy , the Catskill Night Line , the Hudson Night Line , the Newburgh Night Line and the Central Hudson Company 's Lines to several of the cities on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comfort and safety , for the days of steamboat racing are past and the cheap rate competition , which overcrowded the boats , exists no longer . To-day the journey up and down the // river is made on modern boats , the passengers entertained with delightful music from stringed orchestras and at night with searchlight exhibitions . These are indeed beautiful , the cultivated hillsides , handsome villas of the wealthy and rugged grandeur of the rocky Highlands being brought out in a series of wonderful pictures as the boats , twinkling with a thousand electric lights of their own , move slowly along the river . It is not only the passengers that enjoy these nightly illuminations of unusual beauty . The dwellers on the river banks know just when to expect them and almost set their clocks , say their prayers and go to bed after the night boat has passed . Some of the newer boats now in service on the river are the Homer Ramsdell , the Newburgh , the Onteora , the Albany , New York and Hendrick Hudson , of the Day Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night Line to Albany . Of these the Hudson and Morse are the newest and are of a type so distinctly in advance of the others , an extended note of them will be of interest . The Hendrick Hudson is the second steamer of that name that has plied the river . They were probably named Hendrick instead of Henry because of some confusion arising from the English discoverer of the river having come to this country in a Dutch vessel and under the Dutch flag . From whatever cause it arises , it is the fact that half of the time Hudson is referred // to as Hendrick and it no doubt is a more picturesque rendering of the name . The Hendrick Hudson was built on the banks of the Hudson at Newburgh and launched March 31 , 1906 . She is three hundred and ninety feet long , forty-three feet beam and eighty-two feet over the guards . She draws but eight feet of water . Her hull is of steel divided into seven water-tight compartments , with two collision bulkheads . She has five decks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which she can carry five thousand , no space being reserved for freight . The engine is of the three cylinder compound variety of five thousand five hundred horse power with a seven foot stroke . The paddle wheels are twenty-four feet in diameter , of the feathering type , on a shaft twentytwo inches in diameter , of open hearth carbon steel . One of the new features of this boat is the fact that the crank shaft is below the main deck line , made possible by the small diameter of the paddle wheels , but adding greatly to the comfort and convenience of the passengers . No sacrifice of speed has been made by this improvement as the Hudson can make twenty-three miles an hour easily . The boat is magnificently furnished in hard woods and handsomely decorated . The dining room on the main deck aft and surrounded with large plate glass windows , is finished in mahogany , as are the saloons on the upper decks . The Steamboats of To-day 10:3 A grand staircase leads to a large observation room on the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the forward saloon is a suspended band stand and so situated that it is estimated the concerts given by the orchestra , which are a great feature on the boats of this line , can be heard by at least three thousand seated passengers . There are a number of private drawing rooms furnished in Louis XVI , Japanese , French-Empire , Dutch and Colonial styles and a large writing room in polished teakwood . Everywhere throughout the boat are large plate glass windows , affording passengers an opportunity to view the beautiful scenery of the river . She is steered by steam , has her own electric light equipment and in short an attempt has been made to supply every comfort and convenience that the most exacting passengers could desire . A new Day Line boat , companion to the Hudson , is about to be laid down on the ways in Marvel 's Yards , at Newburgh , and is to be finished in time for the summer traffic in 1909 . She will be named the Robert Fulton . The boat will be 415 feet long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of the pilot house . The engines will be 6,500 horse power and the boat will be licensed to carry 6,000 passengers . The C. W. Morse is one of the longest side wheel steamers afloat . She is four hundred and twenty-seven feet over all , fifty feet six inches beam , but ninety feet // over guards . The load draft is but nine feet . The hull is of steel , divided in eight water-tight compartments with collision bulkheads . She has four steel masts . On the lower deck are accommodations for fireman and deckhands and a saloon with berths for passengers , besides room for the boilers and dynamos for supplying two thousand five hundred electric lights all through the boat and the thirty-six inch search light on the pilot house . The kitchens , barrooms and pantries are also on this deck . The main deck forward is reserved for freight , but aft , the entire room is a handsomely fitted up lobby and magnificently appointed dining room , in richly carved mahogany woodwork and lighted with two hundred and twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room will seat three hundred comfortably . The main staircase leads from the lobby to the grand saloon , which is twenty-eight feet high with a domed ceiling in white and gold and surrounded with two galleries having highly ornamented guard rails of mahogany and bronze . Staterooms with brass bedsteads and parlors de luxe with bath rooms and toilets can be entered from the saloon direct or communicating corridors , richly carpeted . There is also a passenger elevator on the boat . In all there are four hundred and fifty of these sleeping apartments furnished in varying degrees of elegance . She is licensed to carry two thousand passengers . // The boat is four stories , or decks , high and the floor of the pilot house is forty feet above water level . She is steered by steam and every movement of the vessel can be directed from the pilot house . The engines , which are of the vertical type , are four thousand five hundred horse power , cylinder eighty-one inches in diameter , twelve foot stroke , and the boilers are four in number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diameter and there are two smokestacks . The paddle wheels are of the feathering type variety , thirty feet in diameter , and the paddle wheel shaft is twenty-four inches in diameter . It was a clever piece of marine engineering to produce so huge a steamer , when the draught of the boat was restricted to nine feet loaded on account of the shallow water near Albany , but the designer appears to have wrestled most successfully with the difficult problem with which he had to contend . Another type of modern steamboat , differing entirely from those described , is the Asbury Park . She is of the propeller type . Though not designed especially for the Hudson , she leaves daily from the North River side of the city of New York for Sandy Hook and is frequently seen by the travelers on the river . The Sandy Hook route is operated by the Central Railroad of New Jersey and is for the special benefit of the patrons of the shore resorts on the Jersey coast . All of the boats of this line , the Monmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latest addition to the fleet , the Asbury Park , built by the Cramps and put on in 1903 , is the fastest on the line . She is three hundred and seven feet long , forty-two feet beam and fifty-one feet over her guards . The hull is steel with six water-tight compartments , and forward and aft there are collision bulkheads . She draws but eleven feet of water on account of the shoals inside the Hook . Her appointments for the accommodation of passengers ? she is licensed to carry two thousand one hundred and fifty-nine ? are of the most complete character . Her grand saloon , one hundred and ninety-five feet long , is finished in quartered oak , and large plate plass windows afford the traveler most delightful views of the shipping in river and bay . There are nineteen staterooms and four drawing rooms are also provided . She has two engines of the four cylinder , triple type , of six thousand horse power and the boat has developed a speed of twenty and five one-hundredths knots . This means she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hook , a distance of eighteen miles , in one hour and five minutes with the regularity of a railroad time-table . Indeed she runs in close connection with railroad trains that carry the passengers from the landing point to Sea Girt , Long Branch , Ocean Grove and other popular resorts . Two new boats , one for the People 's Line and the other for the Citizen 's Line to be built on the // general lines of the Morse , have been contracted for , both of which will be ready for the summer season of 1908 . They will have steel hulls , and the larger one of the two , will be four hundred and forty feet long having over five hundred staterooms and accommodations for two thousand passengers . Every convenience will be provided and they are expected to be the most luxurious river craft afloat . The name of the new People 's Line boat will be the Princeton and the Citizen 's Line new boat will be named the Knickerbocker repeating the name of a popular steamer in the passenger service on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Henry Hudson and Robert Fulton will be borne in large letters on the pages of history , so long as the river that was the scene of their great achievements finds its way to the sea . The Tercentennial of Hudson 's discovery and the Centennial of Fulton 's successful application of steam to navigation will furnish opportunities , however , for New York to erect such memorials as will suitably honor the memories of the two men . It is indeed strange that neither has heretofore been honored in any way , unless an exception is noted on account of the panel in the Astor bronze doors in Trinity Church , which represents Hudson on the deck of the Half Moon off Manhattan Island , and the tablet on Fulton 's grave . Two important committees are at work on the proposition and they include in their membership , some of the best known men in the country . The scheme to suitably celebrate the Tercentennial of Hudson 's discovery took its first tangible shape on // February 15 , 1905 , when Mr. Robert Roosevelt , uncle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him and the subject was discussed . The attendants at that conference represented most of the patriotic and historical societies of the city of New York . It was determined to secure the creation of a commission under act of the Legislature to carry out the object of the conference . This was done and December 5 , 1905 , the Hudson Tercentenary Joint Committee was duly organized at the New York City Hall . The New York Board of Trade and Transportation , and others , acting quite independently , having determined that some celebration should mark the Centenary of Steam Navigation , on July 13 , 1905 , organized the Robert Fulton Memorial Association with Gen. Fred D. Grant as president , who has since been succeeded by Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt , a greatgrandson of the " Commodore " who broke the river monopoly . It did not take long after these two separate movements had been inaugurated , for those at the head of each to appreciate the fact there was such a general tendency of scope and purpose as to suggest a consolidation of endeavor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A special legislative act , Chapter 325 of the Laws of 1906 , was passed with a view of co-ordinating the two propositions ; General // Stewart L. Woodford , ex-United States Minister to Spain , has been elected president of the joint commission and the success of the celebration is assured . It is the purpose of the combined associations to cause suitable memorials to be erected to Hudson and Fulton , to be followed with a joint celebration on the waters of the Hudson that will bring together , possibly , the greatest number and finest types of steam craft ever assembled . The entire week beginning September Nth , 1909 , will be given over to land and water parades and commemorative exercises in the schools and by the Historical Societies . The Hudson Memorial Committee has already advanced its plans in a large measure toward completion . These provide for an imposing Hudson Memorial Bridge to span Spuyten Duyvil Creek , connecting the Boulevard system of Manhattan Island with the parkways of Westchester County . There has already been appropriated $1,000,000 by the City of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contemplated improvement is likely to approximate $5,000,000 . The Memorial Bridge , as planned , is to span the Spuyten Duyvil Creek at a height of one hundred and seventy feet . The central steel span of the bridge will be eight hundred and twenty-five feet in length , the largest in the world with a single exception , that being the steel arch bridge over the gorge at Niagara , which // is fifteen feet longer . From abutment to abutment the length of the bridge will be two thousand five hundred feet . The stone viaduct approaches are to be carried on a series of masonry arches . The structure will be one hundred feet wide , affording two sidewalks , each eighteen feet wide , and a central roadway of sixty feet . No attempt will be made at elaborate decoration on the structure itself . Its grace of outline and massiveness are relied upon to produce an appreciation of its solidity and impressiveness , but parklike effects at the approaches will be introduced and a knoll some thirtyfive feet in height at the southern end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some suitable monument to Hudson . The city is not expected , in the plans of the commission , to defray the cost of this memorial as it is believed that a popular subscription will produce sufficient funds to insure its erection by the time the bridge has been constructed and opened for the use of the public . The views that will be obtained from the bridge when completed will be among the finest that can be secured anywhere near the great city . Immediately below will be the Harlem River and the ship canal to the east . To the west will lie the Hudson , showing a stretch of water several miles in length , teeming with river craft , and beyond , the Palisades on the New Jersey shore . To the north the eye will take in the heights above Riverdale and the wooded hills of Van Cortlandt Park , and // to the south , extended views of what is rapidly becoming the greatest city of the world . The panorama that will spread in every direction before the visitors to the Memorial Bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of those who shall live to see the work successfully completed . The Fulton Monument Association is planning to erect a Monumental Water Gate on the Hudson River shore front at West 114th and 116th streets and Riverside Drive , harmonizing and adding to the dignity and beauty of the tomb of General Grant and the buildings of Columbia University that crown the hillside at that point . Several well-known architects are now at work on the plan for this Monumental Water Gate , but the design that will be finally selected has not as yet been determined . Every endeavor will be made , however , to decide upon the plan in time to put the corner stone of the monument in place on November 14 , 1907 , with appropriate ceremonies . The date named is the birthday of Robert Fulton and the year marks the first century of the successful application of steam to navigation . It is the purpose in building the Water Gate not only to honor the genius of Fulton , but at the same time to provide a suitable landing place for distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind has yet been provided . The beautiful park at the Battery might well have been reserved for such purposes instead of having been given over to elevated // railroad structures , landing places for emigrants , ferry slips and docks for excursion steamers . A third proposition taking tangible shape and form is the establishment of a Iludson-Fulton Memorial Park at Verplancks Point , forty miles up the river and directly opposite historic Stony Point , which has already been secured for a Memorial Park . It is proposed to locate on Verplaneks Point some form of museum and exhibition that will foster a lively appreciation of all the points of interest that are associated with the history and achievements on the river . The State of New York has already been asked to pass a law appropriating $125,000 for this purpose . The proposed park is to include many historical points and will do much to preserve the scenic beauties of the river . The site of Fort Fayette and the remains of a shore battery that did service in the Revolution , the old Iing 's ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , the site of Washington 's headquarters and the camp ground of the allied American and French troops , under Washington and Rochambeau , in 1782 , are all included in the area which it is sought to acquire . Hudson anchored the Half Moon on his trip up the river in 1609 off the shore of Verplaneks Point ; so there will be added interest to the Memorial Park on that account . CHAPTER XIV HENRY HUDSON 'S RIVER WHEN Henry Hudson , an Englishman commanding a Dutch vessel and crew , sailed up the Hudson , he thought he was going to China . Like Columbus and all the early navigators to the New World , he was in quest of the same fabled Northwest Passage . This was to make a short cut to India and the Orient and had been sought for years , but which will never be realized until Uncle Sam finishes the Panama Canal . Hudson had made two previous trips under English auspices and failed . The third attempt was made under the Dutch flag and in a vessel , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon . The beautiful Bay of New York was first entered by Hudson , who rounded Sandy Hook August 3 , 1609 , and kept on his course to the north past what is now Manhattan Island and up what is now the Hudson River . Here surely was a great stream of water , deep enough // to indicate a strait , with the walls of the Palisades suggesting the gigantic erosions of the glacial age , witnesses of the mighty forces of ice and water that swept down from the northward and made the Hudson Valley what it is . Is there any wonder Hudson and his crew rejoiced as they sailed northward , satisfied that the mariner 's goal for hundreds of years , the Northwest Passage , had at last been found ? Every mile of the way seemed to add to the certainty . The broad expanse of water three and a half miles wide at Tarrytown , now the Tappan Zee ( Sea ) , the still wider Haverstraw Bay all hastened the mariner and his men to the open ocean they believed must lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony 's Nose , clothed with their primeval forests , looking like veritable headland capes guarding the secrets of the undiscovered country and waters beyond . What a journey of mysterious enchantment and of unexpected developments this first trip of the half Moon up the Hudson must have afforded ! It was not until Hudson began to detect the shoaling water near the site of the present city of Hudson , his dreams of the Northwest Passage began to fade and the fact he was rapidly approaching the head of a great river dawned upon him . He pushed on , however , to just below where Albany , the capital of the State , now stands on the western bank and from that point sent // small boats still further up the river to ascertain if there was any way out . They returned with the disappointing statement that the stream became rapidly shallow and that they would have to return to the sea , one hundred and fifty miles away at the mouth of the river they had been exploring for so many days . Some of Hudson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went up the Mohawk , for to-day there is a hamlet midway on the peninsula made by the two rivers , called Half Moon , which , tradition says , is so called because some of the first explorers from the little Dutch vessel visited the place when endeavoring to ascertain the limitations of Henry Hudson 's great discovery . The commander of the Half Moon spent several days in visiting the friendly Indians living on the shores . After retracing his voyage and having an unfortunate fight with some Indians , he again stood out to sea on October 4th , and never returned to the beautiful river he had discovered , which was to be known by his name for all time and preserve for him a place in American history . Hudson kept a journal of the many points he had noticed about his discovery . He called it the Great River and also the River of the Mountains . Some of his old crew returned the following year and soon the Dutch began to settle on Manhattan Island . They called it the River Mauritus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named the North River to distinguish it from the South or Delaware River , but it came to be called , and will always be known as the Hudson , after the man who located it on the map of the New World . An unkind fate appears to have followed Hudson to the close of his life . His crew mutinied on the return voyage and when he reached Dartmouth , England , in November , the Government detained both him and his ship on the pretext that an Englishman had no right to be in the employ of foreign nations , making discoveries that would not redound to the credit of England . She paid but little attention , however , to the Dutchman 's colony at New Amsterdam until years afterward , when the importance of the river and the settlement on Manhattan Island had become manifest . Hudson was not permitted to return to Holland and the crew of the Half Moon was not allowed to carry the news of the discovery to those who had sent her on her voyage , until the following July . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his last voyage , in the Discoverie , and this time in the employ of the Muscovy Company . He was still seeking the Northwest Passage when he entered the great sheet of water surrounded by desolate shores , which still bears the name of its discoverer , Hudson 's Bay . But the crew mutinied and Hudson , his son and seven men were put into a small boat and // told to shift for themselves . Undoubtedly the great navigator and his companions met an unmerited fate on the stormy waters of the bay , for they were never heard of again . The people in every land love their rivers . In some countries they are sacred . In others they bring fertility and wealth to the lovely valleys through which they flow . Their praises are sung in the poetry of the people and told of in story . When , as is often the case , they form the boundaries between foreign States , nations have plunged into war in order that the free passage of these great natural waterways might be maintained . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that which sweeps its majestic course from the forests of the Adirondacks , past the cities that line its shores , through the rocky Highlands and by the parapetted Palisades , until it mingles its waters with those of the bay in front of the great metropolis , the very gateway through which by far the largest influx of the wealth of the nation , namely , its people , have reached the New World . A river three hundred and twenty miles in length , one-half of which is open to unobstructed navigation by sail and steam for the larger boats , is a great asset in the building of a state . The Hudson has had much to do with making New York the Empire // State and the city at its outlet the metropolis of the country . From the first the Hudson played a most important part in the colonization of America . When the young colonies had grown strong and asserted their freedom and the War of Independence was on , with what solicitous care did Washington and his generals fight to maintain the Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keeping Burgoyne 's forces in the north from making any coalition with those in the south , under Howe and Clinton . The British commanders also realized the advantage of the control of the Hudson and planned to secure it . Every vantage point along the Hudson was fortified by the Americans . Fort Washington on Manhattan Island and Fort Lee opposite , Stony Point and its fortifications , Fort Montgomery and the redoubts at various places along the shore , make the river one of rare historical interest . It was on the Hudson the patriots built their fire rafts , to float down on the British ships and it was at West Point the great chain was stretched across the stream , to obstruct any passage of the river the enemy might attempt to make . The surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga after defeats in two battles at Bemis Heights in 1777 and the recapture of Stony and Verplancks Points in 1779 , from the British , only made the enemy more determined than ever to control the river and led up to that base    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
