txt the Public Service Commission late yesterday a letter embodying the outline of the Interbarough 's proposed plan of subway extension , which is said to involve the expenditure , of $30,000,000 of private capital and $1,000 ( 100 of the city 's money . In its briefest terms the plan contemplates a west side two-track express subway from Times Square to the Battery , an east side express subway up Lexington Avenue from the Grand Central Station to connect with the present Lenox Avenue branch at 149th Street , third tracks on the Second and Third Avenue elevated lines , and the extension of the stations in the present Subway so as to accommodate ten-car express trains and six-car locals . No details either as to the financing of the engineering and operating features of the Interborough 's undertaking accompanied the letter or were made public by the representatives of the Interborough last night . The reply to questions in regard to these details was that they had not yet been worked out . The maps filed with the commission are substantially identical with those involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to build , with the city 's money , the extensions now proposed on condition that the Rapid Transit Commission grant the privilege of third tracking the Second and Third Avenue elevated lines . For the proposed new subway lines the Interborough wants the same length of franchise as that of the present Subway , which is a fifty-year term , with a twentyfive-year extension , The third track franchises on the elevated would be perpetual . like the existing elevated Iran- ' chiles . The letter of Mr. Shouts makes it plain that the proposition is one to be accepted or rejected in its entirety , which makes it almost an exact duplicate of the recommendation of the special committee appointed by the Chamber of Commerce for the immediate relief of the city 's traction needs . Proposal Favored . Chairman William R. Willcox of the Public Service Commission expressed his gratification- at-the receipt of three proposals for subways within twenty days , and said it looked as though daylight were ahead . Beyond that he did not care to discuss the proposals . It is understood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subway extension plan from Thirtythird Street and Sixth Avenue to the Grand Central Station , and is likely to act on that first of the three , particularly as it is not contingent upon obtaining any changes in existing legislation . Then the plan , if granted , as is considered likely , will be put up to the Board of Estimate , and the ' Wilgus and the Interborough propositions wril be taken up in due time . One phase of the Interborough proposal apparently runs counter to what has been understood to be the opinion of the Public Service Commission , and that is the suggestion that at present there shall be but two tracks on the new west side and east side subways south and north from Fortysecond Street . The letter of Mr. Shonts indicates that provision will be made for further tracks when accommodation for local service is justified by traffic conditions , but the rapid increase of traffic on the present Subway is believed by several of the members of the Public Service Commission to demand more than two additional tracks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the letter of Mr. Shonts : March 10 , 109 . Dear Sir : Under date of Feb. 6. 1905 , I wrote you that this company was " prepared to begin active construction work in conjunction with your commission and add to same as our financial condition would permit . " Since that time we have devoted a great deal of attention to the study of the best means of Improving rapid transit facilities in Manhattan and the Bronx with a view of not only meeting immediate needs , but providing for the future . We are now prepared , upon proper terms , to undertake the following construction : First  --  The extension , at our own expense , of the city 's existing Subway system by the construction of a two-track express Subway north from Forty-second Street under Lexington Avenue to a terminus in the Bronx , and by the construction of a two-track west side express Subway from Forty-second Street to the Battery , ( with provision , in each case , for the construction of additional tracks for local service when Justified by traffic conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subways extending from the Battery to the Bronx ; one upon the east side and the other on the west side of the city , with a connecting subway on Forty-second Street . It is estimated that these extensions can be completed within four years . In order that we may raise private . capital , and inasmuch as it will be necessity to provide for the amortization of the entire cost of the extensions within the period of the operating lease , it will be necessary that the extensions be made under an operating lease from the city for substantially the same terms as that under which the existing Subway is being operated . Under such a contract the city would be the owner of the entire Subway system from the outset and would , come into possession upon the expiration of the term of the existing contract . Third Tracks on Elevated Lines . Second  --  The construction of a. third track on both the Second Avenue and Third Ave .. nue elevated lines . This improvement will furnish the earliest possible relief to . the Bronx , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be necessary that these additional tracks should be built under a franchise similar to that under which the existing elevated tracks were built . Third  --  The lengthening of the platforms jp the existing Subway stations so as to permit the operation of six-car trains on the local tracks and ten-ear trains on the express tracks . This improvement will increase the capacity of the existing Subway by over 25 per cent , and can be completed within ten months . It should be made as an extra under the existing Subway contract . Except in the case of the cost ( less than $1,000,000 ) of the lengthenting of the stations of the existing Subway all of the improvements above outlined . eetimated'to cost 550,000,000 , would be made without resorting to the funds or credit of the city . We are confident that we can obtain the necessary capital to carry out the foregoing improvements lf ' undertaken as an entirety and the laws are so modified as to permit your commission and the city authorities to enter into the necessary contracts . We are prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been prepared by our engineers . Very truly yours , THEODORE P. MONTS , Chairman . The Hon. William R. Willcox , Chairman Public Service Commission of the First District , New York City . Details of the Plan . Some of the details of construction and operation under . this Interborough plan , so far as could be learned , are that the west side express route will run down Seventh Avenue , under Washington Park , across Greenwich and down Varick Streets , West Broadway and Vesey Street to Battery Place . It would normally run into the present Subway at about Fortythird Street , and mig-tit be expected to have stations at the Pennsylvania Station . Twenty-third Street . Fourteenth Street , and at some point near Chambers Street . The Lexington Avenue extension uptown starts from a point sufficiently below the Grand Central Station to allow the adjustment of the express and local tracks , and in joining the present Lenox Avenue Subway at 149th Street affords a complete separation of the east side and west side express - traffic . As to the treatment of the elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public last night , except that the third track on the Second Avenue line ? would start at about Cherry IStreet and that on the Third Avenue line at City Hall . Both will run in together at the junction of the Second and Third Avenue roads at the Harlem River , according to the plans which the engineers have prepared . On certain parts of the Second Avenue line . such as the stretch through Allen Street in the lower east side , it is probable that a double decked structure would have to be resorted to it the third tracking were to be allowed . OPPOSITION TO WILGUS PLAN . Committee of Fifty Says It Does n't Solve the Freight Problem . The Committee of Fifty which has been at work on the Eleventh Avenue track removal ? question and the general problem of freight distribution along the Hudson water front will oppose the . pl31 submitted to the Public Service Commission on Tuesday by William J. Wilgus and his associates in the New Amsterdam Corporation . This plan contemplated the construction of an elevated structure around the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River to Twenty-fifth Street and the East River , a subway from the latter point to Fifty-ninth Street and the East River. , and two crosstown subways . The primary objection made to this plan by those who have been engaged in ' the Eleventh Avenue track removal fight I is that It does not solve the freight distribution problem . Under the terms of the Wilgus proposal , the new elevated structure would handle freight as far south as St. John 's Park only , until suchl time as the passenger traffic demanded the entire service for its own require-1 ments . Below St. John 's Park no relief is suggested , so that the Eleventh Avenue track removal proposition would remain in its present state for all that the plans of the Wilgus company offer .
