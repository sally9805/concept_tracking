txt SUPREME COURT SALARIES . Oklahoma Omitted Provision from Her Voluminous Constitution . To the Editor of Thc New York Times : I have noted with considerable interest the discussion that has been carried on for some time in your paper relative to the movement to fix the salaries of the Judges of the Supreme Court by constitutional provision . It may be interesting to note that the Con.stitution of Oklahoma . which has been criticised on account of its great length and proItxlty , makes no atterhpt to fix . the salaries of any State officers , but leaves that question entirely to - the Legislature . On account of the peculiar and anomalous conditions incident to the admission of Oklahoma to the Lnion. many things were written into the Constitution which , under ordinary circumstances , might have been left to the Legislature . As printed in pamphlet form for distribution at the time of the admission of the State , the Constitution required sixty-four pages of small , closely printed type . Yet it leaves the fixing of salaries entirely to the Legislature .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
