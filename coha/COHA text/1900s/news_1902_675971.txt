txt DR . WOODBURY AND THE WEST SIDE . It is not to be expected that the residents of the West End will have the sympathy of anybody but themselves in their grievances against the Commissioner of Street Cleaning . Certainly they will not have when the facts are understood . The same annoyance that Dr. WoonnuRY finds Col. WARING found in his day . He represented to the West End people what a hardship it was not to have a dumping place along the four miles of river shore which comprises the whole frontage of the west side . He offered to prove to them that it was perfectly possible to arrange a covered dumping place which not only should not be a nuisance , but the operations of which should be so conducted that the residents would not have them in any way brought to their attention . He might as well have talked to the wind . The West End Association , by which the west siders allow themselves to be represented . went to Albany and procured the paskage of a law against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . Thus they made it far more costly to carry away their household wastes than those of any other householders , and at some times , such as these recent days when all the horses of the department are overworked and are needed to cart snow as well as house wastes , even impossible to do so . The dog in the manger is an animal that does not endear himself to anybody but himself . If the Street Cleaning Commissioner should determine to let the West Enders remove their own ashes at their own cost , since they make it so expensive for him to do it , he would have the sympathy of his fellow-citizens in other quarters of the town , whose own service will be retarded if he tries to waste punctual service upon the West Enders . Such a course would probably have the effect of making them hasten to Albany to procure the repeal of the canine , or porcine ; statute of which they procured the enactment . At any rate , the Commissioner is fully entitled , in the circumstances , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes and garbage from the west side .
