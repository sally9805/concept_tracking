 | MY summer home is in a land of wire fences , among people of long abiding utilitarian habit of mind . Outside the village the farmers are nearly all Germans ? frugal , hardworking , relentless in their attack on nature . They have already begun to shave the crowns of the hills and to hang their fields of wheat and rye like rugs upon the most rugged ridges . They consider a tree a nuisance if it can not be turned into posts or firewood , and their roads run across the hills at inexorable angles . They use wire for fence because it is cheaper , and to ask one of them to retain a rail fence for its picturesque charm would make even their priest a candidate for the asylum whose bare red walls rise out of the level valley floor , graceless and unadorned . They consider a road merely in the light of a way to market and never as a means of pleasure in itself ? and yet in all these things they are not markedly different from any other large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not condemning them , I am merely stating a fact . They are farmers , not landscape , gardeners , they have not the leisure nor the past experience to make them lovers of the beautiful .  | I have watched them ravage , my native hills and coollies with sorrow , knowing well that sooner or later every wildling spot , every grassy nook , every wooded slope , will be turned into soil for making more corn grow to feed more hogs , to buy more land , to feed more hogs , and so on in never-ending circles . I have several times set a limit to my stay in this valley , so painful to me is the process of denudation , but family connections still hold me there . and of late I have been interested to observe how bravely and quietly nature is fighting to repair this ravage . I have begun to study her methods as she covers the wounds with the grateful shade of shrubs ; especially have I watched her veil her shame with the tracery of vines . Each year as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call my wife 's attention to the upspringing wild flowers beside the road , and to the silent , shy but steady missionry of the various creeping plants , especially the beautiful and hardy native creeper , the woodbine . In the early days the roads all ran along the creeks of the coollies , near the willows where the blackbird sang across the meadow , where the phlox and the tiger-lilies bloomed , keeping to the natural course , winding in pleasant curves , a joy to traverse . Now they crawl up one hill , turn a sharp angle and plunge down . They are stark , wounding , wasteful of horseflesh and utterly wearisome to travel . Were it not fpr the yearly growth of wild flowers ? " weeds " they are called ? . these lanes would be intolerable . They are at present places of struggle , of drama , of survival and of victory , and thus interest me quite in the same way that the right-of-way of the railroad does , for there , too , a modest yet hardy attempt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , the depressing trail of the car of progress . As I ride these lanes I watch with joy the woodbine making use of the wire fence . Rising obscurely , unaccountably , beside a post far from companions , it sends out lateral shoots along the wires ? barbed and cruel ? and year by year extends its exquisite tracery till the thing that was ugly and menacing , type of the selfish and sordid , has become a thing of beauty . All the summer it swings a waving curtain of green and in autumn becomes a glorious banner of crimson and gold and bronze , teaching the inexpugnable beauty of nature 's intention , just as along the railway it now and then mounts a telegraph pole or spreads up and across a " cut . " Now and then the farmers attack and destroy it ? and yet it returns each spring with the good green grass . Once I passed a building , an electric power house , which was ugly as a brick kiln , a thing devoid of form , of every line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress to the mind , by reason of its association of heat and dust and smell . Last year I saw this building again ? and lo , what a change ? it was covered with a vine , displaying a thousand cool , shining , aromatic leaves ? a delight to every sense ; and seeing it , I again exulted over the splendid mission of the vine . In July of last year I made a trip to St Louis in a houseboat from La Crosse , a joyous trip on a great and splendid waterway . The Mississippi is very beautiful even to-day , for the hand of man has not vet been able to entirely debase it to his utilitarian uses , but while the nature side of the river is serenely satisfying , the bleak , blank wails of the towns , the staring ugliness of the warehouses and wharves and railway stations , are like harsh strokes of the fist in the midst of a solemn piano sonata ; and yet how easily they could have been made less ugly , less barren . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this river are concerned were the locks at Keokuk . There the government , strange to say , had planted grass and trees , and vines were creeping up the stone walls , giving charm and a certain suggestion of age , of history ; all else was barren of grace . It was fine to see , also , how the wild vines spread above the sharp stones of  | the embankment a softening garment of green . My lecturing takes me to many schools and inland colleges , and I am always grateful to the unknown beneficiaries who have had the taste , the courage , to plant vines , even if they do " decay the bricks , " for most of these buildings in these centers of light and learning remain as bleak and bare as the railway stations , notwithstanding the ease with which they could be made a joy instead of an irritation , like the power house I saw on Long Island sound . This is the decorative mission of the vine , to cover the naked ugly walls of the anesthetic and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to this eager , impatient , swelling desire on the part of : nature is the intent of this writing . I recall what joy I took , when I first went to Boston , in the vine-clad walls of the buildings in Copley square , notably Phillips Brooks ' church . I watched these vines flame and fade from day to day as autumn came on , with regret and wonder ? they were so beautiful . A large part of the pleasure I took in English houses and public buildings was due to their vines , for English architecture is by no means always beautiful in itself . Mexican patios owe a large part of their charm to their glorious vines . The exterior of the hacienda may be bare and hot in the sun , but within , the sprangle of palms , the tinkle of falling water , and the deep , grateful festoons of the vines soothe and gratify . I know of nothing more dramatic than this passage from the blinding heat and dust of a Mexican street to the rest and peace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Coyuca , of Tacubaya , and their vines and their flowers appeal more strongly to me than even their cathedrals . " What can we do to improve our American villages ? " was the question debated in a recent magazine . The answer is simple . Paint out the accursed green-blue-pink and the jaundiced-yellow of your jigsaw cottages , simplify their lines and color , and sow  | grass and plant flowers and shrubs and vines . I am looking out as I write upon the brick extension of a city house ? a perfectly hideous thing in itself ? but through somebody 's care it is covered closely ' with an exquisite network of ivy . Its roots are hidden by the pavement , its stem is dusty and dead , and yet each summer it is not merely clothed in beauty , but the walls are kept cooler by this hardy , humble thing that demands so little and gives so much . It suggests what the alleys of our towns and cities might be with a little care , an hour 's thought . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant journey to the woodland and six inches of space , a break in the pavement . In our mad haste to build big cities we utterly forget to build beautifully . We have not vet learned that cities are places in which to live as well as centers in which to do business . Everywhere we have left out the thug that really counts in the long run . The successful man is by no means always the happy man , for his sucicss may not have added to the happiness and beauty of his world , but the man who has made his pathway more alluring to those who come after hint has pleasant memories within himself , no matter if his neighbors fail of tribute . To plant a tree is almost always to plant for someone else , for the future , but the vine , more gracious , is swift to bless the hand that gives it place and nourishment ; a year or two of grace and it is ready to bless the hand that set it in place . Nature here in America is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its largeness and splendor , but nearly all that we call civilization has been of ugly temper , a perversion , a cruel assault , a making of wounds , a despoliation and a ravage ( I hope this is sufficiently sweeping ) ,  | and the task before this generation or the next generation is to repair this ravage , to restore so far as possible the charm of the wild . We must change our aim , we must consider our land a place to be happy in as well as a place to make money in . We must give as well as take , build beauty as well as destroy it . We must learn how to love nature , having lost the violence of our fear and hate of her ; to make our ravages as tender and respectful as may be , in short , to cover the wounds we have been forced to make by means of the vine and the tree . I am the more zealous ? even vehement ? in my advocacy of this because I am of those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the wild things , but I have not always had the courage to cry out against the utilitarian . I have not even been able in any large degree to carry out my enthusiasms , but this I can say , I have never failed of appreciation of those whose practice is better than my precept . I have only just begun to be able to embody a few of my plans , but that by no construction lessens the value of my plea . @# It is said of the late Sterling Morton of Nebraska that he always besought every man he met to " plant trees " ; that was because he felt the barrenness of the treeless west . I would add " and vines " because I would cover the naked wall , and drape the trees . Trees and vines will cover a great deal of bad architecture . There are almost no excuses for barren walls . We do not need to import vines from England , shrubs from Japan , nor flowers from Mexico . Our own native wild plants and vines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty over our blunders , our mistakes , our poverty of resource . Go to the meadows , the swamps , the roadside , and invite them in to help you make life better worth living . Study their needs . their habits , and apply their courage and their grace to your walls , your porticoes , your decayed and dilapidated outhouses , and your porches will become bowers of fragrance and shade , your lawns a delight . And you will furthermore preserve to your children a few of the exquisite wild flowers now swiftly bowing to the sickle and the plow .  | With a clear knowledge that I am writing as a newly born enthusiast I repeat call back all of nature that can . exist side by side with the absolute necessities of your daily life in village or city , and your joy in living will be increased and the minds of your children enriched by an association with their suave and benignant surroundings . My Rustic Arches By James E. Tyler , England THE garden of my present abode had been sadly neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cost as possible . My first idea was that of an arch from disused gas pipes , covered with one or another of the quick-growing creepers . Having obtained some one and one-quarter-inch old pipe from a gas works for a trifle , I cut them into eight and one-half-foot lengths and drove them into the ground about two and one-half feet , one on each side of the path , so that six feet still remained above ground . I then procured a piece of round iron rod a little smaller than the bore of the pipe and bent it in a semicircle , again bending it six inches at either end until at right angles . These straight ends were inserted in the pipes one on each side and plugged or wedged up with pieces of wood driven in to make them secure . Give this two or three coats of paint and your arch is ready for planting the climbers . In this country one of the fastest growing climbers is the Kentish hop , but this unfortunately dies down each year . Each one , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that the quicker growing the climber , the sooner the arch will be covered . Figure 1 shows my arch as covered with Kentish hops . So my first attempt was successful . I next turned my thoughts to an-  | other form , which may truly be called rustic , being made from wood in its natural state . From a wood merchant I procured some ash , chestnut , or similar poles measuring some sixteen to twenty feet long . These are really young trees , the thickest part being about four inches in diameter , which have been cut down to clear part of a wood . They still have the bark on them , the young shoots having been trimmed off . They are not very expensive . I also obtained some smaller stakes , such as we use for raspberry canes . These are used for filling in purposes . A glance at Figure will , I think , enlighten as to the poles and stakes . In making a single arch I would suggest wing the thinner ones . Cut then into nine-foot lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give these points a good coating of gas tar to prevent the - moisture from the ground getting into the ' poles . If in no hurry to erect , give a second coat , it will pay for the doing . First drive in the poles marked A B C D in the order named , so that A and B stand about seven feet out of the ground and the other two about six feet . The crossbar . E , should next be added , and then the angular or arch pieces , F and G. To do this take two of the smaller stakes , and , crossing them six or eight inches from the ends , secure with a nail and fix on the poles previously driven in . Then fill in according to your own taste . A set  | form for embellishing or filling in can hardly be given ; one must leave it to the ingenuity and the taste of the builder . However , it is Well to bear this in mind , that in nailing on these pieces , holes should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to split . A permanent summer house had been erected on the higher level , set back somewhat from the front edge and approached by a bight of concrete steps . This summer house being small had often proved itself inadequate , so I decided to build an annex in the shape of a double arch containing seats . The illustration ( Figure 3 ) will , I think , speak for itself . The main posts must be of a substantial character , as they are to bear the weight of the seats . Of course the house looks bare in the illustration because photographed as soon as erected and before creepers , had been planted , but with fast growing creepers the poles could be , well covered in a couple of seasons . If expense is no object a better substitute for the poles and stakes is peeled oak timber-top . This is easily obtainable but rather more trouble to fit together . When finished it is far more durable . The Small Suburban Garden By Francis Durando Nichols TO the householder who is obliged to content himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a half ( one hundred by two hundred feet ) an acre of land , I wish to devote this article and to show , with illustrations , and with practical and helpful ideas , what can be done with small plots of ground . The veranda , which is now more a separate room , should have a pleasant outlook , and , if possible , a view of a garden , well planted with flowers , so that there may be a continued bloom from early spring till late in the autumn . Vines and climbing plants of all kinds add much to the appearance of a veranda , but they should be grown on a trellis , and it is well to place the trellis in front of the posts , or columns , and not to plant vines which have too heavy leaves . Honeysuckle , Virginia creeper and clematis , in purple and white , are excellent for the piazza , and to be patriotic , and to add a little brilliant coloring to the scheme , crimson ramblers may be planted in with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piazza may be filled in with a group of hardy hydrangeas with good effect . It will be impossible to have indiscriminate growing of flowers , and evergreens , on the one hand , or what is known as potted plants in carpet beds on the other hand , and the natural beauties of the landscape are out of the question within the close confines of such a plot , accordingly it becomes more and more the prevailing opinion that it is better , therefore , in the more immediate environment of any house , to let the order and plan bring the garden into closer relation to the building to which it forms the setting . The illustrations presented herewith show garden views from respective verandas . These gardens are laid out in a geometrical form , and the flower beds are separated by walks , which are built by digging a trench sixteen inches deep , and filling the same in with furnace ashes , and then top-dressing the whole with a little crushed stone , or beach gravel . The walk has a grassed sod edging ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These flower beds were covered with plenty of good manure , and were then well dug over so that the soil might be well mixed . The beds are planted with perenL vials . I most certainly advise the use of hardy perennials , for the reason that they practically take care of themselves , and after dying down in the fall , they spring into life in the following spring with an increased growth ; thus the growth is continual . If annuals are used , the planting is required to take place each year , and the sowing , which must necessarily r  | take place in the spring , does not reach its full growth till the autumn , when in a very short time it is cut down by the early frost . Inside the edging , which should be well clipped , alyssum can be well planted , for it is low in stature , white in color , and profuse in growth . In these beds , within the confines of a grassed edge , may be planted perennial , such as asters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foxglove , snapdragon , columbine , double English daisy , marigolds and golden glow ? one short in growth , and the other tall . both presenting a golden hue to the color scheme . Each should be planted in masses and together . There are also Canterbury bells , candytuft. which is of low growth and should be given a place if it can be spared , forget-menots , primroses , hollyhocks , in those beautiful shades of pink , chrysanthemums , in their deep colors of red , yellow and white , and any number of such plants , which are hardy and which can be purchased from one dollar and twenty-five cents to one dollar and fifty cents per dozen plants . Seeds of the foregoing plants can be purchased at the . average price of five cents per package , and should be planted in the fall to insure results for the following season . Jonquils , daffodils and . narcissus are excellent plants to grow for early flowers . If there is a rear fence , as in the case of one of the gardens shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pergola be built which may be composed of five by five-inch posts , placed eight feet apart , and in one or two rows , as one may wish . If the latter scheme . is adopted , which I advise , a four by six plate may be carried on a line with the posts . and from one end to the other . and across this can be placed two by four with cut-ends , with pergola effect . The whole should be painted white , or dark bottle green ; I recommend the latter color , for the reason that it is cheaper in the long run , and is more appropriate for a place of this character . PIant on the rear line of posts various kinds of grapevines as you may select , and train these @#  | around the posts and over the slats which cover the pergola , and at the front line of posts , toward the house , plant rose bushes of the climbing variety , which may be successfully grown , and form a very pleasing setting against a green background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge , but this requires a great deal of care and brings no return for one 's labor , as the grapevine scheme does . The clothes yard may be inclosed the same as the pergola , or may form a part of it . A very satisfactory and interesting scheme and one that costs nothing except the performance of the work , is to go to the woods and select a quantity of ferns of the different varieties and plant them in groups along the shady side of the house or veranda . These grow profusely , take care of themselves and give a very effective result . The division lines of the grounds may be well broken , and yet kept distinct , by a proper grouping of the hardy hydrangeas and peonies , which should be brought forward and in front of the former . The same treatment may be utilized at the front entrance , and in the corners of the plot at the front , groups of pine may be satisfactorily grown . With this treatment , a very dignified and refined atmosphere is imparted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the estate is furnished . One should study a little of plants , how they should be grouped , how effective certain coloring will be in certain spots , and one should realize how certain combinations will add to the effect of one part , or how insufficient they may be one to the other . All plants should be grouped in single colors and no combination of colors should ever be permitted .
