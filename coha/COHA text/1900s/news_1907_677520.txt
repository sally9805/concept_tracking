txt Pennsylvania Stockholder Protests . As a stockholder I wish to protest against the enormous sums which the Pennsylvania is spending upon its New York terminals . I have been informed by competent engineers that the total cost of the terminals , including interest charges , taxes , &c.,; will be close to $100,000,000 , and that the same will not be in operation for five years to come . This enormous sum is about one-sixth of the total capitalization of the company . For about twelve railes of road from a point near Harrison , this is outrageous . Seventy-five per cent of the traffic of the road will still use the old terminals , and the uptown station will be used perhaps by through passengers only . Perhaps they are spending this money for our posterity , and it 's very little good that it will do the stockholders in A. D. 1907.
