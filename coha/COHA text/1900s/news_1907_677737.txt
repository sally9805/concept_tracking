txt Enraged at being jeered at and called a tin soldier , Michael Marino , a marine doing sentry duty at the navy yard , Brooklyn , last night , fired his musket pointblank into a crowd of over 100 people and Severely wounded two men . The two men who were shot are James C , Brien , 88 years old , of 4S5 Grand Avenue , a bookkeeper , . and Joseph Ryan , 24 years old , of 103 Bedford Avenue , a shipping clerk . O'Brien is in the Cumberland Street Hospital , suffering from a flesh wound in the right shoulder , and Ryan , after being treated at the hospital for a wound through the fleshy part of the right arm , went home . The crowd that was with the two men started to storm the navy yard fence directly after the shooting to get at the shooter . The timely arrival of the rest of the guard and the officer of the day ' prevented what undoubtedly would have been a very serious riot . O'Brien and Ryan are members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the Sound yesterday . The two men , who are friends , had been unable to go on the outing , but about 9 o'clock they went to the wharf near the navy yard to meet the returning excursion boat . There were about a hundred men on the wharf waiting to welcome back the members of the association who had been on the outing . Song Enraged the Sentry . The high iron picket fence that shuts off the navy yard from the street at this point is directly in front of the sentry beat where Marino was stationed . From its position on the wharf the crowd had a clear view of the marine pacing up and down with his musket at his shoulder . The boat was late in getting back from up the Sound , and the crowd began to make fun of the sentry . " Captain Sinks of the horse marines Fed his troops on pork and beans . " Some one chanted this couplet , and then the crowd took it up and sang It in chorus . Marino went on walking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of its singing and , began to call the sentry names , at first purely in fun , but later with some vindictiveness , as Marino 's complacency evidently did n't please the funmakers . " Look at the tin soldier : " shouted one man , adding a few adjectives , and the crowd laughed . Just . then Marino , enraged , swung around , and , bringing his gun to his shoulder , fired point blank at the jeerers . The bullet went between the pickets of the fence and pierced Ryan 's right forearm , going right through and into the shoulder of O'Brien , who was standing just behind him . Both Ryan and O'Brien , screamed , and in an instant there was intense excitement . Two or three men held up the two wounded men while the rest of the crowd shouted to Marino to stop . He stood with his musket half raised , yelling for the guard , evidently fearing that he was in for serious trouble from the men outside the fence .. He was not disappointed . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two had really been hit by the bullet they set up a cry of " Lynch him ! " and the whole mob started for the fence . Reaching it the foremost began to climb up . helped by those behind , and for . a few minutes it looked as if the whole crowd would get over the barrier and make it hot for the sentry . The sentry stood his ground , shouting all the while for the guard , but not attempting to fire his gun again . The guard , . in charge of the Corporal , came running up just as the first of the fence climbers reached the top of the iron pickets . Lining up the guard , the Corporal shouted : " Get down off that fence ! I 'll shoot the first man who trespasses on Government property . " This threat had ' some effect . The enraged mob stopped for an instant . ' but from behind came cries of " Go ahead : Let him fire ! " with sundry more or less insulting epithets meant for the Corporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fence , and then the officer of the day arrived . Yard Officer Arrests the Shooter . The officer of the day took in the situation at a glance and began to talk to the crowd . He told them that they could do no good by coming over the fence ; that there were several hundred more marines than those in the guard , and that they were only making trouble for themselves . When he got the crowd a little quieter he explained that Marino was already under arrest and that he would be turned over to the civil authorities in the morning . Then the officer told the guard to take Marino to the guard house and left the crowd , still on the other side of the fence and quite powerless . The reserves from the Flushing Avenue Station arrived at this tine and dispersed the crowd . O'Brien and Ryan were removed to the station , followed by a lot of their friends . There they made a complaint against Marino , and were then taken to the hospital where their wounds were dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commandant 's office and asked whether the prisoner was In the guard house . Acting Commandant Murphy assured him that the marine was under arrest , and that he would be surrendered to the civil authorities in the morning if a warrant for his arrest was presented .
