 | CLOSE to the northern bank of the winding and placid James , some twoscore miles above where it pours its waters through Hampton Roads into the Chesapeake , into which flow more than a score of rivers , several of them among the noblest on the globe , lies a narrow island . Steeped in the sunshine , or soaked by the rains , it has until yesterday , as it were , lain asleep for the last two hundred and more years , just as it had lain , with the exception of some threescore years , since the Powhatan at flood cut it from its neighboring shore . At the upper end , on the river side , in a clump of trees , and what was until lately a tangle of shrubbery , on the edge of which are piled the remains of an old redout , a relic of the Civil ' War , stands a brick ruin ? a single surviving fragment of the first Protestant Church built in America . About it lie the traces of a once extensive graveyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncovered and preserved a few broken tombs , graven with armorial escutcheons and bearing the names of a very few among those whose ashes have lain for nearly three hundred years embosomed in Virginia 's soil . The eye of the born antiquary may detect out on the plateau in the sun the faint traces of ancient streets and houses ; but to the ordinary passer-by there has been , until just now , nothing to distinguish it from the ordinary Virginia riverplantation dozing in the sunshine . Vet here on this very spot , at the head of this little island , . was Jamestown , the birthplace of the American people ; the first rude cradle in which was swaddled the tiny infant that in time has sprung up to be among the leaders of the nations ; the torch-bearer of civilization , and the standard-bearer of popular government . Here was planted , three hundred years ago , the first surviving colony of the  | English-speaking race , which has since occupied this continent and spread over the globe . Here was established the first outpost and earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle that " Government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . " On the morning of the 13th day of May , 1607 , James I being then King of England , Scotland . Wales , and Ireland , and Philip III being King of Spain , the American continent , when the sun rose , belonged absolutely to Spain . When the sun set , it belonged to England . This was accomplished by a little band of sixscore men who , " after long toil and pain , " landed that day about the hour of four from three small ships , the Susan or Sarah Constant , the Good Speed , and the Discovers , and planted the flag of the Anglo-Saxon on the point , which they promptly proceeded to fortify and call " James Fort , " or " James Town , " after their king . Space forbids in this paper to give even a bare outline of the steps which , extending through a hundred years of aspiration , struggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English race . Men were beginning to awaken from the lethargy in which they had been steeped by ecclesiasticism . The long struggle was on between the old and the new . Happily for the world , just at this time the crown of England fell on the brow of the hard-headed daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Bolevn. and , yet more happily , she found herself at the head of an awakened and eager people , alive in every fiber of their being , and , most of all . alive to the peril of allowing Spain to go unchecked in her career of conquest over body and mind . Even on the Catholic continent there was a great revolt against Spain 's rising power . Francis I had sent his great rival Charles V a message , demanding whether he thought God had given him the earth . And as early as 1534 , France had established a colony on the St. Lawrence , and Huguenots had attempted to plant colonies in Florida , only to be destroyed by the Spanish governor , Menendez , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be mentioned as a warning in the instructions given to the first colonists of the Anglo-Saxon race who effected a permanent settlement . All through this century the struggle was going on between the two countries and the two peoples , and before it was three fourths over , Fame was filling her trump with the names of a score of English captains , many of whom survive in history to-day : Hawkins , Drake , the Gilberts , Grenville , Frobisher , and , finally . Sir Walter Raleigh . All contributed their part ; but to him who came to be known as " the Shepherd of the Seas , " more possibly than to any other one man , Spain owed the wresting of North America from her grasp . England had her well-founded claim based on John Cabot 's discovery , in 1497 , of the coasts north of Florida , of which the only record left is the entry in the privy purse ? expenses of Henry VII ? " ? 10. to hym who found the New land . " She was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Walter Raleigh was the one who inspired and equipped and despatched the fleets which opened the way to the settlement of Virginia and of America . He gave Virginia her name , and was her first Governor . Raleigh , half-brother of the gallant Gilberts , when a student at college , was so aroused by the story of the Spanish attack on Hawkins 's fleet in the harbor of San Juan d'Ulloa , that he left the university and went to the Low Countries to fight the Spaniard . From this time he vowed his life to warfare with Spain , and though he finally fell a victim to her hate , it was not until he had planted on the shores of Virginia a colony which was to lead in the work of wresting America from her grasp . Previous to the final and successful effort , there had been several attempts to plant here colonies fitted out by Sir Walter Raleigh , which failed . That on Roanoke Island might have succeeded had not the Spanish war and the peril of the Spanish Armada kept supplies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish Armada left the seas open for England 's schemes for colonization to go into effect . When , however , Governor White returned to  | Virginia , his little colony had disappeared , and though the one word " Croatan " was carved upon a post , as though to show where they had gone , no trace of them was ever found . The Roanoke Colony , with little Virginia Dare , the first child of English parentage born on this continent , was lost in the dim limbo that surrounds the name " Croatan . " The blotting out of this colony was a heavy blow even to English enterprise , and , as one of the old writers declared , " all hopes of Virginia thus abandoned , it lay dead and obscured from 1590 to this year , 1602 . " By this time the end of the long war with Spain was in sight , and the English public , the English church , and the English government , once more turned their eyes to that far-off but " sweet , wholesome , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , the spirit still remained . Even the death of the great queen , in 1603 , was not able to quench it . National pride , religious zeal , the spirit of adventure and of cupidity ? all combined to make the effort time after time to establish a foothold where all previous efforts had failed . The tales of Spain 's El Dorado untied the purse-strings of the London companies . But there was another and loftier motive . The zeal of the children of those who had suffered at Smithfield and Tower Hill under the Queen of Philip II could not with languor see the church of Torquemada and Alva bringing vast tribes within their fold . The cities of England were full of soldiers returned from the wars in the Low Countries ; the spirit of adventure was abroad , and much more the hatred of Spain . The state reflected it ; the poet sang of it ; the writers wrote of it . Thus , in 1606 , despite the failure of all earlier attempts , an expedition was ready to set forth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her king and people . On April 10 , 1606 , the warrant for the proposed Virginia Charter prepared by the Attorney-General , Sir Edward Coke , was passed under the Great Seal of the Lord Chancellor . It was stated to be for the furtherance of so noble a work as the planting of Christianity among the Heathens , " and claimed for the crown of England the whole of North America between 34 degrees and 45 degrees north latitude , commonly called Virginia . Two companies , one for planting a colony in south Virginia , between 34 degrees and 41 degrees north , with a grant of fifty miles inland and out to sea , and the other for planting a similar colony in north Virginia were incorporated in the same charter . " The inhabitants and their children were to have the privileges of British subjects . " The lands were to be holden of the crown . The colonization of the northern part of Virginia , patronized by Sir John Popham , C. J. , met with difficulties ? at first , as Sir Ferdinand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being appointed Counsellors . " " All the gentlemen that before weare willing to be large adventurers withdraw themselves and by no meanes will have to doe therein . " Saturday , December 1%0 , 1606 , after prayers and religious services in the churches , the first expedition to establish " the first Colony in Virginia " sailed from London under command of Captain Christopher Newport . They numbered sixscore men , of whom fifty-four were " gentlemen , " besides fifty odd mariners . No women accompanied them ; for the memory of Menendez and the lost colony was fresh in all minds . They did not reach the Downs until three weeks later , and " there the winds continued contrary so long that they were forced to stay some time , where they suffered great storms . " Here , pounding up and down for weeks in sight of their homes , their courage was sustained largely by the heroic devotion of " Worthy Master Hunt , " the simple parson , the first apostle of the Anglo-Saxon race to the Americas , whose name never appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not illuminate it alike with service to his fellowman and the Most High God . It was not until three months later that , having sailed the old route by the West Indies , they sighted the Virginia shore . On the 26th of April , about four o'clock in the morning , they reached the mouth of the Chesapeake , and dropped anchor inside the Capes of Virginia . They anchored this continent to the Protestant religion and the English civilization . Here that night the box containing  | their sealed orders was opened , and they discovered who were to be thenceforth their rulers . The first President was to be elected by the Council , who were composed of gentlemen , the most noted of whom in after time was a young captain , John Smith , who just then was a prisoner under charge of having plotted a conspiracy . The first President elected was Edward Maria Wingfield , a brave and highminded gentleman , though , unhappily , not a man qualified to deal with the situation that confronted them . The broad James , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the inland sea , and , seeking a secure abidingplace , to establish themselves at " some spot up one of the rivers sufficiently high ? at least one hundred miles ? to prevent the Spaniard , " who is ever on the horizon , from coming on them as Menendez had done on the Huguenots , and pulling them out of their seat , they quickly discovered this noble river . For many days they worked their way up the broad stream which was to become so historical in after time , likening themselves to the band of lEneas , " in the country called Latium ( on the river Tyber ) , " until , on the 13th day of May , three hundred years ago , on this small island in this Virginia river , the little band of sea-worn adventurers disembarked and planted the flag of the AngloSaxon race , which , though often threatened , and sometimes endangered , has never since that day been lowered . There were bickerings and contentions and quarreling , squalid and disheartening enough . For the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time ? a power which they exercised whenever they saw fit . There were occasions when it appeared as though almost all spirit had deserted them , and their great enterprise must fail . But it is well for the Anglo-Saxon race to pause and take note of the one great fact that , however their perils may have alarmed them and their vast isolation may have awed them , there always remained spirit enough to preserve them , and they remained in this far and perilous outpost of the AngloSaxon civilization , and with the devotion of the vestal virgin of old , kept the fire , however dim its spark , ever alight on the sacred shrine . Life in its most perilous and exacting form was the best to which they could look forward . Sickness and wounds , and death in its most terrible shape , ever confronted them , whether by the terror by night , or the arrow that flyeth by day , the pestilence that walked in the darkness , or the destruction that wasteth at noonday . Before them , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months away of toilsome , tedious , and perilous travel , they found the Spaniard , with sword and rack and stake , on the horizon . But their direst enemy was one more lurking than the savage Indian and more fell than the cruel Spaniard . They had pitched , upon a landing-place simply because of the security which it offered against their enemies , without knowing aught of the climate and its perils ; and it proved to be a spot so malarial that before the summer was out sixty men of the one hundred and twenty , among them the brave Gosnold , who had commanded the Good Speed . were dead of wounds and disease , the first victims of the six thousand who laid down their lives in Virginia or on the way thither in the first nineteen years of her heroic history . Their sufferings so impressed that scholarly historian , George Percy , fourth President of the colony , that he pictured them in one of his reports , the virility of which is to-day the wonder of English writers . " Burning fevers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part they died of mere famine . There were never Englishmen left in a foreign country in such misery as we were in this newdiscovered Virginia . " " There was groaning in every corner of the Fort most pitiful to hear . " " If there was any conscience in men , " says the historian , " it would make their hearts to bleed to hear the pitiful murmurings and outcries . . . some departing out of the world , sometimes three and four in a night ; in the morning their bodies trailed out of the cabins like dogs to be buried . " It came to the point " when ten men could neither go nor stand . " Then Caine the exploration of the Chickahominy and the Pamunkey , ( luring which occurred the picturesque incident over which historians of late have quarreled so much , when , according to Smith 's  | account , his life was saved by the young Indian princess , Pocahontas . Time fails to repeat the arguments in this , place . They appear to establish the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter and the following summer the small remnant of men , under Captain John Smith , explored and charted the waters of the Chesapeake , with its noble tributaries , from the Falls of the James to the Falls of the Potomac , above where the capital of the nation now stands , as within a short period afterward they explored the northern Chesapeake and the Susquehanna , mapping their discoveries with an accuracy which is the wonder of the present time . Smith himself came near falling a victim to partizan faction . He was tried and sentenced to death for having lost his men during his exploration up the Pamunkey , but his life was saved by the unexpected , for , as he records , " it pleased God to send us Captain Newport that same evening . " The brave Christopher had been to England and come back with provisions and reinforcements for the colony . Among these was an element which possibly did more to establish the new plantation than even the provisions . for among the new immigrants were a number of women . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been the guardian angel of her new-found friends . The time is filled with exploration , with attacks on their Indian enemies , and counter attacks by them , with charges and countercharges ; but all the time the little colony was establishing itself . And meanwhile in England a new and broader charter was being secured . A vast step was made the next spring when Captain Samuel Argall , " an ingenious , active , and forward young gentleman , " following the instructions of the adventurers , sailed straight across the sea and proved that there were no currents or constant winds to prevent a direct passage . Argall brought news of the new charter , and also the announcement that Captain Smith had been superseded in the office of President . And that September , Smith having been grievously wounded by an explosion of gunpowder while returning from a punitive expedition against the Indians near the Falls of the James , went back to England , leaving George Percy as President , who at the time was so ill that he could scarcely stan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some five or six years later he explored and charted the coast of northern Virginia , to which he gave the name of New England . Thus this doughty captain , though he may not have done all that he claimed , unquestionably did more than any other man of his time to secure the permanency of the colonies both in southern and northern Virginia . He declared many years afterward that he had " not one foot of ground in Virginia ; not the very house he had builded , nor the ground he had digged with his own hands . " But he has left a more abiding memorial of his work than if at his death he had owned a province . After his departure , what with murder , starvation , and fever , the colonists , who now numbered several hundred , were reduced to the lowest ebb . " Some of the common sort " are alleged even to have resorted to cannibalism . Their despair was relieved by the providential arrival of Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers from the " still-vext Bermoothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deliverance , built in the Summer Isles after the Sea Venture had been wrecked in a storm , the account of which gave a London playwright the theme of his immortal " Tempest . " But so low had they gotten , and so slender was the provision left , that it was decided to embark for England by way of the Newfoundland fisheries , which were even then wellknown . Happily , however , just as they embarked and started , appeared the pinnace Virginia , sent by Lord Delaware , who had just entered the James with a year 's provision . The Governor 's first act , when he landed at the south gate of the fort , where Gates , with his fever-stricken men stood ready to receive him , like that of an earlier and greater admiral , was to kneel and offer up a prayer of thanksgiving . The new Governor quickly began to right matters . He set up as a real viceroy , and held a real court . His style was criticized by the old soldiers , some of whom said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a pickax and spade is better than five Knights that could break a lance . " But there was one Knight in Virginia worth many plain soldiers , and that was Sir Thomas West himself . He straightened out matters at Jamestown , and , in place of the little church which had first been built , he erected the first church in America worthy to be called a church ? an edifice sixty feet by twenty-four , with pews and chancel of cedar , and a communion-table of black walnut , with a baptismal font and a high pulpit , and two bells at the west end . He attended service in full dress , attended by the Lieutenant-General , the Admiral , the Vice-Admiral , the Master of the Horse , and Council , and a guard of fifty halberdiers in red cloaks . He sat in the choir in a green velvet chair , and had a velvet cushion to kneel on ; while the Council were ranged in state on the right hand and on the left . It looks as though it were a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his style to good use . He punished the Indians for their hostilities , got corn from the tribes of the Potomac , built forts in various places , and set Virginia on a sound basis of government . Moreover , he set the stamp on the Virginia life which it has never since lost . When his health gave way and he sailed for England , naming , on the way , Delaware Bay , in which he took refuge from a storm , men fell once more into lax ways . But the arrival in the following May of Sir Thomas Dale , High Marshal of Virginia , a soldier who had seen service in Flanders , " a man of great knowledge in Divinity , and of a good conscience in all things , " served to carry on the good work . He found men playing at bowls in the streets , but he quickly put a stop to this . His government became unpopular enough for the old soldiers to plot a conspiracy ; but , discovering it , he arrested the ringleaders and inflicted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel , unusual and barbarous method at one time customary in France . " Twelve years later certain burgesses signed a paper , stating what they had seen : he had chained a man to a tree with a bodkin thrust through his tongue , and left him to perish . Sir Thomas Dale was , however , an able administrator , and the arrival of some three hundred new settlers enabled him to found a new town , called Henricus , on the plateau in a loop of the James at what is now Dutch Gap . Here he built his own " fair mansion , " where " excellent Mr. Whittaker , " the apostle of Virginia , " exercized every Saturday night . " And here was opened the first university founded on this continent , and the first hospital . By this time Virginia was established on a permanent basis . It had been found in England that the form of government under the King 's charter bred many inconveniences , and a new charter had been granted on June 2 , 1609 , which contained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posterity which shall happen to be born in any of the limits , shall have and enjoy all liberties , franchises and immunities of free denisons and natural subjects within any of our other Dominions to all intents and purposes as if they had been abiding and born within this our realm of England . " This was the Magna Charta of America . Moreover , the charter contained a grant running from sea to sea . The enthusiasm in Virginia caused by the change in the charter was such , says Strachey , " that not a year of Roman Jubilee , no , nor the ethnic Queen of Ephesus can be said to have been followed with more heat and zeal . " This charter itself was remodeled and enlarged by a new one secured in March , 1612 , which transferred the power and government of the colony from the London Council to the Virginia Company . It was this latter company , with its power to sit once a week , or as often as they chose , and to hold four general courts in . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being conducted according to the will of the people and not according to the will of the king . " The Great Parliament of Virginia Adventurers " became known throughout England , and was the talk of London . It proved the far sight of the Spanish ambassador , who told James I that " the Virginia Courts are but a Seminary to a seditious Parliament . " It bore rich fruit . Within a generation a " seditious Parliament , " in which were many men who had been interested in this  | Virginia experiment , brought the head of King James 's son to the block . By this time the coast of Virginia from the Carolinas to the French border was known and charted , and Virginia began to protect her coasts . It having become known that the French had planted a colony at Mt . Desert Island , within the limits of Virginia , Captain Argall was sent by Sir Thomas Dale to root the colony up , and did it most effectively . Then sailing back to Virginia , he went up the Hudson as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading-station , and ordered these intruders off as well . They promised to obey , but obeyed rather in the letter than in the spirit , as the following year they settled on Manhattan Island , where Peter Minuit having a little later cleared his title by paying the Indians $24.00 for the entire island , they remained until dispossessed by the English in 1664 . Thus the Jamestown Colony protected the entire Virginia coast to Nova Scotia . The following year this part of the coast of northern Virginia received its baptismal name of New England at the hands of Captain John Smith , who , in order to chart the coast for himself , had , while on a whaling expedition , rowed , as he claims , along its whole extent , in order to draw and " Map from Point to Point , Isle to Isle , and Harbor to Harbor , with the soundings , sands , rocks and landmarks . " When , in 1616 , Sir Thomas Dale returned to England , he took with him John Rolfe and " the Lady Pocahontas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony in Virginia . He left behind him order and peace . The settlements extended a hundred miles up into the interior . The new town . Henrico , was built partly of brick , and not only did it contain , in 1619 , a university . endowed with ten thousand acres of land , besides ? 1500 raised by the bishops in England , but , as early as 1613 , it contained also a hospital with eighty lodgings , the beds for which had been sent over for the care of the sick and the wounded . A part of this had been accomplished by the liberal-minded Yardley , who succeeded Dale , and possibly more by the ingenious , active , and forward young gentleman , Samuel Argall , who came over again , in 1617 , as Deputy-Governor and Admiral of Virginia . He set up an iron rule , affixing the penalty of three years ' slavery to the colony for violation of his edicts . Failure to attend church services was punished with a night 's imprisonment and a week 's enforced labor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month 's enforced labor ; and for the third , a year and a day . Governor Yardley , however , was at work in England with other friends of liberty , who had won a great victory , the greatest yet achieved . They had secured for the Virginians the right to have thenceforth a representative government of their own . Armed with the power to summon a representative assembly , Governor Yardley returned to Virginia , arriving on April 19 , 1619 , and immediately issued writs therefor . Thus , on the 30th of July , 1619 , assembled at Jamestown the first legislative body of America , prototype of every general assembly and congress that has sat since . Eleven boroughs sent their burgesses , two from each ; and the body held their session in the choir of the old church at Jamestown . The burgesses sat with their hats on , claiming the privilege of the English Commons . The charter brought by the Governor was read and referred to a committee , who were to consider and report whether it contained anything " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any law binding or pressing too hard , " " Because this Great Charter is to bind us and our heirs forever . " The spirit of the assembly may be judged from the petition to the company in London to grant them authority " to allow or disallow of their orders of Court as His Majesty has given them power to allow or disallow our laws . " In fact , the " patriot party " had won a signal victory over the " Court Party . " Thus , in 1619 , the plantation of Virginia had spread until it had become a commonwealth , with an elective representative assembly . When the year 1622 opened , Virginia appeared to be in so prosperous a condition as to justify the wildest hopes of the Virginia Company . With her many settlements , her numerous forts , her long chain of plantations up and down the  | wide rivers , her excellent hospital , her college well endowed and beginning to take on the form of a real institution of learning , everything appeared auspicious , when suddenly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been secretly hatched with consummate art , under the old Indian chief , Opechancannough , and on the morning of the 1st of April , 1622 , from one end of the colony to the other , from the Falls of the James to South Hampton Hundred on the Chesapeake , the Indians by concert fell upon the unsuspecting settlers , butchering over four hundred men , women , and children out of a total population of about thirteen hundred . A friendly Indian had on the eve of the massacre betrayed the plot to friends at Jamestown , and thus , although six members of the Council had been slain , the capital of the colony was enabled to protect itself , and escaped . But although Jamestown was saved , the new city of Henricus , with its endowed college and hospital , had been absolutely destroyed ; the new light of learning had been quenched in blood . For a time Virginia was forced to apply all her energies to the work of making her citizens secure against the Indians . That the great massacre of 1622 did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been planned and was expected to do , is proof of the strength to which the colony had attained . Indeed , by this time Virginia was really what she was called , a commonwealth , and after a little her progress was rapid . She was established by the gentry class of England , and in her structure this class was always dominant . The form of her social system was distinctly aristocratic . The companies that promoted and organized her government and controlled her destinies were composed of men of rank . Of the one hundred and four men of the first colony who landed on Virginia soil , fifty-four were gentlemen ; that is , men of the arms-bearing class . Of the first charter members , a very large majority were men of title ; nearly all were members of Parliament . Of the three hundred and twenty-five charter members of 1612 , twenty-five were peers of the realm ; one hundred and eleven were knights ; sixty-six were esquires , and thirty were " gentlemen . " In fact , not less than sixscore of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , the colonization of Virginia was a great national object , which appealed distinctly to the upper class , and was accomplished by the upper class . The perils and the hazards of the undertaking were just the things which appealed to this class ; and though many of them grew weary and fainted by the way , Virginia was settled by the gentry of Great Britain , who sent their younger sons , their retainers and tenants to clear the way , and then sent over whomever they might get to help establish the country : even " idle persons who followed the Court , " and waifs of the London streets , though the shipment of these elements continued for a very short time . Thus , Virginia was settled under the leadership of the gentry ; but all classes came to . make up the body of the people , and thus , possibly , more than any other colony it represented all phases of English life , and therefrom took on itself a countenance not unlike that of England . From the first there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Kendall conspiracy was divulged by a man named Read when on the gallows for the crime of having struck President Ratcliffe when Ratcliffe was beating him ; and in 1673 a tailor of York County was fined one hundred pounds of tobacco for putting up his mare in a race with the horse belonging to a gentleman , the stake being two hundred pounds of tobacco . Slavery , introduced in the year 1619 by Samuel Argall , and the system of indentured service emphasized the class distinctions by building up a company of great landowners whose fine , old colonial mansions are to-dav among the most interesting relics of our past history . But although devoted to the crown , they were much more devoted to their own welfare and their own rights . From the earliest period of her history the colony stood for those principles on which she was originally founded : the service of God , according to the Protestant faith ; the establishment of English civilization ; the rights of English-born citizens . Through the long contest with the crown she stood valiantly for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her assembly , her records were given up to the crown , she stood up in the pillory the clerk who gave them , and clipped his ear . When the Revolution broke forth in England , she stood on her rights as a commonwealth , and Cromwell deemed it expedient to make a treaty with her as with an independent power . Before many years had gone by , other colonies had been planted along the coast . Maryland , hard by , had been granted to Lord Baltimore ; Plymouth , Massachusetts Bay , had been started on the same bay where Bartholomew Gosnold had landed in 1602 ; Georgiana , further to the northward , had been founded almost on the same lines on which Virginia herself had become established . The Dutch had long settled at the mouth of the great river named for the great discoverer , Henry Hudson . And soon the Carolinas had followed . By the time that the first of these made good their footing , however , Virginia possessed a civilization substantially as much like that of England as was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western frontier . She had her vice-regal court ; she had her established church and ritual ; she had her manorial system and her monthly courts ; she had her House of Burgesses and Council patterned on the British Parliament , and , if possible , they were more jealous of their rights than the Parliament in the old country . Within half a century or a little more she was a state powerful enough to assert her rights , and , on their denial , to rise in revolution . This revolution ended at the time in the defeat and death of the gallant leader , Nathaniel Bacon , and the execution of many of his followers . But , however it ended , this point is clear : that twelve years before the English people themselves rose in revolution to establish their charter of liberties , the Virginia people had risen to make good theirs . It took them just one hundred years more to achieve their purpose . But Washington , Jefferson , Marshall , Mason , Henry , Nelson , the Lees , the Blands , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization established first on this continent at Jamestown . If credit is to be given in measure as intrepid daring and first accomplishments are rated , those three little unknown vessels , the Susan Constant , the Good Speed , and the Discovery , with their company of sixscore men who established the first English settlement on this continent , are entitled to far more credit than any vessel or company whatever which . succeeded them . They seized and held the country ; they explored and charted the coast ? they and their successors . They and their successors drove the French back to Canada on the north , and formed a bulwark against the Spanish on the south ; they built forts and towns ; established law and order and finally English civilization on the continent , with churches , schools , a university , and a legislative government . So all who came after found the way cleared and a land ready for complete settlement . And when it was settled at last , the colony of Virginia stamped her impress upon it indelibly for all generations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdoms , the first foundation , or plantation , is of more noble dignity and merit than all that followeth.
