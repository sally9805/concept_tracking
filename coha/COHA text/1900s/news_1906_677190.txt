txt Dr. DRAPER , State Commissioner of Education , is pushing hard a movement to arouse public sentiment to enforce the compulsory schooling law . For this purpose he has prepared a circular setting forth the facts regarding illiteracy in the State of New York . The general result is striking . It may be summed up briefly as follows : We are not nearly as badly off as we might be ; we are very much worse off than , with our resources , we should be . The whole document is full of material for these two deductions . For instance , the average percentage of illiteracy in the country is 10.7 ; in New York it is 5.5 only , which seems a good showing . But since 1570 we have reduced illiteracy only from 7.1 per cent . to 5.5 per cent. , while the whole country has reduced it from 20 per cent . to 10.7 per cent . We are getting on ; we are not getting on as fast as the rest of the country . We ought to get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every one is that New York is flooded with illiterate immigrants to an extent far greater than other States . That is true enough , but the percentage of foreign-born illiterates has not really changed in the State or in the country at large for forty - years . Then again it will be suggested that the crowded cities , our own especially , make the difference . As a matter of fact the illiteracy in Greater New York but Ca ; per cent. , against 3.5 per cent . in the State , and it is less than in Essex , St. Lawrence , Franklin , and Clinton ; in the latter two counties the figures run up to 14.0 per cent . and 17.9 per cent . There are twenty-five , rural counties out of the sixty-one in which illiteracy is greater than in the big cities of Brooklyn and Buffalo . The native children of native and of foreign-born parents make a still more striking showing . The ratio of illiteracy among native children of foreign-born parents in this State is only 5.7 per cent. ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly three-fifths larger . And here again the dreaded city presents a lar less discouraging picture than the rural districts . The County of New York , that is , the Borough of Manhattan , has a smaller proportion of illiterate children of native parents than any other county in the State . Kings and Queens , of Greater New York , and Erie , with the City of Buffalo , come next in order . The explanation is twofold . The cities have better schools and more of them and foreign-born parents are more eager to give their children schooling , partly because it is the best way to teach them the ready use of English , which is necessary to them . But the real situation is , nevertheless , bad and ' ought to be better . The num- ber of illiterate voters in the State of New York is 59 in every 1,000 . In Denmark the illiterates in the recruits for the army are but 1 in 500 ; in Sweden and Norway 1 in 1,250 , in the German Empire 1 in 2,500 . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 130 times more negligent of universal education than the Germans . It is a shameful fact .
