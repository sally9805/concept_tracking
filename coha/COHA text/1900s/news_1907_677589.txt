txt The Dog Tax Again . A few days ago I saw an inquiry as to the right of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to collect dog taxes . This is , I think , a pertinent and proper question , and one in which a great many of your readers are interested , and I would like to see it answered explicitly in your paper . I am a dog lover , and from time to time for years past have kept dogs for which I have paid a licence tax to the S. P. C. A. , but to what purpose I have not been able to find out . When I once complained to them about an epidemic of dog poisonings in my neighborhood , including my own dog , ( which I think fairly comes under the heading of " Cruelty to Animals , " ) I got absolutely no satisfaction or attention . Why should any private society collect a public tax ? Why should not the tax be paid to the city and the question of regulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city ?
