 | THAT policies should change as conditions do so , is the major premise of all sound reasoning concerning the problem of protection . Two new facts have transformed American industry in a way that affects this problem , and the first of these is the growth of monopolies . The selling of products at high prices at home and at lower ones abroad has become a general practice with the corporations that have command of our markets , and this single fact has everywhere raised a doubt as to the wisdom and justice of retaining the duties which make the practice possible . To the average mind it looks like taxing Americans in order to assist foreigners ; and that corporations which are not too well loved should impose this tax adds an element of hostility to it . The people feel entitled to the benefit of what is called the " most favored nation clause , " at least in their dealings with their own government , and they feel doubly entitled to it in dealing with the industries whose power and wealth they have themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , indeed , an answer to the complaint of discrimination against our own people ? the goods exported constitute an extra product , or an excess above what could otherwise be sold . After all has been made that will be taken in the home market , it is possible to manufacture more and sell it abroad ? provided always that it is sold more cheaply . Moreover , in the companies ' book-keeping the goods exported , though they are identical with the others , cost much less , and it is made to appear that the manufacturers can continue forever to make articles for foreigners much more cheaply than it is possible to make them for Americans . With a mill in running order , but having a capacity for a larger output than it is making , it is only necessary to put new laborers into the force , buy more raw material , and do a little advertising through salesmen or otherwise , in order to make and sell the further output . This part of the product is actually cheaper than the original part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producer 's point of view it is valid . He is justified in reasoning thus : " I am making a million cases of these goods for the American market , and the conditions here enable me to sell this amount at a profit , even though I charge against it all possible costs of manufacture . If I wish  | to make more and sell it elsewhere , there is no need of reckoning as a cost of this further and special output , any of those outlays which my American patrons are now defraying . How much will the extra production add to my present outlay ? is the only question I have to ask ; and it is clear that the addition will be small , and that if the foreigners will pay anything over and above this small cost I shall do well to sell to them . Moreover , there is nothing in this which will make me charge Americans any more than they are paying already . At present they bear the entire fixed cost of my business , and if I can gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs ' ? the additional outlay which the additional production involves ? I shall not have to tax Americans any more heavily . " We may concede that a typical trust which enjoys a more or less complete monopoly in America will get in the home market what it now charges , in any case . The power which it has to crush competitors at home , and the protective duty which keeps the foreign producer from its American preserve , are together sufficient to insure this . The margin that it makes on its foreign sales puts something into its own pocket , but takes no additional tribute from the American consumer . The claim , however , that this entire condition should be allowed to continue , is valid only on the supposition that the protective policy is so just and necessary that it must not be touched even though monopolies thrive by means of it . What the hard-headed American voter is beginning to see is that if the protective duty were not removed , but only somewhat reduced , the monopoly in its own market would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere . He would sell his goods in America , not for less than it costs to make them here ? for we should be certain to keep a sufficient duty to prevent that ? but for less than the specially high price which a trust is now able to get . The plan that is taking shape in many minds involves no abolition of the protective system . The general arguments in favor of that have too strong a hold on our people to be shaken , and it is not clear that they ought to be shaken . What is becoming perfectly clear is that there is a difference between a duty of a certain amount and one of a much greater amount . The one may do good and the other harm . One may introduce and foster an industry till it reaches independence ? it may enable the " infant " to grow up ; but the other may foster a monopoly within the industry , which is a very different matter . Overdoing protection in a way that is too obvious to be disclaimed ? annulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ? this is our present practice . There is a definite part of the duty on an article made by a great  | trust and sold at an exorbitant price which can be thrown off without wresting from the industry any profit that it has a right to . Its more extravagant profits , indeed , it will have to make over to the public that consumes its goods . It would have had to do this in any case if it had not crushed competition at home . Exposing it to the rivalry of foreigners , not on equal terms , but on terms which greatly favor it , would help to end its monopolistic charges but would leave it still in full possession of its present market so long as it should charge only what is fair . It could make ample returns and even thrive on the prices that would rule under a moderate duty . Demanding more is asking the people actually to legislate in favor of monopolies which would tax them in consequence of the legislation . What is needed is that the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreigner . Much actual competition he does not need to encounter . The mere fact that the foreigner stands ready to enter the territory whenever prices become exorbitant will prevent them from becoming so . As long as he stops short of such demands , the American producer can keep the foreigner out of his market ; but if he makes the extortionate demand the foreigner steps in . This is a condition of fair dealing with the consuming public and of fair returns for the producer ; and it is also a condition that insures technical progress in the methods of production . With foreigners ready to compete with him unless he keeps his prices at a reasonable level , the producer must be alert in utilizing new machinery as it ' appears . He must at least keep pace with foreign rivals in perfecting the art of making goods Very vital is the difference between the condition of a country which is full of secure monopolies charging high prices at home and low prices abroad , and resting on their oars in the matter of technical improvements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods reasonably and improve their methods rapidly . The difference between the former state , which is intolerable , and the latter , which is nothing less than inspiring , may be caused by changing exorbitant duties to reasonable and scientific ones ? duties which will protect an industry as such , but not a monopoly within the industry . That many a duty now in force is composed of two perfectly distinct parts , of which one does the former of these things and the other does the latter , is the striking fact of the present time , and it sets at naught all question of dealing with the tariff in its entirety as either evil or good . One part can justify itself , while the other stands condemned in every eye except that of the man who thrives from illegitimate gains . For free trade we are not ready ; but the policy that would " stand pat " p 416 convicts itself of demanding the retention of the pernicious half of the protective system with its results ? the taxing of Americans , the favoring of monopolies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of trusts were the only important change which has recently called for a modification of our protective policy , the thing to be done might be to throw off at once the injurious portion of the duties and keep the beneficial one . We spoke , however , of two recent changes that must be taken into account , and of these the second is the new attitude of foreign nations . We are discovering that they as well as American purchasers can be made weary by the insane length to which we have carried the protective policy . The tax that we put on their products is something that they can reciprocate if they will , and they are now inclined to do it . Such retaliation is one kind of reciprocity ? the returning of injuries ? and very much of this now looms up as a possibility . We are beginning to discover a new meaning in our favorite statement concerning a protective duty , " The foreigner pays the tax . " If this is true , we pay it when it is Europeans who impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . When our own duties are in question , the action of the principle is pleasant enough , but it is far otherwise when theirs are in question . We are beginning to take account of the prospect of paying taxes in this way to foreign nations . As the growth of monopolies calls for a scientific trimming and pruning of our own rank protective system , the impending action of other nations points to a plan which will make this reduction still further beneficial to us . It may induce concessions on their part , and that means the other kind of reciprocity ? the mutual conferring of benefits . The benefits we may hope for will be widely diffused , for whenever a foreigner lowers the duty on our foodstuffs , it is farmers who get a full share of the benefit . Those who suffer more than most classes from monopoly will gain more than most from reciprocity . We are no longer where we can think merely of our own protective duties and what they do for us . We must take into account the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries in retaliation for ours . If the option that is offered to us is reciprocity in injury or reciprocity in benefit , it would seem that the latter would have a clear preference , even though the concessions we might make would cost us something . It happens , however , that a large amount of benefit can be counted on from a policy that will cost the country as a whole less than nothing , though it may reduce the gains of certain monopolies . The whole system of protective duties requires re-examination , and this should go not merely to the length of considering what small modi- fications in our system of duties we can make without abandoning the principle on which the system rests . We need to know whether this very principle itself does not require a scientific division of duties into the two parts we have described , and the abolition of the evil part . We shall , in fact , actually find that the very motive which originally impelled us to impose duties , now requires that we should reduce them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the relation between the traditional argument for free trade , on the one hand , and the prevalent argument for protection on the other . We now see that they are not inconsistent with each other . They do not meet and contradict each other and force us to abandon one of them . They are , as we may say , on different planes , and we may adhere to one without throwing away the other . In accepting the plea for the fostering of " infant industries , " we find that this very policy requires us to make and apply the separation of duties into the part which protects an industry as a whole and that other part which protects a monopoly within it . The monopoly is hostile to the industry as such , and whatever fosters monopoly is not protective , but destructive . The principle on which we acted in imposing the duties , now requires us not to abolish them , but to make them smaller . An intelligent discussion of protection begins by conceding what free-traders claim as to the wastefulness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence of the protective policy . Again , the complete acceptance of what the protectionist claims as to the fostering of new industries carries with it an unanswerable demand for the reduction of excessive duties . The argument for free trade is what may be called a static argument . It would be conclusive if the conditions of to-day were destined to continue forever without change . A protective duty which now causes us to make a particular article instead of exchanging another article for it inflicts a loss upon us . With no duty , we choose the method of procuring the article which gives us the largest amount of it as the fruit of a day 's labor . We have the option of using N units of labor in making the commodity A , or using them in making the commodity B and exchanging it for A. If we get more of the A by the indirect process we naturally resort to it . Forcing ourselves to do otherwise is accepting a loss ; and if the conditions of to-day are the abiding ones ? if no new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be permanent . That is saying that if the conditions of the various countries are static , and if the methods of producing different things are so ? if no alterations occur in the processes of making them ? the waste and loss which come from interfering with profitable exchanges will continue to the end of time , and  | will always be as large as at the outset . Offsetting gains will not accrue , and the protective policy will involve a permanent sterilizing of industry . This fact is as clearly established as any proposition in physics . The protective argument , on the other hand , has rested on what we may call dynamic grounds . Important changes in the methods of production will take place , and some of them will be induced by the protective policy . We force ourselves to make something which at first we produce in an expensive way ; and , with our eyes open , we forego some of the natural return for our labor . We make one blade of grass to grow where two grew before , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly we secured two such articles in exchange for the product of that day 's labor . We consciously cause ourselves to suffer the loss which this misdirection of energy involves , and which the freetrader has from time immemorial pointed out . In the end , however , it comes about that we can and do make the article with greater economy . We first master and then improve the technique of the industry which , in so costly a way , we introduce . We invent machinery , apply cheap motive power , place our mills in favorable localities and cause them to grow to enormous size . We organize and consolidate the industry , until , in the end , a day 's labor signifies twice the product that it originally did . Now the wastefulness of the policy ceases . We get the two blades of grass which we got originally , instead of the one with which , for a time , we forced ourselves to be contented , and we live in the hope that we may ultimately get three . This means that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us as many such goods as a day 's labor spent in making something else to exchange for them . The growth of the industry in size and economy has put an end to the waste and loss which the policy originally entailed , and a further growth will probably yield a profit . In the end , as we believe , we shall be able to make more of the goods by the expenditure of a unit of labor than we could get by spending it in making other goods to barter for them . The intelligent protectionist accepts the static argument in favor of free trade . He admits the wastefulness of protection and concedes that if the conditions of production never changed , the waste would never disappear . He points , however , to the fact that the conditions will change . Instead of taking a stationary state as a premise he takes a progressive one , and this invalidates the former conclusion . The state to which industries in America have now attained justifies this claim ; but if we cast a backward glance over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that a part of the claim of the free-trader has also been justified . The iron industry , the perennial infant of the  | protective system , has cost an immense deal in the introducing and developing . Yet who would now be willing to be without it ? The waste and loss have been suffered up to a point at which the industry has attained a certain growth and perfection . This waste has become less with time , and , in the case of some branches of industry , it has given place to an undoubted gain . From Alexander Hamilton 's first protective duties , few and insignificant as they would seem to a protectionist of the present day , down to the Dingley tariff , with its drastic curtailment of natural exchanges , burdens and losses have attended the system ; and yet the policy has already brought us to a point where many of the wastes have shrunk to nil and others are shrinking . More mills and larger and better ones than we should otherwise have had have come into existence under the costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has put the whole process of manufacturing goods on such a plane of economy that a protectionist may plausibly argue that the labor of the country is already more productive than it would have been if trade had always been free . Much capital and labor which would have been forced to employ themselves in mining and agriculture have betaken themselves to the mills . Mining and agriculture are subject to a law of diminishing returns . Overwork the land and you get less and less out of it ; and we should have worked the land much harder than we have done if it had not been for the manufacturing . The mills , on the other hand , have become more productive with time , and the comparisons between the results gained in the mill with those that might have been gained on the farm have grown steadily more favorable to the mill . No one can now intelligently claim that protection has from the start enriched the country ; but , on the other hand , no one can intelligently deny that its after-effects may enrich the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . An increase has come in the recent years during which machinery and organization have given to manufacturing an efficiency not before attained . It is all due to the changes that have come about in production ? to " dynamic " causes . It is of vital consequence that these changes should continue . It is not reasonable to expect that they will fully continue under duties which foster monopoly . With no reference to any one particular duty , we have defined the general change that most needs to be made in our protective system . It is , for the country , a cheap reform , since it costs less than nil ; but there is some loss connected with it for those who are now taxing the country unduly . These monopolists , however , can make no plea for  | the sparing of gains so secured , and the measure lets them keep all lawful ones . It would be the easiest bit of essential reforming that a people could be asked to carry through ? if only it would prove to be as feasible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to defeat measures which have corporate interests arrayed against them , this article does not undertake to say , and there is little need of saying . There is a clear policy before the country ? a scientific treatment of protective duties , which means justice for all , and a gain for all , limited only by a rule of justice . The thing first to be done is to put the facts before the public and ask for a verdict on them . The reduction of duties which sustain monopolies is not , indeed , the only change that the interests of the people call for . There is another type of protective duty which has no valid claim to continuance . It differs from the excessive duty on manufactures in two respects . First , it does not , as a rule , foster monopolies , but is designed to benefit a class which is as hostile to monopoly as any that the country contains , namely , the farmers . Moreover , most of the duties of this kind do not accomplish very much for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , without a trace of protection , we should create and export , has , as a rule , only minor effects of any kind . It is not needed for the sake of diverting labor and capital to the occupation thus fostered , for they go there in any case . Moreover , the infant-industry argument usually counts in an adverse way in the case of products of agriculture . We nurse a branch of manufacturing through its years of helplessness for the reason that it will afterward become independent ; but in a branch of agriculture the early years are usually those of greatest productivity . Producing foodstuffs and such raw materials as cotton , wool , hides , hemp , lumber , etc. , grows costlier as time goes by . These are industries of diminishing returns , and the lessening of their productivity is brought about by two causes . First , many of these products are created by a process that has been called " land butchery . " For a term of years it is allowed to sap the fertility of the soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertility have to be artificially supplied , the production becomes a costly operation . These effects are very well illustrated by such lands as have been exploited for cotton , tobacco , hemp , or wheat . Denuding the land of forests is , of course , a reckless exploitation ; but scarcely less so is the tillage of hillsides on a plan that lets the loam make its way to the valleys . On all sides the earth is yielding not its produce , but itself , to the daring hands that are taking out its phosphorus , nitrogen , and what-not ? cutting pounds of flesh near the heart by selecting and abstracting the most vital elements . Again , the mere crowding of the land , even though its fertility were  | not impaired , would reduce the returns of labor spent on it . One man on ten acres can get a much larger product than he can on five , and the growth of population , which steadily enlarges the number of men on the square unit of tillable land , reduces in this way men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows to full strength , agriculture begins in strength and goes on to something resembling decadence , or at least to a state in which the returns from it become smaller for each unit of labor expended . It follows that the argument by which protection usually justifies itself has no application to duties on agricultural produce . If any branch of tillage begins its career as a weakling , it will be weaker still thereafter . Moreover , the free-trader 's objection to duties which call labor from more productive occupations to less productive ones has here the fullest force . The waste which protection entails , whenever it does thus divert labor to unproductive fields , bids fair in some branches of agriculture to be permanent . To the end of time we can get more sugar for a day 's labor by making goods and exporting them to regions where cane-growing flourishes than we can by raising sugar beets , and the loss which the protection of raw sugar entails on the country will grow larger rather than smaller with advancing years . The effect of a duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparing the Canadian will become clearer and more deplorable as this destruction becomes more and more complete . In the case of most produce of the soil such evil effects are not experienced , for the reason that duties on them are nearly inoperative . They are worth little to the farmer , and do little harm to other classes . How much would the farmer gain and the country lose by a duty on cotton ? The price would remain essentially the same , whether duties were put on or removed . On a few things duties have been imposed which have somewhat benefited farmers and considerably harmed the remainder of the people ; and the injury from such duties will continue indefinitely . On more kinds of produce duties have been placed which have little effect for good or for ill . There is a chance for a large transaction in the line of what we may term internal reciprocity ? an exchange of benefits by two classes of our own people . A " deal " of an unhappy kind has won the farmer 's assent to exorbitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , on condition that his own produce be also protected . Duties such as now prevail on products of the mill mean somewhat monopolistic prices for goods , and they thus really and seriously burden the farmer ; while duties on his own product amount to little in the way of increasing his revenues . That this should seem to the farmer a fair exchange  | of favors is strange . It is a bargain whereby the farmer gives a dollar and gets a dime , and either considers the bargain even or accepts it as such for lack of power to do better . Now , there is a chance for another kind of reciprocity between farmers and manufacturers . Let the farmer give up the duties on his own products , which do him little good , and make the monopolistic manufacturers yield the unnecessary portion of the duties on their products , which does the farmer very considerable harm . The balance of effects will be in favor of the farmer . He will gain by the curbing of monopoly far more than he will lose by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty on wheat will not greatly affect him ; but curbing the monopolies which control the prices of implements , fuel , etc. , will greatly benefit him . There are , then , two concessions which we can readily make to foreigners whose markets we seek to win . Each of them means a removal of duties which ought to be removed in any case . Simply to abolish them would be one gain , and to induce the foreigner to unbar some of his doors would be another gain . They are , first , the unnecessary parts of duties on articles produced by monopolies ; and secondly , nearly all duties on farming products . To the country in its entirety , parting with both of these is a good riddance . Whatever we can thereby win from foreign countries will do us a further good ; and an important fact is that such gains will accrue very largely to these same farmers . They will thereby win markets abroad for their ' own special products , and this will be an addition to the gain that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ground the farmers could afford to sacrifice all the duties on their own produce if in return the manufacturers would sacrifice the excess of the duties on theirs . Through the opening up of foreign markets both the farmers and the manufacturers are the gainers . Whether such reciprocal benefits between different classes at home will reconcile either to the surrender of duties may be somewhat doubtful ; but it should more than reconcile the country to the abolition of them . Will such a thing be done because the interests of the country require it ? Yes , if the people perceive this fact and act on it ; but not otherwise . Even the reduction of the exorbitant duties on manufactured goods will be impossible so long as a little minority shall have its way . This element will surely " stand pat , " and the country itself may be forced to do so until the effects of so doing become still greater and clearer . An opposition of interest between the few and the many is often decided in favor of the few . Now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole , as was once facetiously said by President Lincoln concerning his own administration , " We have little influence . " If this is the case , all effort to secure reciprocity will fail , as it will , of course , if the people do not perceive the effects of the duties which need removal . There may be at some time a need of purchasing a freer outlet for our exports by concessions that will actually cost us something ; but those which are here advocated are of the kind that cost less than nothing . It remains to be seen whether we shall be unwise enough or impotent enough to lose the double benefit which such concessions would secure .
