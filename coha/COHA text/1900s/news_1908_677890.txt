txt Responsibility for Much Pneumonia . I have read with interest the letter of Dr. Samuel G. Tracy In your issue of this date , and realize the value of suggestions made by him to prevent influenza and pneumonia . But how many of the 1,202 deaths from pneumonia in New York thy last month would not have occurred if the surface and elevated cars had been properly heated ? I came to town last Sunday , convalescing from pneumonia , and rode in a Fourteenth Street car from the Twenty-third Street ferry , North River , to Brooklyn via the Williamsburg Bridge , and then in a Marcy Avenue ( Brooklyn ) car , and neither was heated . I prevailed upon the conductor to keep the rear door closed , but I was chilled when I arrived home . Has the Public Service Commission paid any attention to this matter ?
