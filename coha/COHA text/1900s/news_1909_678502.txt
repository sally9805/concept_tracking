txt STARTING SUBWAY TRAINS . Platform Men Order Signals While Doorways Remain Open . If there is a law against giving the signals to go ahead on the Subway trains before the doors are closed it should be strictly enforced . I to-day saw a woman violently thrown from a moving car to the crowded platform of the Grand Central Station . She was endeavoring to effect an entrance in the crowded and open doorway when the train started . While the door remained open the starter from the platform had given the signal to the guard on the car to go , the starter evidently thinking that all those trying to get aboard could do so before the signal should reach the motorman . This method of starting the express trains during the rush hours can be daily seen at any of the crowded stations . CORNELIUS BRUREY.
