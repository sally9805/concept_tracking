txt The renewal of the movement for a " treaty of arbitration with Great Britain is timely so far as this country is concerned , though it may not so be regarded at this moment on the other side . It can not be denied that the result of the Alaskan Commission and the recent operations of the United States Executive in Panama have aroused a certain suspicion as to the desirability of too close relations with our Government . This , however , is likely to be a passing mood , and the essential harmony of interests between the two countries , so far outweighing the matters of difference , will , we think , bring the British people and our own to an agreement for arbitration in due time . The need for this is all the plainer because the differences when they do arise are apt to be precisely of the sort that excite the passions of both people , and especially excite the passions of the British colony to the north of us . The matter we referred to the other day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay , is a case in point . A very small and insignificant fraction of the American people is interested in those rights or even aware what they are or are claimed to be . But those who actually are interested are very eagerly so , and they are likely to find ardent advocates in the Senators from New England , as similar classes always have found . On the other hand , the feeling in Canada as to this point is Strong in the maritime provinces , and the Dominion Government has taken their claims very much in earnest . The sending of an officer of the Northwestern Mounted Police as Governor of the region where the dispute arises , with orders to expel American whalers from their settlements on the coast and to drive them from the waters of the bay , if found there , is an extreme measure , which , if carried out to the letter , may produce a lot of bad feeling . It is this kind of dispute that should be determined by arbitration . Since the difficult questions involved in the ClaytonBuiwer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new convention is much improved , and no one could be a better leader in the matter than ex-Secretary Of State Posrna.
