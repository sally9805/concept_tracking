WHAT kind of ants are flying ants ? " This question is often asked by persons who fancy that there is a distinct species of ants that have wings . All known ants , one small genus excepted , are " flying ants " in their ancestral origin . The males and females are born with wings , which the males keep until death , and the females scam lose . A complete formicary contains one or more fertile queens , workers of two or more castes , and young males and females . The last are sometimes called ' " virgin queens , " for they are the predestined royal mothers of ants . l3oth sexes are carefully attended by workers of the community , who feed them just as they do the baby ants or larva . They remain within the home nest until nature , with vigilant concern to perpetuate the race , prompts to the swarming or " marriage flight . " Usually the workers assist nature . One may see males and females being driven out of the nest and from the surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their jaws , and otherwise give them notice that their room is held to be better than their company . During their pupilage these winged members of the formicary lead a lazy and merry life . While studying the habits of the Agricultural ant of Texas , the writer saw sonic of them enjoying an outing upon the large circular pavement or plaza which surrounded the central gates of an immense formicary . Their visits to the outer air were not frequent ; but they were plainly made for exercise and the benefit of the sunshine . One female was seen swinging , with evident gusto , upon a grass stalk , not unlike a youth on a turning-bar . On another plaza a bunch of young queens were having a joint outing , a sort of picnic which they heartily enjoyed . A large pebble near the gate was the chief sporting - ground . This they would ascend , and facing the wind , would sit erect upon their hind legs , taking as veritable a rampant posture as any heraldist could wish . Several of the queenlings would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensued a playful passage at arms for position , They pinched one another with their mandibles and chased one another from favorite spots . One was reminded of a group of boys sparring for place upon a big rock , or a bevy of girls in a game of " tag . " So universal and natural is the impulse to play among the young of all living creatures , from an ant to man . Time the brief youth of the winged dependents of the formicary is passed in idleness and comes - when they must go forth from their native city , to return no more . It would seem a sharp change and a most radical one ; but nature has prepared the adventurers for it . Commonly the marriage flight occurs during the autumn . On a warm evening of a September day one may see multitudes of newly exiled male and female ants fluttering above the surface of the earth , the mass rising and falling as the members weave to and fro as in the mazes of a dance . Again , winged individuals may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying away until lost to sight , or until they drop to the ground , where they may locate their " claim " for a new city . Strange stories have been written and told of the immense numbers that escape in the swarming season from myriads of ant-hills , darkening the air , and covering several inches thick the surface of rivers and lakes , and even of the sea . Some accounts may be exaggerated ; but enough facts are known , of which there is no doubt at all , to justify belief of most of them . The writer has seen a swarm so vast as to shade the earth like a light cloud . When one considers that these myriads of creatures are , up to this point , supported wholly by the labor of the workers ; and that in addition the care and nurture of the numerous larva ? , the excavating of galleries and rooms for the extension of the community , defensive and sentinel duty , and foraging for supplies , all are wrought by the same class , ? he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model of industry . But he who would find an ideal commonwealth , wherein are no non-producing classes and individuals , and where all work for the community , must go elsewhere than to an ant-hill . After the marriage flight , the males soon perish . Most of them fall victims to birds and insects of various sorts ; but such as escape these enemies hide under stones , or in hollows of the ground , or underneath shrubbery , and being unable to provide for themselves , soon die . Their mandibles , which are the implements of war and industry among emmet tribes , are usually rounded , feeble , and unsuited for active service . It seems a cruel transition from being communal favorites and objects of unceasing care to a state of exile and aban donment to death . It is another form of that harsh dealing with the useless members of society that one sees among their hymenopterous cousins , the bees . 1 ; ut the active savagery of the beehive appears in the formicary as neglect . The result in each case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of the bees with their drones is the more merciful of the two . Nature , as operative in these vital atoms , having secured the perpetuation of the species , casts aside the individual when the one function for which he was provided has been performed . It is another example of Tennyson 's large deduction : So careful of the type she seems , So careless of the single life . Every female and worker is furnished with two strong movable jaws , or mandibles , hollowed inside like the palm of a hand and with toothed edges . With these they gather food , defend themselves against foes , open out homes in wood , as do the carpenter ants , or excavate galleries underneath the earth 's surface and rear mounds upon it , as do the mason ants . As soon as the home flitting is over , they settle upon the ground or on a tree , and first of all begin to " undress . " They know ? although one can only wonder how ? that their wings can be of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ground or tunnelling in the fibres of wood . Therefore , by pulling and rubbing , they rid themselves of those gauzy in-cumbrances . This accompli sh e d , the queen ? for she may now be truly ranked as a founder of a house , although without a following ? makes for herself a nest in a small cave in the ground or in a slight hollow in a tree . Therein she lays several eggs , from which a small brood of worker ants is hatched ; since the needs of the formicary first require workers . The eggs which produce males are not hatched until later . Whether , as in the case of bees , ants are able to develop queens from ordinary worker larvae by special food and treatment , is not known . But Lord Avebury has shown that eggs are occasionally dropped by workers , who are really undeveloped females , and which always produce males . While the first brood is maturing , the queen attends to all domestic duties . She is a fair type of the primitive human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ; digs out a new room for a nursery , if need be ; washes and cleanses with her tongue her infant progeny ; feeds them in the way common among ants , by regurgitation ; and , in short , nurses and nourishes them until they are full-grown ants . Then they are set to work for themselves . Their first duty is to assist in nursing their younger brothers and sisters . They take to this without instruction and while they are yet callow antlings . As they become a little toughened and hardened , they are pushed out-of-doors to help the queen mother gather food . By and by they are strong enough to assist in the work of house-building , and begin digging out new galleries and rooms . Thus the work goes on and enlarges as the colony grows . All this time the queen continues to lay eggs . There is need for an immense number , for there is great loss of life in an ordinary . ant-hill . The daily exigencies of service among these little creatures are extremely severe . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The feet of passing beasts and human beings crush multitudes . These frequent losses have to be made up by the fertility of the royal mother ; and by and by it becomes necessary for her to devote herself wholly to increasing the colony . Foraging for supplies is abandoned . Household work , domestic service , nursery duty , are gradually given up , and the workers of the growing community take those tasks upon themselves . The queen is restricted to the function of motherhood . Therein lies her supreme claim to sovereignty . The ant queen 's subjection to her subjects is not reached without resistance on the part of her emmet majesty . But . resistance is useless , and she becomes in the end subject to the powerful house which she has reared around her . She is confined closely to the interior of the formicary , and wherever she goes , through chambers and halls , is attended by a circle of workers known as " courtiers , " ? a name that has a large and dignified sound . But the courtiers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrain the liberty of their sovereign within the bounds prescribed by the communal needs , and to look after the eggs when they are dropped . Almost necessarily this phase of ant life must be observed in artificial formicaries . Therein one may watch the courtiers surrounding the queen in a circle , attending her during all her movements . The circle never ceases to close around her as she passes from place to place . Sometimes the queen , falling into a fit of stubbornness , will attempt a course different from that which her court prescribes . Then one attendant gently nips a leg and gives it a little push ; another closes the mandibles upon the body and gives a slight pinch ; a third tenderly seizes a quivering antenna and draws it to this side or that . The whole body - guard meanwhile closes around the queen , and by pushing her and obstructing her path diverts her course , or quite turns her around , her huge body , several times as large as a worker 's , moving sometimes readily , sometimes with sullen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once a queen escaped from the surface gate of one of my formicaries . Not a courtier was in sight . She was free ! Off she ran , as though intending to have a good romp and enjoy her freedom . But she had reckoned without her host , for she had gone but a little way when her body-guard pursued and seized her somewhat roughly , and immediately began to pull her backward toward the gate . She resisted sturdily , but at last gave way , and was drawn down the opening into the royal domicile . Poor queen ! Certes , there are some drawbacks to the dignities that hedge about an emmet throne . The courtiers maintain their circular sentry while the queen is laying eggs . When they are laid , a worker catches up the tiny white pellets and pulls them to one side . Then they are borne away into the nurseries , wherein all eggs arc set aside , and watched and cared for by the workers who have the special charge of that department . From what has been written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly applied by en-tomologists and others to the fertile female of hymenopterous insects , such as bees , wasps , and ants , is misleading to the general reader . The functions of the ant queen seem to be limited to those above de-scribed , namely , first , the mason - work and other labors necessary to establish the original nucleus of a formieery ; and , subsequently , the increase of the colony by depositing eggs . There is really no headship analogous to that which the word " queen " expresses among men . The entire administration of the community appears to be in the hands of the workers . All changes , such as emigration to a now nest , or wars of defence and offence , or the extension of the public works , are directed by them . These movements appear at times to be spontaneous in an entire community , and the reasons for them are often beyond human ken ; but sometimes they plainly lie in special annoyance , inconvenience , danger , or necessity . Every ant seems to be a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . The only sovereignty which it recognizes is that of personal influence and example , which create a potent social atmosphere or environment . When this becomes effective upon the individual worker , it is urged forward in the line of labor , apparently wholly independent of other rule or restraint than that which its task imposes . In fact , the proverb which , many centuries ago , described the wise workers of the ant-hill as " having community , and , as far as can be seen , not at all with regard to the dignity and office of the royal mother herself . How long may an ant queen live ? In their natural habitat some queens doubtless have short lives ; but by reason of the protection afforded them , and the seclusion enforced by the workers , they probably live much longer than other members of the community . Within artificial surroundings they attain a comparatively long life . The oldest ennnet queen known to science was one preserved under the care of Sir John Lubbock , later Lord Avebury . A number of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country - seat , High Elms , Kent , the writer for the first time saw this venerable sovereign , living in the ingenious artificial formicary which had been prepared for her . She was then in the prime of life , as it afterward appeared , being seven years old . In the summer of 1887 Sir John was again visited , this time at his town house in London . After greetings , he was asked about his royal pet . " I have sad news to tell you , " he answered . " What ? Is the queen dead ? " " She died only yesterday . I have not had the heart to tell the news as yet even to my wife . " Having offered my hearty condolence , I asked to see the dead queen . Sir Joint led the way to the room where his artificial nests were kept . The glass case which contained the special formicary in which the old ant had lived was opened up . Lying in one of the larger open spaces or rooms was the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were tenderly licking her . touching her with their antennae . and making other demonstrations as if soliciting her attention , or desiring to wake her out of sleep . Poor , dumb , loving , faithful creatures ! There was no response . Their queen mother lay motionless beneath their demonstrations . " They do not appear to have discovered that she is really dead , " remarked Sir John . Afterward he wrote me of another queen which died at the age of fourteen . The ants dragged her body about with them when they moved until it fell to pieces .
