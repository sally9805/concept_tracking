txt It is not easy to grasp at once the fun significance of what Princeton has done in adopting the tutorial system , which the undergraduates are expected to find in force whey they return in the Autumn . It is perhaps the most radical change that any American university has ever made in its methods and organization . The American ideal , as American colleges have grown from small colleges to big ones , and then to universities , has steadily tended to approach the German . The step that Princeton has taken , as soon as it shall be measurably accomplished , will be a long one in the direction of the English . That ideal , as it is carried out at Oxford and Cambridge , involves the closest contact of the undergraduate with his one tutor . He is under his continual guidance and instruction in study , and frequently in relations of social intimacy with him . And though GIBBON , a century and a quarter ago , could speak of the collegians as the " live stock " of the tutors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember with gratitude and affection . Most of what the student gets out of his college ' work he gets through his tutor , in this way . The university lectures are few and insignificant in the scheme of things . What the university does Is to examine those who wish to obtain her various grades of scholarly distinction . and to accomplish it in the most exacting and thorough-going way . To prepare for this is the duty of the respective colleges  --  that is , of the tutors who are their agencies . Now Princeton Is certainly not to be made over during the Summer vacation into an English university , with its colleges and tutors , and itself reduced to an examining board . It would be manifestly impossible , even if the authprities wished to do it , which they do not . For one thing , the English tutor is a highly , specialized product of educational evolution , and with his characteristic qualities as a very lively , strenuous , and efficient leader of youth , has not been produced on American soil in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the same place in Prince- ton as , their English prototypes take in Oxford and Cambridge , they will have to develop a method , a point of view , and a general trend of feeling of their own that , do not now exist . There must be a tradition and ' a background for the system , which will , be only gradually worked . oixt : It . may be doubted if the personal relation , the Intimacy that comes over so'clal contact at breakfast , luncheon , and dinner , will soon be developed to the degree in which . it exists in England  --  the American tradition , at present , is all against it . But the immediate results in some ways ought to be extremely interesting and important . They will , it may be assumed , tend toward making the student 's point of departure less the " course , " as it has been developed in the American universities , than the whole general subject In which he is working . There ought to be less of getting up tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of independence and of initiative on the student 's part . He is to become more of a " reading man " and lees of a mere pupil receiving instruction . Singly , if need be , or as a member of a small group , he will be given subjects to read up and supplied with advice and assistance by his guide , counselor , and friend in preparing them . the work of each department will be drawn together and studied as a related group rather than as single and separate subjects under different masters . The student will be relieved from constant drill in those matters which he carries most easily , and In which he needs little assistance , and will be supplied with the best possible aids in those which come hardest to him , i and in which the stin3ulus , of direct contact with trained scholars is most vital to him . Such assistance will be practically accessible at all times . There will be lectures and classroom work to supplement independent reading only for the sake of stimulation and systematic drill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted , adding that " under such a system the most interesting men in the teaching body would have an opportunity to gain personal access to the student , and the greater lecturers would be constantly supplemented and interpreted by tutors who will guide the men 's reading . " GIBBON spoke in scorn of the " Silence of Oxford professors in his day , which " deprived the youth of public instruction imperfectly supplied by the tutors . " They are not silent to-day ; but the Princeton professors expect to be still less inarticulate , and will , indeed . do their part also in the tutorial oversight . But the plan will obviously require a very large increase in the teaching forces of the university , an increase quite unprecedented , and ' involving an expense that PreSident WILSON has estimated at two millions and a half for its systematic establishment . But the torrent of educational benefactions is more beneficently copious this year than ever before , and Princeton may confidently expect a stream to irrigate this new soil she has prepared . For her adventurous experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to demand enthusiastic support .
