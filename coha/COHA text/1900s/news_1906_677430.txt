txt The Crapsey Case . As one among many or our clergy whose names do not appear in print , and yet who are vitally interested in the Church we love and . honor , I want to thank you for your sane and candid articles on the Crapsey case , and particularly for that in your paper to-day on " Dr. Crapsey . " Would that he might have seen his way to withdraw from the ministry of the Church long before the necessity of such a trial as this ! May I also express my surprise and regret that Mr. Edward M. Shepard . in his letter In THE TIMES to-day , should presume to imply that our " fathers in God " are devoting their energies to deplete this Church of its men of " conscience and self-sacrifice " as well as of " energy and eloquence . " It is passing strange that a man of Mr Shepard 's years and experience should so forget himself as to make public a statement so unwarranted and unworthy . I protest against it , for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than these same " fathers in God " upon whom he would bring the greatest discredit .
