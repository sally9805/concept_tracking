THE exquisite skill and accurate knowledge observable in the lives of the lower animals , which men generally have regarded as instinctive ? born with them ? have ever been subjects of wonder . In the hands of the natural theologian , whose armory has been steadily impoverished in proportion as mystery has given way before science , instinct is still a powerful weapon . When the divine expatiates on the innate wisdom and the marvelous untaught dexterity of beasts , birds , and insects , he is in little danger of being checked by the men of science . His learned enemies are dumb , when in triumph he asks the old question : Who taught the nations of the field and wood To shun their poison and to choose their food ? Prescient , the tides or tempests to withstand , Build on the ware , or arch beneath the sand ? The very little that our psychologists have done for instinct may be told in a few words . The only theory of instinct , of the nature of an explanation , is that put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evolution ; but , as a theory , it is only beginning to be understood and appreciated among scientific men ; while some eminent thinkers question the reality of the phenomena to be explained . Professor Bain , our other psychologist , and his able following of trained disciples , simply discredit the alleged facts of instinct . Unfortunately , however , instead of putting the matter to the test of observation and experiment , they have contented themselves with criticizing the few accidental observations that have been recorded , and with arguing against the probability of instinctive knowledge . In defending the Berkeleian Theory of Vision , Professor Bain , in answer to the assertion that theyoung of the lower animals manifest an instinctive perception of distance by the eye , contends that there does not exist a body of careful and adequate observations on the early movements of animals . ' Writing lcng ago on the same subject , Mr. Mill also , while admitting that the facts relating to the young of the lower animals have been long felt to be a real stumbling-block in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mental operations of animals is too imperfect to enable  | us to affirm positively that they have this instinct . ' Denying the facts , however , was not Mr. Mill 's mode of saving the theory . He was rather of opinion that the animals have to us an inexplicable facility both of finding and selecting the objects which their wants require . ' How very inexplicable , he conceives , their mental operations may possibly be , may be gathered from the fact of his suggesting an experiment to ascertain whether a blind duckling might not find the water as readily as one having sight . The position of psychologists of the too purely analytical school , however , is not that the facts of instinct are inexplicable ; but that they are incredible . This view is set out most explicitly in the article on instinct ' in ' Chambers 's Encyclopaedia . ' Thus : " It is likewise said that the chick recognizes grains of corn at first sight , and can so direct its movements as to pick them up at once ; being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to measure the distance of objects instinctively , and to graduate its movements to that knowledge ? all which is , in the present state of our acquaintance with the laws of mind , wholly incredible . " And it is held that all the supposed examples of instinct may be ? for anything that has yet been observed to the contrary ? nothing more than cases of rapid learning , imitation or instruction . Thus it would appear that with regard to instinct we have yet to ascertain the facts . With a view to this end , I have made many observations and experiments , mostly on chickens . The question of instinct , as opposed to acquisition , has been discussed chiefly in connection with the perceptions of distance and direction by the eye and the ear . Against the instinctive character of these perceptions it is argued , that as distance means movement , locomotion , the very essence of the idea is such as can not be taken in by the eye or ear ; that what the varying sensations and feelings of sight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the ground ? by experience . On the other hand , it is alleged that , though as regards man the prolonged helplessness of infancy stands in the way of the observer , we have only to look at the young of the lower animals to see that as a matter of fact they do not require to go through the process of learning the meaning of their sensations in relation to external things ; that chickens , for example , run about , pick up crumbs , and follow the call of their mother immediately on leaving the shell . For putting this matter to the test of experiment , chickens , therefore , are most suitable and convenient subjects . I have observed and experimented on more than fifty chickens , taking them from under the hen while yet in the eggs . But of these , not one on emerging from the shell was in a condition to manifest an acquaintance with the qualities of the outer world . On leaving the shell they are wet and helpless ; they struggle with their legs , wings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their heads . Soon , however , they may be distinctly seen and felt pressing against and endeavoring to keep in  | contact with any warm object . They advance very rapidly . I have seen them hold up their heads well , peck at objects , and attempt to dress their wings when only between four and five hours old . But there is no difficulty in conceiving that , with great spontaneity and a strong power of association , much might be learned in four or five hours . Professor Bain is of opinion , from observations of his own on a newly dropped lamb , that a power that the creature did not at all possess naturally , got itself matured as an acquisition in a few hours . ' Accordingly , in the absence of precautions , the time that must elapse before chickens have acquired enough control over their muscles to enable them to give evidence as to their instinctive power of interpreting what they see and hear , would suffice to let in the contention that the eye and the ear may have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the eye , I had recourse to the following expedient . Taking eggs just when the little prisoners had begun to break their way out , I removed a piece of the shell , and before they had opened their eyes drew over their heads little hoods , which , being furnished with an elastic thread at the lower end , fitted close round their necks . The material of these hoods was in some cases such as to keep the wearers in total darkness ; in other instances it was semi-transparent . Some of them were close at the upper end , others had a small aperture bound with an elastic thread , which held tight round the base of the bill . In this state of blindness ? the blindness was very manifest ? I allowed them to remain from one to three days . The conditions under which these little victims of human curiosity were first permitted to see the light were then carefully prepared . Frequently the interesting little subject was unhooded on the center of a table covered with a large sheet of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alive , had been placed . From that instant every movement , with the date thereof , as shown by the watch , was put on record . Never in the columns of a Court Journal were the doings of the most royal personage noted with such faithful accuracy . This experiment was performed on twenty separate chickens at different times , with the following results . Almost invariably they seemed a little stunned by the light , remained motionless for several minutes , and continued for some time less active than before they were unhooded . Their behavior , however , was in every case conclusive against the theory that the perceptions of distance and direction by the eye are the result of experience , of associations formed in the history of each individual life . Often at the end of two minutes they followed with their eyes the movements of crawling insects , turning their heads with all the precision of an old fowl . In from two to fifteen minutes they pecked at some speck or insect , showing not merely an instinctive perception of distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with something like infallible accuracy . They did not attempt to seize things beyond their  | reach , as babies are said to grasp at the moon ; and they may be said to have invariably hit the objects at which they struck ? they never missed by more than a hair 's breadth , and that , too , when the specks at which they aimed were no bigger , and less visible , than the smallest dot of an i . To seize between the points of the mandibles at the very instant of striking seemed a more difficult operation . I have seen a chicken seize and swallow an insect at the first attempt : most frequently , however , they struck five or six times , lifting once or twice before they succeeded in swallowing their first food . The unacquired power of following by sight was very plainly exemplified in the case of a chicken that , after being unhooded , sat complaining and motionless for six minutes , when I placed my hand on it for a few seconds . On removing my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all round the table . To take , by way of example , the observations in a single case a little in detail : A chicken that had been made the subject of experiments on hearing , was unhooded when nearly three days old . For six minutes it sat chirping and looking about it ; at the end of that time it followed with its head and eyes the movements of a fly twelve inches distant ; at ten minutes it made a peck at its own toes , and the next instant it made a vigorous dart at the fly , which had come within reach of its neck , and seized and swallowed it at the first stroke ; for seven minutes more it sat calling and looking about it , when a hive-bee coming sufficiently near was seized at a dart and thrown some distance , much disabled . For twenty minutes it sat on the spot where its eyes had been unveiled without attempting to walk a step . It was then placed on rough ground within sight and call of a hen with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a minute , it started off towards the hen , displaying as keen a perception of the qualities of the outer world as it was ever likely to possess in after life . It never required to knock its head against a stone to discover that there was no road that way . ' It leaped over the smaller obstacles that lay in its path and ran round the larger , reaching the mother in as nearly a straight line as the nature of the ground would permit . This , let it be remembered , was the first time it had ever walked by sight  | . It would be out of place here to attempt to indicate the full psychological bearing of these facts . But this much may be affirmed , that they put out of court all those who are prepared only to argue against the instinctive perception by the eye of the primary qualities of the external world . When stripped of all superfluous learning , the argument against this and every other alleged case of instinctive knowledge is simply that it is unscientific to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question may have been acquired in the ordinary way . But the experiments that have been recounted are evidence that prior to experience chickens behave as if they already possessed an acquaintance with the established order of nature . A hungry chick that never tasted food is able , on seeing a fly or a spider for the first time , to bring into action muscles that were never so exercised before , and to perform a series of delicately adjusted movements that end in the capture of the insect . This I assert as the result of careful observation and experiment ; and it can not be answered but by observation and experiment at least as extensive . It is no doubt common for scientific men to discredit new facts , for no other reason than that they do not fit with theories that have been raised on too narrow foundations ; but when they do this they are only geologists , or psychologists ? they are not philosophers . Before passing to the perceptions of the ear , it may be mentioned that , instead of hooding chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many interesting observations on them when in a state of blindness , I occasionally put a few eggs , when just chipped , into a flannel bag made for the purpose . In this bag the hatching was completed artificially , and the chickens allowed to remain in the dark from one to three days . When placed in the light they deported themselves as regards sight in the manner already described . For the purpose  | of merely testing the perceptions of the eye or the ear this is by far the easier experiment . The hooding process requires considerable delicacy of manipulation , and the chickens are very liable to be injured . With respect now to the space perceptions of the ear , which , in man at least , even Mr. Spencer regards as acquired by each individual . Chickens hatched and kept in the said bag for a day or two , when taken out and placed nine or ten feet from a box in which a hen with chicks were concealed , after standing for a minute or two , uniformly set off straight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they had never seen and never before heard . This they did , struggling through grass and over rough ground , when not yet able to stand steadily on their legs . Nine chickens were thus experimented upon , and each individual gave the same positive results , running to the box scores of times , and from every possible position . To vary the experiment I tried the effect of the mother 's voice on hooded chickens . These , when left to themselves , seldom made a forward step , their movements were round and round , and backward ; but when placed within five or six feet of the mother , they , in answer to her call , became much more lively , began to make little forward journeys , and soon followed her by sound alone , though , of course , blindly , keeping their heads close to the ground and knocking against everything that lay in their path . Only three chickens were made subjects of this experiment . Another experiment consisted in rendering chickens deaf for a time by sealing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped from the shell . I tried at different times to stop the ears of a good many in this way , but a number of them got the papers off , others were found not quite deaf , and only three remained perfectly indifferent to the voice of the mother when separated from them by only an inch board . These had their ears opened when between two and three days old , and on being placed within call of the mother hidden in a box , they , after turning round a few times , ran straight to the spot whence came what must have been very nearly , if not actually , the first sound they had ever heard . It seems scarcely necessary to make any comment on these facts . They are conclusive against the theory that , in the history of each life , sounds are at first but meaningless sensations ; that the direction of the sounding object , together with all other facts concerning it , must be learned entirely from experience . If now it be taken as established that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least manifest an instinctive knowledge of the relations and qualities of external things , the popular belief that the special knowledge , the peculiar art and skill , so marked in the various species of animals , come to them mostly without the labor of acquisition , is at once freed from all antecedent improbability . In the way of direct evidence , the little that I have been able to observe in this wide  | field goes to prove that the current notions are in accordance with fact . We have seen that chickens follow the call of their mother before they have had any opportunity of associating that sound with pleasurable feelings ; and one or two observations , which must be taken for what they are worth , support the general opinion that they have an equally instinctive dread of their more deadly enemies . When twelve days old one of my little proteges , while running about beside me , gave the peculiar chirr whereby they announce the approach of danger . I looked up , and behold a sparrow-hawk was hovering at a great height over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take only short flights , I made it fly over a hen with her first brood , then about a week old . In the twinkling of an eye most of the chickens were hid among grass and bushes . The hen pursued , and scarcely had the hawk touched the ground , about twelve yards from where she had been sitting , when she fell upon it with such fury that it was with difficulty that I was able to rescue it from immediate death . Equally striking was the effect of the hawk 's voice when heard for the first time . A young turkey , which I had adopted when chirping within the uncracked shell , was on the morning of the tenth day of its life eating a comfortable breakfast from my hand , when the young hawk , in a cupboard just beside us , gave a shrill chip , chip , chip . Like an arrow the poor turkey shot to the other side of the room , and stood there motionless and dumb with fear , until the hawk gave a second cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extreme end of the passage , and there , silent and crouched in a corner , remained for ten minutes . Several times during the course of that day it again heard these alarming sounds , and in every instance with similar manifestations of fear . Lnfortunately , my hawk coming to an untimely end , I was prevented from proceeding with observations of this class . But these few were so marked and unmistakable in their character that I have thought them worth recording . There are instincts , however , yet to be mentioned , concerning the reality of which I have thoroughly satisfied myself . The early attention that chickens give to their toilet is a very useful instinct , about which there can be no question . Scores of times I have seen them attempt to dress their wings when only a few hours old ? indeed as soon as they could hold up their heads , and even when denied the use of their eyes . The art of scraping in search of food , which , if anything , might be acquired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her time in scratching for them ? is nevertheless another indisputable case of instinct . Without any opportunities of imitation , when kept quite isolated from their kind , chickens began to scrape when from two to six days old . Generally , the condition of the ground was suggestive ; but I have several times seen the first attempt , which consists of a sort  | of nervous dance , made on a smooth table . As an example of unacquired dexterity , I may mention that on placing four ducklings a day old in the open air for the first time , one of them almost immediately snapped at and caught a fly on the wing . More interesting , however , is the deliberate art of catching flies practised by the turkey . When not a day and a half old I observed the young turkey already spoken of slowly pointing its beak at flies and other small insects without actually pecking at them . In doing this , its head could be seen to shake like a hand that is attempted to be held steady by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not understand its meaning . For it was not until after , that I found it to be the invariable habit of the turkey , when it sees a fly settled on any object , to steal on the unwary insect with slow and measured step until sufficiently near , when it advances its head very slowly and steadily till within an inch or so of its prey , which is then seized by a sudden dart . If all this can be proved to be instinct , few , I think , will care " to maintain that anything that can be learned from experience may not also appear as an intuition . The evidence I have in this case , though not so abundant as could be wished , may yet , perhaps , be held sufficient . I have mentioned that this masterpiece of turkey cleverness when first observed was in the incipient stage , and , like the nervous dance that precedes the actual scraping , ended in nothing . I noted it simply as an odd performance that I did not understand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight except when in its flannel bag , persisted in its whimsical pointing at flies , until before many days I was delighted to discover that there was more in it than my philosophy had dreamt of . I went at once to the flock of its own age . They were following a common hen , which had brought them out ; and as there were no other turkeys about the place , they could not possibly learn by imitation . As the result , however , of their more abundant opportunities , I found them already in the full and perfect exercise of an art ? a cunning and skilful adjusting of means to an end ? bearing conspicuously the stamp of experience . But the circumstances under which these observations were made left me no room for the opinion that the experience , so visible in their admirable method of catching flies , was original , was the experience , the acquisition of those individual birds . To read what another has observed is not , however , so convincing as to see for oneself , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired ; at the same time , it can scarcely be attempted to set aside the evidence adduced , on the ground of improbability , for the fact of instinct : all that is involved in this more striking example has , we venture to think , been sufficiently attested . A few manifestations of instinct still remain to be briefly spoken of . Chickens as soon as they are able to walk will follow any moving object .  | And , when guided by sight alone , they seem to have no more disposition to follow a hen than to follow a duck , or a human being . Unreflecting on-lookers , when they saw chickens a day old running after me , and older ones following me miles and answering to my whistle , imagined that I must have some occult power over the creatures , whereas I simply allowed them to follow me from the first . There is the instinct to follow ; and , as we have seen , their ear prior to experience attaches them to the right object . The advantage of this arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of supplying animals with arts very essential to them , and which they could not very well learn for themselves . If there is anything that experience would be sure to teach chickens , it would be to take care when they had got a piece of food not to let their fellows take it from them , and from the very first they may be seen to run off with a worm , pursued by all their companions . But this has been so stamped in their nature that , when they have never seen one of their kind , nor ever been disturbed in the enjoyment of a morsel , they nevertheless , when they get something larger than can be swallowed at once , turn round and run off with it . Another suggestive class of phenomena that fell under my notice may be described as imperfect instincts . When a week old my turkey came on a bee right in its path ? the first , I believe , it had ever seen . It gave the danger chirr , stood for a few seconds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in another direction . On this hint I made a vast number of experiments with chickens and bees . In the great majority of instances the chickens gave evidence of instinctive fear of these sting-bearing insects ; but the results were not uniform , and perhaps the most accurate general statement I can give is , that they were uncertain , shy and suspicious . Of course to be stung once was enough to confirm their misgivings forever . Pretty much in the same way did they avoid ants , especially when swarming in great numbers . Probably enough has been said to leave no doubt in minds free from any bias on the subject , that in the more important concerns of their lives the animals are in great part guided by knowledge that they individually have not gathered from experience . But equally certain is it that they do learn a great deal , and exactly in the way that we are generally supposed to acquire all our knowledge . For example , every chicken , as far as my observations go , has to learn not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they did not repeat it oftener than once or twice . Many times they arrested themselves when in the very act , and went off shaking their heads in disgust , though they had not actually touched the obnoxious matter . It also appeared that , though thirsty , they did not recognize water by sight , except perhaps in the form of dew-drops on the grass ; and they had to  | some extent to learn to drink . Their first attempts were awkward ; instead of dipping in their beaks , they pecked at the water , or rather at specks in the water , or at the edge of the water . All animals have a capacity to learn ; each individual must learn the topography of its locality , and numerous other facts . Many dogs , horses and elephants may be able to learn more than some men . But I have no doubt that observation will bear out the popular belief that what may be called the professional knowledge of the various species ? those special manifestations of practical skill , dexterity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less clearly than do the physical differences whereon naturalists base their classifications ? is instinctive , and not acquired . As we shall see , the creatures have not in a vast multitude of instances the opportunity to acquire these arts . And if they had the opportunity , they have not individually the eapacity to do so , even by way of imitation . We have seen as a matter of fact that it is by instinct that the chicken , and , I may now add , the turkey , scratch the surface of the earth in search of insects ; also , that the turkey has a method of catching flies so remarkably clever that it can not be witnessed without astonishment . Now , chickens like flies no less than turkeys , and , though with less success , often try to catch them . But it is a significant fact that they do not copy the superior art . To give every opportunity for imitation , I placed a newly-hatched chicken with my turkey , when the latter was eleven days old . The two followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them they remained close companions throughout the summer , neither of them ever associating with the other poultry . But the chicken never caught the knowing trick of its companion ? seemed , indeed , wholly blind to the useful art that was for months practised before its eyes . Before passing to the theory of instinct , it may be worthy of remark that , unlooked for , I met with in the course of my experiments some very suggestive , but not yet sufficiently observed , phenomena ; which , however , have led me to the opinion that not only do the animals learn , but they can also forget ? and very soon ? that which they never practised . Further , it would seem that any early interference with the established course of their lives may completely derange their mental constitution , and give rise to an order of manifestations perhaps totally and unaccountably different from what would have appeared under normal conditions . Hence I am inclined to think that students of animal psychology should endeavor to observe the unfolding of the powers of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives . And perhaps it may be because they have not all been sufficiently on their guard in this matter , that some experiments have seemed to tell against the reality of instinct . Without attempting to prove the above propositions , one or two facts may be mentioned . Untaught , the new-born  | babe can suck ? a reflex action ; and Mr. Herbert Spencer describes all instinct as compound reflex action ' ; but it seems to be well known that if spoon-fed , and not put to the breast , it soon loses the power of drawing milk . Similarly a chicken that has not heard the call of the mother until eight or ten days old then hears it as if it heard it not . I regret to find that on this point my notes are not so full as I could wish , or as they might have been . There is , however , an account of one chicken that could not be returned to the mother when ten days old . The hen followed it , and tried to entice it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran to the house or to any person of whom it caught sight . This it persisted in doing , though beaten back with a small branch dozens of times , and indeed cruelly maltreated . It was also placed under the mother at night , but it again left her in the morning . Something more curious , and of a different kind , came to light in the case of three chickens that I kept hooded until nearly four days old ? a longer time than any I have yet spoken of . Each of these on being unhooded evinced the greatest horror of me , dashing off in the opposite direction whenever I sought to approach it . The table on which they were unhooded stood before a window , and each in its turn beat against the glass like a wild bird . One of them darted behind some books , and squeezing itself into a corner , remained cowering for a length of time . We might guess at the meaning of this strange and exceptional wildness ; but the odd fact is enough for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this marked change in their mental constitution ? had they been unhooded on the previous day they would have run to me instead of from me ? it could not have been the effect of experience ; it must have resulted wholly from changes in their own organization . The only theory in explanation of the phenomena of instinct that has an air of science about it , is Mr. Spencer 's doctrine of Inherited Acquisition . The laws of association explain our intellectual operations , and enable us to understand how all our knowledge may be derived from experience . A chicken comes on a bee , and imagining it has found a dainty morsel , seizes the insect , but is stung , and suffers badly . Henceforth bees are avoided ; they can be neither seen nor heard without a shudder of fear . Now , if we can realize how such an association as this ? how what one individual learns by experience may , in any degree , be transmitted to the progeny of that individual ? we have a key to the mystery of instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulated experiences of past generations . The plausibility of this hypothesis , however , is not appreciated by the majority of even the educated portion of the community . But the reason is not far to seek . Educated men , even materialists ? their own positive statements to the contrary notwithstanding ? have not yet quite escaped from the habit  | of regarding mind as independent of bodily organization . Hence it is , that while familiar with the idea of physical peculiarities passing by inheritance from one generation to another , they find it difficult to conceive how anything so impalpable as fear at the sight of a bee should be transmitted in the same way . Obviously , this difficulty is not consistent with a thorough belief in the intimate . and invariable dependence of all kinds of mental facts on nervous organization . Let us , if possible , make this clear . The facts of mind that make up the stream of an individual life differ from material things in this important respect , that whereas the latter can be stored up , volitions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Facts of consciousness can not be thought of as packed away like books in a library . They have to be forever produced , created , one after another ; and when gone they are out of existence . 11 hatever associations may be formed among these , must depend for their permanence on the corresponding impress given to the nervous organism ; and why should not this , which is purely physical , be subject to the law of heredity ? Look at a friend as he lies in unconscious sleep . His sovereigns are in his pocket , but where is his stock of ideas ? Where is all that he has learned from experience ? You have simply a living machine ; but such a machine that it can wake and exhibit all the phenomena of what we call a well-informed and cultivated mind . Suppose , now , that while you stand by , another organism , the same in every particle and fiber , is by some mysterious process formed direct from its elements . Outwardly you can not tell the one from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even then , will not the one being recognize you , and then be as completely and indistinguishably your friend as the other ? Will not the newly created man , by virtue of his identical material organization , possess the mind and character , the knowledge and feelings , the past , in a word , the personal identity of the other ? I have made this extreme supposition in order that no doubt may be entertained as to the shape in which I hold the doctrine that for every fact of mind there is a corresponding fact of matter , and that , given the material fact , whether produced by repeated experiences in the life history of the individual , or inherited from parents , the corresponding mental fact will be the same . If this view be admitted , there can be no difficulty in conceiving how entrance into life on the part of the animals may be a waking up in a world with which they are , in greater or less degree , already acquainted ! Instinct , looked at from its physical side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning on of the nerve currents ' on already established tracks : for no reason , we presume , can be suggested why those modifications of brain matter that , enduring from hour to hour and from day to day , render acquisition possible , should not , like any other physical peculiarity , be transmitted from parent to offspring . That they are so transmitted is all but proved by  | the facts of instinct , while these in their turn receive their only rational explanation in this theory of inherited acquisition . But the difficulty of the undisciplined mind lies , as we have said , in an inability to grasp the full significance of the doctrine that , in an individual life , it is the physical part alone that endures from day to day ; that , strictly speaking , we can not feel the same feeling or think the same thought twice over ; that only as by pulling the bell-cord to-day we can , in the language of ordinary discourse , produce the sound we heard yesterday , can we , while the established connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences over again . This doctrine of inherited acquisition , then , is , to say the least , a good working hypothesis in explanation of all those facts of instinct that may be conceived as built up , compounded out of , the accumulated experiences of innumerable generations . So far good . But it will occur to every reader that the peculiar depths of animal psychology are not yet explored . Two classes of phenomena still lie in the dark . First , there are the many extraordinary and exceptional feats of dogs and other animals , which seem to be constantly falling under the observation of everybody except the few that are interested in these matters . Second , all the more wonderful instincts , especially those of insects , are such that it is hard , if at all possible , to conceive how they ever could have been derived from experience . With regard to the first , it is not desirable to say much . Though volumes of marvelous stories have been written , I am not aware that any careful experiments have been tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exceptional character , it is perhaps but scientific caution not as yet to put too much stress on them . For my own part , though I have been very intimate with dogs , I have been singularly unfortunate in having never witnessed any of their more incomprehensible clairvoyant-like achievements . I have known them to do many surprising things , but I have always found that they had , or might have had , something to go upon ? enough , coupled with quick intelligence , to account for their exploits . What may be said in this connection , if , indeed , it be prudent to say anything , is that , while we certainly can not have all the data of experience from without of all the vastly different living things which people the earth , the air , and the ocean ? while we certainly can have no trace of many feelings that arise from changes in the organisms of the different creatures , and which , instinctively interpreted , start them on lines of action ? a host of statements , generally accepted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs , are alive to , conscious , sensible of influences that scarcely affect us , or wholly escape our cognition . If this be so , they have a basis of experience from which to start in their calculations that we want , and , if so , well may their actions seem to us , as Mr. Mill said , hopelessly inexpli- cable . Take , not the most remarkable , but the best authenticated example of this class ? the frequently alleged fact of dogs and other animals returning in a straight line , or by the most direct routes , through districts they had never before traversed , to places from which they had been taken by devious tracks , and even shut up in close boxes . To most people this is a phenomenon sufficiently incomprehensible . They are certain they themselves could do nothing at all like it . But there is in some men what may be just a hint of this faculty . Most people that have lived only in cities are very soon lost in a strange and trackless district , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , after wandering this way and that for a few hours , in the other , after merely turning round a few times , they can tell nothing of the direction whence they came . But all men are not so easily lost ; some , without consciously making notes , retain , after long wandering in such situations , a strong and often accurate impression , not of the ground they have gone over , but of the direction in which lies the place whence they started . Without attempting to throw any light on the mental chemistry of this perception , we would submit that in it may perhaps be found a clue to the mystery of those astonishing home-journeys of dogs , sheep , cats , pigeons , bees , etc. , of which hundreds are on record . It is , however , with the other dark enigma that we are more specially concerned . We do not think it necessary to examine the proof of the actuality of such marvelous instincts as those of bees and wasps . But for the too fond love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , or the instinctive character , of their " far-sighted , " or , more correctly , blind provisions for the future . The problem before us is not whether , for example , the male of the fish Arius does , and by instinct , hatch the eggs of the female in his mouth , but how such a singular mode of incubation ever had a beginning ? Perhaps the most widely known instance of this class of instincts is the provision of the solitary wasp for the worm that will issue from her egg after her own death . She brings grubs ? food that as a wasp she never tasted ? and deposits them over the egg , ready for the larva she will never see . The life history of every insect exhibits instincts of this perplexing description . Witness the caterpillar , how at the proper time it selects a suitable situation and spins for itself a silken cocoon . It may be admitted at once that the creatures , as we behold them , never could have lived to acquire such instincts by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor let it be supposed that it is only in the insect world , where all is so strange , that instincts are to be met with so essential to lives of the individuals or their progeny that without them the creatures in their present shape could never have existed . Of this kind are the first movements observable in the life of a bird , and which take place within the shell . I have often observed the self-delivery  | of the chicken . The prison wall is not burst in pieces by spontaneous , random struggles . By a regular series of strokes the shell is cut in two -- chipped right round in a perfect circle , some distance from the great end . Moreover , the bird has a special instrument for this work , a hard , sharp horn on the top of the upper mandible , which being required for no other purpose disappears in a few days . Obviously each individual bird no more acquires the art of breaking its way out than it furnishes itself with the little pick-hammer used in the operation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never escaped from the egg without this instinct . Again , how were eggs hatched before birds had acquired the instinct to sit upon them ? Or who will throw light on the process of such an acquisition ? Nor are the subsequent phenomena easier of explanation . A fowl that never before willingly shared a crumb with a companion , will now starve herself to feed her chickens , which she calls by a language she never before used ? may have never even heard ? but which they are born to understand . Once more , it is clearly because she can not do otherwise that a sherabbit , when with her first young , digs a hole in the earth away from her ordinary habitation , and there builds a nest of soft grass , lined with fur stripped from her own body . But how as to the origin of this habit ? We need not accumulate examples of seemingly unfathomable instincts . And it may be confessed at once that in the present state of our knowledge it would be hopeless to attempt to guess at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creatures wore different shapes and lived different lives , wrought changes in their nervous systems that , enduring and being modified through many changes of form , have given to the living races the physical organizations of which these wonderful instincts are the corresponding mental facts . Nor , perhaps , can it be confidently asserted that in experience and heredity we have all the terms of the problem . The little we can say is that though in the dark we need not consider ourselves more in the dark as to the origin of those strange instincts than we are concerning the origin of those wonderful organs of astonishing and exquisite mechanism that , especially among the insects , are the instruments of those instincts . Nay , more , if the view we have put forward concerning the connection between mental manifestations and bodily organization be correct , the question of the origin of these mysterious instincts is not more difficult than , or different from , but is the same with , the problem of the origin of the physical structure of the creatures ; for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not fail to have the minds that correspond thereto . When , as by a miracle , the lovely butterfly bursts from the chrysalis full-winged and perfect , and flutters off a thing of soft and gorgeous beauty , it but wakes to a higher life , to a new mode of existence , in which , strange though it may sound , it  | has , for the most part , nothing to learn ; because its little life flows from its organization like melody from a music box . But we need not enlarge on this a second time . In seeking to understand the phenomena of instinct we of course get the full benefit of the law of Natural Science , which though it throws no light on the origin of anything , mental or physical ? for , as Mr. Darwin says , it has no relation whatever to the primary cause of any modification of structure ' ? nevertheless helps us to understand the existence of instincts far removed from the circumstances or conditions of life under which they could have been acquired . Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a couple of parrots , and to teach them to say in very good English , " How do you do , sir ? " ? that the young of these birds are also taught by Mr. Crusoe and their parents to say , " How do you do , sir ? " ? and that Mr. Crusoe , having little else to do , sets to work to prove the doctrine of Inherited Association by direct experiment . He continues his teaching , and every year breeds from the birds of the last and previous years that say " How do you do sir F ' most frequently and with the best accent . After a sufficient number of generations his young parrots , continually hearing their parents and a hundred other birds saying " How do you do , sir ? " begin to repeat these words so soon that an experiment is needed to decide whether it is by instinct or imitation ; and perhaps it is part of both . Eventually , however , the instinct is established . And though now Mr. Crusoe dies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not die , not for a long time at least ; and if the parrots themselves have acquired a taste for good English the best speakers will be sexually selected , and the instinct will certainly endure to astonish and perplex mankind , though in truth we may as well wonder at the crowing of the cock or the song of the skylark . Again , turkeys have an instinctive art of catching flies , which , it is manifest , the creatures in their present shape may have acquired by experience . But suppose the circumstances of their life to change ; flies steadily become more abundant , and other kinds of food scarcer : the best fly-catchers are now the fittest to live , and each generation they are naturally selected . This process goes on , experience probably adding to the instinct in ways that we need not attempt to conceive , until a variety or species is produced that feeds on flies alone . To look at , this new bird will differ considerably from its turkey ancestors ; for change in food and in habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every useful modification of structure will have been preserved by natural selection . My point however is , that thus , by no inconceivable steps , would be produced a race of birds depending for all their food on an instinctive art , which they , as then constituted , could never have acquired , because they never could have existed without it .  | No doubt , to the many , who love more to gaze and marvel than to question and reflect , all this will seem miserably inadequate as a clue to one of the greatest mysteries of life . But enough , if I have indicated my view of how the most inexplicable of instincts may have had their origin ; or rather , if I have shown how our utter inability to trace them back to their origin tells nothing against the probability that they all came into existence in accordance with those laws of acquisition and heredity that we now see operating before our eyes . We can not tell how the pupa of the dragon-fly came by the instinct that prompts it to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may be able to explain this quite as soon as to unveil the origin of the hooks by which it hangs itself up . And if ever human intelligence should so trace the evolution of living forms as to be able to say , " Thus was developed the billscale wherewith birds now break their way out of the shells , " it will probably be able to add , " and these were the experiences to which we must trace the instinct that makes every little bird its own skilful accoucheur.
