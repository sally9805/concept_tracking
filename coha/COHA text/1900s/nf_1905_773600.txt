txt // variety of phrase which is contingent upon it ) in the architecture of the verse paragraph . In Paradise Regained redundancy makes its appearance again ; and in Samson Agonistes ? perhaps deliberately , the dramatic form inviting it , perhaps as a mere consequence of an unconscious tendency ? it becomes very prominent indeed . There is a difference , too , in phrase . The stately yet seldom over-gorgeous or over-stiff Miltonic diction reaches its acme in Paradise Lost ; and , if a little less sweet and graceful than in the early poems , is still more accomplished , still more " inevitable , " still more suited to convince all good judges that it can not be better done at the time , for the purpose , and in the context . In the best passages of Paradise Regained there is no falling off in this respect ; but elsewhere there is , and the absence of splendour and succulence in the diction , joined to the occasional relaxation of the verse , makes that danger of the prosaic , which waits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . The process continues further in Samson , where the great pathos and greater dignity of the action can not hinder the blankverse parts from being at once too dry and too loose . But here the choruses come to the rescue with their despised auxiliary rhyme and their exceeding beauty , while even their unrhymed Pindaric sections , though perhaps confessing a relaxing grasp of the paragraphsymphony , serve to vary the effect . The substance of the three needs no praise , little account , and only a hint that , though never below , it is sometimes either above or outside the most appropriate themes of verse . Light treatment is rarely called for , and is never successfully given . But the mere narrative is , in Paradise Lost at any rate , managed with extraordinary skill ; the personal touches , in reference chiefly to the blindness , both here and in Samson , give pathos without impertinence ; the shorter poetical jewels are innumerable ; and even the longer passages , many , if not most , of which could stand almost as substantive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank verse out of drama we have few things that can approach , and nothing that excels , the picture of Pandemonium and its inhabitants ; the scene with Sin and Death ; the journey through Chaos ; the address to Light at the beginning of Book III . ; Satan 's vision of the Sin and his speech on Niphates ; the description of paradise ; the discovery by Ithuriel and the subsequent debate ; parts of the story of Raphael ; the Temptation ; the change of nature thereafter ; and the riot of names in the description of the view from the topmost mount of Paradise . All these are in Paradise Lost , and the sequel adds , though fewer and farther between , the great confession of Satan , " ' T is true I am that spirit unfortunate " ; the dream of Christ , and the morning scene after it , with its traces of Milton 's // reading in romance ; the second prospect from the mount ; the views of Rome and Athens ; the storm ; and , above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet perhaps it is not in passages that Milton 's greatness appears so decidedly as in the great achievement and attainment of the general scheme of his poems on the one hand , and the marvellous perfection of the single line and phrase on the other . The extreme importance of Milton in English poetry has been already referred to , but must be now somewhat more fully , though still briefly , dwelt upon . He represents ? and almost exhausts ? the fourth great influence in English prosody . We have Milton 's place already seen how Chaucer gathered together and put , in English with an immense contribution of his own , the results Prosody. of the struggles of Middle English towards such a prosody , and how his example , followed blindly and with a tongue as stammering as the eyes were dim , lasted for more than a century , till the changes of the language put it for the moment aside ; how Spenser , partly returning to it , partly gathering up de nova the results of the experiments of his immediate forerunners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh start ; and , lastly , how the dramatists , and especially Shakespeare , suppled and shook out the texture of the decasyllabic line , varied its cadence , stocked it ( on the principles of equivalence or slur ) with a great number of new foot-combinations , while the lyric and stanza poetry of the fifty years between the Calendar and Milton 's " Three-and-twentieth Year " sonnet almost exhausted the possibilities of less uniform verse . At the time which we have reached , as we have seen already , and shall see still more , the stream of original poetic thought was slackening ; even the lyric composition , though almost more exquisite than ever , was dwindling in range , height , and strength , and tending to an exquisite prettiness rather than to passion or splendour ; and , above all , the extreme laxity of structure into which the drama had degenerated was either rendering verse ( as in the drama itself ) mere hobbling prose , or by reaction was creating the sharply separated couplet , a form admirable for the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just at this time came Milton , a poet with an exquisite ear and extraordinary science of form , great learning in his own and other languages , and a predilection for the special form of non-dramatic blank verse which , managed as he manages it , at once counteracts the effect of the sharp snip-snap couplet and of the wandering , involved , labyrinthine stanza . He tightened up the metre without unduly constricting it ; he refined the expression without making it jejune . And in particular his need of an extremely varied line to construct 2D // his paragraphs and supply the want of rhyme-music , made him , without adopting the sheer abandonment of the late dramatic verse , resort to every artifice of metrical distribution to avoid monotony . So intricate and constant is this artifice that some have even imagined the invention by him of a " new prosody " not reducible to ordinary laws , or have resorted to the supposition of extrametrical syllables . As to this last , it can only be said that the existence of an extrametrical syllable anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imcompetence of the poet . Extrametrical syllables are the " epicycles " of criticism . It is true that there are a very few lines in Milton where no more than nine syllables can be made out by any artifice ; and we must here suppose , either that he has followed Virgil 's example in leaving these lines designedly incomplete , or else that he has , with rather doubtful judgment , borrowed from some other metres the license of making the initial foot monosyllabic , with strong stress and pause to serve for the missing half . It is true also that , probably seduced by his affection for Italian ( in which language the prevailing cadence is always trochaic rather than iambic ) , he has substituted the trochee rather more freely than altogether suits the genius of English . But , with these two provisos , every line of his can be scanned with perfect strictness as an iambic of five feet in which the following feet are admissible , strictly speaking , in any place ? iambus , trochee , anapest , dactyl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . With such precision , and on the whole such judgment , did he apply these principles , that in a certain sense English prosody up to the present time has gone no farther . Very many new metrical combinations have , of course , been invented , and the eighteenth century for a long time discarded , or used very gingerly , his licenses of equivalence and pause . But he practically put English prosody on the footing which it has maintained ever since ; and , except in the few and always unsuccessful cases where poets have deliberately set themselves to attempt a new prosody , every poet from Dryden to Mr. Swinburne can be accounted for on the system applicable to him . His pattern of blank verse , admirable as a variation , is not a complete substitute for couplet or stanza ; his vocabulary , at least in his later poems , may be objected to as unnecessarily stiff and loaded . But his prosody in the strict sense is exhaustive . No one up to his time ( though Shakespeare had practically included everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one since his time has added anything new in principle . The position now for two centuries assigned to Milton was during his lifetime held by Abraham Cowley.i This poet , whose " // popularity , extraordinarily high and extraordinarily brief , was not quite so unreasonable as his loss of it , was a Londoner born ten years after Milton , in 1618 . He went to Westminster , and thence to Cambridge . He certainly wrote verse , C ? wley. and good verse , very early , for some of it was published when he was fifteen ; but whether his reading and emulation of Spenser really enabled him to produce some of these poems at ten years old must be left to the reader . He had but just taken his Master 's degree in 1643 when Cambridge fell into the power of the Parliamentarians and he was ejected , went to Oxford , where he stayed for two years , and then going with Henrietta Maria to Paris , became her secretary . After some ten years ' stay abroad , in 1656 he returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on condition of some indefinite compliances which are vaguely and differently related . He returned to France till the Restoration , and was then , like many other Royalists , disappointed in hopes which Charles II . was perhaps not too careful to satisfy , but which he certainly could not in all cases have satisfied if he would . Nor was it very long before a beneficial lease of the Queen 's lands gave him competence , if not affluence . He retired , however , in some dudgeon to Chertsey , and died there ? not finding the country quite the poet 's paradise ? in July 1667 . Cowley 's remarkable prose may be for the present put aside . In his verse he is not merely a most curious bridge of communication between the couplet poets , the " school of good-sense , " and the metaphysicals , but almost more than Waller , and much more than Denham , the pair who usually go with him , a bridge between one whole period of poetry and another . He wrote in " youth a play called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , but after the Restoration altered and acted as Cutter of Coleman Street . But this requires no special notice . His purely poetical works , which are by no means so easily to be distinguished by mere chronological order as might be thought likely , fall pretty easily into three classes when judged from the point of view of form ? namely , couplet verse , lyrics and stanza poems of various kinds , and Pindarics . Of the couplet verse the most important piece in size , as indeed it is of the whole , is the curious sacred epic of the Davideis , much of which was written at Cambridge , though it was continued ( it never was completed ) later . Four books exist ; yet even this manageable length , assisted by Cowley 's immense popularity , never made it generally read . There are unquestionably fine things in it ? from the opening picture of Hell , earlier by much than that of Milton , through the sketch of the Priests ' College , a favourite // theme with the author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David 's account of Saul and of Jonathan . And the passages of length are as a rule inferior to the single lines and couplets , which are sometimes wonderfully fine . But the miscarriage of the piece as a whole may be accounted for many times over . It is true , as Johnson urges , that the story , being merely begun , has no time to justify itself , that its amplification of familiar Scripture is felt as impertinent , and that the decorations exhibit the fatal fault of the " metaphysicals " almost in the worst degree . But there is more than this . The very accomplishment of the couplets now and then jars with the phraseology and imagery , as would not have been the case in stanza or blank verse ; and , little story as the poet gives himself room to tell , he interferes with the interest even of what little there is by constant divagation . The book is a museum of poetic fragments tastelessly cemented together , not an organic whole . In his other couplet pieces , from quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowley shows much better , or at any rate is much more accessible , as a pioneer in the path . The piece upon the " Happy Birth of the Duke of Gloucester " in 164o , though sometimes " enjambed , " shows on the whole a great preference for , and a pretty complete command of , the authentic , balanced , selfcontained couplet with the cracker of rhyme at the tail of it . We only want weight to give us Dryden , and polish to give us Pope : the form is there already . In his stanza-poems and lyrics proper Cowley shows the retrospective side of his poetic Janus-head , though it is observable that even in Constantia and Philetus , one of the earliest of the juvenilia , the concluding couplets of the sizain " snap " as they would not have done in Daniel or in Drayton . The lyrics are often quite Jonsonian , while sometimes they have a lightness which Ben rarely achieved , and which is chiefly proper to his " sons , " of whom Cowley was born just too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-known thing , is the very best of poetic froth ; while the Anacreonlics are often equal to Ben , and sometimes not very far below Milton . One is frequently inclined to give Cowley a really high place , when something ? his shallowness or his frigid wit , or a certain " shadow before " of eighteenth-century prose ? interferes , especially in his once adored Mistress . Undoubtedly , however , Cowley 's Pindarics are the most peculiar efforts of his talent , and those which , upon his own time , produced most of the effect of genius . They are little read now , and there can be no doubt that both their structure and the presumed necessity of imitating Pindar 's style of obscure conceit encouraged the metaphysical manner very treacherously. // But they would be interesting to us even were they far worse than they are intrinsically , because to the historian of literature nothing can ever be uninteresting which has , for a long time , supplied an obvious literary demand on the part of readers and provided employment for great writers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which always presupposes remembrance , that the debt would have been due to another if this man had not been in case to lend ? the really magnificent odes of Dryden , Gray , and Collins pretty directly ; indirectly that still greater one of Wordsworth which is almost his solitary claim to have reached the highest summits of poetry ; and many great things of Shelley and Tennyson , not to mention lesser men . And the eager adoption of the form , which for more than half a century produced libraries full of unreadable Pindarics ( the most interesting and nearly the most hopeless examples being those of no less a man than Swift ) , shows us what the time wanted , how it was sick of the regular stanza , how blank verse was still a little too bold for it , while it had not yet settled down or become satisfied with the regular tick of the couplet-clock . But as a matter of fact the things themselves are not contemptible . " Life and Fame , " " Life , " the " Ode to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least contain , very fine things ; and the chief drawback of the whole is that descent to colloquial abbreviations ( " I 'm , " etc. ) which was due partly to the slow vulgarising of popular taste on such points which we shall have to record , partly to the still prevailing dread of slur and trisyllabic equivalence . On the whole , no doubt , Rochester was right when he said ( " profanely , " as Dryden very properly adds ) that " Cowley was not of God , and so he could not stand . " But the special reason of his fall was that he never could make up his mind whether to stand with the old age or with the new , with the couplet or with the wilder verse , with mystical fantasy or clear common sense , with lawless splendour or jejune decency . One splendid passage ? which , by the way , did not appear in the first edition of the poem , Cooper 's Hill , that contains it ? has preserved to Sir John Denham r a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , thanks Denham . chiefly to his younger contemporary Dryden 's generous eulogy of it . He was born in Dublin , and of Irish parentage on his mother 's side , in 1615 ; had at Oxford and Lincoln 's Inn a reputation for idleness and extravagance , especially in gambling ; obtained some fame in 1641 by The Sohhy , and published Cooper 's Hill soon afterwards ; lived chiefly at Oxford during the war , and chiefly in France after it ; was knighted at the Restoration , and received a 1In Chalmers . // valuable place , the surveyorship of the king 's buildings ; was unlucky in marriage , became disordered in mind , and died on loth April 1668 . Few , except for studious curiosity , are ever likely again to read Denham through , or even any considerable part of his not extensive work . The Sophy is a feeble tragedy ; Cooper 's Hill , putting aside the patch Oh ! could I flow like thee and a few other fine lines , is chiefly a creditable , and tolerably though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couplet . A verse paraphrase of the Second Aeneid adopts the older and looser " enjambed " form of the same measure ; indeed , this enjambment is common in Denham , and is found in Cooper 's Hill itself . Prudence , Justice , Old Age ( of all odd things a verse handling of the De Senectute ) , The Progress of Learning , are preludes to the eighteenth-century concert of couplet tunes on things not tunable . The smaller poems , with occasional flashes , such as the happy transformation ( for translation it is not ) of Martial 's Non ego sum Curius nec Wilma nec Titius into I pretend not to the wise ones ' To the grave or the precise ones , and a few pieces of some nobility like the elegy on Cowley and the attack on Love in favour of Friendship , are apt to oscillate between the tastelessly fantastical and the merely gross . Moreover , Denham is an eminent sinner in the small matters of grammar , rhyme , and measure which disgrace so many writers in the middle and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any imperfect condition of the language , but to sheer carelessness and a downat-heel fashion of literature . He has occupied the place between Cowley and Waller as the a three reformers of our numbers " so long , that he has established a title to it by prescription ; and as it has long been understood what this " reform of numbers " meant , there is the less reason for turning him out . But he is much less of a poet than Cowley , while it is an injustice to couple his slatternly muse with the neat and graceful , if not radiantly lovely or bewitching , muse of Edmund Waller . ' This curious person , whose actual poetical achievements were helped by accidents of all kinds , including social position , wealth , long life , and the fact that the greatest English writer of his latest days was a man of singular modesty and generosity towards his contemporaries , was born in Hertfordshire , hut of a family connected by property with the neighbouring county of Bucks , " // and by extraction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a mere child to a very large fortune , was educated at Eton and King 's College , Cambridge , and early introduced to court . This was an age of precocity , but Waller 's was certainly very remarkable , for he was not eighteen when he wrote his poem on Prince Charles 's escape from shipwreck at Santander ; and there is no doubt that the cast of the couplets in which it is written is unlike anything before except mere scraps and fragments , and almost exactly like what was to prevail for an entire century , and , with Pope 's refinements , for nearly two . When we remember that the time of his writing such couplets as With the sweet sound of this harmonious lay About the keel delighted dolphins play was the year of the publication of the first folio of Shakespeare , that it was seven years only after his death and seven more before the birth of Dryden , that Milton was a boy at school , that Drayton , Jonson , Chapman were alive and to be so for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child of five years old , the thing is certainly surprising enough . Waller was to live sixty-four years longer , nor was his life uneventful . He increased his wealth by marrying a city heiress , who died very soon , and is said only in his widower state to have begun to court Lady Dorothy Sidney , ? " Sacharissa , " ? who would not have him . " Amoret " is said by a less confident tradition to have been Lady Sophia Murray . He actually married a lady of less distinguished position , by whom he had many children . His fortune naturally opened Parliament to him , but his political career was not fortunate or creditable . In the Short Parliament he was an active member of the Opposition . In the Long , though he was a relation of Hampden , he became somewhat less antagonistic to the court , and though he continued to sit after the final breach , was in a manner persona grata to Charles , with whom he was sent to negotiate . Had what is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must refer to history ? succeeded , or had he shown more fortitude at its failure , Waller 's name might have been at least as favourably known in historical as in poetical records . Unluckily , on the plot 's discovery and his own arrest he confessed everything in regard to himself , informed against others , urged them to do the like , was at least part cause of the execution of his own brother-in-law Tomkyns , and himself escaped with life , exile , a fine of ten thousand pounds , and a hopelessly damaged reputation , which was not much mended by his making his peace with Cromwell , his kinsman and the subject of one of his best poems . As he had wit and wealth he was welcome at // Whitehall after the Restoration , sat in several Parliaments , and only missed the Provostship of Eton ( for which he asked ) because he was ineligible as a layman . He survived Charles II. , is said to have given his infatuated successor good advice , and died in 1687 . Waller , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman ; that is to say , he neither published often nor attempted anything of great magnitude , but his very early beginnings and his very long life enabled him to put together a considerable poetical baggage . We have noticed his first couplet poem ; it was followed by others , of which the chief are that on the Duke of Buckingham 's death , Iv hich is quite in Dryden 's earlier manner forty years later ; a batch of complimentary poems to persons of the court of Charles I. from the Queen downward ; another , written at Penshurst and full of the ? Sacharissa " affair ; the Battle of the Summer Islands ( Waller 's longest poem except the later Divine Love , and like it remarkable for the extreme shortness of the cantos , which contain only a few score lines each ) ; and the Instructions to a Painter , on the fighting at sea in 1665 . The panegyric on the Protector is in the quatrain , being written at the time when Gondibert ( vide infra ) had made that form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are not the equal of Dryden 's somewhat later " heroic stanzas " on Cromwell 's death , still less of Annns Iifirabilis . Of the smaller lyrics , which , like his " reform of our numbers , " made Waller 's reputation with his own time , one , " Go , Lovely Rose , " is universally known , and with the almost equally popular " On a Girdle " forms an almost sufficient sample for judgment . As was said above , Waller 's muse always presents herself in irreproachable condition , not a curl out of place , not a spot or crease on her dress , the colours chosen with sufficient taste , the arrangement made with sufficient skill . Only , some critics think her features insignificant and her expression quite devoid of air and fire . Once or twice , indeed , the spirit of lyric verse and of intense though fantastic poetry which was still abroad does descend on Waller , as in the famous comparison between Sacharissa and Amoret ( " Sacharissa 's beauty 's wine , " etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( proving the truth of its own sentiment , for it seems to occur in his last work ) ? The soul 's dark cottage , battered and decayed , Lets in new light through chinks that time hath made . Not often was Waller so happily metaphysical . As something general was said of Milton 's influence on the course of poetry , so we must also consider briefly the influence of these his contemporaries in a direction different indeed from his , but so far to be , connected with it that they too were innovating , and were innovatCHAP. // ing in directions to be followed afar and freely by their poetical successors . A good deal has been written on the exact origin of this change in poetry from varied and rather loose measures to the tight , neat , heroic couplet ? French influence being the point most hotly contested . It is undeniable that the court of Henry IV . did exercise certain influences on that of James I. , and that in the former , " reform of under Malherbe and Balzac respectively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fantastic standards of verse and prose to more correct and more frigid models . But the phenomenon is much more one of coincidence than of imitation , though it is impossible to deny that the change had begun and been very conspicuous in France long before the earliest experiments of Waller . That poet , according to his own account , found his chief predecessor in Fairfax ( see p. 357 , aide ) ; more recently an ancestor has been found for him in George Sandys , l his senior at least . To insist , however , too curiously or too peremptorily on either connection would be only to vary the mistake in regard to French influence . In most cases literary changes are not initiated by any one person , or even by any one country . They are in the air , the wind scatters the seeds of them , and they spring up more or less simultaneously , and even with a certain appearance of spontaneity . Only later , when some very commanding genius gives them a home , as here in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their diffusion . Generally , the preference for and practice of the couplet may be said to be only one more instance of the eternal " see-saw , " of that alternation between the plain and the ornate , between the vast and vague and the cabined and correct , which pervades the whole history of literature in verse and in prose alike . In particular , the couplet accommodated itself better to the special poetical desires of the age , and still more to those which were coming to its successor . The time was ceasing ( without complete knowledge that it ceased ) to care for passionate and romantic narrative . Its love-poetry , though still retaining an exquisite sweetness , was sinking towards gallantry and badinage . Its leaning in didactic verse was shifting from the metaphysical and theological to the scientific and merely ethical . It was acquiring a strong craving for satire ? political and other . Above all , it was becoming gradually less dreamy and more businesslike , while its critical tendencies in the lower sense were also being 1 // awakened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other forms clearest to the Elizabethans and Jacobeans proper were extremely ill-suited . They all demanded oratorical point , clean hitting , and mathematical arrangement , for which the couplet was as well suited as the others were unapt . And though , even after nearly a century , it is difficult to get our ears to accept the fact , there is no doubt that to those surfeited with other sounds the sharp rattle , the regular tick , as it may be called , of this couplet was a grateful and agreeable change . We still have to make a positive effort to understand what four or five generations meant by saying that Waller had invented and Dryden perfected " harmony " and " smoothness of numbers . " Mere study will indeed show us that the couplet had already acquired over these generations such a mastery that when they talked thus they were really thinking of the couplet itself only ; and no doubt the couplets of Waller , still more of Dryden , are vastly smoother and more harmonious than those of Drayton or Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteenth century was unjust is simply that it was ignorant . Except a few antiquarian students like Oldys in the first half and Warton in the second , very few men indeed in all probability had ever opened Christ 's Victory or Philarete , the songs of Campion or the sonnets of his contemporaries . Good wits who read Spenser did like him ; though it is clear , even from their imitations , that they had lost the key to his true music , that it was in more senses than one out of time to them . Great harm has been done in literary history , and much labour wasted , by refusing to accept facts of this kind , and persevering in a fruitless and too often misleading attempt to get behind them , to account for them . Simple acceptance , not from pusillanimity or laziness , but in a wise passiveness , is the best attitude , and nowhere more so than here . CHAPTER II THE METAPHYSICALS ? THE LYRIC POETS ? THE MISCELLANISTS , ETC . Meaning of the term " metaphysical " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Randolph ? Habington ? Cartwright ? Corbet ? Suckling ? Lovelace ? Cleveland and others ? Marvell ? Bishop King ? Sherburne , Godolphin , Stanley , Cotton , Brogue ? Quarles , More , Beaumont ? Davenant ? Chamberlayne ? Miscellanies IT may seem unreasonable to have noticed the two most famous and characteristic of the school of poets whom Johnson dubbed metaphysical ? namely , Donne and Cowley ? before devoting any special explanation to that word and to the thing which it was intended to denote ; but there are good reasons for the postponement . In the first place , Donne is anterior by nearly a whole generation to those who are usually classed with him ; he was some forty years older than Cowley , and it is probable that he wrote next to none of his characteristic work after Cowley was born . The lumping of the two together , and of both with others , has led to the most grotesque blunders , such as that which Wordsworth makes in representing Donne 's style as a decadence and reaction from that of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , Cowley , though undoubtedly one of the chiefs of the school that Johnson meant to portray , is , as has been seen , but half a metaphysical , and has a common-sense face as well as a fantastic one . The very term ' metaphysical " has been quarrelled with , and not quite unjustly , but there is also some justice in itself . We must not understand metaphysical " here in its strict philosophical sense , nor in that of Shakespeare 's " metaphysical aid " ( that is to say , " supernatural " ) , nor , of course , in that accidental one which is said to have originated the actual word . But it is not inappropriately used for the habit , common to this school of poets , of always seeking to express something after , something behind , the simple , obvious first sense and suggestion of a subject . 411 // Johnson has indeed not made so much of his term as he might ; for he himself only attributes to his " metaphysicals , " as their differentia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the desire to say something that had never been said before . The metaphysical Caroline school had all these things , but these things were not peculiar to them . The Euphuists , in fact , had had them all . But until themselves the quest after the remote , the search for the after-sense , for contingent and secondary suggestion , had been less marked . The Elizabethan " conceit " is very near it ; you may find the metaphysical spirit ( as indeed what may you not ? ) in Shakespeare . But between 163o and 166o. with a certain belated set of appearances later still , this metaphysical tendency employed almost all poetry except that of Milton , whose intensity melted and transformed this as other peculiarities . Butler is a metaphysical humourist , Chamberlayne a metaphysical romance-writer , Herbert and Vaughan metaphysicals in spiritual poetry , Herrick and Carew , with all their minor train , metaphysical amorists of the decorative kind . Crashaw is perhaps the chief metaphysical , the type of the whole class ; Cleveland , Flatman , Wild , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style is so much interwoven with the practice of the set of poets often called Cavalier Lyrists that it is difficult to disentangle the two . All , no doubt , owed much to that mighty influence of Donne , which was so strangely disconnected from any publication of his work . But Donne himself is metaphysical in the greater and wider sense . His thoughts , even his conceits , are never far-fetched , because his immense and brooding imagination reaches to them all without the trouble of fetching . The others have to fetch them ; they could in some cases hardly go farther , they could in many hardly fare worse . Let us therefore , for the sake of order and classification , make divisions in the abundant group of poets we have before us . Let us take the three great sacred metaphysicals , Crashaw , Herbert , Vaughan , first ; then pass to the lyric group , Herrick , Carew , Habington , Lovelace , Suckling , and others ; next notice the three , oddly contrasted , of the Commonwealth , Davenant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the innumerable and curious collections of songs , ballads , and the like which succeed the Elizabethan miscellanies , and serve with less breach than in any other department of verse as a connecting chain between the poetry of the sixteenth century and the verse of the eighteenth . Richard Crashaw , ' who , if he could but have kept himself at his own best , would have been one of the greatest of English poets , was 1 // born in London either in 1616 or , as has been made more probable , in 1612 . He was the son of a clergyman , whose extremely Puritan leanings may , as often happens , account for Crashaw 's subsequent inclination in the opposite direction . Richard Crashaw. was educated at Charterhouse and Cambridge , where his college , Peterhouse , was as much the centre of High Church teaching and feeling as Emmanuel was of Puritanism . He refused the Covenant in 1644 , was deprived of his Fellowship , and went abroad , quickly joining the Church of Rome . He died at Loretto , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were rumours that he was poisoned . Some of his poems were published during his lifetime , others in a posthumous edition , and a certain i amount of matter certainly , probably , or possibly his has been added since from MS . But his best work in English ( he was a pretty Latin poet , and is said to have been the author of a well-known conceit on the miracle of Cana , while he certainly wrote an elegant fancy on the " Bubble " ) has been known for two centuries and a half . Crashaw 's poetry , more almost than any other in English , must underlie different and nearly irreconcilable judgments , according as the judge insists upon measure , order , and the steady working out of central ideas in poetry , or prefers casual and irregular bursts of expression and fancy . Pope , who rather liked him , expressed a typical judgment from the first point of view , the terms of which undoubtedly suggested Johnson 's criticism of the whole metaphysical school . To the great apostle of correctness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the soul of poetry , all that concerns exactness or consent of parts , which is the body , " seemed wanting in Crashaw ; only " pretty conceptions , fine metaphors , stuttering expressions , and something of a neat cast of verse ? which are properly the gems , dress , or loose ornaments of poetry " ? are to be found in him and in his likes , who should be considered as versifiers and witty men rather than as poets . We may formulate a judgment from the extreme opposite point in very similar words ; for those who take it would doubtless say that in passionate conception ( which is the soul of poetry ) and harmonious metrical expression ( which is its body ) Crashaw is at his best very nearly supreme , while he need only be found wanting in hulk and arrangement of plan , orderly management of means , and self-criticism , which , though useful adjuncts to poetry , are common to it with all literature , and do not usually affect its special excellence . The right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremes , but very much nearer to the standpoint of our anonymous enthusiast than to that of Pope . By far the greater part of Crashaw 's work is devoted to sacred subjects , but some of his best and prettiest , if not his most sublime , pieces are secular . The best // of these is the well-known Wishes to his Sufi hosed Mistress , a decidedly whimsical but infinitely graceful thing ; and a version from the Italian beginning ? To thy lover , Dear , discover . But it must by no means be inferred that Crashaw was only master of this exquisite trifling , and of the frail skipping measures that best suit it . He was at least an equal adept in Pindarics , and in the stateliest form of the contemporary couplet ; and his noblest poems are composed in measures of this kind . They are also entirely devoted to religious subjects . Not indeed that this class of subject was , by or in itself , at all a guarantee of unmixed excellence in Crashaw . His very worst things ? things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various range of metaphysical absurdity ? occur in the poem The Weeper , on St. Mary Magdalen , which unluckily stands in the forefront of his works . The eyes of the penitent are " sister springs , Parents of silver-forded rills " ; they are " thawing crystal heavens of ever-falling stars " ; their tears being " the cream of the milky way , " cherubs sip of them , and their liquid is bottled by angels for new guests of heaven . Further , the eyes are the hourglasses of time ; " walking baths , compendious oceans " ; " fertile mothers of simpering sons . " Common sense may almost be excused if it is indignant and disgusted at these frigid ardours , these fustian imitations of brocade . Yet if we turn from this to The Flaming Heart , a poem in honour of St. Theresa , and to a hymn addressed to the same Saint , we shall find , though still the same pomp and prodigality of imagery , nothing frigid , nothing fustian , but an ever growing and glowing splendour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named of the two pieces , in the most unerring explosion of passionate feeling to be found in English , perhaps in all poetry . Crashaw often translated , sometimes from very second-rate models like Marino and Strada . He can be made , though by something of a garble , the awful example of the style . But he as certainly displays its most splendid capabilities . An infinitely more popular poet than Crashaw , and certainly a more equable , though at the best of both Crashaw towers over him , was George Herbert , l a member of the noble Norman-Welsh family of that name , and brother of Lord Herbert of Cherbury . He was born at Montgomery Castle on 13th April 1593 , went to Cambridge , became Fellow of Trinity in 1615 , and Public Orator four years later , at the early age of twentysix . He held the place for eight years with great distinction , though // he was charged with the fault of haughtiness , and seems to have looked forward to a political career . But something led him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latterly at Bemerton , near Salisbury , which he pursued for six years , till his early death in 1632 . His verse ( almost entirely included in the well-known collection called The Temple , which made Crashaw call his Steps to the Temple ) was not published till after his death , but very soon after , for though the date of the first edition is 1633 , there are undated copies which seem to have been distributed in the previous year . The Temple consists of 16o pieces , arranged partly with a fancy of reference to the structural arrangement of a church , beginning with " The Porch " ; partly under the heads of the great festivals and services ; often under quite fantastic titles , " The Quip , " " The Pulley , " and so forth . There is no prevailing metre ? couplets , stanzas , and regular and irregular lyrical forms being chosen as may best suit the poet 's purpose , while occasionally he will even condescend , as in " Easter Wings , " to that device of adjusting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ridicule in the eighteenth century . And the note of fantasy is at least as much present in idea and in diction , though Herbert seldom pushes either to very extravagant lengths . In the " Church Porch , " which is a string of ethical and religious maxims . this fantasy does not often pass beyond the almost proverbial imagery to which we are accustomed in such connections . But in the more abstract and doctrinal poems Herbert gives himself a much wider range , and ransacks art and nature for quaint similes , sometimes worked out in the fashion of the emblem-poetry then so popular . The Game of Bowls ; the real or fancied properties of the orange tree ; the Palace of the World , with Wisdom sweeping away its cobwebs , Pleasure adorning it with balconies , Sin splitting the walls with stealthy fig-tree growth , Grace shoring them , and Death throwing them down ; the imaginary peculiarities of the crocodile and elephant ? Herbert presses all these and a myriad more into his service . Yet the unaffected piety , and perhaps still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstinence from anything like strife and crying , the heavenly peace that pervades him , have made his work tolerated by many who are not as a rule very tolerant of conceits . As a poet he is certainly not the equal of either Crashaw or Vaughan , and in his own quiet fashion he has in the present century been equalled by Keble and surpassed by Miss Christina Rossetti . He very seldom transports : the throb of response to the highest and happiest thoughts and expressions of the poets is very uncommon in reading him ; his is an equable merit , a soothing and healthful pleasure , rather than the dazzling excellence , the contagious rapture , of the great ones . But he can never be mentioned with contempt // by any one who loves poetry , and he undoubtedly holds a high place among those who have attempted the exceedingly difficult task of sacred verse . If his successes are never so great as those of some others , it is hardly too much to say that he never fails with the maddening failure too common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great thing . The contrast between Crashaw and Herbert is repeated in that between Herbert and Vaughan , ' but with certain variations . Henry Vaughan ? " Silurist , " as he called himself , from the seat of his family in South Wales , " Swan of Usk , " Olor Iscanus , from Vaughan ' the river on whose banks he lived ? was born in or about 1622 , at a place called Newton , St. Bridget . He and his twin brother Thomas ( a poet likewise and a diligent writer on occult and u Hermetic " subjects ) went to Jesus College , Oxford . He seems to have begun the study of law in London , but to have turned to that of medicine . He may have actually served in the Royalist forces during the Rebellion , and was certainly a strong partisan of the King 's cause . He retired quietly to Brecon during the usurpation and there practised physic . Hardly anything is known of his long life . He may have had two wives ; he certainly had one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Day , 1695 . He was the last of the Caroline school proper . His poetry as originally published is contained in four volumes ? Poems , chiefly secular , in 1646 ; Si/ex Scintillans , his principal book , and wholly sacred , in 1651 ; Olor Iscanus , also sacred , a year later ; and Thalia Rediviva , many years afterwards , in 1678 , which returns to the secular . There is no doubt ( we have his word for it , and without his word there could not be any ) that Vaughan was greatly influenced in all the more remarkable part of his work by Herbert , whose poems were published twenty years before Silex Scintillans . The relation between the two men is altogether that of master and pupil , but in divers ways . Often Vaughan copies Herbert directly . But the spirit of the two was different and resulted differently . Vaughan is not more or less pious than Herbert , but his piety is much more mystical ; his thoughts are deeper and farther brought . And his expression is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he is often meditative to dulness . He never disgusts , but he sometimes tires , because he has not cared , or has not been able , to give his thought clear poetic expression . // There was no real reason on the moral side for the compunction which Vaughan , late in life , expressed for his early secular poems . But as a profane poet he has nothing above the average of dozens of half or wholly forgotten versifiers of his time , and is often below that average . His love-poems to Amoret and Etesia are sometimes pretty , though never distinguished ; and in octosyllables , where he chiefly follows the manner of Jonson , he is at about his happiest . His decasyllabic couplets are , as Mr. Chambers has justly observed , based on Donne , and on the worst part of Donne , the designedly crabbed form of the Satires and some of the Epistles . It is as the author of the Si/ea- Sciutillans that Vaughan holds his place . And the title itself , which is explained by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stroke of a thunderbolt from a cloud ? is appropriate in more than the pious sense . At times there is in Vaughan genuine blood and fire ; but it is by no means always , or even very often , that the flint is kindled and melted to achieved expression . His most famous and successful things , " They are all gone into a world of light " ; " The World , " with its magnificent opening ? I saw Eternity the other night Like a great ring of pure and endless light All calm as it was bright ; " The Retreat , " with its suggestion of Wordsworth 's great ode ; " The Storm , " with its intensely realised imagery ; the quaint and pleasant piece beginning , " I walked the other day to spend my hour " ; the beautiful " Joy " ; " The Garland , " with its wonderfully striking picture of youthful delusions , and the sharp turn , " I met with a dead man , Who thus to me began " ; " The Waterfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a marvellous adaptation of sound to sense ? these and some other things are not merely in company unworthy of them as far as the achieved expression goes , but are even for the most part unworthy of themselves . But this inequality of expression is redeemed by the almost constant presence of a rare and precious tone of thought . The great age of the Church of England finds in Vaughan , at his best , its best poetical exponent . He stops short of the almost maudlin intoxication with divinity which carried Crashaw out of the Church altogether , and he far transcends the decent piety of Herbert . The pair chosen to follow this trio is in general character strangely contrasted with it , though a certain bridge of transition exists in Herrick 's " Divine " poems . Both Herrick and Carew are far greater artists than any of the three just mentioned . But despite of this and of the fact that their temper is far more mundane , they are still alike . // Robert Herrick , 1 who belonged to a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dryden , and Swift as well as through himself , was born in London in 1591 . His father , Nicholas Herrick , a goldsmith , died very shortly afterwards by falling out of window . Robert was left subject to the guardianship of his uncle , a rich member of his father 's trade , and by an accident , rare with men of letters of the time , we have some letters exchanged between ward and guardian , when the former was at Cambridge . Here he was a member , first of St. John 's College , then of Trinity Hall , and it is thought that he had gone to the first-named from Westminster School . But despite these letters we still do not know much of him . He took his M.A. in 162o , when he was nearly thirty years old , and apparently orders in 1629 , when he was not far from forty ? an entrance into the Church nearly as late as Donne 's , and even less accounted for . At any rate , in the year mentioned , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirts of Dartmoor , at which he rails much , and which he occupied till the triumph of the Parliament drove him out . His two books of verse , Noble Numbers ( 1647 ) and Hesperides ( 1648 ) , are differently dated but appeared together . There is absolutely no mention of him from this time till 1662 , when he was restored to Dean Prior ; and again there is none till his death and burial in October 1674 , at the age of more than eighty . Moreover , though gossip about men of letters was just beginning , there is a strange silence about Herrick . The two great chatterers of the time , Howell and Aubrey , never mention him , though the former at least must have been sometimes , probably often , in his company , as both were " sons " of Ben . The Sessions of the Poets and other literary comments of his day pass him by ; his work , contrary to the almost universal habit of the time , had no commendatory verses prefixed to it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last century . Since its recovery , however , there have been natural diversities of opinion , justified to some extent by the admixture of bad and good which it contains . The two divisions together contain rather more than fourteen hundred poems , to which a few doubtful pieces from miscellanies or MSS. have to be added . No one extends to more than a few pages , and most do not exceed a few lines . They fall naturally into three classes : epigrams imitating Jonson , offensively personal in tone and coarse in diction , with but seldom a grain of // real wit to keep them tolerably sweet ; Divine Poems of wonderful beauty at their best , which best is expressed by the " Litany to the Holy Spirit " and " The White Island " ; and lastly , an immense residue of secular poems , amatory , descriptive , occasional in the widest possible sense . It is on these last that the fame of Herrick really rests , and it is securely based . The Julia of the universally known " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thy silvery feet , My soul I 'll pour into thee " ? is only one of a group of perhaps real , perhaps imaginary , mistresses ? Althea , Electra , Perilla , Dianeme , and others ? to whom the most exquisitely phrased love-poems are devoted ; the country sports and scenes ( though he despised them ) , such as the " hock-cart , " the maying , and the like , find the same celebration ; his maid Patience , his breadbin , the daffodils , violets , primroses , cherry-blossoms , the very grass itself , find in him a singer , and he can be more ambitious and abstracted , as in the " Mad Maid 's Song " and other things . But the subject of Herrick 's verse never matters very much : it is the exquisite quality of his phrase and his " numbers " that exalts him to a place all his own . This quality beggars definition , and is perhaps the greatest justification in English literature of the " theory of the single word " ? that one special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that if you do not get it " all 's spent , nought 's had . " No one has ever been quite certain what the word " Protestant " means in the celebrated verse beginning , " Bid me to live and I will live , Thy Protestant to be " ; yet every one who knows poetry feels that " Protestant " could not be changed for any other word without loss ; and this is only an extreme and obvious case . In all his famous things , which a hundred anthologies have made known , and in others less divulged , this absolute and unerring perfection of word-selection appears . The . thoughts are sometimes trivial , sometimes not ; but the expression gives them at once the freshness of the morning dew and the perennial character of marble . Herrick 's images are not as a rule out of the way ; his mere vocabulary is , for his time and class , quite ordinary for the most part . But the choice and the collocation make it something absolutely unique . The art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sparingly exemplified , and more artificial in appearance , is of much the same kind . Many details of his life are problematical , but he was certainly of a Gloucestershire or Worcestershire branch of the great western family of Carew or Carey , was perhaps born in Kent , perhaps went to Westminster School , and perhaps // thence to Corpus Christi College , Oxford . The University though not the College is certain , as also that he was known to most of the wits , especially the Oxford set of Falkland and Hyde , that he was Sewer ( marshal of the dishes ) to Charles I. , that he was a " son " of Ben 's . He died in or about 1638 . Most other things about him are guesswork , but it is the merest uncritical partisanship to neglect or slight the testimony of his admiring friend Clarendon , that his life had been somewhat licentious , though his death was the death of the penitent . A masque of his , Caelum Britannicum , which is not unworthy to be ranked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1634 ; but Carew 's Poems appeared posthumously in 164o , and they did not include divers paraphrases of Psalms which are of no great value ? a sentence which extends to divers attributed poems , fished out from MSS. or other sources by recent diligence . The volume of 1640 , small as it is , still contains his titles to fame . This volume is small , and the contemporary malevolence or jest which attributed " hide-boundness " to Carew 's muse was not subject to any such complete contradiction as Johnson 's characterisation of Fielding as a " barren rascal . " But the titles are indisputable . The best , ? the " Persuasions to Love , " to A. L. , ? with its at first playful octosyllables rising to a panting throb of passion seldom equalled ; the song , characteristic of Caroline triumph in such things , " Give me love or more disdain " ; the still more splendid " To my Inconstant Mistress " ? " When thou , poor excommunicate " ; the indignant and manly expostulation , " 1 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pretty " He that loves a rosy cheek " ; the second " To Celia Singing " ; " Red and White Roses , " with two or three other things the pattern-piece of the author ; the audacious but also admirable " Rapture " ; the beautiful group of epitaphs on Lady Mary Villers ; the stately elegy on Donne , so generous and yet so just ; and , to finish with what all admit , the splendid " Ask me no more " ? these things by no means exhaust , but put at perhaps their very best , Carew 's titles to high honour as an English poet . His consummate elegance has no doubt done him harm with some judges , according to the prejudice put in the well-known verses of his " father " Ben ? Still to be neat , still to be drest , and so forth . But the " Rapture , " the Donne Elegy , and the " A. L. " verses are there to give evidence of intensity , of real passion on his part , which at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little on such a piece as " Red and White Roses , " it will be very hard to refuse its author a place , apart it may be from the greater // summits of poetry and lower than they are , but untouched , unapproached , by any peak in its own kind . Here , as in those best pieces of Herrick which have been noticed above , there is an absolute and final felicity in the style . The poets of this Caroline age are so numerous , they are so attractive , and their attractions consist so much in little separate bits and strokes , that there is danger , more than in almost any other of our compartments , of being seduced into prolixity disproportionate for such a survey as this ; and we must quicken the pace with a large group of singers . The order in which they are mentioned , though a certain rough chronological arrangement may be observed , is not very material . The lyric touch , which is the strong point of nearly all , distinguishes , with only slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , such as Randolph , and men who saw the eighteenth century , such as Sedley . Thomas Randolph , ' who will be mentioned again for his plays , was born in 1605 , of a gentle family . He went to Westminster School and was of both Universities , belonging more originally to Cambridge , where he was a Fellow of Trinity . He died when he was only thirty . He is accused of rather free Randoiph. living , but this sort of vague and stock censure of poets goes for little , and certain elegiac verses by his brother Robert , a student of Christ Church , who outlived him many years , have a more genuine ring in their eulogy than is usual in such things . Randolph 's nondramatic verse , though not very copious , is fresh , vigorous , and distinctly original . It is , especially in the couplet pieces , of the older cast of his time , and in stanza or octosyllable. rather Jacobean than Caroline . His best piece , perhaps , is the " Ode to Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing somewhat in Ben 's style . William Habington 2 was born in the same year with Randolph , at Hindlip Hall . Worcestershire . He was a Roman Catholic , and so did not go to either University , but lived as a country gentleman , marrying Lady Lucy Herbert , and dying in 1654 . He left one play , The Queen of Arragon , and a collection of poems , the bulk of which celebrates the charms and virtues of his wife under the title-name of Castara . Friendship as well as love inspired him , and he wrote many verses on the death of his comrade , George Talbot , with a few miscellanies . Habington is creditably distinguished from too many of his contemporaries by a very strict and , remarkable decency of thought and language , and he has some very fine passages . On the whole , however , he ranks rather with Herbert // as a poet of few faults ? he has not even the excess of Herbert 's quaintness ? than with Crashaw as one of magnificent bursts , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cartwright ' was born about five years after Randolph , in 1610 , and died two years before Habington , in 1643 , but the date and place of his birth are disputed . He certainly spent more than half of his short life at Oxford , where he died during the war , and five years after he had taken orders . He left plays , too , and poems , the latter fairly numerous , but mostly short and always occasional . His couplets , like Randolph 's , show little of the new form and pressure ; but his lyric verses , again of the Jonson tribe , are often good , and sometimes excellent . The more extravagant side of the school is shown in the lines on " A Gentlewoman 's Silk Hood , " the better in the lines " To Chloe , " to Bishop Duppa , and others . Richard Corbet , 2 Bishop of Oxford , and then , just before Hall , of Norwich , was a much older man than those just mentioned , having been born in 1582 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years before his death , which happened in the same year as Randolph 's . He too was closely connected with Ben , and is said to have procured him his degree from Oxford . He appears to have been an interesting compound of a sound divine and a good fellow , and his poetical pieces , which are quite occasional , were probably spread over the greater part of his not very long life , though many of them date from the latter part of it . The best and most poetical , a charming address to his little son Vincent , combining humour and tenderness in the best English fashion , certainly does so , having been written in 1630 . At purely serious poetry Corbet was not very great , but in lighter and satiric verse he anticipates Butler , Swift , and even Prior , as in his Iter G'oreale ( a title copied afterwards ) , his journey into France , and ( the strongest and bitterest of all ) his " Exhortation to Mr. John Hammond " and " Distracted Puritan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a certain traditional and now inseparable bond between Lovelace and Suckling . Both were unlucky Cavaliers , both illustrate the poignant charm of Cavalier poetry at its best , and both , it must be added , illustrate also the slipshod faults of this poetry . at its worst . Both , moreover , give us , better than any others , the link of transition from the first to the second lyrical Caroline School , from Herrick and Carew to Dorset and Sedley . The short life of Sir John Suckling3 is partly mythical . He was of a good though not great family , was educated at Westminster perhaps , 1I // and Trinity College , Cambridge , certainly became early master of a great fortune , lavished it in travel , in court frivolities , and ( at the breaking out of the war with Scotland ) in equipping a troop of horse who did no credit to themselves and their leader , was a strong Royalist in the Long Parliament , and had to fly to the Continent , was perhaps a victim of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1642 . Suckling 's excess of wealth over birth , and perhaps his careless living , seem to have excited some illfeeling against him , but there is little solid proof that he was a cowardly prodigal and fribble , and we should certainly prefer not to think the author of the ? Ballad on a Wedding " anything of the kind . Besides that charming piece and his plays ( see as in other cases post ) , with some letters , etc. , he has left a parcel of poems , occasional , satirical ( his Session of the Poets , which not improbably earned him his had reputation , was constantly imitated ) , and above all amatory , of a curious and original kind , indicated at once in the words ? There never yet was honest man Who ever drove the trade of love , upon which text the poets and play-writers dwelt with unwearying iteration for the next half-century and more . Suckling , however , though neither a refined nor a very passionate writer , does not reach the dull brutality of loveless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too often taints the best . His is the real " elfin laughter , " the true tricksiness of Cupid , which even Rochester , even Congreve , turned to sordid treachery and ribald coarseness later . Everything with Suckling turns to a ripple of merriment . " Love 's World " reads like , and perhaps is , a designed burlesque of the metaphysical altitudes . ' T is now since I sat down before That foolish fort , a heart , is the very triumph of the style , unless Out upon it ! I have loved Three whole days together ; or the universally known Why so thin and pale , fond lover ? demand the preference . The poet is not always quite so frivolous ; there are poems , and good ones , of his which might pass muster as serious , but one always suspects that they are not . // Richard Lovelace n derives his just immortality from two or three pieces of exactly the opposite kind . He was of a better family than Suckling , but like him very wealthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born at Woolwich in 1618 , educated at Charterhouse and at Gloucester Hall , Oxford , was prevented from taking part in the Civil War by being committed to the Gatehouse and held to enormous bail in 1642 , but contrived to help the King 's cause with much money , fought abroad at Dunkirk and elsewhere , and returning to England in 1648 , was again imprisoned . He was released , but as a ruined man , and he died in Gunpowder Alley , Shoe Lane , two years before the Restoration . Meanwhile his beloved Lucy Sacheverall ? " Lucasta " ? had married another under the belief that he was dead , and Lovelace , one of the handsomest men of his time , beloved by all , rich , well-born , and of rare abilities , died thus almost miserrimus . He published Lucasta in 1649 , and ten years later a brother added Posthumous Poems . He wrote plays , but they perished . The greater part of his work is worthless , and some of it almost unintelligible , owing to the strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to very careless printing . But . ' On Going to the Wars " and " To Althea from Prison " defy the greatest things of the greatest poets in absolute achievement of their particular purpose , and there are charming passages in " The Grasshopper . " From these two mainly , and especially from Suckling , proceed a school of songsters who , as has been said , did not absolutely cease till the death of Sedley in the year after that of Dryden . Dryden himself has some claims to belong to them , but there is still a difference of cast , hard to define but easy to perceive , and all his work had best be handled in the next period . Marvell , at his best almost the equal of any in this chapter , Davenant , and that remarkable isolation . Chamberlayne , may be placed apart . For our purposes the group may be composed , again in loosely chronological order , of Sherburne , Bishop King , Stanley , Godolphin , Brome , and Cotton among the school more especially of Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behn , the more definitely Restoration group , can be postponed . To these a fringe or fringes might be added very copiously . for the second and third quarters of the seventeenth century swarmed with poets and poetasters . Of these last may be mentioned John Cleveland , who was born at Hinckley in 1613 , became a Fellow of St. John 's College , Cambridge . took refuge at Oxford with other Cambridge Cavaliers , was imprisoned under the Commonwealth , and died of fever in 1658 . Cleveland is rather unfairly known by some citations of conceits in Johnson 's dis- // quisition on the metaphysicals prefixed to his Life of Cowley , and he has not recently been reprinted . Even Dryden soon after the Restoration sneers at him ; and his name became a byword for extravagances of style.HIe had , however , no little vigour , extravagances chiefly shown in his ? State " Poems , the longest of which is a furious onslaught on the Scots for their betrayal of Charles . It is at least curious to compare his elegy on Edward King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fancy we may charitably allow a suspicion of humorous and conscious exaggeration . Wild , author of a second Per Boreale and the sharer of Dryden 's sarcasm , was a very inferior Cleveland who survived the Restoration ; Flatman , a poet and painter with an unlucky name who wrote some charming songs , and whom Pope found " good to steal from . " Flecknoe , notorious for Dryden 's unceremonious use of his name in his satire on Shadwell , has a fine poem on " Silence " and some other good things . Patrick Carey 's Trivial Poems and Trio/etc ( 1651 ) are pleasant for more than their form and the fact that Scott re-edited them . But of these . as still more of Beedome and Baron , Hall and Heath and Hooke , Tatham and Kynaston , Prestwich and Shepherd , no account in any detail can be given here.l The life of Andrew Marvell2 and his work both fall into two sharply divided and curiously contrasted sections . In the first he is a quiet student , a passionate lyrical poet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings , gently inclined to what is noble in the other side ; in the second he is , Marvell. perhaps an austere patriot . certainly a violent politician , and poetically a ferocious lampooner in rough couplets . We may confine ourselves here to his earlier , and as literature better , period . He was born in 1621 at Winestead , not far from Hull , and went early to Cambridge , where he took his Bachelor 's but not his Master 's degree . He seems to have travelled a good deal , but we find him in 1649 at home , contributing to the collection of elegies on Lord Hastings which saw Dryden 's first work , and being the friend of Richard Lovelace . Indeed , the splendid lines on the execution of Charles I. , and others , show him as at least partly Royalist at this time . In 165o , however , Fairfax made him his daughter 's tutor , and for this reason or that Marvell seems to have changed his politics . He was long resident with his young pupil at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his most delightful verse . . // Becoming an admirer of Cromwell and a friend of Milton , he entered Parliament even before the Restoration , and sat for Hull till his death in 1678 . I. or some years he was abroad doing diplomatic work , but latterly he fell more and more into Opposition . His best , and indeed his only really , poetical work was clone before he had reached middle life , and exhibits , with a form individual and in a type more chastened and classical . the best characteristics of the Cavalier poets . The exquisite octosvllables of the long poem on " Appleton House , " and the shorter and still better known ones on " The Bermudas " and " The Nymph regretting the loss of her Fawn , " unite Jonson 's art with Herrick 's grace . " The Coronet , " in style between Crashaw and Vaughan , is free from the rococo ornament of the first and the tongue-tied inequality of the second ; the passionate magnificence of the Amorists , whom Milton so tastelessly scorned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and still more " The Definition of Love , " with its splendid beginning ? My love is of a birth as rare As ' t is for object , strange and high ? It was begotten of Despair Upon Impossibility ; and the majesty in style of the " Horatian Ode " ( to Cromwell , but containing the lines on his victim ) is among the noblest and most individual of the kind in English . Nor can it be said that Marvell , like most of his school and time , wrote unequally ; so that it is only curious that he did not write more . But perhaps it is not fanciful to argue that the peculiar and indeed unique perfection of phrase characterising the best poetry of this period involved a kind of mental effort of gestation which could not be repeated very often , and which obliged the poet to be either unequal or else infertile . Henry King , ' a typical poet of this period ( who is likely to keep his place in English literature by at least one exquisite piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is , " and by a part claim to " Like to the falling of a star , " one of those sets of verses which so caught the fancy of the time that they exist in many different forms and are attributed as originally the work of more than two different men ) , was born at Worminghall in Bucks in 1592 , was educated at Westminster and Christ Church , received preferment early ( his father was Bishop of London ) , but justified it both by abilities and virtues , was the friend of Jonson , Donne , whose executor he was , and Howell the epistoler , became Canon of Christchurch . Dean of Winchester , and Bishop of Chichester , was much despoiled and ill-treated during the Rebellion , but recovered his see . // at the Restoration , and died in 1669 . His poems were partly published in 1657 . The influence of his great friend Donne is obvious , and though King had not anything like Donne 's strength or the strangeness of his charm , yet " Tell me no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the five Cavalier poets 1 mentioned together above , most were actively engaged in the war , or at least active members of the Royalist party . Edward Sherburne , afterwards knighted , and the son of a knight of the same name , was born in London in 1618 , was educated abroad ( he was a Roman Catholic ) , and became clerk of the Ordnance , but lost his place and his liberty in 1642 . On his release he joined the King 's army , but chiefly studied at Oxford till the triumph of the Parliament , when he lost all his property . He recovered his Ordnance post at the Restoration , but lost it as a Roman Catholic at the Revolution , and did not die till 1702 . Much of his not extensive poetical work is translated from authors-and languages ancient and modern . His originals , reminding us of Carew on the profane side , of Crashaw on the sacred , have sufficient charm of their own , yet perhaps never show quite at the best of the style . Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembrance better as the author of the first English History of Philosophy , and as the editor of an excellent edition of Aeschylus , than as a poet , but , as was not uncommon at the time , great and genuine learning by no means extinguished poetry in him . He was the son of a rich man , and though a strong Royalist , does not seem to have been much incommoded He was born in 1624 , educated at Pembroke College , Oxford , and died in 1678 , having lived chiefly in the Temple . He sang mainly of love , and well . Another of the group , Sidney Godolphin , uncle of the future Lord Treasurer , and himself celebrated by Clarendon , had the good fortune to die young and gloriously fighting in Hopton 's triumphant campaign at Chagford in 1642 . He was not much over thirty at his death , having been born in 161o . He had entered Exeter College , Oxford , at fourteen , and with Trevanion , Slanning , and Sir Bevil Grenvil , was the flower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . was both translator and original writer , and though his work is not great in bulk , he has the ineffable ring of the time in many more places than this : ? Oh love me less or love me more , And play not with my liberty ; Either take all or all restore , , Bind me at least , or set me free . CAROL1I E LITERATURE BOOK Brome and Cotton were of somewhat less limited production , but also of a less rare style . Alexander Brome ( to be distinguished from Richard , the playwright , whose plays he edited ) was a Londoner and an attorney . He was born in 1620 and died in 1666 . It does not appear that he took any active part for the King , but very many of the songs and lampoons by which the Cavaliers kept up their spirits between Rebellion and Restoration are attributed to him ; he has Izaak Walton 's good word , which could have been given to no bad man ; and some of his light and careless ditties have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he is sometimes coarse , he stopped far short of the unpleasant excesses of others in that direction , and there is tenderness in his love-poems , fire in his Bacchanalia , sincerity in his political songs , and wit , whim , and spirit everywhere . Charles Cotton of Beresford Hall , Staffordshire , is known to most people as Walton 's colleague and pupil in the Complete Angler ; to some as the author of the admirable " New Year Poem , " admired by Lamb ; to a few as the writer of many other pleasant verses , including the last rona'eaux that English saw for a century ; and to fewer still , it may be hoped , by the unworthy following of Scarron and Butler combined , called Virgil Troves/le . As a prose writer he is kept in some memory by his translation of Montaigne , though it was not in the least wanted after Florio . His original poems , very numerous , very unequal , and often very slight , are sometimes at least very happy . Hardly one of the authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must now turn to those of their time who were . Butler , though really of it , is so mixed up with the history of Restoration literature that he may be postponed , Davenant , Quarles , Chamberlayne , More , and Beaumont must find place . Four of these writers , very popular in their time , are now merely curiosities , the fifth has never been much known , but was a writer of singular talent . The most voluminous of all was Francis Quarles , ' who was born of a good Essex family near Romford , in 1592 , was a member of Christ 's College , Cambridge , and of Lincoln 's Inn , and held divers appointments in court , city , and the lay offices of the Church . He just survived the breaking out of the Rebellion , and died in 1644 . His work is enormous : he would versify anything from the Arcadia to the Lamentations . Little of his is now remembered except his famous Emblems ; and he wrote prose , of which again nothing survives in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Quarles ; but it requires a great deal of leisure to find them out , and they are // so fragmentary as hardly to be capable of separate representation . Henry More and Joseph Beaumont carried the dubious Spenserianism of the Fletchers yet farther by writing immense poems on philosophical theology . More 's enormous Sang of the Soul in Spenserians , and even Beaumont 's more enormous Psyche in sixains , are not to be spoken of without respect , the first being certainly the work of a man who had poetry in him . But the choice of subject in each case was problematical , the choice of scale in both fatal . The middle of the century saw two other long poems of much more human interest . Both were the work of ardent Cavaliers ; both deserted alike the classical epic and the allegorical romance for a novel kind of story founded , no doubt , in each case ( though the fact has not been always recognised ) on the French heroic novel , but treated with independence . One , however , distinctly anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either for that reason or because of its author 's busy and not unamiable character , immediately , widely , and for some time popular . The other , except in scheme and subject , looked backward , and seems to have been almost entirely neglected . These are the Gourlibert of Sir William Davenant and the Pliaronuula of William Chamberlayne . Davenant was born at Oxford in 1605 , the son of an innkeeper , but had some connection with Shakespeare , wrote verses ( and not bad ones ) on his death , and was well educated at Lincoln College . He was taken up by Lord Brooke and others , and produced his tragedy of Albovine in 1628 , when most of the second school of Elizabethans , and some of the first , were still living and writing . Ten years later he succeeded Jonson as Laureate , became a playhouse manager , and both in these capacities and as a busy servant of the King , and still worse of the Queen , fell into very bad odour with the Puritan party . He served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even seems to have been in some serious danger , but is said to have been saved by Milton , whose kindness he afterwards returned in the time of the greater poet 's own peril . If the stories are true , he thus knew the three greatest men of letters ( for he was later intimate with Dryden ) of the three generations of the century ; and he was in more ways than one an ingenious and interesting man of letters . He was not , however , a great poet , though his miscellaneous verse is sometimes pretty , and Gondlibert is not a great poem . It was written on principle , and is ushered not by the usual crowd of commendatory verses from anybody and nobody , but by two copies only , from the great Mr Cowley and the great Mr. Waller , and by letters to and from Mr. Hobbes . To this last Davenant explains his // principles at great length , and Hobbes replies that he never yet saw poem that had so much shape of art , health of morality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not finished ) . It is a poem in three books , each of several cantos , and some 1700 or ' Soo quatrains ? a form which for some time marked , and very slightly arrested , the inevitable transition from the longer stanzas to couplet and blank verse . The scene is Lombardy , and especially Verona ; the theme the affections of the hero as tending towards Rhodalind or towards Birtha , two damsels equally " bright of blee " with fighting and other things . But the stanza is not well suited for narratives of great length , and the verse , though occasionally weighty and dignified , is too often wooden ; while , except in Birtha , there is little attempt at character . Pharonnida is a very much better thing , though by no means a perfect one . Of its author little is known . He was born about 162o , practised as a physician , and died in 1689 , at Shaftesbury in Dorsetshire . He was a good Cavalier and fought at the battle of Newbury . He tells us himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in 1659 , and in its author 's lifetime turned into a prose romance under the title of Eromcna ) , he had a year earlier published a play , Love 's Victories , which seems to have been acted twenty years after , also with its title changed . It is a somewhat confused piece ( see next chapter ) of the Brome and Nabbes kind , more poetical , with some very fine flashes , but not worth much as a whole . Pharonnida , on the contrary , is worth a great deal , though as far as possible from being faultless . It is difficult to agree with Campbell ( the first of the few who have praised it ) that it is " one of the most interesting stories ever told in verse , " for this story , such as it is , is extremely incoherent , and the personages are mere stock romantic types ? Pharonnida , a virgin in danger ; her lover Argalia , a compound of Joseph , Amadis , and Hector ; and so forth . Further , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? especially that ugliest " to 's " for " to his , " and the like ? deface it . But the versification , which represents a further development from Wither and Browne , is , though too much " enjambed , " often charmingly melodious ; some of the episodes ? especially that at Rhodes , with the fate of Janusa , which Campbell has given , not quite completely ? are of great force and interest , and above all the spirit of romance pervades the whole , while the separate phrases and passages of beauty are literally innumerable . It has five books , each in several cantos like Goxdibert , and must contain from twelve to fifteen thousand verses . But it is not rash to say that of the nearly // five hundred pages which contain them hardly one can be read without finding some notable poetic fragment , and few without finding more than one such thing as we may search the whole poetry of the eighteenth century with little chance of paralleling . The Miscellanies and Song-books of the Elizabethan period proper continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed fashions , which must be at least glanced at here . The books of this class may be best divided into two varieties which often crossed each other . The ballad , ' the rise es . of which was sketched formerly , received especial attention during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , and certain individual fashioners of it , Thomas Delony , Elderton , Martin Parker , are known . The bulk of the examples preserved for us by the fortunate fancies of Pepys and other collectors is enormous , and from time to time bundles were printed under divers titles , some of them very pretty , ' in which the word Garland is often conspicuous . But there were also more ' literary collections , 3 in which not a little of the work of poets mentioned already occurs , with a good deal that is anonymous , this latter sometimes including charming things such as the famous " Phillida ( Phillada ) flouts me . " At about the time of the Restoration these books were apt to assume the title of Drollery , which persevered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his seal . To judge the progress of literature one must read most of these things ; but the result of the reading is not easy to summarise . As the century went on , the coarseness ( sometimes reaching brutality ) which was provoked and fostered by Puritanism stains them . Yet even in the dullest and most offensive deserts , things like And the Star Chamber of her eyes Robs subjects of their liberties , make diversion and amends . CHAPTER III THE DRAMA TILL THE CLOSING OF THE THEATRES Massinger ? Ford ? Shirley ? Randolph ? Suckling ? Davenant ? Brome ? Nabbes and Davenport ? Glapthorne WITH due observation of the caution ( which may seem tediously repeated , but is still necessary ) as to the overlapping of periods in the brief , crowded , and intensely active years of the drama called Elizabethan , we shall find a more than sufficiently well-marked character in its third and last stage , though the best men ? Massinger , Ford , Shirley ? were not very young . Philip Massinger , l son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went to St. Alban 's Hall , Oxford , and seems to have remained at the University till about the usual age of five or six and twenty . We do not know how or when he made his way to London and began play-writing , tnough he was , on documentary evidence , engaged in that occupation as early as 1614 ; but the earliest thing of his that we have is The Virgin Martyr , which was acted in 1622 . He died seventeen years later , in 1639 , and was buried in St. Saviour 's , Southwark , a church of many literary connections . It was not that of his own parish , for he was entered as " a stranger . " Thus he is nearly as little known to us personally as his colleague in The Virgin Martyr , Dekker himself . But in his literary character we know him very well . Of nearly twoscore plays recorded and ascribed to him , rather more than half are lost , but the eighteen that remain ' exhibit him in sufficiently varied lights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much altered if we had the rest . The general impression which he gives , when he is compared with his predecessors , is that of 1 432 en . In THE DRAMA TII.1 , ' l'ltl ? CLOSING OF THE THEATRES 433 a slight increase of artificiality accompanied by ? and no doubt clue to ? a corresponding decrease in original and spontaneous genius . Massinger 's tragedies are never the mere blood-and-thunder muddles of which we have so many before him , and they have many noble scenes and passages , especially in The Unnatural Combat , The Duke of Milan , The Bondman , Me Picture . The Roman Actor , The Fatal Dowry ; but with the exception of The Virgin Martyr itself , where the difference is fairly set clown to the hand of Dekker , we find little or nothing of the ineffable snatches of poetry of the earlier drama , and an inability to strike out those fresh and not impossible , if not always very probable , types of character which ( not to mention Shakespeare ) we find even in Beaumont and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of those mere heaps of less or more amusing scenes compacted into no dramatic story , and not even connected by the thread of any one vivid character , which we find earlier iii Middleton , and later in Broke , and Nabbes , and others of his younger contemporaries . But hardly more than twice , in the famous New Way to ! ' ay Ola ' Debts ( by far his greatest play , in which the usurer and tyrant Sir Giles Overreach is worthy of Jonson at least ) and in The City Maalam , does he rise to distinction in comedy . On the whole , however , the greatest of the great race cease with him , for he as far surpasses Shirley in intensity and in the goodness of his best things , as he does Ford ? his superior in these points ? in range , bulk , variety , and comparative freedom from the morbid . His blank verse is very good , less musical than Beaumont and Fletcher 's , but free from that perilous pressing of the " points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivor of them , admirably suited for stately declamation , and yet of sufficient variety . And he has a certain indefinable faculty of giving a good account of almost any subject handled by him . That he has had few passionate admirers is clue probably to the fact that he rather attains and keeps a high level of general craftsmanship than shoots to solitary heights of individual artistic success . But , since Gifford , he has been generally set too low , and Gifford did not value him quite aright . He should indeed gain , not lose , by the contrast with his contemporary , John Ford . ' Ford does go higher than Massinger ; he has received warmer praise by far ; it is considered as a mark of Philistinism to set any limitation to estimates of him . Yet it is noticeable that wherever Ford is at his best , he avails himself of illegitimate aids . His very best play , ' T is Pity she 's a Whore , brings on the scene the passion of a brother for a sister , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agony by the most preposterous and improbable means . Ford can not do with nature ; he l Ed . Gifford and Hartley Coleridge , as above ; also Dyce , reprinted 1895. 2 F // must go against or beyond her to fetch effects of tragedy , and in doing this he stands condemned and excluded from the first order of poets of his own time , or indeed of any . The inspiration of the unnatural is the " Dutch courage " of poetry . He was not , like most of his rivals , a writer for a living , though he seems to have worked pretty hard for those by no means lavish paymasters the theatrical managers . He wrote plays in the second , third , and fourth decades of the century ; but he was a member of a good Devonshire house , the Fords of Ilsington , was connected with others , was a member of Lincoln 's Inn , though we have no record of his being at either University . As early as r606 he celebrated the death of Lord Mountjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second husband of Sidney 's Stella . When he ceased writing or when he died we do not know , and we have very few notices of him , the chief being the often-quoted one in a Drollery , which is not unpicturesque Deep in a dump alone John Ford was got gat , With folded arms and melancholy hat . Sixteen plays are attributed to him alone or in collaboration . We have lost Beauty in a Trance , destroyed by Warburton 's cook , but entered in the Stationers ' books as late as 1653 . The London Merchant , The Royal Comedy , and An Ill Beginning has a good End , also destroyed by this same evil cook , appeared still later in 166o , with apparently no collaborator in any . Ford and Dekker are responsible for The Fairy Kukla and Tin ' this/owe Merchant ( of which from Dekker we should have preferred the former ) , and Ford and Webster for Tin ' Murder of the Son Von the Mother , which from the authors of The Broken heart and The Duchess of Malfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining the curious play of The Witch of Edmonton , in which Ford took part with Rowley , Dekker , and others ; The Sun 's Darling , by Ford and Dekker , and worthy of neither except that it has some of the charming lyrics which Ford could never manage alone , but which mark the passage of Dekker everywhere . The Fancies Chaste and Noble , Love 's Sacrifice , The Lady 's Trial are all feeble , and Love 's Sacrifice offensive ; so that the pieces on which his fame rests are the pair already mentioned , with The Lover 's Melancholy and PerkinWarbeck . This last has the perhaps not very high honour of being one of the best of plays on an English historical subject out of Shakespeare ; The Lover 's Melancholy , a graceful but rather feeble piece , is principally famous for one of the verse transcripts ( Crashaw did another ) of Strada 's prolusion on the nightingale and the lute-player . But neither can enter into competition with the other two , and it is by these that Ford 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most notable poets of Charles 's reign , James Shirley , ' was somewhat , but not very much , younger than Massinger and Ford . He was a Londoner , and was born in 1596 ( thus vindicating the right of the drama of which he was the last distinguished practitioner to be called Elizabethan ) . He Shirley . was educated at Merchant Taylors ' and hence passed not merely to the natural university destination of its scholars , St. John 's College , Oxford , but also to Catherine Hall , Cambridge . He was ordained in the Church of England but went over to Rome , and became a schoolmaster , between which occupation and the writing of plays he hovered for the greater part of his tolerably long life . He is said , as well as his wife , to have died of fright , and perhaps exposure , in consequence of the fire of London in 1666 . Shirley 's work , what with masques and what with plays , is very voluminous , extending to some forty pieces with a few non-dramatic poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the famous lyric , " The glories of our blood and state , " contained in one of the latest of his entertainments , The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses . Yet he was a playwright for some forty years , his first piece , Love Tricks , having appeared in 1625 . Other comedies are The Witty Fair One ( 1628 ) , The Wedding , The Pall , Hyde Park , The Changes , The Lady of Pleasure . Among his tragedies we may name The Traitor and The Cardinal ; the first named of which is his best in this way , as The Lady of Pleasure is his best in the other . Shirley , almost more than any other of the great race , has suffered both from over-praise and over-blame , as well as from the want of reading as a whole , which he especially needs . ' In original power he is undoubtedly the least of the series which he ends : he has no great plays , hardly any great scenes , and not very many distinguished passages . In him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain distinct imitation , the " literary " note . On the other hand his plays are very generally readable as wholes , and have a certain gain in coherence and congruity , even though they , for the most part , belong to a very loosely constructed scheme of drama . He does not fall into the astonishing and almost inconceivable hodge-podge of prose that is // not prose , and verse that is not verse , which we find in men like Davenant and Suckling , but can write more than fair verse when he chooses this , and very fair prose when he chooses that . Indeed , now and then his verse rises to a melancholy sweetness which admirably suits his best notes of character and tone ? notes of a rather feminine grace and a slightly sentimental chivalry . As in tragedy he stops short of horrors generally , so in comedy he abstains generally from obscenity . After the Restoration he fell into disrepute ? on the one hand Pepys sneers at his individual plays , and on the other the almost always generous Dryden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite unjust , and he is even a direct link between Fletcher and the distinctive Restoration comedy in all its better and some of its worse ways . He was undoubtedly unlucky in coming just where he did , and may be said to have fallen between two generations . Yet he by no means unworthily ends his own great class . Even in these three greater men ? certainly in Shirley ? signs , if not of decadence , at any rate of impending change , are manifest ; in nearly all the minor playwrights of the period these signs become flagrant . The most promising of this group is Randolph , ' whose dramatic work , Aristippus , The Conceited Pedlar , The Jealous Lovers , The Manses ' Looking-Glass , Amyutus , and Down with Knavery , all show the influence of the classics both directly and through Jonson . Amyntas and The Muses ' Looking Glass are the best , but no one is absolutely good , and all labour under the defect of being rather exercises in different school ; of drama than original compositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those dramatists who were also more or less considerable poets , form a curious contrast to his poems . The versification shows almost every fault of which dramatic verse is capable , and which has been or was to be shown by English dramatists . It is by turns as stiff as Gorboduc and as loose as the worst imitations of Fletcher 's later redundances , while , like play-verse generally at this time and for some years to come , till Dryden tightened things up again , it very often slips and flounders about as if it never could make up its mind to be verse or prose , heroics or doggerel . The prettily named tragedies of Brennoralt , The Sad One , and Aglaura ( the last of which has two fifth acts , as fishingrods have two tops ) are strange nondescripts , blending echoes of Shakespeare , who was very popular at Charles the First 's court , with imitations of the heroic novels . The Goblins , a comedy , is rather amusing but wildly chaotic . 1 Edition as for Poems . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEATRES 437 Davenant 's . verse in his plays is not much better than Suckling 's , but , partly by accident , he is a more important person in the history of the stage if not of the literary drama . It has been said that he began as a playwright with Albovine ( 1628 ) , The Cruel Brother , and other things , quite early , and he followed them up with others ? The Wits , News from Plymouth , the Fair favourite , The Unfortunate Lovers , Love and Honour , etc. , none of them very good plays and all of them in very bad verse ? verse so bad that one suspects some convention of deliberate badness , as in the case of the satirists . But when Davenant , long after the theatres were closed , had secured his liberty through Milton , and perhaps also through him had become acquainted with Cromwell , he used his influence with the Protector to obtain permission ( 656 ) for the performance of musical entertainments , which practically restarted the drama itself . Notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prolific playwright , however , of this time was Richard Brome.2 We know next to nothing of Brome except that he was dead in 1653 , and that at one time he was servant to Ben Jonson , who mentions him by no means unkindly , though others , to curry favour with Ben , or out of spite to Brome , spoke of his plays as the sweepings of Jonson 's study . They are , as we have them edited by his namesake Alexander , fifteen in number , and they belong , without exception , to that rather nondescript class of plays of contemporary manners which has been already noted under the heads of Middleton , Jonson . and Fletcher . The best of them are The Northern Lass ( in which Constance the heroine is made to speak a sort of Scots ) and The jovial Crew , a very merry picture of gipsy life . All the rest , The Siaragus Garden , A Mad Couple well Matched , The City Wit , The Lovesick Court , The Queen and Concubine , The Antipodes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The English Moor , Covent Garden Weeded , The New Exchange , resemble each other curiously . We read them without too much belief in their pictures of manners , and yet recognising traits here and there as from the life . Of Thomas Nabbes , 3 a weaker Brome , we know even less ? nothing , in short , except that he once drank some good strong beer at Droitwich , and seems generally to have haunted Worcestershire . His plays , Covent Garden , Tottenham Court ( names indicating the style ) , Hannibal and Scipio , a weak play of a more ambitious sort , The Bride , The Unfortunate Mother , i Ed . Maidment and Logan , 5 vols . Edinburgh , 1882. // with the moral masque of Microcosrnus , by which he has been most generally known , and which is perhaps his best thing ? all seem to have been produced between 1638 and the closing of the theatres . Robert Davenport ' . was an older writer if not an older man , for he had a historical play , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; John and Matilda , his best thing , has been thought to be not much younger , though we hear nothing of it till 1639 , and it was not printed till still later . The City N9 ; htcali , which ranks with it , but is a comedy , must have been as old in years as the histories , and there is a third existing play of some merit , A New Trick to Cheat the Devil , which was published in 1639 . Davenport certainly wrote other plays , and those which we have are good enough to make us wish for what we have not . A similar wish would perhaps be more difficult in the case of Henry Glapthorne , of whom again so little is known that his editor 2 has thought it necessary to print some documents about a George Glapthorne , not known to be in the slightest degree connected with the dramatist . We have of his a certain number of poems , mostly in couplets , and in a feeble style , and five plays ? Alberta 's Wallenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Argalus and Partl'enia , one of the numerous dressings up of the Arcadia , Wit in a Constable , The Lady 's Privilege , and The Hollander . Perhaps he wrote The Lady Mother . He is something of a poet , but very little of a dramatist . Besides these the fifteen years or thereabouts of Caroline drama provide the names of Shakerley Marmion , who besides a rather pretty poem , Cupid and Psyche , produced at least three extant plays , the best of which is The Antiquary , long known from its inclusion in Dodslcy ; Sir Aston Cokain , the author of The Obstinate Lady , Trappoia Creduto Principe , and Ovid ; Thomas May , rival of Davenant for the Laureateship , and it is said from spite at his non-success afterwards a Commonwealth 's man and historian of the Long Parliament , who has left us The Heir and The Old Couple ; Cartwright , whose Ordinary has merit ; and Dr. Jasper Mayne , whose City Match has more . All deserve respectable places in a separate history of the drama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGE OF THE ENGLISH PULPIT ? II Jeremy Taylor ? Fuller ? South ? Barrow ? Baxter , Chillingworth , Hales , and others Not the least admirable and remarkable division of Caroline literature is that peopled , by the Sermon-writers . Indeed , taking advantage of the facts that of Hall and Donne , the chief ornaments of the earlier period , one survived Charles I. himself and the other saw the first ten years of his reign , and that , under Charles II. , another and only less great race arise , with a slightly different style , it has been not uncommon to speak of the great divines iii a body as Caroline . We shall here , as before , borrow from the Second Charles those divines who , under him , still exhibited the graces more specially attributable to English under his father , and postpone those who , like Tillotson , are rather eighteenth than seventeenth century in character . The greatest of the group thus provided are Taylor , Fuller , and South ? the last a much younger man than the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a survivor into the reign of the last Stuart who occupied the throne , but still distinctly Caroline and not Augustan in spirit ; the midmost of the three , the wittiest of English divines except Sydney Smith , and much more of a divine than Sydney ; the first in almost all ways the chief of English orators on sacred subjects . These three display the characteristics of the time so well that a fairly careful survey of them will enable us to pass more rapidly over their fellows . Jeremy Taylor 1 was born at Cambridge in August 1613 , and was the son of a barber . He was sent to Caius College , took his degrees there , and perhaps became Fellow , but by Laud 's influence was transferred to Oxford , where in 1636 he became Fellow of All Souls . He obtained the rectory of Uppingham two years later , and married in 1639 . He is guessed rather than known to have served 439 // as chaplain in the King 's army during the Rebellion , and dates are also very uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his marriage with a second , and his retirement ( probably to her . property in Wales . Here , poverty after some time of T Y ) and school-keeping , he was patronised by the Earl of Carbery , became tolerably prosperous , and during the twelve or fifteen years of his Welsh sojourn composed most of his greater works . Yet he was thrice imprisoned during this time for political and ecclesiastical malignancy . Even before the Restoration he received ( rather unluckily ) preferment in Ireland , being appointed by Lord Conway to a lectureship at Lisburn , and when the King came home he was made Bishop of Down , Connor , and shortly afterwards Dromore , becoming also an Irish Privy Councillor and Vice-Chancellor of Dublin University . But he was by no means happy in Ireland , where , between Roman Catholics and chiefly Presbyterian Protestants , his Laudian Anglicanism was very uncomfortably placed , and where he had domestic troubles . He died on 13th August 1667 , at Lisburn , and was buried in his cathedral of Dromore . Taylor 's unique position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erudition ( for though it would ill beseem most men nowadays to belittle him in this , he was for that most learned of times by no means extremely erudite ) , nor by his theological power ( for logic was not his forte , and he more than once approached heresy unawares ) , nor in that special product of the time , casuistry , for which his dialectics are not delicate enough ; but wholly and solely by his magnificent rhetoric . This rhetoric is so true to itself that he does not even show as a writer so well as he must have shown to his hearers , since some pretty obvious faults in the page would have been nearly imperceptible as they came from the pulpit , while all his beauties would be enhanced by actual delivery , especially as he is known to have had a handsome presence and an admirable elocution . He began as a writer in 1642 with a defence of Episcopacy , but did not show his real quality till he was safe in Wales , under the wing of Lord and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice Egerton . Of the numerous works then written , The Liberty of Prophecying is an argument for toleration which would have been more effective if the author had been a closer reasoner , and perhaps also if he had not been on the losing side at the time . 1650 saw a Life ( If Christ and the famous Holy Living , which was completed next year by Holy Dying . A course of Sermons for the Christian Year was then begun , and finished in 1653. 1655 saw the devotional work called , from the seat of the Carberys , The Golden Grove ; 1655 Unum Necessarium , a treatise on Repentance , in some points dubiously orthodox ; and in 166o the Ductor Dubitantium , his chief work in cx. iv THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE ENGLISH PULPIT ?

In all these works , as well as in his numerous others , the chief of which , for our purpose , is the supplement of eleven extra sermons to the En/autos , or Christian Year , it is almost a universal rule that Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though more unequal ) in meditation , and weakest in anything that requires close logical argument . It may be questioned whether his thought is ever very profound , and it is certainly never very original . We are not to look in him for anything like the infinite suggestiveness , the far-reaching vistas , of Donne . But , luckily for Taylor , his subject supplied him with depth and height enough in mere matter , and he had nothing to supply but the external graces of his inimitable expression . Almost everything that can fairly be said against this expression is summed up in the one word " florid , " and it seems practically impossible for impartial criticism to deny that this word is applicable . The presence of the quality it denotes shocked the younger generation of Taylor 's own time , and is commented on in a passage , not quite so unjust as harsh and unbecoming , by South ; it probably lessened Taylor 's influence with the eighteenth century , and it certainly procured him abundant compensation at the time of the Romantic revolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speech are most exquisite and most lavishly provided . They hardly ever deserve from just criticism the epithet of tawdry . But they are something too lush in their growth ; they are strung with stock devices of phrase ( " so have I seen , " especially ) which are irritating ; and their extraordinary abundance gives an air of fulsome and somewhat feminine languor and luxuriance to the style . The less good effect of this is increased by Taylor 's confused grammar . Like most of his predecessors except Hooker , he never seems quite certain whether he is writing Latin or English , and abuses the license of both languages , as well as length of sentence . Yet to no person of fairly catholic taste can his defects come into any close comparison with his beauties . If he is seldom deep he is never shallow ; his subjects are always noble and always worthily handled ; even his plainer writing has a musical cadence and a pictorial effect . If we want something better still we can only go to Donne or Browne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give it us in scantier measure , and in manner harder to receive . A contrast , which is almost the full one between tragedy and comedy , exists between Jeremy Taylor and Thomas Fuller , ' who was born at Aldwinkle St. Peter 's , the other division of the . // village in which Dryden was born later , in the summer of 16o8 , his father being rector of the parish . He was sent to Queen 's College , cutler . Cambridge , from which he passed to Sidney Sussex , and in 1630 obtained a curacy from a third college , Corpus or Benet . His uncle , Dr. Davenant , who had been President of Queen 's , was now Bishop of Salisbury , and made Fuller first a prebendary of his cathedral and then vicar of Broadwindsor , in Dorset . He wrote some verse of no merit early , and produced his Holy War a history of the Crusades , in 1639 , and his Holy and Profane States in 1642 , with some sermons between them . Just before the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an army chaplain . But his moderation , or , more probably , his humour , made him thought halfhearted by some . He printed at Exeter in 1645 , when hope was almost gone , Good Thoughts in Bad Times , one of his very best hooks ; and followed it in 1647 with Better Thoughts in Worse Times . Like some , though not many , sound divines and royalists , he was not absolutely persecuted during the usurpation , and though he was unable to keep a post at St. Clement 's , Eastcheap , he was more fortunate with one at Waltham Abbey . In 165o he published his Pisgah Sight of Palestine , a book on the Holy Land , in 1655 his great Church History of Britain , and in 1658 his Mixt Contemplation for Better Times . At the Restoration he was made D.D . and chaplain to the King ; and a bishopric is said to have been designed for him , but he died of some sort of typhus or typhoid in August 1661 . The largest and almost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IEngland , was published posthumously . Fuller , like Taylor , was the darling of some of the great Englishmen of the Romantic revival , such as Coleridge , Southey , and Lamb . The last named avowedly doted on him , has made a selection of some of his greatest phrases , and may be said to owe his style more to Fuller and Browne than to any one else . At the same time , he has been by no means universally popular . The formidable South fell foul of him almost more roughly than of Taylor just after his death ; the eighteenth century regarded him as a learned buffoon ; and it is by no means certain that more modern judgments have been wholly conciliated to him . Nor is this surprising , for , as has been said , the knowledge of Fuller , except among a few students , is probably by no means extensive nowadays , and his temper is one not now commonly met , and regarded , when it occurs , either with suspicion or positive dislike . Fuller 's most heartfelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intensely interested in politics , and except that he was strongly anti-Roman , the purely ecciesiastical quarrels of his day did not excite any very bitter feelings in him ; he was a true Royalist and Anglican , but not a keen cll. iv THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE ENGLISI-I PULPIT ? II 443 one . Yet his Christianity was the very life of him ; he was an earnest student of history , especially in the lines of topography , genealogy , and heraldry . All these are of the class of subjects which ? the world seems to take it for granted ? ought to be treated in what some one has called " the grave and chaste manner . " But it was impossible for Fuller to be grave . No mind was ever freer from the slightest irreverence than his . But the quips and conceits of the Elizabethan time , the " metaphysical " fancies of the Jacobean , had been in some singular way seasoned in his case by an anticipation of the more purely satirical and jocular tone of the later seventeenth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarseness , hardness , and impiety which too often accompanied this . It is absolutely impossible for Fuller to resist a jest , whether on natural phenomena , as where he writes of wax , " It being yellow by nature is by art made red , white , and green , which I take to be the dearest colours , especially when appendant on parchment " ; or in divinity , as when he observes of ejaculations or short prayers , that a the soldier may at the same time shoot out his prayer to God and aim his pistol at his enemy , the one better hitting the mark for the other . " This quaint quipping wit does not appeal to all readers , especially in modern days , and is no doubt extremely annoying to some ; but they are probably the wisest who can enjoy it , though it is not perhaps necessary for them to go to the extremes of laudation indulged by Lamb and Coleridge . The range of Burton and the depth of Browne are both denied to Fuller ; his temper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as childlike in the good . But if not for all tastes , or even for all hours , as these two are , in the case of those who love them , he is no mean ornament to English literature , and no scantily stored treasure-house of it . If Taylor is sometimes open to the charge of effeminacy and Fuller to that of childishness , neither fault can be found with Robert South , the most masculine of English seventeenth-century writers except Hobbes , and indeed a sort of orthodox pair to that great writer . He was born at Hackney in 1633 , and passed through Westminster ( which certainly did not at this time , under the rule of Busby. discredit Solomon 's system of education ) to Christ Church , where he became a student in 1651 . He took orders before the Restoration , and when that event occurred , was made public orator of his University , chaplain to Clarendon , a prebendary of Westminster , and a canon of Christ Church . He lived to a very great age , and , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strong Tory ; but he was not a nonjuror. and held his preferments to his death in 1716 . He was a formidable controversialist , signalising himself in this way against Sherlock ; but his // literary reputation rests upon his numerous and very remarkable sermons . ) He was controversial enough even in these , as may be seen in the passages already referred to , where he makes strictures on Fuler and Taylor ; and compliments have been paid to his wit almost equal to those bestowed upon Fuller himself . They are merited , always remembering that in using the word of seventeenthcentury writers we must observe the sense , then more specially attached to it , of intellectual keenness , not necessarily , though very often , exhibited in relation to the ludicrous . South has still something of Elizabethan conceit and word-play , and a great deal of Jacobean scholasticism . But the new style of restricted antithetical balance which was rising around him affected him a good deal , though not to the same extent as that to which it affected Tillotson or Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice here , and not with them . For he retains that fondness for luminous if also audacious imagery which , though certainly not absent from Dryden , or even from Temple , was to be more and more restricted both in them and in their followers . His famous sentence , " An Aristotle was but the rubbish of an Adam , and Athens but the rudiments of Paradise , " unites seventeenth-century splendour of fancy ? the sudden blaze of the imaginative rocket ? with eighteenth-century balance , antithesis , and point . It can be matched with hundreds of single things , hardly less ingenious and successful , while South is also able to build up larger sentences , till he reminds us , not so constantly , of Browne before and Temple after him in the two styles . Thus , while he never has the beauty of Taylor , while he lacks the easy lambent light of Fuller 's wit , he is in better fighting trim , better balanced , less unequal and disquieting than either , and provides in almost all his work quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2 who was a little older than South , was also a Londoner , born in 163o , but his school was Charterhouse . Hence he passed to Felsted , in Essex , and to Trinity College , Cambridge , of which he became Fellow in 1649 . He was known Barrow . as a strong Cavalier and Churchman , and this for the time prevented the further promotion which his extraordinary abilities , both on the literary and scientific sides , would have gained him , and he travelled much abroad . On the eve of the Restoration he became Professor of Greek at Cambridge , and after it a Fellow of the Royal Society , Gresham Professor of Geometry , and Lucasian Professor of Mathematics , where Newton followed him . The King always greatly fancied his preaching , and in 1672 made him Master cll. tv THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE ENGLISH PULPIT ? II 445 of Trinity , but he died five years later . Barrow 's style is less severe than South 's , but also a little less technically good , more disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more modern . We need pause less on some others . Bishop Pearson ( 1612-86 ) , though a longer liver than Barrow , was born much earlier , and his birth-date is reflected in the style of his famous treatise On the Creed and his other works . He was a Norfolk , man , a son of Eton and of King 's College , Cambridge , a Royalist chaplain ( though he does not seem to have " andh , Hales , been much interfered with during the Commonwealth ) ; and after the Restoration Master of Jesus , Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity , Master of Trinity , and Bishop of Chester . Richard Baxter , one of the lights of English Nonconformity , was a little younger than Pearson , and lived a little longer ( 1615-91 ) . He was neither ill-born nor very ill-educated , but went to no University , and , after some changes of mind , became a schoolmaster and took orders . His duty was chiefly at Kidderminster , with which town he was throughout his life most connected . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but scrupled , and " went out " in 1662 , his recalcitrance to the law being , of course , followed by some inconveniences , but by nothing serious till the tyranny of James II . His Saints ' Rest ( 165o ) , his Call to the Unconverted ( 1657 ) , and the agreeable posthumous work published in 1696 as Rd/guide Raxlerianae , are perhaps the most important for us out of a very large total of work . Baxter , who is said never to have altered or corrected his work , and whose style , though neither so vernacular nor so racy , has a certain approximation to Bunyan 's , is a distinctly pleasant writer , if not very much more . This rich period contains in theology , as in other departments , much that it would be interesting to comment upon . John Hales ( 1584-1656 ) , the " ever memorable , " was born at Bath and educated there and at Cambridge , but transferred himself to Oxford , where he became a Fellow of Merton and a lecturer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a Fellow of Eton College , and lived there all the rest of his life , though he was deprived of his Fellowship after the King 's death . He was one of Falkland 's set in Oxfordshire and of Jonson 's in London , and a mighty admirer of Shakespeare . His repute is rather greater than his works , which consist of tracts , sermons , and letters from the Synod of Dort , where he went with Sir Dudley Carleton . His chief single work is the tract on Schism and Schismatics , 1636 . It and the rest of his works contain arguments // for toleration , and for a sort of orthodox freethinking , expressed in a rather undistinguished style . It is supposed to have been written against , or at least in reference to , the Religion ofProtestants of William Chillingworth , who was born at Oxford in 16o2 , was much favoured by Laud , became Fellow of Trinity in 1628 , see-sawed a good deal in religion , but after an experience of Romanism returned to the Church of England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capture of Arundel Castle , where he was taken prisoner in 1644 . The principal merit of his style ( and in his days it was no common one ) is its extreme clearness . George Herbert wrote some prose very like his verse . Archbishop Robert Leighton ( 1611-84 ) was born and educated at Edinburgh , where he was Principal and Divinity Professor in the University ; later travelled a good deal ; became Bishop of Dunblane in 1661 and Archbishop of Glasgow in 1669 ; resigned and died at Horsted Keynes in 1684 . His character , in a position likely to attract slander , excited universal admiration ; his style ( shown chiefly in Commentaries on the Scriptures , which had an immense influence on Coleridge ) has been highly , though not always clearly , praised . It belongs to the class of the great imaginative styles of his time . Bishop Wilkins ( 1614-72 ) , a man with a rather questionable record , who married Oliver 's sister and contrived to make the best of both sides in the struggle between King and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wadham at Oxford and Master of Trinity at Cambridge , was an early student of physical science , and member of the Royal Society . His works , Discovery of a New 11 nor a ( Discourse concerning a New Planet , Mathematical Magic and Essay towards a Philosophical ( i.e. universal ) Language , display in their very titles the survival of the fantastic . His style is simple and lively enough . Lastly , the famous school of metaphysical theologians , called the Cambridge Platonists , produced in Henry More , the poet , and still more in Ralph Cudworth , the author of the True Intellectual System of the Universe ( 1678 ) , notable prose-writers . Cudworth , born 1617 , in Somerset , entered Emmanuel College , Cambridge , in 163o , and becoming successively Master of Clare , Professor of Hebrew , and Master of Christ 's , died 1688 . Besides his great book , which is a sort of history of philosophy as well as a contribution to it . Cudworth wrote a treatise on Eternal and Immutable Morality , and other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his enemy , Hobbes , as a prose-writer , Cudworth stands high among our early philosophers for his style , which , if not exactly elegant and never splendid , is solid and clear . CIIA1'TER V MISCELLANEOUS PROSE Milton 's prose ? Its faults and beauties ? Sir Thomas Browne ? Reli:gio Medici ? Vulgar Errors ? Ursa Burial ? The Garden of Cyrus ? Clarendon ? Hobbes ? Felltham ? Howell ? Walton THE eminence of this remarkable period is certainly not least shown in the department of miscellaneous prose . After dealing with the theologians , we have still left the prose work of Milton , Sir Thomas Browne , Hobbes , and Clarendon , together with not a few minor prose writers of quality from Walton down- Milton 's prose . wards . Milton 's prose work , as has already been said , was in the main , though not quite wholly , comprised in the twenty years of his middle age , and is again mainly , though not quite wholly , controversial in character . The great bulk of it is an instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manner in literary history . If we look at the matter , it requires almost desperate partisanship to put much of Milton 's prose work high . Except the Areopagatica and the Letter to Education , almost all of it is more than questionable . The divorce tracts are dubious from the point of view of public morality , and ludicrously one-sided as expressions of private spleen . The rudeness , the sheer ill-manners of the political and educational pamphlets arc allowed by all except those who decline to see any fault in the author of Paradise Lost . Even as a controversialist , all questions of taste and literary courtesy put aside , Milton is too onesided , too passionate , and too weak in mere argumentative power to receive high praise from impartial criticism . But when we turn to the mere form of his prose the case is quite altered . It is true that even here praise can not be indiscriminate , and that there have been some who , even on formal grounds , have denied to Milton very high rank as a prose-writer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be suspected . It is true that Milton is by no means a faultless writer : he is. indeed , a very faulty one . Nothing is more curious than to see how he , the great 447 // architect of the paragraph and the sentence in verse , seems to be utterly ignorant of the laws of both in prose , or at least utterly incapable or careless of obeying those laws . On many , perhaps on most , occasions the gorgeous harmonic phrases , of which in prose as in verse he is a master , entirely fail to adjust themselves to any kind of symphonic arrangement . They clash and welter against each other , or suddenly quaver off into some cacophony or insignificance of close which destroys their effect and value . The pleas that Milton 's writing was constantly not merely rhetorical , but oratorical , and that we must give it the license of heard matter , as well as that his blindness latterly made correction difficult , have a certain validity as excuses , but not as defence . And the first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are sentences of Milton 's which , though ugly on the page , would be harmonious on the platform or in the pulpit , but there are others , and many of them , which would be ugly any where . The fact evidently is that Milton , to whom prose was not , as verse was , his native organ of speech , suffered exceptionally from the three vices of the prose of his age ? the tendency to an unduly laboured vocabulary , that to an unduly Latinised syntax , and that to enormously long sentences . For the two first there was in his case , as all fair critics have acknowledged , not merely the excuse that men of letters read more Latin than English , but the particular one that it was the custom , and latterly the business , of this man of letters to write more its Latin than in English . And it seems strange that any one should be capable of denying the splendour of Milton 's prose at its best . The gorgeous evocations of vision , how " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thule , was scattered with the proud shipwrecks of the Spanish Armada " ; the thunder of single phrases , " the dateless and irrevoluble circle " ; the famous comparison between the poet , with his garland and singing robes about him , and the same sitting in the cool element of prose ; and the almost more famous one as to the wandering of his younger feet among those lofty fables and romances ; the magnificent search for the Dead Truth in the Areooagitica , ? other things , not much below these , are there to prove his quality . We could have had them from no one but Milton , for the best of them have a certain quality or inseparable accident of egotism , not to say arrogance , about them of which Shakespeare and Spenser and Shelley , and others of the greatest , could never have been capable , and which yet gives them the swell of their cadence and the thrill of their ring . So let us be thankful for even the egotism of Milton . The humour which Milton so profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his and our good , no doubt ) he // lacked likewise , were both present in the next writer to be mentioned , the greatest prose-writer perhaps , when all things are taken together , in the whole range of English . Thomas Browne , l whobecame Sir Thomas in the last years of his life , was born in London on 19th October 1605 . His father , who was in trade but of a good Cheshire extraction , died when Thomas was a child , and his mother married a certain Sir Thomas Dutton . The boy was sent to school at Winchester , and thence to Broadgates Hall , Oxford , which , before he left it , was turned into Pembroke College . He took his Master 's degree in 1629 , and then studied medicine at Leyden , graduating there as doctor . After some years of travel and of practice in different places , lre settled in the year 1636 at Norwich , with which city he was connected for nearly fifty years , marrying a Norfolk lady a few years later , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuller 's classification has it ) in inoffensive and unmolested prosperity . His knighthood took place in 1671 , and his death in 1682 . Besides letters and a few minor miscellanies , we have from him five capital works , very different from each other in size , but of pretty uniform excellence as literature ? Religio Medici , written , it would appear , pretty early ( about 1635 ) , but not printed till 1642 ; Pseudodoxia EEidemica , better known by its English title of 1/n gar Errors , 1646 ; Urn Burial and the Garden of Cyrus , published together in 1658 ; and the posthumous Christian Morals , which was not printed till 1716 and was edited forty years later by the great light of his college in the next century , and its great Christian moralist , Samuel Johnson . Every one of these works , from the mere pamphlets which contain the third and fourth to the bulky treatise on Errors , is of the very first importance in English literature . Religio Medici has perhaps been the general favourite , a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-fruits of Browne 's extraordinary style , that it is a sort of key to the others , and that it displays , as does no other book , the mental attitude of the older and better generation of the Jacobean and Caroline time . This attitude may be taken as resulting from the following conditions . An immense but what we may perhaps call a somewhat lopsided erudition ? ancient writers and modern writers in Latin being insufficiently balanced by those in the modern tongues ; science , in the modern sense , conspicuous , but as yet unorganised ; a wide and deep , but by no // means necessarily unorthodox , and scarcely at all scornful , scepticism ; and a gorgeous setting glow of poetical fancy . The result was an inevitable melancholy in all the choicer souls , except those where " cheerfulness would break in , " as with Fuller ; or those who were furiously devoted to the strife of the time and otherwise wrapt up in themselves , as with Milton ? inevitable , though this melancholy might be erudite and discursive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donne ; hectically religious , as in Crashaw ; meditatively so , as in Vaughan . In Browne it is , as melancholy , kept in the background . He has not merely , like Burton , his learning ever present , but a practical and busy art ; religious as he is , he does not become absorbed in religion like Crashaw or Herbert or Vaughan ; his blood is cooler , and his brain less trammelled with occult things than Donne 's . And the result is the Religio , a confession of intelligent orthodoxy and logical supernaturalism couched in some of the most exquisite English ever written . The great medley of the Pseudodoxia is more puzzling to modern ideas . Here Browne first discusses the general subject of delusion in a fashion singularly different from , though perhaps not less philosophical than , that which would suggest itself to most people . Now and then he takes the errors one by one , but the fact is that " errors " is not quite the right word . Pseudodoxy , as opposed to orthodoxy , consists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the explanation of undoubted phenomena by wrong causes , at least as much as in the belief in things certainly false . Very often he will not go beyond the position that the popular creed may be , with more reason , denied or affirmed ; sometimes he has possible explainings away of difficult facts ; and it will readily be anticipated that he very often advances hypotheses more difficult for modern science to admit than the facts he wishes to explain . He is himself , though profoundly sceptical , by no means obstinately incredulous ; and if he can not believe the magical qualities of gems , and must admit that " it bath much deceived the hopes of good fellows what is commonly expected of bitter almonds , " he declares " that an unsavoury odour is gentilitious or natural unto the Jews , we can not well conceive . " Yet he is by no means prone , as his great editor and fellowcollegian was , to deny things simply because they are strange ; and the result is that the , written in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd but almost always interesting Psudodoxia legends , anecdotes , beliefs , and lighted throughout with Browne 's own special candles ? his mild intelligence and his unaggressive irony ? is one of the most charming books existing or conceivable .
