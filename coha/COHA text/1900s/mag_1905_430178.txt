 | Two recently published books on the race question deserve special consideration . One of these is Thomas Nelson Page 's " The Negro : The Southerner 's Problem , " ( Scribner 's , $1.50 ) ; and the other is " The Color Line : a Brief in Behalf of the Unborn , " by William B. Smith ( McClure , Phillips &; Co. , $1.5 ? ) . The first named author , of course , needs no introduction in the South , while Professor Smith , it may be worth while to say , occupies the chair of Mathematics in Tulane University , and is not unknown as a writer on economic subjects . Mr. Page 's book is marked by the same qualities that have found expression in his works of fiction ? love of the South , fairness to the negro , and dispassionate handling of facts as he secs them ; qualities , by the way , which make " Red Rock " an incomparably more authentic story of Reconstruction than Mr. Dixon 's sensational " Leopard 's Spots . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freedom from tantrums , is likely to appeal to the judgment of many Northern men who could never be reached by hot-headed writers , who bring heat , and not light , to bear upon this irrepressible " Southerner 's Problem . " In this book Mr. Page does not set himself to argue to any given conclusion , but his purpose is to make a faithful portrayal of the several aspects of the race question . To the negro 's training in slavery he devotes one or two chapters , and of the breach between the races , brought about by Reconstruction , he has more to say . But all this is only the background on which he pictures the negro problem of the present . At times one thinks Mr. Page too pessimistic ? as , for example , when on page 9 he speaks of the negro as " owning less than 4 per cent . of the property and furnishing from 85 to 93 per cent of the total number of criminals ; with the two races drifting farther and farther apart , race-feeling growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the country . " But later on one finds a more hopeful note , and in the concluding chapter  | he confesses that as he " has surveyed the entire field , " he has come to be more optimistic . And his conclusion of the whole matter is characterized by that broad humanity which those who know him would expect of the author of " Marse Chan : " " There are only two ways to solve the negro problem in the South . One is to remove him ; the other is to elevate him . The former is apparently out of the question . The only method , then , is to improve him . " As to his ideas as to how the negro shall be elevated or improved , Mr. Page writes at some length . He believes that the first step is for the negro to recognize that in striving for equality now he " is fighting , not the white race , but a law of nature , universal and inexorable ? that races rise or fall according to their character . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build up a civilization of his own , inside his own race , founded on character : " The urgent need is for the negroes to divide up into classes , with character and right conduct as the standard for elevation . When they make distinctions themselves , others will recognize their distinctions . " Having set himself right in this fundamental matter , the negro will then be prepared to make a proper use of his educational training ? the results of which up to this time Mr. Page regards as very disappointing . " It might seem , " he says , " that the true principle should be elementary education for all , including in the term industrial education , and special , that is , higher education of a proper kind for the special individuals who may give proof of their fitness to receive and profit by it . " At all times , and under all circumstances , our author would have the Southern white man cooperate with the negro in his efforts toward improvement ; but philanthropy , whether from the North or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the black man 's self-reliance . In short , Mr. Page here preaches the doctrine which will never be more aptly put than it was by President Roosevelt in a side remark ( overlooked by the Associated Press ) in his speech on the negro in New York last February : " Help him if he stumbles , but if he lies down let him stay . " If Mr. Page 's book is thoughtful and informing , Professor William B. Smith 's " The Color Line " is scholarly and profound . I did not take up this book with any prejudice in its favor ; I was no even sure of the need of such a work . But my impression after  | reading it is that its author has done the South a monumental service . In the very outset Professor Smith faces the issue unflinchingly . " Is the South justified in this absolute denial of social equality to the negro , no matter what his virtues or abilities or accomplishments ? " And with sledge-hammer blows of reason and scientific argument he drives home the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our tables , if we entertain them as our guests and social equals , if we disregard the color line in all other relations , is it possible to maintain it fixedly in the sexual relation , in the marriage of our sons and daughters , in the propagation of our species ? Unquestionably , No ! It is as certain as the rising of tomorrow 's sun that , once the middle wall of social partition is broken down , the mingling of the tides of life would begin instantly and proceed steadily . . . . If the race barrier be removed , and the individual standard of personal excellence be established , the twilight of this century will gather upon a nation hopelessly sinking in the mire of mongrelism . " And it is well that Professor Smith has done this work . Have you ever read and been touched by the deep pathos of " The Souls of Black Folk , " by that cultured and gifted mulatto , Professor W. E. Dubois ? If so , you must have wished to give , fully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as to the social separation of the two races . And this is the service which Professor Smith has rendered us . A man of deep learning and wide research , he has put the case for the South with such skill and power that his book can not fail to have its effect throughout the country . In the face of his clear exposition of the supreme law of racial integrity , on which the hopes of ages hang , the pathetic pleas of men like Dr. DuBois may excite our pity , but can not sway our judgment . An army of cavalry , with the destiny of a nation in its hands , can not turn aside because a wounded hare lies in its pathway . Moreover , the South , being irretrievably committed to the policy of social separation , the interests of both races demand that this policy be fixed and unshakable as Gibraltar . This will be better for the negro and better for the white man . Once accepted as inexorable , it will be little thought of as a hardship ? little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have no  | hereditary titles or were not born to the purple . As Professor Smith himself has said : " In general , whatever tends toward the sharp demarcation of the two races , toward the accurate delimitation of their spheres of activity and influence , will unquestionably make for peace , for prosperity , for mutual understanding , and for general contentment . " As to Professor Smith 's conviction that the negro race will die out , as others coming in contact with the Caucasian have died , it is not mp purpose to argue . It is enough to say that Professor Smith has vindicated the South 's position in a masterly work of logical and scholarly argument , and that his position and the South 's is not incompatible with a Christian and philanthropic spirit . Accepting it in the fullest , we are still able to say , as ex-Governor Aycock said to the negroes of our State nearly four years ago : " No thoughtful , conservative , and upright Southerner has for your race aught but the kindest feeling , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest citizenship of which you are capable , and we are willing to give our energies and best thought to aid you in the great work necessary to make you what you are capable of , and to assist you in that elevation of character and of virtue which tends to the strengthening of the State . But to do this it is absolutely necessary that each race should remain distinct and have a society of its own . Inside of your own race you can grow as large and broad and high as God permits , with the aid , the sympathy , and the encouragement of your white neighbors . If you can equal the white race in achievement , in scholarship , in literature , in art , in industry and commerce , you will find no generous-minded white man who will stand in your way . But all of them in the South will insist that you shall accomplish this high end without social intermingling ; and this is well for you ; it is well for us ; it is necessary for the peace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
