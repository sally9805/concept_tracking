He went into the hotel and registered as " Count Baroni and valet , Naples . " " I want a suite of four rooms on the Fifth Avenue side of the building , where I can get a good north light , " the Count said to Manager Ryan . He was shown to Suite 1,40 ? - 3- 4- 5 , which is one of the handsomest in the hotel , and contains a drawing room of large proportions . Count Baroni had been in the hotel but a short time when his baggage , consisting of seven large trunks , arrived . These he asked to be sent to his suite until he had time to unpack them .

Mr. Ryan went up to Count Baroni 's suit and asked for some information about his business . There he found that , in addition to the ten or twelve pictures hung by the porter , there were another dozen scattered about the rooms , on chairs and on tables , Mr. Ryan asked the Count to prove that he was what he pretended to be . At first the Count indignantly protested against this intrusion upon his private affairs , ' but he finally confessed that he was an art dealer and thought he could better dispose of his wares by putting them on exhibition in this way in a large hotel .
