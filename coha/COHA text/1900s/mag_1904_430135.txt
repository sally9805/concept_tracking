As we descended from our second attempt to climb Mount McKinley , we were made to realize by frozen grass and increasing snow-storms that the season for mountaineering had closed ; furthermore , the north wind convinced us that if we wished to get out of the country before the long winter and the night stilled the subarctic world about us , we must quickly reach the head waters of some big stream . We did not care to go to the Yukon , because in doing so we would cover explored territory . We could not return as we had come , because horse-feed along the western slope of the range was already frozen . We were not yet ready to leave Mount McKinley , provided we could only linger at some point where our retreat would not , as was likely in our present position , be suddenly cut off . Altogether , our purposes would seem best served if we could cross the range and get into the Sushitna Valley ; but the possibility of such an effort seemed doubtful , in the time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pass within a few days ' travelling . Accordingly , we resolved to make a desperate attempt to cross to the eastern slope of this great range , and , in the event of failure in this , our alternative was to make the deep waters of the Toklat , and travel thence by raft to the Tanana River . Though thwarted by an insurmountable wall , we had ascended Mount McKinley far enough to get a good view of its entire western slope . The walls of the main mountain rise out of Peters Glacier , which sweeps the entire western slope . Avalanche after avalanche rushes down the steep cliffs and deposits its downpour of ice , rock , and snow on the glacier . Beyond Peters Glacier is a remarkable ridge of lesser mountains , extending about sixteen miles parallel to the great mountain . Its altitude is 7500 feet at the north , and it gradually rises to 11,900 feet at the south . The ridge is weighted clown with all the ice it can possibly carry . Many glaciers grind down the gorges on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily corniced with ice . The altitude of the lower clouds here ranges from ( 3000 to 10,000 feet , and when looking at Mount McKinley from the west , during the greater part of our sojourn , we could see only this great ridge , the main mountain usually being obscured under heavy clouds . For this unique geographical feature I shall suggest the name Roosevelt Ridge . West of Roosevelt Ridge is a series of snow-free foothills , mostly pyramidal in shape , for which I shall suggest the name Hanna Foot-hills . We descended a dome-shaped mountain six miles south of this ridge , from which place we made our final at- tack . The mountain referred to is entirely covered with ice , and its summit reaches an altitude of 14,000 feet . This will appear on our map as Mount Hunter , in honor of Miss A. F. Hunter , of Newport . In the eastern end of Roosevelt Ridge there is a huge amphitheatre , in which rises a glacier about two miles wide and six miles long ; this glacier , in honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shainwald Glacier . Over Shainwald Glacier we made our first ascent to an elevation of 8300 feet . As we were about ready to start on our uncertain effort to cross the range we found ourselves deserted by six of our horses . In their eagerness to get grass the animals had wandered downstream toward the main valley of the Kuskokwim . The seven remaining horses were easily able to carry our reduced packs , so we allowed the wayward horses to seek their fortunes in lowlands among the caribou and moose . On the morning of September 4 we started on our long , weary march along the western slope of the foot-hills above the tree-line . The slopes were long and difficult ; and the travelling , after our mountain experience , proved very tiresome . Every sudden descent from the high altitudes produced a feeling of languor , with difficult heart action . This after-effect of mountain-work was to us much worse than any effect of ascending altitudes . So much was the fatigue felt that as we ate lunch on a prominent hill , we picked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch was eaten with some relish because we were hungry and had worked hard . It was the usual meal of boiled caribou ribs , cold and without salt ; also without bread or anything else except glacial water . While we were picking the bones , our horses were searching little depressions for a few sprigs of grass which had not been frozen , and as we rounded up our horses we saw several caribou . Printz with a rifle . and Shainwald with a revolver , crept stealthily around a hill into a ravine , and soon we heard a volley of shots . We  | followed with the horses and took the choice bits of a fat bull . Then , within an hour , we were headed for the willows of a small creek , and here the Nimrods spied and secured a moose , which was very good excuse for shortening our day 's march . So we camped in moose haunts in a swamp , where we built a huge camp - fire and ate an incredible amount of moose - steaks , while our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packing our horses , on the following morning , with an abundance of fresh meat , we then took a course for Muldrow Glacier , beyond which we hoped to find a pass . In two days , marching seven hours daily over tundra , we reached the terminal moraine of this great glacier , and then we marched southeasterly to examine the mountains . Our course hitherto had been close to that of Brooks and Reaburn , and their map , though quickly made , was found to be remarkably correct . But now we were to traverse absolutely unknown territory , and the task thus became doubly interesting , though much more difficult . In our course we first discovered a glacial stream pouring through a canyon only a few hundred feet north of Muldrow Glacier . We followed this stream into a broad valley , and there learned that the river was the output of a system of glaciers among a cluster of sharp peaks seven miles east of the Muldrow Glacier . As we left the lateral moraine of the big glaciers , travelling on the gravel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great broad valley , which we later discovered extended nearly fifty miles northeasterly . To the east were the high snow-capped mountains , from 7000 to 10,000 feet high , while to the west were brown weatherworn mountains of from 5000 to 7000 feet altitude . The valley had a general width of seven miles , and an average elevation of four thousand feet ; and I named it , in honor of one of our companions , Dunn Valley . On September 8 we camped in the canyon of a small stream at the base of a rounded black mountain ,  | to the west of which we hoped to be able to find a pass . After a hasty meal of unsalted moosesteaks I asked Printz and Dun to join me in an ascent of the mountain before us , which we called Black IIead . The climb was steep , but not difficult , and on the way we found many tracks of grizzlybears , caribou , and mountain-sheep . In the course of an hour we reached the summit at an altitude of 5100 feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of country , upon which it is probable that no human eye had rested before . Thirty-five miles to the southwest , looking across unnamed mountains 12,000 feet high , we saw the summit of the unconquered , culminating peak of North America . The upper walls of this great McKinley uplift from this side had for us a new aspect . An almost constant stream of clouds swept over and around the mountain from the east , and a blue electric glow softened the rough outline . Now and again we could see the summit , and from here it resembled very much the crown of a molar tooth . Four tubercles were distinctly visible ; the saddles seen from the west formed two , and to the east were two rather higher and more distinct . These tubercles of this giant tooth are separated by large glaciers , whose frozen current pours clown very steep slopes . if it were not so very difficult to get at this side of the mountain , we reasoned that here the upper slopes might offer a promising route . Apparently continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our position , there was a sharp icy ridge , in which we saw several mountains over ten thousand feet high . We thought we could see a break through this ridge about ten miles northward from our position , but the prospective pass which we had seen from below was only a small valley walled off by the main ridge . About eight miles up the valley we saw the benches of a large stream , and on the banks spruce-trees . The sight of spruce raised hopes of a big camp-fire and a good camping-ground , with better prospects of grass for our poor , half - starved horses . Along the upper slopes , in the most inaccessible  | places , we saw long lines of snowy ( lots zigzag on the sunny rocks ; these were mountain-sheep in great numbers , but our larder was too well stocked and our time too precious to seek them . Around us and toward the unnamed brown mountains northward we saw innumerable ptarmigan . After plotting our course for the following day , we descended to our camp among scrub-willows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , near by , signs of petroleum . On the day following we moved our pack-train to the river we had seen from the Black Head , but , much to our disappointment , the southerly outlook here did not promise a pass . Beyond , the main valley widened , the glacial streams became more numerous , willows were larger , and signs of game more abundant . Our camp on the 9th was near a salt-lick , where many animals had congregated to eat the salty soil . The drainage all along Dunn Valley was northward into the Toklat River ? the valley itself probably had been carved out by some vanished glacier . To the eastward the valley ended in a series of hills , and there we felt that we were certain to find a pass . On the 10th we camped on a large stream at the end of our newly discovered valley , and from here , looking southward , we discovered a wide cut through the ridge . Through this opening , over a glacier , came the moist , cutting easterly winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserting us . To guard against this we set up a watch through the night , hut in the dense blackness of midnight they escaped and back-trailed . On the morning of the 11th , while Dunn and Printz searched for the horses , Shainwald and I explored the prospective pass . In an hour we had ascended the face of the new glacier and walked over ice very much crevassed . Ahead were two possible routes to cross the range ? to the north and to the south of a nunatak which projected above the glacier . We gradually rose to an elevation of 6100 feet , crossing hundreds of crevasses in a thick snow-storm , and as we came to the end of the easterly arm of the glacier  | the snow-cloud vanished , the weather cleared , and with a good deal of pleasure we looked down into the green valley of the Chulitna , the main tributary of the Sushitna River . The descent , however , seemed very difficult for our horses , though possible in an emergency like ours . We next sought a course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . A cloud of snow swept the glacier , and so thoroughly blotted out the huge mountains to each side that we were compelled to travel by compass . For nearly two hours we marched up this arm , keeping our glacial rope tight , almost expecting to drop into crevasses every moment . Suddenly we broke through the cloud , and just beyond Shainwald 's toes was the brink of a precipice with a perpendicular drop of three thousand feet . We quickly stepped back , and then beheld the most desolate mountain wilderness which it has ever been my lot to behold . Here were the easterly foot-hills of the McKinley group , black , ragged peaks , dotted by spots of fresh snow . We were at an altitude of seven thousand feet , and these mountains were a little higher . The most remarkable feature was their apparently uniform height of about 7500 feet . Over this expanse of jagged peaks there drifted heavy silver - edged clouds . Sometimes we could see over them , at other times under them , but at nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mirage , which drew up some mountains to such heights that we could see huge needles of rock so far above us that we believed ourselves discoverers of several peaks that rivalled Vomit McKinley . As we returned , the clouds were now , for a time , swept out of the divide by a strong northerly wind , giving us a good view of the glacier over which , we had advanced in a snow-storm . It is about eight miles long and somewhat less than two miles wide . The highest mountains on each side are 8000 feet , and from these several small tributaries pour down their frozen output . This new glacier I have named Harvey Glacier , iii honor of Mr. George Harvey . The drainage from Harvey Glacier  | spreads out into numerous channels over a great bed of glacial silt about a mile wide . This river takes a course almost due north across Dunn Valley , and then it enters a canyon , after which it probably takes an easterly course to the Toklat River . Nearing the centre of Harvey Glacier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Printz , and Miller , between two great pillars of granite , which mark the gates of the divide . From here the task of getting the horses over and around wide crevasses became extremely difficult . And as we ascended higher , the horses frequently slipped into wide gaps , deceptively bridged by snow . Our horses , however , were now pretty well used to all kinds of hardships , and though they were thoroughly frightened by frequent falls into dangerous caverns , they carried their packs nobly and safely over the divide . The most difficult task for the horses , among their long series of hard adventures was the descent from this glacial pass . In less than two hours they came down three thousand feet at an angle sometimes too steep for the men . It was a route over sharp stones , ice , and frozen ground ; but the animals , with their feet and legs cut and bruised ? leaving bloody stains everywhere , in their trail , ? followed us without urging towards the green fields of the lower valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long young grass just as we were aiming to strike camp . From here the famished animals refused to be urged on , and we quickly removed their packs that they might eat to their utmost capacity . It was their first feed of grass which had not been frozen , for more than two weeks . We now took a course nearly due south over a marshy country towards the main Chulitna River . Our next camp was on a bluff to the main tributary of the Chulitna , which came from the unknown glaciers only ten miles west of the place where we crossed the range . The underbrush here was so thick and the canyons  | so numerous that with our horses we were forced to take to the stream-bed for our route . Getting into this glacial stream , we found excellent travelling , but the slews soon narrowed , and led us into a canyon with walls three hundred feet high . The rushing , milky waters among richly tinted cliffs , crowned by trees in beautiful foliage , made a picture sublimely fascinating ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii landscapes as we were in making rapid progress . We had used our last bread . The supply of tea and sugar was exhausted ; and the horses , in an unguarded moment , had deprived us of all our salt . Of meat and beans we still had an ample supply , but everything else except a reserve of perm-Mean had either been eaten or spoiled by water . We were still anxious to examine Mount McKinley from the east , and all our energies were bent on getting to the mountain as quickly as possible . The winter , however , was advancing with an alarming pace . Even the low mountains about us were blanketed by newly fallen snow , and the temperature was falling to the freezingpoint every night . We desired to get out of this canyon and cut a trail , but we dared not lose the time . Fully knowing the danger of following an unknown stream through a canyon , we still had no alternative . We In a relied down-stream , crossing from bank to bank as the river turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossings were not difficult , but the stream gathered force vary rapidly . On the second day 's march down-stream the horses were compelled to swim at almost every crossing , and it was necessary to cross the river thirty to forty times daily . The men tried to ride the horses , behind the packs , but in swift streams they were frequently thrown off . For three days we swam and forded this icy stream , and then we were aroused to the dangers of the task through an accident by which a man and a horse were carried down-stream and thrown against a cliff . A similar accident was likely to occur at any time . The horses could not be taken much farther . For the safety of ourselves and our outfit we now sought to build a raft . The Chulitna proper is formed by the union of the glacial stream down which we came and a clear-water stream of somewhat less volume , flu latter draining the extensive low country towards the head waters of the Cantwell River . About two miles below this fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found small flats covered with tall I n the absence of better wood we camped here and built a raft . The cottonwood-trees were fifteen inches thick , about eighty feet high , remarkably straight , and free of limbs . We cut logs thirteen feet long and carried them to a convenient launchingplace , where we fastened them with crossbars lashed by ropes , making two tiers about eight feet wide . After the raft was fnished , we learned to our sorrow that it would barely carry two men . The wood was evidently too heavy for raft-building . Printz and Miller floated the raft , while the others followed with the horses . The stream got larger , more rapid , and even more dangerous to swim . After having gone only two miles we saw dry spruce-trees a short distance westward up a large creek of clear water . Here we camped and built two good rafts , and then came the sad task of leaving our horses . Good , faithful animals that they had been , it seemed heartless to leave them to meet an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow or from the onslaught of wolves . Each man had among the animals one or two pets , and nobody had the boldness to deliberately kill any of the noble creatures . The grass was good here , and we argued that when the deep winter snow carne they might possibly dig under it and find a bare subsistence . On this clear stream , then , about eighteen miles north of the big glacier , we left seven of the finest and most faithful horses that ever traversed the wilds of Alaska . Taking to the rafts , we quickly descended the Chulitna through a series of small canyons divided by cross-canyons . Early in the afternoon of September 19 we camped on a bar about eight miles southeast of the moraine of a great glacier . The lower end of this glacier had been partly charted by government parties , but nothing was known of its  | upper reaches . We now set for ourselves the task of exploring the glacier , and over it the eastern slopes of Mount McKinley , which had not yet been seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days packed in our rucksacks , we ascended the terminal moraine on the following morning , and then climbed for eight miles over the most wonderful accumulation of glacial debris that I had ever seen . At the first bend we left the glacier , and ascended the steep slopes of a series of mountains , from which we hoped to see the course of the glacier and the great peak . We climbed to an elevation of 6000 feet , but then our progress was barred by cliffs . From here , however , we were able to map the glacier and a large mountainous area . The glacier starts from the northeast side of Mount McKinley and flows almost due east for fifteen miles , where it receives a large aria from the north . Five miles southeast of this another arm swells the bulk of the great icy stream , and then it takes a circular course , swinging toward the Chulitna . The lower edge is seven and one-half miles wide , its length is about forty miles , and the lower ten miles are so thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that no ice is visible . It is thus the largest interior glacier of Alaska , and it probably carries more moraine material than any other glacier in the world . Somewhat later we discovered a smaller but similar glacier which drains the southeastern side of Mount McKinley . These two glaciers T have named in honor of my wife and daughter ? the larger , Fidele Glacier ; and the smaller , Ruth Glacier . Mount McKinley from the east gives a much clearer impression of great altitude . We could not see the lower ten thousand feet , but the upper slopes , though difficult and perhaps impossible of ascent , are more nearly accessible than those of the west . The upper ten thou- sand feet are rounded like a beehive , and three spurs offer resting-places for glacier ice , over which a route to the summit may , perhaps , be found . The season had now so far advanced that if we eared to avoid being detained for the winter , we saw that we must take to our rafts quickly and descend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an unknown stream . Our supply of provisions was nearly exhausted and our clothing was torn into rags . Hatless and almost shoeless , we pushed our raft over bars , wading icy streams several hours daily , until we reached the deep waters of the Sushitna River . We arrived at Tyonek on September 26 , just four months after our start . In that time we had walked over seven hundred miles , and by boat and raft we had travelled three hundred miles . We had explored a good deal of new territory . We had ascended Mount McKinley 11,400 feet , encircled the McKinley group , and made a fair geological and botanical collection . Altogether , we had done all that determined human effort could in the short time of an Alaskan summer . As to the future efforts to climb Mount McKinley , it is not likely that the highest peak in North America will be abandoned as impossible of ascent until the great mountain has been thoroughly explored for a route from every side . I hope to be able to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountaineers will consider the project . Any attempt to reach the summit is sure to prove a more prodigious task than Alpine enthusiasts are likely to realize . The area of the mountain is far inland , making the transportation of supplies and men a very arduous task . It is surely the steepest of all the great mountains , and arctic conditions begin at the very base . Unlike Mount St. Elias , the glaciation is not extensive enough to offer an all-ice route . The prospective conqueror of this immense uplift must pick his path over broken stones , icy slopes , sharp cliffs , and an average slope of forty-five degrees for at least fourteen thousand feet . It is an effort which , for insurmountable difficulties and hard disappointments , is comparable with the task of expeditions to reach the north pole .  |
