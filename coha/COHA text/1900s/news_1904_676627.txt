txt Spring comes slowly up this way , but free trade , we judge , is almost upon us . We are forced to this alarming conclusion by perusal of the columns of our contemporary The American Economist , which is the organ of the American Protective Tariff League . The leading article in the current issue of The Economist is entitled " The Best Editorial Brains . " The Economist has them . Some of the mightiest protectionist intellects in this Republic are enlisted in the service of that paper . Its editors are devoted to the cause they espouse . They burn with fervent loyalty to the principle of high and higher duties on imports . They know the whole range of protectionist argument , syllogism , suggestion , and demonstration . In controversy with free traders they are invulnerable , and in the Dingley tackle altogether irresistible . Yet they content themselves and evidently hope to content their readers with such arguments as this , which was evoked , we admit it with pain and humiliation , by an attempt of Tas TIMES to reprove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the Wilson Tariff bill : The people of the United States are not to be fooled by subterfuge or evasion . They know perfectly well that the panic of 1893 was caused by the election of a free trade Administration and Congress pledged to repeal the tariff . They know , moreover , that the effects and the duration of the panic of 1893 were greatly increased by the passage and operations of the Wilson-Gorman tariff . How well they knew these things was shown by the election of Wiwag in 1896 and again in 1900 . A gem like that should have its mate . Here it is , taken from the same number of The Economist : Although the population of Great Britain has increased largely in the last thirty years , yet she sells about $110,000,000 worth of goods a year less to foreign countries than she did thirty years ago , while her imports have increased in the same period more than $800,000,000 a year , which is nearly a net loss of $1,000,000,000 a year , or $163 for each adult male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A failing cause is usually supported by the worst arguments . It would tax the ingenuity of the most malignant member of the Cobden Club to devise worse arguments for the cause of protection than are here put forward by its chief organ .
