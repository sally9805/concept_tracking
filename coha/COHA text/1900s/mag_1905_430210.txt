 |p1169  I AM a native of Hartford and a graduate of Yale , and take a genuine pride in both facts , altho I realize that I was in no way responsible for the first , and that , while I did graduate from Yale in 1871 , I could n't do it now in 1905 . Nevertheless the pride is there , and naturally I resent an adverse criticism either of my home or my alma mater , and doubly a criticism that groups and condemns them both . I want to reply to Mr. Porritt 's several indictments before giving myself the pleasure of taking up the larger and welcome subject of the public spirit of Hartford and Hartford citizens , whether college men or not . ( 1 ) Women are not " excluded from all part in its ( Hartford 's ) municipal life . " A fictitious and in some respects amusing agitation some time ago pushed " the reform against nature " so far as to secure women 's suffrage in school matters in this State . But it was n't wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is admitted to be a farce . At the recent Hartford city election in April , when a very important school question was before the public , less than 100 women out of a total of at least 18,000 of voting age in the city went to the polls . But when it comes to women in affairs , the Hartford Public Library is presided over by Miss Hewins , who is one of our most useful citizens ; the Good Will Club , which has kept thousands of street boys out of mischief and made fine men of many of them , is managed by Miss Mary Hall , who organized and developed it and is its mainstay ; the Union for Home Work , whose wise charity has for years been relieving sufferers and encouraging the unfortunate to self help , is conducted by Mrs. E. L. Sluyter , its moving spirit , a ministering angel in the whole community ; and in our public schools many noble women have done and are doing immeasurable good . Then there are numerous clubs of women who meet and discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " except in the case of one club that is organized simply to discuss that exclusion . Hartford owes much to its women and is proud to be thus indebted . ( 2 ) It is true that a big whisky sign has been placed on the top of a central building , as has been done in various cities . There has been considerable and very proper indignation about this . Protests have been made and still the sign stands . The reason for this is that there is no lawful way to secure its removal . It is absurd to class the thing as a nuisance within the meaning of the law or as a public peril ; and , if it is not that , then there is no power to attack it . The city government is helpless , and , lawyers say , the Legislature can pass no effective law . It would require a constitutional amendment , and a curious one , to reach the case , for the rights that keep it intact are a treasured element in our personal liberty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are within their rights . " That 's all , " as the letters themselves read . ( 3 ) Mr. Porritt is absolutely astray when he says the Consolidated Railway Company is asking the right to doubletrack the car lines in our streets " without permission of the City Council . " No corporation can do more than its charter permits . This company has absorbed smaller ones and some of these are by charter limited to single tracks . They could not lay a second one if the local authorities granted the privilege . The Consolidated is simply asking the right , and this right under existing statutes is subject always to the consent of the local authorities . The case is exactly contrary to Mr. Porritt 's statements . He simply does n't know the law . That may be excusable , but , not knowing it , he certainly should know better than to be  |p1170  led astray by " legislative strikers , " who try to cultivate a spirit of hostility to the Consolidated because they can not get pay to work for it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following of well meaning zealots . Time was when the great railroad hired a small army of lobbyists , bought every venal legislator and made others venal who did not start so , and was the source and inspiration of political corruption . That time , it is believed , has gone by , but it is said the present managers find it harder to get reasonable things decently than their predecessors did to get unreasonable things corruptly . Such an attack as Mr. Porritt makes in the name of public spirit and good government is another argument for those of the " practical " turn of mind , who contend that it is useless for a great corporation to be decent , that people do not expect or believe that it will be , and that the only way to manage it is to buy what you want , pay for it and get it . ( 4 ) I can not at all understand the gas reference . I think I am within bounds in saying that the old Hartford Gas Company was one of the most unpopular institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was welcomed on all ' sides . Its subsequent attempts at extortion have been attacked by the newspapers and by committees of citizens , and it has been forced to modify largely the unjust and aggravating rule that it arbitrarily established . Where in the world the gospel of " Revere the Consolidated and think no evil of the Gas Company " came from is beyond me . " Hit ' em both ? they 're rich , " is a more general doctrine . ( 5 ) Hartford has no more to do with its post office than with its Adams Express office . The postal business here has grown enormously , the clerical force provided to do the work is insufficient , the building ( now being enlarged ) is utterly inadequate to the demands upon it . No one questions that the office falls short of what we want it to do , but that is not the fault of Hartford , but its misfortune . ( 6 ) I have observed that men work for those who pay them the best wages . Teachers and lecturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its delivery . Even clergymen see the hand of the Lord in the bigger salary . Lawyers , whether from Yale or from elsewhere , sell their services to the clients that pay them best , and the big corporations get the pick of the talent . It is not for me to defend the ethics of the legal profession . There are lawyers who can do that better ? perhaps with more enthusiasm ? but all that Mr. Porritt 's reference to lawyers in Connecticut comes to is that they are like others of their profession and the best are found on the side that can afford to pay them . ( 7 ) Readers of TI3E INDEPENDENT do not care for any elucidation of our form of city government ; we here understand it and any one who desires to can easily master its details . Its results are a peaceful , progressive city , free from scandals in administration . The scheme is not a model , it could advantageously be recast , but it is no discredit . And as for consolidation of schools , our district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is open to all voters and has full control of school affairs . It is all we have left of the old town meeting . The objections to consolidation are not political , but legal and material ? the adjustment of debts , ownership of property and so on . The people of the city do favor an even cost of education all over town , and a bill carrying us a long way in that direction will probably pass at this session of the Legislature . So much for every point raised except that which refers to Senator Bulkeley . He is a successful business man , identified with many of our largest and most honorably conducted concerns , is of unquestioned and long established personal popularity , and if the people of the State themselves had voted for United States Senator last January , at an election where not a dollar was spent by anybody , he would have been in the first half dozen when the votes were counted , and probably in the first half of that half dozen . So it is the fact that : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted . The Constitution is bigger than the whisky sign . The Consolidated is n't asking for leave  |p1171  page deleted  |p1172  see what the college men will do and then try their little best to imitate them , irritates everybody when it happens occasionally to be exploited , and mortifies and puts at a disadvantage the very element that it is supposed to exalt . In Hartford there are " educated " shirks and " uneducated " shirks , as there are in other cities , but to a very large degree all hands work together here . The argument that a man is " educated " and therefore should be put forward , and the argument that he is not " educated " and therefore is " one of the people " and should be put forward , have each been tried and both failed . The question is what a man is and what he can do , and its answer places him . In material development and the morale of its business life , in works of judicious philanthropy and practical charity , in opportunities for study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in act and in opinion , and in the whole wide range of things that go to make a place desirable as a home Hartford is willing to be compared with any other city in the country .
