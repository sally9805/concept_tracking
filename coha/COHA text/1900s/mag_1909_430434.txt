 | IN its issue of June 17 , on " The Carnegie Foundation and The George Washington University , " THE INDEPENDENT 's comments upon the work and mission of the university were so friendly that I have asked this opportunity to say certain things about its work and mission which ought now to be said . In the rehearing , which in due time will be asked at the hands of the trustees of the Carnegie Foundation , and which , in justice to the cause of higher education at the national capital , will surely be granted when the full facts are presented , the university authorities are confident that ? in regard to our requirements for admission and graduation ? it will become as clear as noonday that the executive committee 's recent action was taken upon an entire misapprehension of the situation ; and that , as soon as the university complies with the rule of the Foundation with reference to the minimum of productive endowment , The George Washington University will he restored to the list of " accepted institutions . " For -- with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's princely endowment of a " Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching " was , surely , to encourage , and never to cripple , institutions that were earnestly striving to serve their own localities , and , with equal sincerity , were endeavoring to advance the standards of higher education . It is an excellent thing to have a giant 's strength , but it is supremely important for such an educational Titan to use that strength gently and with discrimination . We covet the most rigid scrutiny far more complete than the courteous repre-  | sentative of the Foundation was able to give during his recent two days ' visit . And we are serenely confident that a more minute inspection of our actual , every day work , and a fuller consideration of the special functions performed by The George Washington University to its local constituency will show that the progress made by this university during the past five years ? in the direction of that " advancement " of educational standards which the Carnegie Foundation is seeking gradually to bring about in all parts of this unevenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of higher education in America . The action of the Foundation 's executive committee was , in part , avowedly based upon what appeared to the committee as a disproportionately large number of " special students " in the university ? " more than one-third of the total enrollment . " To us on the ground the committee seemed to have made the serious mistake of applying , rather mechanically , the yard-stick of a general rule to peculiar local conditions , which most educators would say ought to be judged in their own light , and measured by a far more flexible standard . There are all kinds of " special students . " One type ought , as far as possible , to be weeded out of American university and college life . Recall the delights of campus and dormitory , the athletics , dramatics , glee clubs and all the charming camaraderie of student life at such institutions as Harvard , Yale , Princeton , Columbia , Brown , Williams , Amherst and Cornell . Picture to yourself the hordes of half-baked young fellows who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the bars were let down . would dearly live to " take a few special courses at college " and enjoy two or more years of dilettante loafing in such an environment as indicated above . In the case of institutions of that type , any sane critic of American university and college life would readily admit that the able men who , from their watch-tower at 576 Fifth avenue , are endeavoring faithfully to conduct a nationwide examination and testing- of our universities and colleges ( a testing that shall help the given university or college , and never hamper its local usefulness ) . would only be rendering a wholesome service to such institutions if , when necessary , the Carnegie Foundation warned them that their number of " specials " was approaching or had passed the danger point . And in deciding just when that point was reached it would be safe , and entirely just , for the Foundation to base such a warning upon the condensed statistics of matriculants , and to apply with an almost mechanical uniformity the thumb rule as to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " without detailed inquiry into the exact character of such special students or of the relations of the institution in question to its own constituency . But to any one with a full knowledge of educational conditions at the national capital , and particularly the type of " special students " attending The George Washington University , it seems essentially unscientific , and unjust to the community as well as the university , to insist that we must apply , far more rigidly than we are now doing , the yard-stick of " i ; points " of high school work to those who apply for admission as " special students " and who wish to take simply a few subjects , with no intention of working for a degree . There is very little in the student life of The George Washington University to attract the undesirable type of " special students . " We have neither dormitories nor campus , and no athletic field of our own . Our student activities in athletics . dramatics and in social matters are inevitably reduced to the minimum , altho the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in a proper admixture of these features of college life . But the physical limitations being what they are at present , precious few applications for enrolment as " special students " come to us from that class of young men , whose main desire is to enjoy " college life " for a year or two , with a little study thrown in. simply for the purpose of saving one 's face , or avoiding a stern parent 's criticism . The population of Washington is sui generis . Our special students are of two tones : ( r ) There are many bright young men in the Government service , who have  | come from parts of the country where good high schools were few and far between , and who were therefore unable to get " 15 points " of high school work to their credit . More often than not , these young men are from twenty-five to thirty years of age . But they are ambitious for something better than a life position as a Government clerk , and they wish to take a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their intellectual equipment and enable them , later on , to earn a better livelihood . While we have abolished our " - night schools , " we always expect to maintain classes from 4.30 to 6.30 p . M. , in order to make it possible for Government clerks to get a better education than their earlier opportunities afforded them . Such young men do not come to the university to have a " good time " ; they come for business , " and they are an unusually serious lot of fellows . Instead of being condemned by our friends at 576 Fifth avenue for admitting even a large number of such " special students " we ought to be commended . Our primary mission is a local one . We are set here in this community to serve the people of Washington , to meet their peculiar educational needs , and it would be a criminal neglect of our public duty if we applied the " 15 points " rule too rigidly to such a deserving and intellectual class of young men . Here is a typical case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student " for next autumn in the College of the Political Sciences , a Government clerk over forty years of age , who , in order to fit himself for better service in his present position , will take certain courses in the political sciences . He could not dig out more than 8 " points " from his high school course of twentyfive years ago ; but he is well qualified 1 reason of his age , his serious purpose and general experience , to pursue the course elected . We are doing him and the Government a service in letting him in . And yet he would go to make up the apparently fatal " one-third of the total enrollment. " ( 2 ) There is in Washington a second type of " special student , " whom it is surely the duty and privilege of this university to serve -- a class of well-to-do people , with some leisure and study , who are desirous of taking a few special courses , such as English literature , the languages , philosophy , economics , political science , diplomatic history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular high school course , but most of them have had a good deal of general culture and intellectual ability . Bearing in mind always , that ( because of its lack of campus , dormitories , etc. ) this institution is in no danger of an influx of idlers who would enroll themselves merely for the purpose of having a good time " ? surely no reasonable person would hold that The George Washington University ought to close , or narrow , its doors to these two classes of " special students " ? provided , always , that the previous preparation of such a student for the particular subject he wishes to elect its hint to pursue that subject without demoralizing or retarding the regular students in that course . The words just italicised give the crux of the whole question , which seems to have been lost sight of by the Carnegie executive committee , in the undue emphasis it had laid upon the fact that " more than one-third " of our " total enrollment are special students . " To illustrate the matter concretely , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card of John Smith , showing the full " 15 points " of high school work . " John Smith is all right , " says the examiner . Next , he inspects the card of William Jones . To take an extreme case , for the sake of illustration , we shall say that Jones has only 6 " points " of high school work to his credit . " That 's bad , " says the examiner , and forthwith he adds Jones 's name to what seems to him to be a dangerously long list of " specials . " He has never seen Mr. Jones . He does not know that he is a serious-minded Government clerk , twenty-five or thirty years of age , whose six " points " of preparatory work were won in subjects which , when added to his serious purposes and good mental caliber , qualify him abundantly for admission as a " special student " in the particular subject he elects , with no harm to the university and much good to himself . Those who have observed the type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington University , and who are all equally well acquainted with an entirely different type of " specials , " who , in spite of all rules , will so often slip into such institutions as the ones just named ( because of attractions which this university does not possess ) , will subscribe to the statement , which is made here deliberately , that , taken as a class , the " special students " attending the George Washington University have nothing corresponding to them in other institutions . In judging of our " special students , " two points should be kept clearly in mind : ( 1 ) This university admits no one as a candidate for a degree unless the applicant substantially meets the entrance requirements . How , then , could we " lower , " by a single ell , the value of the A. B. degree " in admitting even a large number of " special students " of the two types described above ? ( 2 ) Taking as an extreme case the applicant with only six " points , " it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won haphazard , in any subjects ; but , if admitted at all as a special student , it is because those " points " showed the necessary preliminary education fitting him to take up the special subject or subjects he may elect . I have said enough to convince any scientific investigator of educational problems ? and particularly of the educational needs of the capital ? that it would be most unjust to this institution and to this peculiar community to apply too rigidly , and at long range , a general rule against " specials " that was made to fit entirely different conditions . If that great Foundation is to help and not to cripple the cause of higher and practical education at the capital , there must be a far more discriminating estimate of local needs , and of the plain duty resting upon The George Washington University to meet those needs , than has been made by the Carnegie committee , in so far as its recent action was based upon our educational standards and policies . And now will THE INDEPENDENT permit me to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE INDEPENDENT 's sympathy with the general idea of developing a strong university at the national capital , and , its friendly attitude toward " The George Washington University have let its editor into some misapprehension or exaggeration of those aims . Unquestionably , the Federal capital ? with its wonderful libraries , museums , laboratories and collections ? offers extraordinary facilities for graduate work , and the day will surely come ( iii spite of all difficulties and obstacles , and in the face of all narrow and provincial objections ) when some institution here will co-ordinate and effectively utilize those facilities for advanced teaching . And yet , as far as The George Washington University is concerned , the evolution of our graduate work will come as a natural outgrowth of the work we are doing in our various undergraduate departments ; and even now we are doing graduate work in certain lines that will compare favorably with the work done in many an institution boasting of immense endowments . But we are not bitten , in the least , by any ambition to become the great national university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission , as well as our supreme desire , is to serve our own community , by furnishing to the young people of Washington ( 1 ) the best possible general education , by means of our college of arts and sciences ; ( 2 ) a thoroly practical and liberal education , as a means of livelihood , in the fields represented by our college of engineering and the mechanic arts , our departments of law , medicine , dentistry , our college of pharmacy and veterinary science , and our teachers ' college , which has already been officially recognized as being of great value to the public schools of the District . As we are the only non-sectarian university in the District , and are so centrally located , we are in a position to render yeoman service in the fields of higher and practical education to this intelligent and growing population . A city of this size surely needs a strong university to meet the local educational demands ; besides which , the capital of this great nation ought to have such a university . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own lines  | would be to the District of Columbia what certain large universities are to their respective cities , such an institution would , in time , become of no little national importance , because of its very location . The editor of THE INDEPENDENT has said that the financial problems confronting The George Washington University are due to its effort to expand into a metropolitan university of the standing of Columbia or Chicago . " The explanation is offered in an entirely friendly spirit , for he goes on to say that altho such plans are " ambitious " they are " not impracticable , " and that he hopes " they will be carried out . " But he is entirely mistaken as to the present program of The George Washington University . What the next twenty-five years may bring to the university bearing the immortal name of the father of his country we modestly leave to the future . But what we have done is to lift our standards of entrance and graduation , and to shift the entire university from the " night school " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that we might the better serve our own community . Here are some eloquent figures showing how this university , under President Needham 's wise administration , has contributed toward the " advancement of teaching " in the city of Washington . Eight years ago we had 1,300 students ; today , there are more than 1,500 ? a very respectable increase . But when the figures are analyzed , the real advance is nothing short of remarkable . Eight years ago , out of the 1,300 students , only 71 were giving all their time to their college and university work ! Today , we have more than 500 giving their full time , and with a splendid body of half-time students , who , with a few exceptions , are here for business . " Eight years ago we had onlv 11 teachers giving their entire time to the institution ; today there are 44 . The growth in number of full-time students during the last five years has shown , beyond a shadow of doubt , that there is a local demand for the development of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its permanent and temporary residents . And yet , while our primary mission , as well as our supreme ambition , is to serve the citizens of Washington , there is , however , one special field of service to the whole nation which we do propose to enter , and that is the field represented by our new college of the political sciences , the enlargement of which is being financed separately from the university as a whole , by means of a special five years ' sustentation fund of $25,000 a year , which is now being raised for that college . If public-spirited Americans , both men and women ( who would appreciate the added prestige coming to their country if American consuls were more uniformly ideal representatives of our people ) , and the business interests of the country ( which have a financial stake in the development of " A Consular Corps of Well-Disciplined Soldiers of Commerce " ) will now come forward and complete the sustentation fund for this new college of the political sciences , located at the national capital , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Knox are making to bring about a complete and permanent reform of the consular service , this new college will soon become a valuable ally of the Administration , and it will be all the more effective because such a consular training school , as well as the Government , is relieved of all the embarrassments that would inevitably arise , if , at this stage of our progress toward the civil service millennium , the Government itself were to attempt the financial support and active management of such a school .
