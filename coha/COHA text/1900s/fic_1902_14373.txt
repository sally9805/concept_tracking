The deck of a ship . The railing is at the footlights , and beyond it , against the cabin 's sides , are rows of steamer chairs facing the audience . At Right of the Centre are double doors to the principal gangway ; at Left of the Centre is a gangway through to the other side of the ship , where the audience sees the railing and the sea and sky beyond . Along this gangway promenaders are constantly passing . Most of the steamer chairs have their bored occupants in them , and scattered about there is still the paraphernalia of a voyage two-thirds finished . There are half-empty lemonade glasses perilously placed beside chairs , remnants of once white grapes , like tawdry boardinghouse keepers who have seen better days , on white plates tucked into out-of-the-way corners . A conversational child is conspicuous . It is late afternoon . There is a few moments ' silence ; then a MAN PASSENGER , reading , turns a page . The CHILD drops her doll and picks it up . A MAN , on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left in a businesslike manner of taking exercise . After him TWO GIRLS , arm in arm , walk more slowly , talking , and disappear at Right . WOMAN PASSENGER Querulously . Steward ! STEWARD Off stage , Right . Coming , madam ! He enters . p. 3 MAN PASSENGER Steward ! STEWARD Hesitates at centre . Yes , sir ! WOMAN PASSENGER Steward ! ! STEWARD Yes , madam . Going to the WOMAN and tucking in her shawl . WOMAN PASSENGER I want some lemonade , steward ! STEWARD Going toward Right . Yes , miss . WOMAN PASSENGER Calls after him . With ice , plenty of ice , steward ! STEWARD Yes , miss . Going . MAN PASSENGER Steward ! STEWARD Stopping near him . Yes , sir . MAN PASSENGER Can you tell me if this damned boat is ever going to get across ? STEWARD Yes , sir , we ought to land in another day , sir . MAN PASSENGER grunts . STEWARD goes out at Right . The MAN again walks rapidly by from Right to Left on his fourteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HANDT A thin , sweet-faced German woman , wearing glasses , and inappropriately dressed for a voyage . A loafly day , not ? Yust ass glass , only for de pig swells dat come efery leetle once . Here comes one now ! THE LADY WITH THE CHILD Take care , Rosalie ! The STEWARD at the same time comes out of door with lemonade , and the ship rolls heavily forward , then back . Each motion is accompanied by loud screams , shouts , and laughter , and a great clatter of crockery and glass . Oranges and empty glasses and cups roll down to the footlights , and some of the passengers are almost thrown of their chairs . The STEWARD is obliged to hang on to the doorway . When the lurch is over , a great sigh of relief goes up from those on the deck . MAN PASSENGER Steward ! Is that going to happen again ? STEWARD I do n't know , sir . The STEWARD goes to the WOMAN PASSENGER . FRAULEIN HANDT To anybody , laughing . Dat vas ein corker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The STEWARD tucks up her shawl and makes her more comfortable . I 'd like some prunes for my dinner , steward . p. 5 STEWARD Starting to go . Very good , madam . WOMAN PASSENGER Steward ! STEWARD Stopping . Yes , madam . WOMAN PASSENGER When will we get in ? STEWARD Could n't say , madam . WOMAN PASSENGER Well , I wish you 'd go to the captain of this boat and say that Mrs. Harry K. Whipple , of Salem , Mass. , would like to know just when we do get there ! STEWARD Yes , madam . Going toward Right , stops to tuck in a passenger . The MAN , the amateur pedestrian , walks rapidly by from Right to Left again . The TWO GIRLS pass him and join the FRULEIN . One of these is VI TOMPSON , a breezy , natural , wholesouled , perfectly untrammelled girl of the soil  --  a western Eve . Her companion is a more colourless young person , the sort of girl that would be content to rest in the contrasted shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect day , would n't it , if it were n't for these awful swells every little while  --  they make you feel just like express elevators , do n't they ? p. 6 FRAULEIN HANDT Vere iss Mees Geraldine ? VI TOMPSON Oh , she 's all right ! She 's playing thingum-bob  --  you know that game  --  in the bow with the English Lord . My dear ! It 's such a case ! I think you 're the sweetest chaperon , or companion , or whatever you are , that ever was ! Really , I do ! FRAULEIN HANDT Oh , Mees Geraldine iss quite safe . She nefer need no chaperong ! VI TOMPSON Well , I only wish mamma was like you ! I tell you it 's lucky for me she 's so seasick , or I should n't be having any fun with the Doctor at all ! This latter added in a more confidential manner and amusedly . IS N'T he handsome ! Oh , my ! And when we walk , you know , he goes so fast I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  have to ! ! ! Laughs . Well ! I think he 's perfectly lovely  --  that 's all ! Perfectly ! FRAULEIN HANDT And where iss your fader  --  that he haf not see  --  Interrupted . VI TOMPSON Oh , popper never sees anything , even on shore , except figures and numbers . And on board he lies in the smoking room all day . He 's made all our fees at poker , and won three pools besides ! Popper 's awfully clever ! The MAN walks by again from Right to Left , and VI 'S friend pulls her arm to notice him . p. 7 VI TOMPSON Looks at him , and then turns to FRULEIN . I do n't think he 's so good-looking , do you ? Jess is crazy about him . But of course I 'm colour blind , anyway ; all I can see just now is brass buttons ! HE 'S going to give me one for a hat-pin ! Really ! They start to walk again , and she calls back over her shoulder . Wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot-water bag , followed by a STEWARD , lead out from the double doorway the figure of a pale woman , pretty well enveloped in wraps of an indiscriminate sort . They place her carefully in an empty chair Left of FRULEIN . VI TOMPSON Stopping . Oh , here 's Miss Piney ! I 'm so glad you 're feeling better . STEWARDESS Oh , yes , she 'll be hall right now she 's hup and hout in the hair ! VI TOMPSON Yes , indeed ! And it 's a beautiful day ! MISS PINEY rolls her eyes , as much as to say at present there can be no beauty in any day for her . FRAULEIN HANDT Unt de sea yust like a mill pond  --  parfecdly smoot except yust every leetle once ! VI TOMPSON You look splendidly , Miss Piney , not at all ill ! MISS PINEY is safe in her chair by now , and well wrapped , from her feet with overshoes , to her head in its baby-blue crocheted arrangement . The hot-water bag is at her feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her eyes shut . The STEWARDESS goes back , downstairs . p. 8 STEWARD To VI . Excuse me , miss , your mother asked me to tell you she wanted to see you . He follows the STEWARDESS . VI TOMPSON Oh , pshaw ! Mamma 's too boring ! She 's always sending for me to ask if I 've found out when we land , or if popper 's drinking too much . And how can I tell ? To FRULEIN . Say , if the Doctor should come by here alone , wo n't you grab him , please , and try to keep him till I come back ? I just hate to leave the deck for five minutes  --  because , of course , every other girl on this boat , not to mention the five widows , crape and grass , are all dying to get him away from me ! But I 'm not afraid of you !  --  You know what I mean ! And with her arm about her friend , she goes out through the double doors . FRAULEIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling much better as already ! MISS PINEY opens her eyes to give FRULEIN one miserable and speechless glance , and then closes them again . The MAN walks on from Right , but as the ship sways far forward , stops , with his legs wide apart to steady himself . Again there are cries and laughter , the noise of crockery and glass colliding ; several people slide from their chairs . Down the passageway Left , half run , half fall LORD TILBURY and GERALDINE . GERALDINE is a very handsome girl , with the love of life in her face and speech and manner ; like Vi , she is whole-souled and unaffected , but she is more cultivated than VI , more emotional , and with a more tender sense of humour . TILBURY is a very good-looking , very smartlooking young Englishman , a " good sort , who needs , however , more experience and more years than the average man to get him out of his salad days . p. 9 GERALDINE LANG Cries out . Lord Tilbury ! She clutches him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains standing , and all brace themselves for the return roll of the ship . This being duly accomplished , the travellers settle down again . The STEWARDS run hither and thither , and GERALDINE helps LORD TILBURY to rise . LORD TILBURY Thanks awfully . So glad it was n't you ! GERALDINE LANG Laughing . So am I ! Miss PINEY slowly rises , feebly , and with difficulty extricates herself from her belongings . GERALDINE and TILBURY hurry to assist her to the doorway , where the STEWARDESS takes her and she retires . GERALDINE LANG Miss Piney 's even a worse sailor than you , Lord Tilbury . LORD TILBURY But really  --  I have n't been seasick . Really ! Really ! It was only a cold with dizziness . GERALDINE LANG Laughs pleasantly at him . I know that cold ! And Miss Piney , she has heart weakness , that 's all  --  she 's not seasick . O dear , no ! Only heart weakness ! LORD TILBURY And what is your pet illness ? p. 10 GERALDINE LANG I love the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And on the land ? GERALDINE LANG I never am ill on the land , either ! LORD TILBURY Really ! what a beastly healthy person ! GERALDINE LANG Oh , do hit some wood quick or my luck may change . She stamps on the deck with her right heel . He follows her action . Thank you ! I think I 'll sit down . Sitting on the arm of FRULEIN 'S chair . Do you know my friend , Frulein Handt ? She introduces them . FRAULEIN HANDT I ' ave knowed your fader at sight , Lord Tilbury . I vas one time governess in de Austro-Hungary Embassy , unt he vas often to de house . LORD TILBURY Really ! I do n't know my father very well ! FRAULEIN HANDT Ah , but dat vas ven you vas at school . She settles back in her chair to let them talk together without her . GERALDINE LANG Are you coming down to dinner , Frulein ? FRAULEIN HANDT I tink not , I go sleeping now . Closes her eyes . p. 11 GERALDINE LANG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's tact ! Both laugh gently . LORD TILBURY She 's an awfully good sort , is n't she ? How long have you been abroad , Miss Lang ? GERALDINE LANG One hundred years ! LORD TILBURY Really ! ! GERALDINE LANG Well , it seems that ! Ever since I can remember ; I came over here at the age of five ! LORD TILBURY Really ! GERALDINE LANG I have n't a relative in the world , but I 've some property in New York , and that is my home , and I 'm happy to say at last I 'm going back ! LORD TILBURY Really ! GERALDINE LANG Laughingly . If you say " really " again , I think I shall die ! ! LORD TILBURY I beg your pardon  --  Interrupted . GERALDINE LANG I 'm sure it must sound very strange to you , but it 's really very simple ! At the age of four I was left to my last relative , an uncle , a  --  I have gathered and imagined and intuitived  --  rather gay person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift ! p. 12 LORD TILBURY You might be in the way , I suppose ! GERALDINE LANG Exactly ! Who says Englishmen are dense ! ! So he railroaded me off to Stuttgart  --  of all dull places !  --  with a dear old German lady , the aunt of Frulein . Did n't he , Frulein ? FRAULEIN HANDT Yah ! GERALDINE LANG Amused , to TILBURY . Not asleep yet ! Well , when she followed all my other relatives , except Uncle Ray , she left me in charge of my friend here , who is the dearest thing in the world  --  are n't you , Frulein ? FRULEIN snores . She 's only pretending ! She 's too modest to answer that question . FRULEIN giggles . I told you ! They stroll down to the rail and lean on it , looking over . Well  --  now my uncle died last month , and he 's left me a big fortune and a magnificent new house . LORD TILBURY He left you everything ? ! GERALDINE LANG Everything ! ! LORD TILBURY He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never could decide on which ! LORD TILBURY Is n't there any one there you know ? p. 13 GERALDINE LANG Yes , the old housekeeper , and her husband , who is butler . I have childish memories about them both . Mrs. Jars was a dear , fat , jolly woman , with a pocket never empty of sweets  --  Oh , I loved her ! LORD TILBURY Are you glad to be going back to America ? GERALDINE LANG Glad ! ? ! Glad ! ! Surely an Englishman knows what love of one 's country means !  --  how it 's born in one , and nothing ever gets it out ! Let me tell you something ! The day I sailed , a pale , small , timid girl , this same uncle gave me , to wave from the boat , a little stars and stripes ; Uncle Ray DID love his country  --  as well as a few other things ! Perhaps you 'll think it silly of me , but from that day to this I 've never let go that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never went to sleep one night without it under my pillow at first , and afterward in a little sort of amulet about my neck Taking hold of a chain she wears. , when it threatened to become rags ! Glad to go back to America ? It 's what I 've been dreaming of , longing for , waiting for on tiptoe since the very hour I left fourteen years ago ! Glad ! ! ! I do n't pretend to explain ; I can only tell you that even to speak of going back fills me with an emotion I do n't understand . I feel it here ! Her hand over her bosom . And here ! At her throat . It 's  --  why  --  it 's home , you know , that 's all ! p. 14 LORD TILBURY I know what you mean . I felt it in South Africa . GERALDINE LANG With quick interest and sympathy . Were you in many battles there ? LORD TILBURY No , but I was in all the hospitals ! GERALDINE LANG She laughs . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down a little , just here in front of you . FRAULEIN HANDT Without opening her eyes . Oh ! I vas not afraid ven you vill be lost ! But do n't forget dat a long time de first horn for tinner have tooted ! GERALDINE LANG As they begin to walk . Now I 've told you the story of my life . Tell me yours ! Is this your first visit to America ? LORD TILBURY Yes , I 've been to Ireland and Paris , besides South Africa , but of course New York is different . GERALDINE LANG But New York is n't America ! LORD TILBURY No , I suppose not  --  there 's Chicago , is n't there , and Washington  --  Stops walking. only I hear that 's very cosmopolitan ,  --  and there used to be a Boston , did n't there ? p. 15 GERALDINE LANG Horrors ! ! LORD TILBURY Across a bridge ? GERALDINE LANG With relief . Oh ! you 're mixed ; there used to be Brooklyn , but now it 's greater New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming with the DOCTOR from the opposite direction . As they pass , VI catches hold of GERALDINE 'S arm , holding her back , and speaks in her ear , the DOCTOR standing a step or two in advance of her , and TILBURY discreetly waiting a few steps in front of GERALDINE . VI TOMPSON I think you 're just too mean for anything to keep a real live lord all alone to yourself . Still , I 'm not mad , because I 'VE got second prize ! Do n't you think he 's perfectly lovely ! GERALDINE LANG Amused . Who ? VI TOMPSON Why , the Doctor ! GERALDINE LANG Perfectly . VI TOMPSON Going on with the DOCTOR , calls back . I 'll exchange ! GERALDINE LANG Calls over her shoulder . All right ! LORD TILBURY She 's a jolly sort of girl . Where does she come from ? p. 16 GERALDINE LANG Her home is in Butte City , Montana . LORD TILBURY Really ! GERALDINE LANG O dear , that awful word 's come back ! Are you coming over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the opposite . They stop walking . So as not to get married . GERALDINE LANG Opening her eyeswide . " Really ! " I 'm afraid you 're going to the wrong place ! You ought to have gone to where I 've been  --  Stuttgart ! Somebody 's SURE to marry YOU in America ! They go on . LORD TILBURY No ; you see it 's this way . I 'm awfully keen to marry Rosy Boggs . She 's in the Gaiety . Maybe you 've seen her in the Toreador . She 's the third from the end on the right all through the first act , and is the one that says , " He did n't go this way ! " Eagerly . Do you remember her ? GERALDINE LANG I do n't think so . LORD TILBURY Perhaps you remember her in the last act . She 's on the opposite side in that act , and she substitutes in the octette when any one of the other girls are ill . Stops . But perhaps you do n't go every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a matine. p. 17 GERALDINE LANG No , I was n't in London long , and I did n't go to the Gaiety regularly . LORD TILBURY Well , you 'd have seen she 's a lady born , only her parents are a bit offish ; the father keeps a public house , and Rosy began behind his bar , but she was too refined and could n't stand it . My governor 's so obtuse he wo n't see Rosy a little bit , and threatens to cut me off with a ha'penny  --  is n't it awful ! GERALDINE LANG If I loved her , I 'd marry her anyway . LORD TILBURY But Rosy wo n't ! GERALDINE LANG Oh , then , Rosy does n't love you . LORD TILBURY Yes , she does ! She 's awful gone on me , but she 's so noble ! She says she wo n't marry me unless my father relents , because she could n't bear to have me cut off with a ha'penny ,  --  do n't you see ,  --  on her account ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ! Laughing . GERALDINE sings a couple of lines of " Rosy , you are my Posy . " LORD TILBURY I say , you 're awfully sympathetic . I 've been awful keen to talk to somebody about it . We 're all in hopes I 'll forget Rosy over here , but I 'm afraid I wo n't . Bugle call for dinner , in the distance . p. 18 GERALDINE LANG Just wait ! You 've no idea what damage American girls can do to a little memory like that . LORD TILBURY You know you remind me a little of Rosy  --  if you wo n't mind my saying it . GERALDINE LANG Goodness  --  already ! If I 've shaken your precious souvenir the least little bit , Miss Vi Tompson of Butte City , in her own language , " wo n't do a thing to it ! " A STEWARD appears and gives loud bugle call for dinner . Many more people have been promenading during the end of this scene , and the speeches have been broken , interrupted , and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the others to pass them . The sun has also sunk ; there is the clear light without the yellow of the sun , leaving only red and gold seen in the clouds over the horizon . At the sound of the call all rise from their chairs except WOMAN PASSENGER and FRULEIN . A STEWARD hurries in , and is busy helping the women , while another with the menu and waits on FRULEIN and WOMAN PASSENGER . There is a general crowd walking about on the deck . GERALDINE LANG Casually . The last call . I suppose we must go down ! They move on and meet VI . GERALDINE , with p. 19 LORD TILBURY pauses and stops VI . GERALDINE LANG Miss Tompson . VI TOMPSON My dear , are n't you going down ? GERALDINE LANG I want to present Lord Tilbury to you . VI TOMPSON How do you do , Lord Tilbury . TILBURY bows . I am pleased to make your acquaintance . I saw you the first day out , and I wanted to know you then , you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he , Miss Lang ! It was the sweetest suit on the boat ! But you disappeared for several days , till this morning ! LORD TILBURY Yes , I caught a bad cold . VI TOMPSON Laughs . Oh , come ! It 's been terribly rough ! I do n't mind confessing that I was awfully seasick . I wanted to go straight down to the bottom , Paris clothes and all ! Which reminds me of the killingest story popper told us he heard from the second officer . Oh , but I do n't know Lord Tilbury well enough to tell him funny stories yet . LORD TILBURY I hope after dinner we may become much better acquainted , and shall look forward with pleasure to the story . You will be on deck after dinner ? p. 20 VI TOMPSON Oh , yes , I think it 's perfectly lovely on deck at night ! I just adore the stars and the moonlight , do n't you ! It makes you feel so happy and sociable . Oh , I just think it 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till after dinner , then ! He bows . VI TOMPSON Good-by ! GERALDINE LANG Good-by ! LORD TILBURY Good-by . He goes downstairs . VI TOMPSON Oh , my dear , I think he 's perfectly lovely ! And it was just too sweet of you for worlds to introduce him . Most girls would have kept him locked up in the ice box . GERALDINE LANG Come along , we must go too . VI TOMPSON Laughingly . I 'm so mad ! Mamma 's coming down to dinner to-night . You know I 've had the table alone with popper and a whole lot of men , and I do think men are so nice , do n't you !  --  and now mamma 'll come down and cut me right out ! . You know mamma 's the sweetest thing that ever was ! She is really ! But you 've never seen her , have you ? Well , you must to-morrow if she 's up . See you later . She goes downstairs , through the double doors . STEWARD gives FRULEIN her basket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her also . Then he goes out . GERALDINE goes to FRULEIN. p. 21 GERALDINE LANG Frulein ! FRAULEIN HANDT Yes , tear , ca n't you guess for vy I vas staying ? GERALDINE LANG Delighted . To see who it is leaves the white rose every night during dinner on my chair ? !

WOMAN PASSENGER Steward ! p. 22 STEWARD Entering Left with a basket-tray full of used dishes . Yes , madam . WOMAN PASSENGER Querulously . My baked potatoes are n't baked and my beefsteak is a mutton chop . STEWARD Very sorry , madam . Shall I  --  WOMAN PASSENGER No , no matter , I 'll eat it , but it 's stone cold . I shall never cross on this line again ! I never saw such food . STEWARD starts to go , but stops as she speaks . Steward ! Bring me some champagne with ice , plenty of ice . STEWARD Yes , madam . He goes through the double doors . As he goes , COUNT CARLOS KINSEY appears from Right and comes toward GERALDINE 'S empty chair ; when he gets near enough to see FRULEIN , he starts and stops . But FRULEIN has heard him coming and seems to be asleep , with her head turned away . KINSEY comes carefully along and lays a white rose in GERALDINE 'S chair . At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying , " Oh ! " COUNT CARLOS KINSEY Also starts and bows low . I beg a pardon . FRAULEIN HANDT Vith pleasure ! She looks in the chair and sees the rose .

PEOPLE begin to crowd the deck , men striking matches for their cigars and cigarettes . The sky is dark blue and stars come out . It is dark , and electric lights are turned on , two or three on the ceiling of the deck , one over the FRULEIN . Half of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VI TOMPSON Comes along on her friend 's arm and stops by FRULEIN . Frulein , there 's a lovely ship awfully close on the other side , you ought to see it . The cry of a ship on the other side is passed along the crowd , and they all go through the passageway or disappear at each end . Some of them can be seen through the passageway leaning over the far rail . The moon slowly rises . TILBURY has come out and goes to FRULEIN. p. 27 COUNT CARLOS KINSEY As he sees TILBURY approach . You vill not tell her ?  --  yes ? FRAULEIN HANDT I svear it , no ! LORD TILBURY You do n't want to see the ship , Frulein Handt ? FRAULEIN HANDT No , I vant only to see de landt , and I tink I must go now unt find Miss Geraldine . You vill excuse me , Lord Tilbury ,  --  you know Herr  --  She hesitates , at a loss .

TILBURY and KINSEY come down to rail ; KINSEY offers TILBURY a cigarette , and they light them during the dialogue that follows . The STEWARD goes about gathering up the rugs , etc . LORD TILBURY I had quite a pal in London from Budapesth  --  Count Kinsey , the Count Kinsey , the older brother . Thanks ! Referring to the cigarette that Kinsey offers him . Everybody called him Dolly at the Gaiety . Clever girls , those ! His name was Adolph . Did you know him ? Thanks ! Lighting his cigarette from a match of KINSEY'S. p. 28 COUNT CARLOS KINSEY It is probably vile he vas in London then I vas in Budapesth . Lights his own cigarette . LORD TILBURY He was a gay chap . His crowd was too tight a screw for me , but I knew him through Rosy . Do you know Rosy Boggs ? She 's rippin ' ! KINSEY looks puzzled . You 've seen the Toreador ? COUNT CARLOS KINSEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the third from the end on the right all through the first act ! It 's a nice little part . She has a line in that act , " He did n't go this way ! " And , by George , how she does say it ! Delighted with the memory . Rippin ' ! Kinsey was daft for a year on the little American girly who stood next to Rosy . He followed her to Russia in the autumn , and back , and she 's only just now run off with an American jockey over here ! But Kinsey 's after her . I read in a paper the day we started that Count Kinsey sailed under an assumed name the same week as we did , chasing an American girl . COUNT CARLOS KINSEY Really moved . Zat is very strange !

JARS has gone to the door . He opens it . GERALDINE stands there with FRULEIN a little behind her . GERALDINE wears a brilliant scarlet dress with a white rose in her belt . FRULEIN is also dressed in colours . They carry hand luggage , and behind them are two cab drivers , with more luggage . p. 43 GERALDINE LANG Is this Mr.  --  yes  --  I 'm sure you 're William Jars , are n't you ? Coming toward him .

No ! I never wore red before in my life ! But when I heard that precious old uncle of mine was finished , I went out that very day and bought this dress ! p. 46 DRIVER Pushing open door , his arms full . If you please , ma'am , the baggage is all down now . Shall we bring it ? MRS . JARS Yes , of course ! The MEN bring in many trunks of all sizes , bandboxes , boxes , handbags , shawl straps , and steamer chairs , until the stage is actually full , with , in some instances , trunks and bags on top of one another .

GERALDINE LANG Looking in . Ugh ! It looks like the ghost of a room , does n't it ? MRS . JARS Mr. Lang never entertained company , except in the dining room , and that room and the hall was all he had furnished downstairs . Front bell rings . She goes to the door Left . Yes , ma'am , she 's come ! Yes , ma'am . I think you 'd better let them get in first or they 'll ruin that elegant dress . Turns to GERALDINE . It 's Mrs. Wrighton !

GERALDINE stands expectant , breathless . MRS . WRIGHTON sees her and starts . My dear child ! They go quickly toward each other with outstretched hands . MRS . JARS goes out the front door . MRS . WRIGHTON is a charming woman of distinction , about forty-five years of age , and looking naturally younger ; very smartly dressed , without any appearance of an effort to that end . She is perhaps more sentimental than one has the right to expect in a woman of the world , but that 's forgivable ; she means it , and it makes her happy . I would know you anywhere ! She holds GERALDINE 'S hand tight and affectionately and gazes into her face . The living image ! The living image of your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will you kiss me ?

I 'm very glad indeed to know you . When I was Miss Geraldine 's age I knew your aunt very well . FRAULEIN HANDT I tank you ! GERALDINE LANG Would you mind sitting down here somewhere till the luggage is in ? MRS . WRIGHTON By all means . These trunks are perfectly comfortable . They sit on a large trunk , side by side , FRULEIN standing by the door and directing the bringing in of their luggage . And now , Geraldine  --  I shall call you Geraldine ? GERALDINE LANG Of course . MRS . WRIGHTON Your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a girl your age . I want to ask you to let me be a second mother to you , may I ? A sort of well-meaning stepmother !

FRAULEIN HANDT Miss Geraldine , why vill you not make haste go to your room for one leettle minute , refresh yourself mit a leettle vater ? I vill vatch out for de luggages . MRS . WRIGHTON Yes , do , and take off your hat and make yourself comfortable . MRS . JARS returns . GERALDINE LANG Rising . Mrs. Jars , will you show me my room , please ? MRS . JARS Certainly ! Climbing over a trunk which blocks her passage . And I forgot to tell you , Miss Geraldine , that I 've kep your uncle 's room sacred , just as he left it , no one has been in it , till you go . Going upstairs . MRS . WRIGHTON To FRULEIN . Well ! With a long breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should imagine , for a young girl ! GERALDINE LANG Stops on stairs to speak to MRS . WRIGHTON .

I wo n't be long , Aunt Janet . As she goes on upstairs , FRULEIN whispers to MRS . WRIGHTON . MRS . WRIGHTON Geraldine ? GERALDINE LANG Yes ? MRS . JARS disappears upstairs . MRS . WRIGHTON Throw me that white rose , it 's lovely . GERALDINE LANG Oh ! Putting her hand over it . I 'm so sorry , but I could n't . She goes on , but stops at top to call over the railing . Frulein ! ! ! Laughing . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She follows after MRS . JARS . The following conversation is interrupted several times by the MEN bringing in trunks . The TWO WOMEN always break off the conversation , even in the middle of a word , when the MEN enter , and continue exactly where they left off when the MEN exit . p. 51 MRS . WRIGHTON Why ? Interrupted . FRAULEIN HANDT Interrupting . Exguse me ! There vas so leettle time .

GERALDINE LANG She hesitates a little in this speech . No , I did n't ask him , but I gave him my address , and told him to come any time he liked and let me know where he would be . I thought that as I was an American , it was only being decently hospitable to a foreigner in my home . MRS .

I made him come up here in a cable car , and he 's never been out of a cab before in his life ! GERALDINE LANG How did you like the cable car , Lord Tilbury ? LORD TILBURY Oh , I thought it was rippin ' ! VI TOMPSON And he 's got to go back in the elevated !  --  I came to tell you where we 're stopping . I could n't find you anywhere this morning .

I do n't know what people think society in Butte City is like ! They 'd better come out and see . GERALDINE LANG But what DID you do ? VI TOMPSON Well , the first thing we did was for popper to make everything worse , by shouting out , " Where in  --   --  did all these dresses come from , anyway ! I never saw any of them before ! " MRS . WRIGHTON and GERALDINE exchange an amused glance . p. 59 MRS . WRIGHTON Just like a man ! GERALDINE LANG I hope your mother came out all right ? VI TOMPSON Oh , yes , popper fixed it up somehow , but mamma naturally had hysterics , which was most fortunate in the end , because that 's why we 're here at all . MRS .

GERALDINE LANG Do tell us ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , mamma and popper fought like sixty over where we were to stay here . Popper said we were going to the Fifth Avenue Hotel and mamma said we were going to the Waldorf-Astoria . Popper said he would n't stay a day in that damn-fool hostelry , and mamma said she would n't stay a minute in the Fifth Avenue . I saw myself taking the through train straight to Butte City ! So I joined in and said I would n't be found dead in the Fifth Avenue Hotel  --  and then we had it hot and heavy ! We all held out , too , and mamma would n't have popper in her stateroom , so I had to give up my comfortable room by myself to him and go to sleep with her in the upstairs bunk . It just spoiled my night 's rest . I 've been terribly dull all morning , have n't I , Lord Tilbury ? LORD TILBURY I beg your pardon ? p. 62 VI TOMPSON Laughing . Oh , is n't he awful ! Just awful !

WRIGHTON But you have n't told us where you are yet ! VI TOMPSON Oh , yes . Well , when mamma had hysterics in the Custom House , of course that settled popper , and we 're at the Waldorf-Astoria , and  --  what 's more  --  mamma and I have got a plan to stay a month . There 'd be no use going before next week , anyway , because everybody comes on to the Waldorf from Butte City for the Horse Show . GERALDINE LANG I 'm delighted you are going to stay .

GERALDINE LANG I 'm sorry there is no servant to send , but Jars has gone out . LORD TILBURY Oh , I shall manage all right , thank you . VI TOMPSON I hope you 'll manage better than you did with the tea ! Do n't spill the cab , especially if you 're in it ! He laughs , embarrassed , and goes out Left . Is n't he sweet !

WRIGHTON Well , in the first place , I told him at once that I knew of him through my wife . MRS . WRIGHTON And embarrassed him a little . MR . WRIGHTON And then I went it rather strong , perhaps , and said I had every reason to believe he was n't what he appeared to be , and that I should warn my friends who were thinking of joining the company . p. 88 GERALDINE LANG Oh , Mr. Wrighton ! MR . WRIGHTON My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is to own a certain number of shares in the company , and we are to work the vines over there in Hungary and own the rest of the shares . But where is the proof of these vines ? His word ! to be backed up by the proper papers , et cetera , he has sent for . MRS . WRIGHTON You do nothing with the company till these papers arrive , so I do n't see  --  Interrupted . MR . WRIGHTON Interrupting . ' Suppose they never arrive ? MRS . WRIGHTON He 's discovered and no harm done . MR . WRIGHTON There can be all sorts of delays , and he may have confederates writing from Hungary . How do we know ? And meanwhile , what ? He is getting an entr into our homes ! Doing the same here , perhaps , as he did in London . GERALDINE LANG Quickly . What did he do in London ? MRS . WRIGHTON Quickly . Nothing , dear , that we 're sure of . GERALDINE LANG But tell me ; you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! it is not our secret yet ; when it is , you shall know the truth for good or ill . MR . WRIGHTON He looks rather raggy , in spite of his smart clothes . His cuffs showed it . Of course he was after Geraldine 's money  --  and if Geraldine 's is impossible , then the next girl 's  --  GERALDINE LANG No , you do n't know that ! MR . WRIGHTON If he is honest , why is n't his consul backing him up ? MRS . WRIGHTON That 's so ! Looking at GERALDINE . MR . WRIGHTON I asked him about his consul . GERALDINE LANG Yes ? MR . WRIGHTON He said he did n't know him , and that the consul would n't know his name . And yet , you know , the man has such a winning way with him , if I did n't really know all I did , why , by George , I should have been weaker than I was . GERALDINE LANG I wish you had been ! I see nothing in all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , and I was always told that a man in this country was innocent till proved guilty . MRS . WRIGHTON Dear me , if that is n't like a girl ! It will be our fault next that she drove him away from her house . p. 90 MR . WRIGHTON Well , next I played a strong card , in hopes it would make him show his hand . I told him frankly I thought him a charlatan ! GERALDINE LANG Oh , how could you ? MR . WRIGHTON I told him I knew of his behaviour to Miss Lang , which nothing could excuse . GERALDINE LANG Oh , he will think I have told everything ! What did he say ? MR . WRIGHTON Nothing . GERALDINE LANG Nothing ? MR . WRIGHTON That was his principal reply to me ! MRS . WRIGHTON How do you mean ? MR . WRIGHTON I did n't mince matters . I told him I doubted his vineyards  --  that I should warn my friends in his company , and would not join it myself . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed name , and I had a suspicion as to who he really was . GERALDINE LANG What answer did he make ? MR . WRIGHTON None ! MRS . WRIGHTON Dick ! ! ! MR . WRIGHTON He drew himself up till it seemed as if he were nine feet and I three , and said I had insulted him , that he did n't come to discuss his private affairs with me , but only a matter of business , and he would bid me good morning . p. 91 GERALDINE LANG And you let him go ? MR . WRIGHTON No ! GERALDINE LANG Ah ! MR . WRIGHTON I stopped him  --  at the door . I said , " If you have the right to resent strongly all I have said , no one will be more glad than I ! and my apology shall be abject . " MRS . WRIGHTON That was nice , Dick . MR . WRIGHTON He did n't seem to understand ; he was still in too much of a rage , poor fellow ! You know I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GERALDINE LANG Interrupting him . Hush ! You do n't know what he is yet . MR . WRIGHTON I said the matter of the company would naturally hold over till the arrival of his papers , and he said within three weeks . GERALDINE LANG But how is it he 's coming here ? MR . WRIGHTON Oh , I was weakening a little then , and I said , as to the other matter , would he be so good as to call upon my wife this afternoon ? MRS . WRIGHTON And he agreed ? MR . WRIGHTON No , he refused . Then I took your name in vain To GERALDINE. and said it was , I knew , your desire . p. 92 GERALDINE LANG Yes ? ! MR . WRIGHTON He bowed and said he would be here at five ! That 's all ! Rising . You know now I 'm away from him I realize he must be a scamp ; but be careful , Janet , when you 're with him  --  there 's no doubt he is full of charm ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech a SERVANT has been arranging a tea-table in the farther room . MRS . WRIGHTON sees him . What are you doing , Thornton ? THORNTON Laying the tea-table , madam . MRS . WRIGHTON But why ? We do n't take tea with our cards . THORNTON Excuse me , madam , but it 's Thursday . MRS . WRIGHTON Oh , of course , so it is ; I forgot . To WRIGHTON . I had the bridge-whist class meet here on my day at home so as not to waste the afternoon ! GERALDINE LANG But how will you see Herr Carlman ? MRS . WRIGHTON Oh , I must just get rid of the people somehow . I 'll do it . MR . WRIGHTON Well , I 'm going over to the club . I hope you 're satisfied with my day 's work . GERALDINE LANG I am , and I thank you , only please do n't side too quickly against him ; let 's give him a big , fair , open chance . p. 93 MR . WRIGHTON By all means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going to him . Try to be back by six , and we could take a little drive . She leads him out into the hall , out of sight . GERALDINE watches , smiling softly . There is a silence , and then the sound of a kiss . GERALDINE LANG I heard you ! MRS . WRIGHTON You have ears like Red Riding Hood 's grandmother . As she comes back . GERALDINE LANG I do n't feel at all like bridge to-day . MRS . WRIGHTON Neither do I ; but at this rate we 'll never learn . GERALDINE LANG You 'll be sure to see him , wo n't you ? MRS . WRIGHTON I am as anxious as you , dear . Putting her arm about her . I 'm no longer fond of you , Geraldine , for your mother 's sake only , but for your own . GERALDINE LANG And , as near as any one could , you take her place . MRS . WRIGHTON Thank you . GERALDINE LANG Listen , the more I hear against him , the stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 94 MRS . WRIGHTON Smiling . That 's your natural inborn stubbornness , dear . You had it as a child . GERALDINE LANG I do n't think it 's stubbornness this time , I think it 's love . No woman can pretend she loves a man , unless she has faith in him , and the only one able to destroy that faith should be the man she loves . MRS . WRIGHTON Oh , be careful , my dear , do n't let yourself go ! It looks so certain you must suffer terribly if you do . GERALDINE LANG It 's too late to say that now . MRS . WRIGHTON Really ? GERALDINE LANG Yes . MRS . WRIGHTON Oh , then , if only we are wrong ! GERALDINE LANG What is it you know and suspect ? You must tell me ; I have a right to ask it . MRS .

GERALDINE LANG And you are taking all this trouble for me !  --  do n't think me ungrateful . MRS . WRIGHTON We are only trying to protect your happiness in place of your mother and father . GERALDINE LANG Look ! You shall have my white rose ! Gives it to her , As BUTLER enters Left , and announces Miss TOMPSON . She enters . VI TOMPSON As they greet her and she shakes hands . Am I late or early ? Nobody else ? Oh , I wish I 'd known it ; I 'd have let him come in . MRS . WRIGHTON Who ? VI TOMPSON Why , the Doctor ! off the ship ! I never had such a disappointment in my life ! Never ! Well ? ! !  --  MRS . WRIGHTON How ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us to-day , and without his uniform ! I did n't know him ! No , really ! I thought it was the barber come to shave popper , and I told him popper 'd shaved himself and gone out ! Was n't it awful ! Of course I wanted to sink through the floor ! p. 96 MRS . WRIGHTON Brass buttons do make a great difference ! VI TOMPSON I should say they did ! Why , he was perfectly horrid ! I never saw any one look so ordinary ! Never ! ! and he hardly spoke a word . Just sat there in all his hideous commonplaceness and I had to do all the talking ! GERALDINE LANG Smiling . That must have been very difficult for you ! VI TOMPSON Are n't you mean ! I think you might sympathize with me . BUTLER announces MRS . MATHEWSON , who comes in . MRS . MATTHEWSON There are the usual general greetings . I 'm not late ? No , Mr. Crager is n't here yet to teach . I really think , especially considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to fine him something for being behind time . MRS .

I suppose you brought it over  --  and , Miss Tompson , I called on your mother to-day . VI TOMPSON I 'm sure mamma was tickled to death ! I hope she was in. p. 97 MRS . MATTHEWSON She was . I knew , because I heard her maid telling the clerk she wanted some writing paper , but she sent down word she was " out , " which I considered most thoughtful of her . You know To MRS . WRIGHTON. one might as well make calls in Brooklyn as at the Waldorf , it takes about the same length of time . VI TOMPSON Probably she was being undulated . I know she was sorry ! MRS .

VI TOMPSON Lord Tilbury 's going to drop in ; I hope you do n't mind ? MRS . WRIGHTON Delighted ! MR . CRAGER You might cut for partners now , ladies ! They do so . MRS . MATTHEWSON I promised to drive with my husband . He 's got a new Hungarian wine company on his mind ; and he never will do anything without me , for fear if it fails I 'll say , " I told you so .

DREED , who comes in.Oh , Mrs. Dreed ! MRS . WRIGHTON Excuse me . GERALDINE LANG Who 's Mrs. Dreed ? MRS . MATTHEWSON A horrid woman ! VI TOMPSON I met her yesterday . She was to have her gown made in Williamsburg . MRS . WRIGHTON Lays down her cards in the middle of the dealing , and goes to greet MRS . DREED . How do you do , I am so glad to see you . Do sit down and excuse me for a moment , wo n't you ? I 'm just dealing . Or will you have tea ? MRS . DREED No , do n't let me interrupt . MRS . MATTHEWSON It 's bridge ! MRS .

She is so amusing . GERALDINE LANG Yes , and after a fifteen years ' heavy diet of the German fruleins of Stuttgart , you can imagine what a colossal joy she is to me ! But you must realize that underneath everything she has an awfully good heart . That girl as a friend and as a woman would be as true as steel ! And she always affects me like a tonic ,  --  I feel doubly hopeful now of your interview . p. 114 MRS . WRIGHTON Do you want to see him ?

Thornton , if the gentleman I spoke to you of should come , tell me before you show him in . THORNTON Yes , madam . Having rearranged the table , he goes out . GERALDINE LANG You know , suppose he is poor as he seems , and suppose all his hopes and expectations are centred on forming this company , and it is broken up , think what that will mean to him ! Maybe it is because he is poor that he felt he could n't ask me to marry him ! p. 115 MRS . WRIGHTON That theory is not altogether plausible , my dear ; he is what the papers call " a titled foreigner . " GERALDINE LANG Titled ? MRS . WRIGHTON Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

WRIGHTON Yes , under a promise of secrecy ; but she was worried and told my wife . I cabled to London after my interview with him this morning , and here is my reply . GERALDINE turns away from WRIGHTON . " Yes , Kinsey sailed America week October 30th , after American girl , was in embassy here , worst reputation possible , letter follows . " It is from a secretary of our legation . There is silence , broken only by GERALDINE 'S sobs . MRS . WRIGHTON Going to her . My dear , my dear . GERALDINE LANG Sobbing as she speaks . No ! No ! I do n't want to be sympathized with . I know you mean it all for my good , both of you , but I tell you you 're wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what he said the other day about the things that held him back meant no insult to me , nor dishonour to him either . It 's because he 's poor , I tell you , I can see it clearly . He 's poor and he knows I am rich ! This company would have made it possible for him to ask a woman to marry him , and you , you , my best friends , have done all you could to rob him of his chance . p. 124 MR . WRIGHTON Because I do n't believe in him . I know too much of his record . GERALDINE LANG Still crying , but beginning to control her tears . You do n't know , you do n't know , you only guess ! MRS . WRIGHTON Why confess his name to Frulein and deny it to us ? And why had he concealed it ? MR . WRIGHTON That 's it ! Why ?  --  unless he was ashamed or afraid . GERALDINE LANG Having controlled her tears . Perhaps , if he is Count Kinsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other men have come over here only to sell their titles . He has proved himself above that ! MRS . WRIGHTON You are young , dear , and inexperienced in the world ,  --  living way off in that little German town ,  --  and love blinds your insight . This man 's reputation is known and it is abominable ! At this GERALDINE frees herself from MRS . WRIGHTON 'S arms . MR . WRIGHTON You heard what I read just now , Geraldine , from an unprejudiced and responsible source . GERALDINE LANG But you have n't proved it yet that he is Count Kinsey , and if he is , there may be more than one in Hungary . No , you would n't believe in his cable ,  --  I wo n't believe in yours ! p. 125 MR . WRIGHTON I have sent both to London and Budapesth for further and more reliable proof . In a fortnight I am only too afraid I will be able to give you that proof . MRS . WRIGHTON And if we prove to you this man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , who are trying to take your mother 's place , guide you just a little on your road to happiness ? GERALDINE LANG Very firmly . Yes , if you do prove to me that he is unworthy ! MRS . WRIGHTON That , Dick , is all we want . GERALDINE LANG Excited . And if your proof comes and after all exonerates him , if all these things you believe now prove somehow some hideous mistake  --  you 'll turn around and be his friend ? To MRS . WRIGHTON . MRS . WRIGHTON Yes ! GERALDINE LANG More excited , to WRIGHTON . And you too ,  --  you 'll withdraw your influence against his company ? MR . WRIGHTON I 'll form that company for him ! GERALDINE LANG Laughing hysterically . Ah ! that 's good ! That 's good ! She goes to WRIGHTON , half embracing him , and then goes to MRS . WRIGHTON and hugs her close . Now I can be happy !  --  wait and be happy , for he and I will win , I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughter . Forgive me for being angry just now ! Forgive me ! And look ! I 'm not crying ! I 'm LAUGHING ! ! I 'm laughing because I 'm the happiest girl in the world again ! The HAPPIEST ! ! Laughing and crying. @x The conservatory in Geraldine 's house . The room is a mass of potted plants . There is a semicircular marble bench at Right , banked behind with a row of orange trees . The Blue Hungarian Band is playing on a dais at Left . The musicians are screened by bay trees and palms . The moonlight is seen through the roof . The entrance from the ballroom is Right . LORD TILBURY and VI are seated on the marble bench . The band finishes a waltz . VI TOMPSON You know , I have n't had the slightest desire to marry a lord ! Of course I was dying to know you on the steamer ; but then I 've always been crazy to meet lords and dukes and such things , just to say . I had ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means living in London ! I 've always thought " Excuse me ! " LORD TILBURY Only part of the year . I 'll promise to bring you to America every winter . VI TOMPSON If you did n't , I should certainly bring you ! Laughing . I just love my home . I know Europe 's perfectly grand , and I 'm not finding any fault with London or Paris or Vienna or anywhere , but for a good time among your friends , Butte City beats them all in my eyes ! Just wait till you see it ! LORD TILBURY I hope to have that pleasure very soon ,  --  do n't mind if I call you darling , or something of that sort ? p. 128 VI TOMPSON I do n't care , but do n't you think you 'd better wait till I 've really decided . LORD TILBURY Well , you will give me a decided answer when we get home ? VI TOMPSON " We " get home ! Is n't that rushing it just a little ? LORD TILBURY Really ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City ? VI TOMPSON Yes , that ' I promise . He takes her hand and holds it for a moment in happy silence . MRS . MATHEWSON comes , with a silly-looking young man , to take the marble seat . They are disappointed to find it occupied . MRS . MATTHEWSON O dear , of course that Tompson girl is still there ! They 've monopolized the best seat in the house the entire evening . YOUNG MAN Never mind , let 's go back and dance . They turn and go out . LORD TILBURY Are you happy ? VI TOMPSON Doubtfully . Oh , yes  --  ?  --   --  LORD TILBURY Delighted . So am I ! Rippin ' ! A moment 's silence . Another couple come and look to see if the bench is empty . p. 129 GIRL Oh , pshaw ! They go out . VI TOMPSON Withdrawing her hand . Somebody might come along . Say  --  who is Rosy ? LORD TILBURY Has entirely forgotten . Rosy ? What Rosy ? VI TOMPSON Why I 've heard Miss Lang tease you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , that Rosy ! He says no more . VI TOMPSON WHO is she ? LORD TILBURY More embarrassed . Oh , er  --  she 's  --  er  --  a sort of Spanish girl , that  --  er  --  I thought Miss Lang reminded me of once . VI TOMPSON And did n't I ever remind you of her ? LORD TILBURY Er  --  yes  --  I er  --  believe you did . VI TOMPSON Where is she now ? LORD TILBURY I du n no ! VI TOMPSON When did you see her last ? LORD TILBURY Unwillingly . The day I sailed . p. 130 VI TOMPSON Who is getting more and more excited with her questions and their answers . Oh , did she see you off ? LORD TILBURY Well  --  er  --  yes  --  it answered that purpose . VI TOMPSON What 's her other name ? LORD TILBURY Who is in agony . Boggs . VI TOMPSON Boggs ! Really ! Sounds very Spanish ! ! LORD TILBURY Well , she was only  --  Spanish at the Gaiety , do n't you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has she written you ? LORD TILBURY No ! VI TOMPSON Look me square in the face . LORD TILBURY He does so , and weakens . She cabled . VI TOMPSON Show it to me . LORD TILBURY It 's torn up ! VI TOMPSON What did it say ? LORD TILBURY Rebelling . No ! Really !  --  Interrupted . VI TOMPSON What did it say ? Rising . Or I go back to the ballroom  --  and to Butte City alone ! p. 131 LORD TILBURY It said , " Come back by next boat like a dear old guy . " VI TOMPSON Sitting . And did you ? LORD TILBURY Of course not ,  --  ai n't I here ? VI TOMPSON Why did n't you ? LORD TILBURY Because of you . VI TOMPSON Were you engaged to her ? LORD TILBURY Oh , no !  --  I would n't call it engaged ! A third couple come to see if the bench is empty and go away angry . VI TOMPSON How long did it take you to forget Miss Rosy Carmencita Boggs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOMPSON H 'm ! Two weeks ! Listen . I think we wo n't wait till we get to Butte City . LORD TILBURY Delighted . What ? ! ! VI TOMPSON No , I think it 's best that we should be engaged AT once ! Oh ! look out for the band . He wants to kiss her , but dares not . The band begins again . LORD TILBURY I say , it is rather a beastly nuisance , is n't it , proposing to a girl straight in front of a whole Hungarian band ! p. 132 VI TOMPSON You 'll be pleased to understand that we are engaged all the same , with or without the band ! LORD TILBURY Rather ! ! VI TOMPSON And now we 're off our minds , I want to talk to you about Geraldine Lang . LORD TILBURY She 's a jolly girl ! VI TOMPSON You 'd better think so  --  it was she introduced us . Well , she broke right down with me the other day and told me her story . She 's in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlman . LORD TILBURY Yes , a jolly nice chap ! VI TOMPSON Well , none of her friends think so , and have kept them apart ; and now she has no idea where he is , and is afraid he may be awfully hard up . She knows he 's practically not got a cent , and his business plans have been entirely upset by her friends ! Somehow or other , you and I 've got to find him . LORD TILBURY And then what will we do with him ? VI TOMPSON Oh , if we find him , she 's got to do the rest ! MRS . MATHEWSON comes again with the same young man to see if the bench is free . MRS . MATTHEWSON In disgust . Well ! they 'll grow to that bench ! They go back to the ballroom , laughing ; VI and TILBURY turn and see them . p. 133 VI TOMPSON It does n't seem very private here , does it ? LORD TILBURY Rather not . VI TOMPSON I think . I 'll go tell mamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my nose at your title , but mamma ! Oh , my ! Butte City wo n't hold her when I tell her I 've decided to marry you , not for a minute ! and I bet you she buys a tiara before she leaves here ! Both laugh and move on to where they can see the Hungarian band . VI TOMPSON Speaking of the band . Are n't they all handsome ! But the ship 's doctor has discounted uniforms and gold braid for me ! LORD TILBURY Who recognizes KINSEY . By George ! VI TOMPSON What ? LORD TILBURY Turn around quick ! They face the other way . I 've just seen the man . VI TOMPSON What man ! I 've seen twenty dreams ! LORD TILBURY Herr Carlman ! VI TOMPSON Here ! LORD TILBURY In the band ! VI TOMPSON Goodness ! Did he see you ? p. 134 LORD TILBURY I do n't think so , but I 'm going to speak to him . VI TOMPSON Oh , do ! The band stops playing . And be awfully nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make them as happy as we are ! Find out what the trouble all is ,  --  and I 'll go tell mamma about us ! She 'll be tickled to death ! I 'll bet she has n't missed a single dance  --  she 's a wonder ! ! She goes to the ballroom . The other musicians are talking among themselves . KINSEY remains a little separate , by himself . TILBURY comes near to him . LORD TILBURY Pardon me , Mr. Carlman ! KINSEY starts and looks to see who is speaking . He sees TILBURY and is not pleased . He bows somewhat stiffly . I must speak with you a moment ; may I ? COUNT CARLOS KINSEY There vill be one minute or two between ze next number . LORD TILBURY I say , can these Johnnies understand English ? COUNT CARLOS KINSEY No , not a one , not a vord ! LORD TILBURY Very embarrassed .

She has told me how unhappy Miss Lang is to be separated from you by her friends and not to know where you are . COUNT CARLOS KINSEY It vill end , I hope , on to-morrow . LORD TILBURY Really , I say , old chap , I am glad ! He involuntarily holds out his hand , and the two men shake hands warmly . COUNT CARLOS KINSEY Moved . I tank you .

LORD TILBURY Really ! VI TOMPSON And how long do you suppose we 've been sitting there ? LORD TILBURY I du n no ! VI TOMPSON Of course you would n't ! Three hours ! LORD TILBURY Oh ! I say ! ! Laughing . VI TOMPSON Is n't it awful , perfectly awful ! ! Come on , we 're going !

WRIGHTON Smiling . Well ! They have n't lost their time ! MRS . WRIGHTON I 'm envious for Geraldine ; I wish I could see her face as happy  --  with her hand on the arm of the man she loved . MR . WRIGHTON Has she enjoyed the party ? MRS . WRIGHTON She 's tried to , but you could SEE her trying , and I think she 's relieved now that everybody 's going . I 'm so tired I do n't think I 'll give another ball as long as I live . MR . WRIGHTON I know why . She knows the answers to my letters to London and Budapesth have arrived . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper to see when the mails were in . She cornered me when I came home this afternoon and asked me point blank . p. 140 MRS . WRIGHTON And what did you say ? MR . WRIGHTON I lied ; but if I 'd told her then , she would n't have appeared , I know , to-night . MRS . WRIGHTON Oh , Dick ! it 's true then  --  the letters confirm ? MR . WRIGHTON Our worst fears ! MRS . WRIGHTON It will break her heart ! MR . WRIGHTON She refused to wait till to-morrow morning , and so we compromised on to-night , when the last guests were gone . I told her to bring Frulein - here they are now . GERALDINE enters with FRULEIN . GERALDINE is excited and forcedly happy . GERALDINE LANG There 's no one left downstairs , and I 've done my best  --  I ca n't wait any longer . You will open your letters now , wo n't you ? MR . WRIGHTON Yes , dear . GERALDINE LANG Hum ! That " dear " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to find , but you 'll not ! You 'll see ! It has been a beautiful party . To MRS . WRIGHTON . Every one said so , and looked it , which is more ! MR . WRIGHTON Takes out two long envelopes . Here are the letters . p. 141 MRS . WRIGHTON Those men wo n't hear ? Indicating band . MR . WRIGHTON None of them understand English , and besides , they will be gone soon . MRS . WRIGHTON Then let 's sit down . GERALDINE LANG You sit , and Frulein . I could n't ! I feel on tiptoe ! I must stand to meet my happiness , which is coming out of those envelopes . Those , dear . Her whole manner and expression change . Those are the ones ? MR . WRIGHTON Yes . GERALDINE LANG And they have been opened ! The first falsehood ! And she assumes an attitude and expression of defiance . MRS . WRIGHTON Geraldine , it was for your sake , to spare you through the evening . Do n't be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all striving for the same goal ,  --  your happiness ! GERALDINE LANG Taking off her long , white gloves nervously . Read the letters ! Read them ! Of course I know now they are against Mr. Carlman . MR . WRIGHTON The first letter is from our present ambassador in London , who happens to be an old friend of mine . Reads . " My secretary cabled you in brief . Count Kinsey was in the Austro-Hungarian embassy in London six years ago . He was obliged to resign his position , owing to a most painful scandal , affecting the honour of one of our countrywomen , the beautiful Miss Lorimer , GERALDINE interrupts with " Impossible ! " but WRIGHTON continues. - who died a few months after the exposure . In America he would have been lynched ! " Offering her the letters . Now you see that I was right when I called the man in your presence a liar ! p. 142 GERALDINE LANG No ! MR . WRIGHTON What ? MRS . WRIGHTON Oh ! Together . GERALDINE LANG The proof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes ! BUT there is absolutely not one word in all you 've read to prove that Mr. Carlman and Count Kinsey are the same ! In fact , in that letter I only hear proof that they are not the same ! He waits . There is no answer from GERALDINE , who stands thinking . MR . WRIGHTON You 'll not doubt Frulein Handt 's truthfulness ? He waits ; there is no answer ; he looks at MRS . WRIGHTON . MRS . WRIGHTON Geraldine ! Touching her . What is it ? Do you hear us ? GERALDINE LANG Excuse me , yes ; what were you saying ? MR . WRIGHTON Frulein Handt is here to prove to you that Count Kinsey and Herr Carlman ARE the same . GERALDINE LANG With feeling and much pathos , appealingly . No , no , Frulein , you know you ca n't ! I love him , Frulein ! p. 143 FRAULEIN HANDT Almost in tears . Ach ! it iss the most sad day of my life . But it iss true when I saw Mr. Carlman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call him Count Kinsey . He asked of me how I know him , and I have made the explanation . I was governess mit his ungle what vas ambassador in London . GERALDINE LANG But he  --  was he secretary there ? FRAULEIN HANDT Yes , he vas . GERALDINE LANG Distressed , overexcited . You 're sure ? You know you might be mistaken , Frulein  --  it might be a resemblance . Do n't you think it was  --  something like that ? FRAULEIN HANDT He said , yes , he vas der secretary , when I ask him on de boat . MR . WRIGHTON Sh ! To FRULEIN . Thank , you , Frulein . FRAULEIN HANDT To GERALDINE . You will forgif me ? You are sure I would gif the world for not to hurt you . GERALDINE LANG Yes , Frulein dear , I know ; it 's all right  --  good night . FRAULEIN HANDT Good night . She goes out . p. 144 MRS . WRIGHTON Dearest , dearest Geraldine . Goes to her . GERALDINE LANG You do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives absolutely . I am grateful for the reasons that inspire them ; but you do not prove to me that the man I love is unworthy . I believe in him still ; perhaps it is because I love him , I do n't know . What I do know is his lips spoke truthfully to my ears , though you may think his kisses have coloured his words for me . When I looked into his eyes , they looked straight back into mine , and if I saw love in them , I saw truth too  --  and they never flinched , and when I gave him my hand , he took it in a strong grasp , and his hand felt honest . Believe me , a woman has an instinct about such things ! I 'd trust his hand to lead me anywhere . The band begins to play . MR . WRIGHTON Strong . Then I must tell you the worst of all . Our consul in Budapesth has also given me the character of Count Kinsey . GERALDINE LANG Is it the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own home it is much , much worse ! Slowly , very seriously , but quietly . He has a wife and child in Budapesth ! p. 145 COUNT CARLOS KINSEY Interrupts during the speech . No ! Gott my witness ! that iss not truth ! All turn , astonished to see him . They murmur their surprise as he begins to speak . As he finishes . GERALDINE LANG Herr Carlman ! MRS . WRIGHTON Count Kinsey ! All together . MR . WRIGHTON You here ! How dare you steal into this house ! ! GERALDINE interrupts with , " Mr. Wrighton ! " You are even a lower scoundrel than I thought . GERALDINE LANG Quickly , and interrupting . Do n't ! Do n't ! Going to him . COUNT CARLOS KINSEY At the same time as GERALDINE 'S " do n't . " I am NOT one scoundrel !
