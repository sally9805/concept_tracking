LITERARY COPYRIGHT *** Produced by David Widger LITERARY COPYRIGHT By Charles Dudley Warner This is the first public meeting of the National Institute of Arts and Letters . The original members were selected by an invitation from the American Social Science Association , which acted under the power of its charter from the Congress of the United States . The members thus selected , who joined the Social Science Association , were given the alternative of organizing as an independent institute or as a branch of the Social Science Association . At the annual meeting of the Social Science Association on September 4 , 1899 , at Saratoga Springs , the members of the Institute voted to organize independently . They formally adopted the revised constitution , which had been agreed upon at the first meeting , in New York in the preceding January , and elected officers as prescribed by the constitution . The object is declared to be the advancement of art and literature , and the qualification shall be notable achievements in art or letters . The number of active members will probably be ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and associate members without limit . By the terms of agreement between the American Social Science Association and the National Institute , the members of each are ' ipso facto ' associate members of the other . It is believed that the advancement of art and literature in this country will be promoted by the organization of the producers of literature and art . This is in strict analogy with the action of other professions and of almost all the industries . No one doubts that literature and art are or should be leading interests in our civilization , and their dignity will be enhanced in the public estimation by a visible organization of their representatives , who are seriously determined upon raising the standards by which the work of writers and artists is judged . The association of persons having this common aim can not but stimulate effort , soften unworthy rivalry into generous competition , and promote enthusiasm and good fellowship in their work . The mere coming together to compare views and discuss interests and tendencies and problems which concern both the workers and the great public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In no other way so well as by association of this sort can be created the feeling of solidarity in our literature , and the recognition of its power . It is not expected to raise any standard of perfection , or in any way to hamper individual development , but a body of concentrated opinion may raise the standard by promoting healthful and helpful criticism , by discouraging mediocrity and meretricious smartness , by keeping alive the traditions of good literature , while it is hospitable to all discoverers of new worlds . A safe motto for any such society would be Tradition and Freedom  --  ' Traditio et Libertas ' . It is generally conceded that what literature in America needs at this moment is honest , competent , sound criticism . This is not likely to be attained by sporadic efforts , especially in a democracy of letters where the critics are not always superior to the criticised , where the man in front of the book is not always a better marksman than the man behind the book . It may not be attained even by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not like to use the word authority , but it is not unreasonable to suppose that the public will be influenced by a body devoted to the advancement of art and literature , whose sincerity and discernment it has learned to respect , and admission into whose ranks will , I hope , be considered a distinction to be sought for by good work . The fashion of the day is rarely the judgment of posterity . You will recall what Byron wrote to Coleridge : " I trust you do not permit yourself to be depressed by the temporary partiality of what is called ' the public ' for the favorites of the moment ; all experience is against the permanency of such impressions . You must have lived to see many of these pass away , and will survive many more . " The chief concern of the National Institute is with the production of works of art and of literature , and with their distribution . In the remarks following I shall confine myself to the production and distribution of literature . In the limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain tendencies and practices which are affecting this production and this distribution . The interests involved are , first , those of the author ; second , those of the publisher ; third , those of the public . As to all good literature , the interests of these three are identical if the relations of the three are on the proper basis . For the author , a good book is of more pecuniary value than a poor one , setting aside the question of fame ; to the publisher , the right of publishing a good book is solid capital ,  --  an established house , in the long run , makes more money on " Standards " than on " Catchpennies " ; and to the public the possession of the best literature is the breath of life , as that of the bad and mediocre is moral and intellectual decadence . But in practice the interests of the three do not harmonize . The author , even supposing his efforts are stimulated by the highest aspirations for excellence and not by any commercial instinct , is compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production ; the publisher wishes to get the utmost return for his capital and his energy ; and the public wants the best going for the least money . Consider first the author , and I mean the author , and not the mere craftsman who manufactures books for a recognized market . His sole capital is his talent . His brain may be likened to a mine , gold , silver , copper , iron , or tin , which looks like silver when new . Whatever it is , the vein of valuable ore is limited , in most cases it is slight . When it is worked out , the man is at the end of his resources . Has he expended or produced capital ? I say he has produced it , and contributed to the wealth of the world , and that he is as truly entitled to the usufruct of it as the miner who takes gold or silver out of the earth . For how long ? I will speak of that later on . The copyright of a book is not analogous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of universal necessity to the world . Nor should the greater share of this usufruct be absorbed by the manufacturer and publisher of the book . The publisher has a clear right to guard himself against risks , as he has the right of refusal to assume them . But there is an injustice somewhere , when for many a book , valued and even profitable to somebody , the author does not receive the price of a laborer 's day wages for the time spent on it  --  to say nothing of the long years of its gestation . The relation between author and publisher ought to be neither complicated nor peculiar . The author may sell his product outright , or he may sell himself by an agreement similar to that which an employee in a manufacturing establishment makes with his master to give to the establishment all his inventions . Either of these methods is fair and businesslike , though it may not be wise . A method that prevailed in the early years of this century was both fair and wise . The author agreed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a certain term , or to make and sell a certain number of copies . When those conditions were fulfilled , the control of the property reverted to the author . The continuance of these relations between the two depended , as it should depend , upon mutual advantage and mutual good-will . By the present common method the author makes over the use of his property to the will of the publisher . It is true that he parts with the use only of the property and not with the property itself , and the publisher in law acquires no other title , nor does he acquire any sort of interest in the future products of the author 's brain . But the author loses all control of his property , and its profit to him may depend upon his continuing to make over his books to the same publisher . In this continuance he is liable to the temptation to work for a market , instead of following the free impulses of his own genius . As to any special book , the publisher is the sole judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stagnation of unadvertised goods . The situation is full of complications . Theoretically it is the interest of both parties to sell as many books as possible . But the author has an interest in one book , the publisher in a hundred . And it is natural and reasonable that the man who risks his money should be the judge of the policy best for his whole establishment . I can not but think that this situation would be on a juster footing all round if the author returned to the old practice of limiting the use of his property by the publisher . I say this in full recognition of the fact that the publishers might be unwilling to make temporary investments , or to take risks . What then ? Fewer books might be published . Less vanity might be gratified . Less money might be risked in experiments upon the public , and more might be made by distributing good literature . Would the public be injured ? It is an idea already discredited that the world owes a living to everybody who thinks he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital which exploits literature as a trade acquires any special privileges . The present international copyright , which primarily concerns itself with the manufacture of books , rests upon an unintelligible protective tariff basis . It should rest primarily upon an acknowledgment of the author 's right of property in his own work , the same universal right that he has in any other personal property . The author 's international copyright should be no more hampered by restrictions and encumbrances than his national copyright . Whatever regulations the government may make for the protection of manufactures , or trade industries , or for purposes of revenue on importations , they should not be confounded with the author 's right of property . They have no business in an international copyright act , agreement , or treaty . The United States copyright for native authors contains no manufacturing restrictions . All we ask is that foreign authors shall enjoy the same privileges we have under our law , and that foreign nations shall give our authors the privileges of their local copyright laws . I do not know any American author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against foreign authors . This subject is so important that I may be permitted to enlarge upon it , in order to make clear suggestions already made , and to array again arguments more or less familiar . I do this in the view of bringing before the institute work worthy of its best efforts , which if successful will entitle this body to the gratitude and respect of the country . I refer to the speedy revision of our confused and wholly inadequate American copyright laws , and later on to a readjustment of our international relations . In the first place let me bring to your attention what is , to the vast body of authors , a subject of vital interest , which it is not too much to say has never received that treatment from authors themselves which its importance demands . I refer to the property of authors in their productions . In this brief space and time I can not enter fully upon this great subject , but must be content to offer certain suggestions for your consideration . The property of an author in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute and unlimited as his property in the product of his physical labor . It seems to me idle to say that the two kinds of labor products are so dissimilar that the ownership can not be protected by like laws . In this age of enlightenment such a proposition is absurd . The history of copyright law seems to show that the treatment of property in brain product has been based on this erroneous idea . To steal the paper on which an author has put his brain work into visible , tangible form is in all lands a crime , larceny , but to steal the brain work is not a crime . The utmost extent to which our enlightened American legislators , at almost the end of the nineteenth century , have gone in protecting products of the brain has been to give the author power to sue in civil courts , at large expense , the offender who has taken and sold his property . And what gross absurdity is the copyright law which limits even this poor defense of author 's property to a brief term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his children and heirs have no defense , no recognized property whatever in his products . And for some inexplicable reason this term of years in which he may be said to own his property is divided into two terms , so that at the end of the first he is compelled to re-assert his ownership by renewing his copyright , or he must lose all ownership at the end of the short term . It is manifest to all honest minds that if an author is entitled to own his work for a term of years , it is equally the duty of his government to make that ownership perpetual . He can own and protect and leave to his children and his children 's children by will the manuscript paper on which he has written , and he should have equal right to leave to them that mental product which constitutes the true money value of his labor . It is unnecessary to say that the mental product is always as easy to be identified as the physical product . Its identification is absolutely certain to the intelligence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of assignees , who are commonly publishers , are equal with those of authors , in making absolute and perpetual this property in which both are dealers . Another consideration follows here . Why should the ownership of a bushel of wheat , a piece of silk goods , a watch , or a handkerchief in the possession of an American carried or sent to England , or brought thence to this country , be absolute and unlimited , while the ownership of his own products as an author or as a purchaser from an author is made dependent on his nationality ? Why should the property of the manufacturer of cloths , carpets , satins , and any and every description of goods , be able to send his products all over the world , subject only to the tariff laws of the various countries , while the author ( alone of all known producers ) is forbidden to do so ? The existing law of our country says to the foreign author , " You can have property in your book only if you manufacture it into salable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wisdom or wild folly of a law which sought to protect other American industries by forbidding the importation of all foreign manufactures ? No question of tariff protection is here involved . What duty shall be imposed upon foreign products or foreign manufactures is a question of political economy . The wrong against which authors should protest is in annexing to their terms of ownership of their property a protective tariff revision . For , be it observed , this is a subject of abstract justice , moral right , and it matters nothing whether the author be American , English , German , French , Hindoo , or Chinese ,  --  and it is very certain that when America shall enact a simple , just , copyright law , giving to every human being the same protection of law to his property in his mental products as in the work of his hands , every civilized nation on earth will follow the noble example . As it now stands , authors who annually produce the raw material for manufacturing purposes to an amount in value of millions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals and exceeds in commercial value many of the great staple products of our fields , are the only producers who have no distinct property in their products , who are not protected in holding on to the feeble tenure the law gives them , and whose quasi-property in their works , flimsy as it is , is limited to a few years , and can not with certainty be handed down to their children . It will be said , it is said , that it is impossible for the author to obtain an acknowledgment of absolute right of property in his brain work . In our civilization we have not yet arrived at this state of justice . It may be so . Indeed some authors have declared that this justice would be against public policy . I trust they are sustained by the lofty thought that in this view they are rising above the petty realm of literature into the broad field of statesmanship . But I think there will be a general agreement that in the needed revisal of our local copyright law we can attain some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be removed . There is no reason why an author should pay for the privilege of a long life by the loss of his copyrights , and that his old age should be embittered by poverty because he can not have the results of the labor of his vigorous years . There is no reason why if he dies young he should leave those dependent on him without support , for the public has really no more right to appropriate his book than it would have to take his house from his widow and children . His income at best is small after he has divided with the publishers . No , there can certainly be no valid argument against extending the copyright of the author to his own lifetime , with the addition of forty or fifty years for the benefit of his heirs . I will not leave this portion of the topic without saying that a perfectly harmonious relation between authors and publishers is most earnestly to be desired , nor without the frank acknowledgment that , in literary tradition and in the present experience , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful relations have subsisted , as they ought always to subsist , between the producers and the distributors of literature , especially when the publisher has a love for literature , and the author is a reasonable being and takes pains to inform himself about the publishing business . One aspect of the publishing business which has become increasingly prominent during the last fifteen years can not be overlooked , for it is certain to affect seriously the production of literature as to quality , and its distribution . Capital has discovered that literature is a product out of which money can be made , in the same way that it can be made in cotton , wheat , or iron . Never before in history has so much money been invested in publishing , with the single purpose of creating and supplying the market with manufactured goods . Never before has there been such an appeal to the reading public , or such a study of its tastes , or supposed tastes , wants , likes and dislikes , coupled also with the same shrewd anxiety to ascertain a future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in millinery and dressmaking . Not only the contents of the books and periodicals , but the covers , must be made to catch the fleeting fancy . Will the public next season wear its hose dotted or striped ? Another branch of this activity is the so-called syndicating of the author 's products in the control of one salesman , in which good work and inferior work are coupled together at a common selling price and in common notoriety . This insures a wider distribution , but what is its effect upon the quality of literature ? Is it your observation that the writer for a syndicate , on solicitation for a price or an order for a certain kind of work , produces as good quality as when he works independently , uninfluenced by the spirit of commercialism ? The question is a serious one for the future of literature . The consolidation of capital in great publishing establishments has its advantages and its disadvantages . It increases vastly the yearly output of books . The presses must be kept running , printers , papermakers , and machinists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fed . The capital must earn its money . One advantage of this is that when new and usable material is not forthcoming , the " standards " and the best literature must be reproduced in countless editions , and the best literature is broadcast over the world at prices to suit all purses , even the leanest . The disadvantage is that products , in the eagerness of competition for a market , are accepted which are of a character to harm and not help the development of the contemporary mind in moral and intellectual strength . The public expresses its fear of this in the phrase it has invented  --  " the spawn of the press . " The author who writes simply to supply this press , and in constant view of a market , is certain to deteriorate in his quality , nay more , as a beginner he is satisfied if he can produce something that will sell without regard to its quality . Is it extravagant to speak of a tendency to make the author merely an adjunct of the publishing house ? Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the late Spanish-American war . How many of them were ordered to meet a supposed market , and how many of them were the spontaneous and natural productions of writers who had something to say ? I am not quarreling , you see , with the newspapers who do this sort of thing ; I am speaking of the tendency of what we have been accustomed to call literature to take on the transient and hasty character of the newspaper . In another respect , in method if not in quality , this literature approaches the newspaper . It is the habit of some publishing houses , not of all , let me distinctly say , to seek always notoriety , not to nurse and keep before the public mind the best that has been evolved from time to time , but to offer always something new . The year 's flooring is threshed off and the floor swept to make room for a fresh batch . Effort eventually ceases for the old and approved , and is concentrated on experiments . This is like the conduct of a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . I speak of this freely because I think it as bad policy for the publisher as it is harmful to the public of readers . The same effort used to introduce a novelty will be much better remunerated by pushing the sale of an acknowledged good piece of literature . Literature depends , like every other product bought by the people , upon advertising , and it needs much effort usually to arrest the attention of our hurrying public upon what it would most enjoy if it were brought to its knowledge . It would not be easy to fix the limit in this vast country to the circulation of a good book if it were properly kept before the public . Day by day , year by year , new readers are coming forward with curiosity and intellectual wants . The generation that now is should not be deprived of the best in the last generation . Nay more , one publication , in any form , reaches only a comparatively small portion of the public that would be interested in it . A novel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine ; it may then appear in a book ; it may reach other readers serially again in the columns of a newspaper ; it may be offered again in all the by-ways by subscription , and yet not nearly exhaust its legitimate running power . This is not a supposition but a fact proved by trial . Nor is it to be wondered at , when we consider that we have an unequaled homogeneous population with a similar common-school education . In looking over publishers ' lists I am constantly coming across good books out of print , which are practically unknown to this generation , and yet are more profitable , truer to life and character , more entertaining and amusing , than most of those fresh from the press month by month . Of the effect upon the literary product of writing to order , in obedience to a merely commercial instinct , I need not enlarge to a company of authors , any more than to a company of artists I need to enlarge upon the effect of a like commercial instinct upon art . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , in relation to the literature and art of the world , can not be accurately judged by contemporaries and participants , nor can it be predicted . But I have great expectations of the product of both in this country , and I am sure that both will be affected by the conduct of persons now living . It is for this reason that I have spoken .
