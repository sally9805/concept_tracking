txt A DISCOURAGED MOTHER . Thinks Boys Had Better Not Try to Work Their Way Through College . Permit me , a mother who has helped her son to " work his way " to say a word . Unless a boy is physically and mentally very strong he would better not attempt to work his way through college . The struggle is too great . One of these colleges that promises so much " aid to students " did give my son a few days ' employment , and he waited three months for his pay . The boy , an all-around good boy , neither precocious nor dull , even with what assistance a working mother could give him , worked beyond what his health could stand . What these colleges do for the " brilliant ones " I ca n't say . It 's my opinion if certain of them paid more attention to building up the boys and less to " showy " dormitories , ( which a poor boy can not afford to enter , ) and other buildings it would be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sit Together Except on Men 's Side . Permit me to say a few words regarding some of the park benches that are reserved for women and children . While passing through Union Square Park this morning I saw a little family group of four occupying one of these benches , and a policeman informing the husband and father that he was violating one of the rules -- that he would have to sit apart from his wife and children . In order not to be separated , however , the party changed their seats , the woman sitting on the benches occupied by the horrid men , there being , happily , no rule against that . Now is this not a travesty on city government and the height of absurdity ? What is the motive of such folly , and who is responsible for this ruling ? Any enlightenment on this subject will be truly appreciated by one who wishes always to be A LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN .
