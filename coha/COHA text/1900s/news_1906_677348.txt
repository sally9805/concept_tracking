txt Refuses to Believe in B.R.T. Kindly record my protest against your editorial entitled " The Killing Policy . " Evidently the able writer of those sentiments is a happy and contented resident of Montclair , Orange , or some other pretty hamlet in Jersey , and knows nothing at all of conditions in Brooklyn . It would make a horse laugh to read the serious announcement that the Brooklyn Rapid Transit would abandon all plans of Improvement and extension it has intended to bless the borough with . For fifteen years that company has kept on promising these betterments , and the service has gone from bad to worse . At last we seem to have a man willing to do something for the suffering public , and presto ! here is the best and most sensible paper of this city assailing him . Are the interests of the holders of large blocks of watered stocks really more sacred to you than the welfare of an abused public ? I will not believe it , and confidently expect a fine editorial of recantation in your columns shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public officer , Borough President Coler.
