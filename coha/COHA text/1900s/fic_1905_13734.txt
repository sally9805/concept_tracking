GIRL Well I gues not . He would n't understand . I never told any one but you . I just told him that I did n't have  --  any  --  and that I did not want to get one .

GIRL Well send for the police  --  send for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I would just about as soon to jail as anything else . There does n't seem anything much for a woman to do in this world anyway but marry somebody or go to the devil or teach school ( Seriously ) If I were educated right I would teach school . p. 13 CURTIS Why not get married ? GIRL Because nobody has wanted me that I wanted . The very best I could do would be some old bald headed floor walker and that 's not my sort . I see some of my sort sometimes buying furnishings for evening clothes . ( which a little air ) My father was a thoroughbred . CURTIS Indeed ? GIRL I ca n't remeber him but mother said he was . I always like to imagine he is still alive  --  and wondering how it would be . I 'm always pretending he 's looking out for me  --  taking an interest and all that Sometimes I pretend we live in a mal house  --  that we are sitting before a fire  --  him in a big chair and me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on my head , smoothin along my hair .  --  I saw a picture like that once  --  It was called " His only Daughter " or something like that . We had a big sale of em last Christmas . I do nt know but I always kind of pictured him looking something like you  --  just something on the same style you know CURTIS ( smiling ) Indeed ? Well you rea pretty wise little girl after all , are n't you ? Martin should be here Do n't you want to send any word to any one ( hesitating as though a little affected by her talk ) Have n't you  --  any mother ? p. 14 GIRL No  --  she died a long time ago and I gess my father 's dead all right too though I do n't know . Mama would never let me talk about him . She would ask me if I loved her just to kiss her and not ask silly questions . So I would . You just could n't help loving her and doing as she said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands were so little . You just could n't help loving her . CURTIS Indeed ? GIRL No- and that 's all she wanted . She used to tell me sometimes ( speaks with a slight accent ) Now do n't you grow up and he serious mignon , it would kill me . All that a woman is for is just to be pretty and to be loved "  --  ( In her own voice ) She talked that way  --  kind of foreign . CURTIS ( as though to himself repreaing after her with the same accent ) Loved . ( Stares at the girl . Gets up and comes near to her looks into her face  --  goes to desk and opens small drawer at right hand . ) GIRL ( Watching him uneasily ) Aw  --  You 've already sent for the police . CURTIS ( unheeding her takesout picture which he holds in his hand and gazes at  --  speaking as though in reverie ) My little girl , my little girl . p. 15 GIRL ( puzzled and then drawing back- speaking scornfully ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 're all alike I thought no one but drummers wanted a six dollar a week girl . You just caught a thief  --  nothing worse . ( Turns and walks away ) I wish the police would come  --  I 'd feel safer . ( Turns again and looks at him - speaks bitingly ) Or maybe you only want to be a father to me ! CURTIS ( hands her the picture ) Do nt you remember her ? GIRL ( She goes to him slowly half refusing to take it . Takes it without looking at it and backs away from him holding it to her and looking at him . Then she glances casually at the picture and speaks in an awed half whisper looking at him ) That 's my mother . ( She draws the picture to her again quickly as though protecting it from him . Then her arms fall to her side and she speaks to him with surprise  - -  shninking a little at first ) Then you 're  --  my  --  CURTIS Father . GIRL ( She still shrinks . Then realizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means she throws out her hand in a little gesture of appeal ) Oh I 'm  --  so - so  --  p. 16 CURTIS ( With a quizzioal half smile ) Happy ? GIRL ( Intending to have said sorry , at the word happy she bursts into wild sobbing which gradually quiets as MARTIN ENTERS R. MARTIN You wanted me , did n't you ? ( seeing the girl there crying ) Has this girl been  --  ( starts toward her ) CURTIS ( authoritavely putting out his hand ) Hold on there . ( weakly ) Oh  --  this  --  young lady is - in the mens furnishing , is n't she ? GIRL ( looking up  --  sidles over and whsspers to Curt smiling through her tears )
