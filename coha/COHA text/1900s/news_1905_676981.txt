txt The committee appointed by the labor unions obtained an interview with President Roosevelt late this afternoon and came away with a rebuke for the way in which it referred to the United States Army In its protest and with a declaration from the President that Mayor Dunne and other authorities would be upheld in every attempt to suppress mob violence and maintain law and order . President Roosevelt , after a busy twelve hours in the city , left at 12:10 o'clock tonight over the Pennsylvania line for Washington . The labor unions ' committee was sent to lodge a protest against the employment of the Federal troo-e for which , the unionists alleged , it was the plan of the employers to ask . The members of the committee were Cornelius P. Shea , President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ; Charles Dold , President of the Chicago Federation of Labor ; Joseph O'Neil , Vice ' President of the Chicago Federation Of Labor ; T. P. Quinn , a member of the Canvassers ' Union . and T. Rickert , President of the Garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Secretary Loeb were the only persons at the conference . The account of what passed was given out by Secretary Loeb : Mr. Shea , acting as spokesman , said ; " We are here as a committee to present to YOU a statement of our position in this controversy between the Employers ' Association and the Teamsters ' Association . We have understood that they had asked your aid for bringing Federal troops to Chicago . " The President took the petition , read it , and said : " I have read the petition , the conclusion of which is a request for a hearing before any action be taken by the President relating to the Chicago strike situation . As yet no suggestion of any kind has come to me from any source that I should take any action . Of the merits of the case I am wholly ignorant , I have no knowledge of what the situation is or of what steps should properly be taken to end it . I feel , however , that in view of one statement , or series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : Rebukes Attack on Army . " I regret that you should in the letter have spoken at all of the use of the Federal army , as you have there spoken . No request has been made to me for action by the Federal Government , but at the same time , Mr. Shea , as you have in this communication brought up that matter , I want to say one thing with all the emphasis in my power . In upholding the law and order , in doing what he is able to do to suppress mob violence in any shape or I way , the Mayor of Chicago , Mayor Dunne , has my hearty support . I am glad to be able to say this to you , gentlemen , before I say It to another body . " Now , let me repeat that I know nothing of the facts of the situation . I know nothing of the right or wrong of the points at teem . What I have to say is based partly upon what I regard as the unfortunate phrasing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " E have not been called upon to interfere in any way , but you must not misunderstand my attitude . In every effort of Mayor Dunne to prevent violence by mobs or individuals , to see that the laws are obeyed , and that order is preserved he has the hearty support of the President of the United States , and , In my judgment , he should have that of every good citizen of the United States . Now , gentlemen , it has been a great pleasure to see you , and I am glad to have bad the chance to say this to you . " Mr. Quinn , who knew the President in his youth , said : " Mr. President , what prompted us to come to you with this statement is that for the last two or three weeks there has been a continual howl for the Federal Army . I have known you long enough to know that you would not respond to a one sided demand  --  that you will not respond until you have thoroughly investigated the case . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Quinn , as yet the Mayor of Chicago has not made any appeal to the Governor , and therefore , of course , the Governor has made none to me ; and , as yet , nothing in the situation has demanded action by me . " Mr. Shea . again said : " Let me explain that the Governor has been requested by a committee of the employers to demand Federal troops ; the statement has been made in the papers . I immediately telegraphed Gov . Deneen that we would allow him to appoint a commission . Regardless of that , I want to make our position known to you in regard to mob violence . I believe that we are skilled workmen enough in our partICular craft to demonstrate to our business men of Chicago that it is to their interest to employ us . " Violence does not meet with the sympathy of our organization . I simply want to say that we want to be fair , to preserve the business Interests of Chicago , realizing that the prosperity of our employers is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unions . " Mr. Shea , I can only repeat what I have said . I am a believer in unions . I am an honorary member of one union .. But the uniownust obey the law just as the corporation must obey the law ; just as every man , rich or poor , must obey the law . As yet , no action has been called for by me and most certainly if action is called for I shall try to do justice under -- -the law to every man , so far as ? I have power . But the first essential is ' - the Pfebervatien of law and - order ; the sup . PretsiOn of violence ? by n ohs ' individuals . " ' This closed the interview and the comMittee withdrew . The unions ' protest declared that the difficulty began as a lock-out , and " so far as there has been any striking done . it has been a strike for arbitration . " Parts of the petition follow : " Arbitration has been repeatedly spurned by the employers in the presence of Mayor Dunne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ready Tool . " ? ' Because they openly boast that they can spurn it . and that the troops under Your command will shoot down him who dares to openly protest against their action . They flatter themselves that the Federal army is their ready tool to act upon their suggestion  --  right or wrong ? and they therefore refuse to have any inquiry made as to whether they are right or wrong . " Can a few soldiers scare the men who make armies and who compose the flower Of American manhood ? Are we serfs that we cringe at the mention of troops ? If the laboring men are wrong the decision of an arbitrator without cannon or club will command the obedience of every toiler affected . Even if we are right and the arbitrator decide against us , still we will bow to that decision .. " Every laboring man knows these facts . What will be the results upon the citizenship of this country if , when American citizens ask for court procedure and order they are met by the bullet and the jail ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case ? We submit that labor is an essential of National life . And the sympathy and co-operation of the laborers in their life work is as essential as is the sympathy and co-operation of citizenship . Unionism can no more be destroyed to industrial life than can patriotism in political life . " Treasury Department 's Caution . The Treasury Department in Washington to-day received a telegram from the Woolmerger Company of Milwaukee , which has the contract for furniture for the Federal offices in Chicago , asking that military wagons be sent to deliver furniture to the Government Building in Chicago . Assistant Secretary Taylor replied that if the company would notify the Teamsters ' Union in Chicago that it was about to deliver Government goods ' he did not expect there would be any trouble . At the luncheon given by the Merchants ' Club this afternoon Mayor Dunne told the President that the most alarming stage of the strike had passed and that the police had control of the situation . George S. Pierce . a striking teamster , was killed to-night by George T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Striker Shot by Deputy . Waldorn formerly was a member of the Teamsters ' Union , and Pierce taunted him with his change in employment . Waldorn drew a revolver and fired one shot , the bullet striking Pierce just above the heart . Waldorn was arrested . Notwithstanding the tacit agreement that there was to be no violence while President Roosevelt was in the city , there were numerous outbreaks . one taking place in Michigan Avenue a short time after the President had passed the spot . One negro was shot in the leg and two cut about the face and hands . In a riot this afternoon on Twenty-sec- I and Place . Edward ' Wright . a strike sympathizer , was shot in the groin by a nonunion teamster , who was driving a United States Express Company wagon . The crowd rushed toward the express wagon , but the police guards repelled the attack . The employers sent out more wagons to-day with fewer guards than at any previous time . To-night it was said that fully 2.000 men were ready to take charge of wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
