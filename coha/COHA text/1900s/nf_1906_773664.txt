txt // such as the village , town , city , or state in which he lives . Even the sun , the intermittent light from which causes day and night , with their corresponding alternate sleeping and waking , working and resting , though so far away , is a part of man 's environment . We have referred in Part I to the blood and lymph as the environment of the cells of the body , and such they are ; but this internal environment ( of the cells ) need not be confounded with the external environment ( of the body ) . This latter may be concisely defined as everything outside ourselves . A close relation always exists between the body and its environment , by which the former is , so to speak , in harmony with or adapted to the latter . Just as the ship is adapted to the sea ; the punt , the shell , and the canoe to quiet waters ; the bicycle to good roads , ? so also man 's body reaches its best development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the poles , but in the more temperate zones to which it appears to be better adapted . A perfectly healthy organism might , perhaps , be defined as one perfect in construction or constitution , and perfectly adapted to its environment . 7 . Man and His Environment . ? Man is absolutely dependent on a favorable environment . IIe can not , like a fish , live long in the sea ; or , like a bird , in the air . IIe can not even make his way to the poles of the earth ; and at an elevation of six or seven miles in a balloon or on a mountain he perishes . Fire quickly destroys , and molten iron or boiling water quickly kills him . A constant temperature of even 100 ? F. causes him great discomfort , if not danger . Intense light is painful to him , intense noise disagreeable . The same thing is more or less true of other animals . They flee from fire , shudder or cry at great noises , are often dazzled by intense light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and activities , man may , to a great // extent , choose or control his immediate environment , ? a power which he shares with many other animals . The beaver and the muskrat build rough shelters or houses , many birds build nests , foxes dig burrows , and some birds and other animals migrate from one environment to another . Man also seeks or makes for himself the shelter of caves , huts , wigwams , houses , or hotels . These he heats if cold , or cools if hot . He lights them by windows by clay , and by artificial light by night . He provides for himself , instead of the ground , couches to lie upon , chairs to sit upon , and tables upon which to place his food . All this is a kind of artificial adaptation of the environment to man , and , if wisely done , is an important aid to health , since it tends to secure for the body that favorable environment which is one of the greatest factors of health . Man can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they should be , or at least more nearly what they should be . Fires are used in winter , shades and fans in summer ; ventilation replaces bad air with good air ; by proper drainage , filth and dampness are avoided ; by artificial lighting , darkness is done away with ; by cultivating the soil and by raising cereals and cattle , the food supply is maintained . Thus in many ways the environment is controlled and healthful conditions are promoted or maintained . Failing all else , man may travel for a while and find benefit in temporary change ; or , like thousands arriving in America , may abandon one environment and emigrate to another . 8 . Scope and Subdivisions of Hygiene and Sanitation . ? The considerations dwelt upon in the foregoing pages indicate the scope and possibilities of the science of hygiene . Given the constitution of any individual as it is at any one time , we must seek to maintain or place that constitution in a condition of health , or efficient working order , in two ways : first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // itself , including the proper direction of its activities ; and second , by providing for it favorable surroundings or environment . The former we call hygiene , the latter sanitation . Each of these efforts reacts on the constitution ; improper operation of the muscles in muscular work , or improper use of the nervous system in mental work , may " undermine " a strong constitution and lower its vital resistance ; similarly , a bad climate , a neglect of the ventilation of living and sleeping rooms , the use of polluted water or milk or other food , exposure to the contagion of disease or to excessive cold without proper clothing , ? all such failures to provide a proper environment may injuriously affect the constitution or structure of the body . It is impossible to draw any sharp line between the care , management , and operation of the body mechanism , and the care and control of the environment , and it is neither necessary nor desirable to do so ; but we shall begin our detailed study with those things which concern chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , ? such , for example , as the proper direction of muscular and nervous activity ; alimentation or right feeding ; the use and abuse of stimulants , narcotics , and other drugs ; bathing , clothing , the care of the eyes and ears , etc . These matters which concern chiefly the individual or the person constitute that part of our subject known as personal hygiene . We shall then proceed to consider those matters of health which concern not only individuals but communities of individuals , such as families , cities , states , and nations , ? for example , the site , ventilation , heating , and plumbing of the dwelling house ; the control of food supplies , as to their purity ; public supplies of water and milk ; sewage disposal ; the infectious and . contagious diseases . All these things require the cooperation of many individuals , either as families , or as citizens of an entire town , city , or nation . Hence they are classed under domestic hygiene and // sanitation and public hygiene and sanitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapters XXVI and XXX . It should be understood that the following statements on the hygienic conduct of individual and social life are not equally applicable to all who read them . For one , those on muscular exercise are more important than those on nervous strain ; for another , those on domestic hygiene are more important than those on the hygiene of the person . No attempt has been made to indicate the relative importance of any part of the subject , either by the order in which it is treated or by the amount of space devoted to it . The application must be made by each reader for himself , with strict reference to himself and to the conditions of his own life and environment . The principal desire and aim of the authors is to persuade every one who reads this book , not merely to study and to know himself as a physical mechanism with the same earnestness and thoroughness with which he would study a valuable watch , a bicycle , a yacht , or an automobile , but also to use that mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? to the end that life may he longer , more useful , and more enjoyable . PERSONAL HYGIENE CHAPTER XVII MUSCULAR ACTIVITY A. THE MINISTRY OF MUSCULAr ACTIVITY TO THE BODY AS A WHOLE It is sufficiently obvious that it is through muscular activity that we do many necessary , useful , or otherwise desirable things ; and it is also a matter of common experience that muscular activity is required in order to build up strong muscles . A very considerable amount of it is required in order that the laborer may do his work , and a similar amount is necessary in order that one may become an athlete . But the effects of muscular activity on the body as a whole are not so obvious ; while a large number of people think that it is a good thing " and a smaller number are convinced that it is absolutely necessary to the best of health , yet we not infrequently hear men and women seriously question the latter proposition and even venture to doubt the truth of the former . Now there is nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to healthy living . The effects of a sedentary life may not show themselves at once , but almost without exception they will assert themselves in the end . Muscular work , in other words , not only enables us to influence our surroundings , not only builds up strong muscles , but in other and equally important though unseen ways ministers to the health of the 304 // body as a whole . It is the purpose of this section to present this , the most important hygienic side of our subject , by describing some of the physiological effects which muscular activity produces in the body , and the hygienic value of each of these effects . 1 . The Present Use of the Term " " Muscular Activity . " ? In the present chapter the term " muscular activity " is used in a somewhat general sense , and without attempting to set sharp limitations upon it . Strictly speaking , of course , muscular activity would include all work done by the muscles of the body , and this is of various kinds . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ; the heart works on , the breath comes and goes through orderly muscular contractions ; sitting and standing , speech , gestures , mastication , ? all these things involve muscular activity , and do , as a matter of fact , contribute something to the maintenance of the healthful conditions of the body . It is not improbable that they are the physical salvation of thousands of people leading sedentary lives . At the other extreme are those who perform severe manual labor , or who engage in vigorous exercises or purposely cultivate exceptional physical strength . We are not , however , directly concerned at present with either of these extremes , nor with those forms of muscular activity so common to-day in workshops where , hour after hour , the workman performs the same task over and over again . We are rather concerned with those forms of muscular work which are seen in a lumber camp or on the farm ; which present the characteristic of variety and involve the use of the musculature of the body as a whole ; in short , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race has supported itself in its daily life . Such things as brisk walking , running , rowing , woodchopping , swimming , tennis playing , would thus be placed // in the same class , since they involve a use of the muscles similar to those which we have mentioned . 2 . The Physiological Effects of Muscular Activity and their Hygienic Value. ? We may now turn to the hygienic value of the more important physiological effects of these general muscular activities , leaving for subsequent consideration exercises designed for special purposes , such as much of our gymnasium work . ( a ) The physical and chemical changes in the working organ are greater than those accompanying any other bodily activity . The output of carbon dioxide by the body per minute is increased at once from three- to tenfold with what would be termed moderate or vigorous exertion , while digestion seldom increases it more than one fifth , and mental work shows practically no effect upon it . Large quantities of heat are likewise liberated and the temperature of the muscle rises several degrees . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects upon the body as a whole are to be traced to them as the primary cause . ( b ) As the result of these changes in the muscles new physical and chemical conditions are introduced into the blood and lymph . The excess of carbon dioxide is entirely excreted by the lungs , so that the blood carried to the other organs by the arteries shows no increase in this substance ; but other waste products ( such as salts of sarcolactic acid ) , whose elimination requires the cooperation of other organs than the lungs , are found in the arterial blood in larger quantities than during rest . The chemical and physical characteristics of the immediate environment of every cell of the body is thus changed , and profoundly changed . Let us now consider the reaction of other organs to these changes in the muscles and in the blood and lymph . ( c ) Some of the most striking effects of muscular work are those which are connected with the heat-regulating mechanism . // The large liberation of heat by the working muscle necessitates active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant temperature . The small arteries of the skin dilate , while those of internal organs constrict , perspiration is secreted , and all these processes are carried out in a coordinated manner . The nervous mechanism of heat regulation is given a new form of activity , and thus receives valuable training in adjusting itself to the changing conditions with which it has to cope in daily life . ( d ) Closely connected with the foregoing is the ( temporary ) relief afforded to any congestion of blood in the internal organs . Sedentary occupations usually involve more or less overfilling of the blood vessels of the stomach and intestine , the pancreas , the liver , the spleen , and the kidneys ; they also involve the absence of those movements of the trunk whose pumping action affords a marked assistance to the flow of blood through the abdominal organs ( p. 147 ) . The congestion thus caused is not a good thing ; it almost certainly renders the organs concerned more liable to inflammatory processes ( see Chapter XXI ) , and , if there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 381 ) , it aggravates that tendency . Popular experience has long associated with health a good color of the skin ; and , while it is not safe to make such an inference in all cases , pallor very frequently means internal congestion , unhealthy digestive functions , and greater liability to cold in the head or the chest . ( e ) Muscular activity is the only thing which can be depended upon to increase the work of the heart . While this fact makes caution and moderation necessary for persons having certain forms of heart disease , yet for the vast majority of people it is of the greatest hygienic importance to accustom the heart to reasonably hard work . Only in this way does it receive the training necessary for its proper development and for the maintenance of its strength . // Emergencies will arise when the heart is called upon for severe effort , brief or prolonged . The familiar example of the sudden " sprint " for a car is a case in point ; and there are times , as in pneumonia , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heart . In too many such cases , if the patient escapes the fatal issue , it is only with a permanently weakened heart . It is important not only that the heart should be kept ready for emergencies but also that it be kept in condition for vigorous work as a regular duty of daily life . One of the worst of " vicious circles , " as physicians call them , is the acquirement of a weakened heart by abstention from 0 proper muscular exertion , and , as a consequence of this weakened heart , increasing disinclination to exertion of any kind whatever . The failure to take proper exercise leads to deterioration in strength and endurance on the part of the heart ; and this cardiac deterioration , with the resulting discomfort of breathlessness , leads in turn to abstention from muscular activity . ( f ) Muscular exercise is the one agent which increases the depth and frequency of the respiratory movements . The hygienic importance of this does not lie in the better oxidation of wastes , since , so far as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem that the processes of respiration during sedentary life more than supply the existing demands of the tissues for oxygen . The increased respiration is rather of importance because of the secondary effects of the respiratory movements in promoting the flow of blood , and especially the flow of lymph ( see p. 147 ) . It is probable that the " freshening effects " of muscular exercise are to a very large extent attributable to the improved lymph circulation in the tissues , and this effect , it will be remembered , is felt in the immediate environment of almost every cell in the body . The suction action of inspiration quickens the lymph flow from all organs // outside the thorax ( p. 173 ) , . and the increased pumping action of the respiratory movements themselves aids the lymph flow from the lungs and other organs within the thorax . Waste products are more completely removed from the lymph spaces surrounding all cells , and thus one of the most important of fatigue conditions is relieved ( see p. 59 ) . Where lymphatics are subject to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extension of joints , the suction action of the respiratory movements is reenforced . This pumping action especially affects the lymphatics ? of the arms and legs , and those of the abdominal cavity ( through the action of the diaphragm and the trunk movements ) . The increased respiratory movements also contribute to greater mobility of the ribs and to the better ventilation of the lungs . During vigorous exercise all lobes of the lungs are used , and the dangers attendant upon disuse of the apical lobes ( p. 172 ) are largely obviated. ( g ) Moderate exercise exerts a favorable effect upon time digestive organs , although the precise action involved is very complicated . Here also it improves the lymph flow , thus promoting absorption and producing better conditions in all digestive glands and in the muscular apparatus of the digestive tract ; it prevents continued congestion and the unfavorable attendant conditions . It is probably also a direct stimulus to peristalsis , for unquestionably the exercises which involve movements of the trunk often prove a peculiarly efficient remedy for constipation . The above summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of muscular exercise upon the organism , but it will suffice to show how essential an element such exercise is in the life of the body . The training of the heat-regulating mechanism , the training of the heart , the improved lymphatic environment of every cell resulting // from increased breathing movements and from the pumping action of mechanical motion , the relief of internal congestions and the favorable influence upon digestive functions , ? all these things are fundamental to healthful cell life . 3 . Muscular Activity a Necessity for All . ? We often hear of men and women who live to old age and do large amounts of mental work with seemingly little or no muscular activity ; and it is sometimes suggested that the experience of these people proves that exercise is unnecessary . There are also on record a few cases of men who can drink large quantities of whisky without getting drunk ; but it will not be contended that most men can do likewise . As to any line of right hygienic conduct there are some among the hundreds of millions inhabiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are not to be taken as safe guides . The cases are very few indeed where abstinence from muscular activity persisted in as the rule of life is without disastrous results ; the bad effects do not always come in a day or a week or a year , but sooner or later they almost invariably show themselves . We must never fail to distinguish carefully between the immediate and remote effects of any line of conduct ; and nowhere is this caution more needed than in observing the effects of a sedentary life , the evil results of which , though sometimes long postponed , usually appear sooner or later . Some muscular exercise is a hygienic necessity for every period of life ; it belongs to no one age . Youth is the time when athletic sports , games , and all kinds of activity are most agreeable , most necessary , and most enthusiastically pursued . In old age the changes which take place in the arterial walls necessitate caution as to severe exertion . But these are only the extremes . Rarely indeed do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk of several miles a day , at a rate of three or four miles an hour ; and it can not be too strongly insisted that the // inability to do this with enjoyment and profit is in almost every case because the habit of taking exercise is not kept up . The heart is not as strong as it once was ; the connective-tissue elements of the muscles , the ligaments , etc. , become sore upon taking exercise , not because of any inevitable " old-age change , " but because the ability to do the work easily has not been maintained by constant practice . It would be amusing , if it were not sad , to see how the average adult American will try almost everything which holds out the slightest promise of maintaining some sort of health rather than take muscular exercise , ? alcoholic drinks ( to dilate cutaneous vessels ) , Turkish baths , massage , patent medicines , ? anything rather than a horseback or bicycle ride , or a brisk walk , or some other simple and perfect remedy which stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when these exercises are first tried after years of sedentary life , they will be enjoyed ; and too often the man or woman , instead of persisting patiently , draws the conclusion that the time for such things has gone and only resignation to old age is in order . When young men and women begin life , it should be with a clear conception of the danger of falling into habits of muscular inactivity , and with a conscious and strong determination to avoid this danger . 4 . The Conservation of the Enjoyment of Muscular Activity . ? Muscular activity is so necessary for health , for the enjoyment of life , and for usefulness , that the ability to take it should be conserved at all costs . We should not only keep " in practice " by making it as much a daily habit as eating or sleeping , but we should also avoid those unfavorable conditions which interfere with our enjoyment of it . Some will not walk a step more than necessary because , by the use of improper shoes , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body ; sometimes a sunstroke , following incautious exposure to // the hot sun , leaves the heat-regulating mechanism so injured that muscular exertion except in cool weather becomes unsafe or even dangerous ; exposure to dampness often brings rheumatism , an almost insuperable barrier to pleasurable movement of any kind ; some infectious diseases leave their trace in the form of an incurable organic weakness which makes muscular activity inadvisable . These things should , of course , be avoided for their own sake ; they should be avoided also because of their serious indirect effects on health . 5 . General Character of the Most Useful Exercises . ? To specify the exact forms or amounts of muscular exercise advisable would take us beyond the scope of the present work . Here as elsewhere the student must work out his own salvation . In the following chapters we shall discuss , as far as possible , the characteristics of some special exercises ; for the present a few general suggestions may prove useful . The muscular activity which formed part of the life of our ancestors may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard ; only exceptionally did it involve extreme endurance or great muscular strain . Our ancestors were not , as a rule , given to " tugs of war , " or to putting up heavy dumbbells , or to making inordinately long runs , or to " giant swings " in the gymnasium ; nothing like a hundred-yard dash or a four-mile boat race was a common occurrence among them . Where work of this kind had to be done it was left to those who , by reason of exceptional strength , were especially fitted for it ; mankind as a whole did no such work , and it is not necessary ( or even advisable ) for most of us . Nor can it be claimed that the cultivation of great muscular strength was a common practice . There was a much higher average of strength than among us , and we should probably be better off were our average higher than it is ; // but if we can judge at all from the ' history of mankind , such training as that required to break some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor does our own experience tell a different story . Very strong men are no healthier nor longer-lived than those of only average strength , and , in general , the athletic ideal is not the hygienic ideal . It is not necessarily unhygienic , but it is not required for purposes of health . It is not desirable that exercise taken for general hygienic purposes shall be unduly fatiguing . A moderate amount of fatigue is not unwholesome , since fatigue brings with it the desire for rest ; nor is fatiguing exercise necessarily harmful . But exercise need not necessarily be of this character ; and , in view of the other work of life , it is certainly better to avoid undue fatigue , especially when we can not rest well afterwards . A walk of six or eight miles will do more good than one of forty or fifty . 6 . Exercise for Women . ? Muscular exercise is no less essential to the health of women than of men . Fortunately the day is past when false standards misinterpreted the truth that woman 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tied down to the confining duties of household life , she should never know the joy of movement , except in dancing ( and sometimes not even in that ) ; and then proceeded to make sure of the result by clothing her in narrow , pointed , high-heeled shoes , heavy skirts , and tight-lacing corsets . The reaction from this state of affairs , at times going to the opposite and undesirable extreme , has unhappily at times produced in women exhibitions of mannishness which once led a lady to speak of " that terrible thing called muscular exercise . " But disgust with these grotesque but avoidable consequences should not be allowed to blind us to the fact that a reasonable enjoyment of daily muscular activity is as much a ? necessity for women as for men . // B. GENERAL MUSCULAR EXERCISE The present section deals with the use of muscular activity for its hygienic effect upon the body as a whole ; the next section with its employment for special purposes . Exercises undertaken for their general good effect are frequently spoken of as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we shall speak of them as general muscular exercises . General muscular exercise is of hygienic value because it produces the physiological results which have been enumerated in the preceding section , ? results which have been shown to constitute essential elements of the normal internal environment of the cells of the body . To review the separate offices of this ministry to the normal conditions of the body : 1 . General exercises should produce to a considerable extent those physical and chemical changes which accompany muscular contraction , with the resulting effects upon the physiological condition of the muscle itself and upon the general internal environment , the blood and lymph . 2 . They should exercise , and so train , the heat-regulating mechanism . 3 . They should tend to relieve vascular congestion in internal organs , bringing the blood in larger quantities to the skin . 4 . They should afford training to the heart . 5 . They should increase the ventilation of the lungs . 6 . They should increase the flow of lymph in the lymphatics , and thereby improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Chapter IV ) . 7 . They should exert a favorable influence upon the digestive processes , promoting proper secretion and absorption , and tending to prevent unhealthful conditions leading to constipation. // Such being the physiological ends sought for , we may conclude , as to the character of such exercises : 1 . They should consist of rhythmic rather than of sustained contractions . These involve less fatigue , are more enjoyable , and especially facilitate the flow of blood and lymph . 2 . They should be vigorous , somewhat prolonged , and should usually be continuous . A brisk walk or a run meets most demands ; so do bicycling and many games . The strolls or saunters which are too frequently mistaken for exercise : do not meet the reasonable hygienic demands of the body ; they involve only an insignificant increase of chemical activity in the muscles , they hardly affect respiration , they do not train the heart ; in short , they do not produce adequate physiological effects to accomplish hygienic ends . 3 . They should involve considerable movement on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many excellent forms of exercise , such as bicycling , are somewhat deficient in this respect . It is not meant that sudden and violent trunk movements are called for , but that hygienic exercise should bring full change and relief from the con- ' strained positions of the trunk imposed by the sedentary occupations of modern life . A vigorous walk , with its accompanying increase of breathing and trunk movements , fencing , and games which involve the throwing and catching of a ball are especially good in this respect . 4 . They should be accompanied by full and free respiration . The importance of this requirement needs no comment . Constricting clothing should not be allowed to interfere , and , as far as possible , the trunk should be held erect , the neck and shoulders back , so as to permit the freest movement of the upper ribs . 5 . It is advisable not to confine oneself wholly to one form of exercise . Similar considerations to those which // hold in the choice of food apply to some extent to exercise . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can frequently be maintained to old age by using only one kind of general exercise , such , for example , as walking . 7 . Considerations concerning Fatigue . ? The relation of general exercise to fatigue is a matter of considerable interest and also of importance in correlating muscular work with the other work of life . Fatigue of the whole organism is a very complicated matter and involves much more than the total amount of chemical change in the muscles and of the resulting waste products in the system as a whole . We may , for example , be made very tired by unpleasant sensations from the joints and tendons , or by walking in shoes which do not permit free play to the bones , ligaments , tendons , and muscles of the foot ; and this even when the amount of muscular exertion involved may have been slight . It is well known that merely standing still for a time will frequently cause more fatigue than will a longer time spent in walking . Again , some forms of exercise throw a relatively large share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of muscles , while others distribute the total work more evenly over larger groups . Walking and running are very unlike in this respect ; in the former the weight of the body must be lifted from the ground with each step , ? especially when we walk very erect , ? by the extensor muscles of the leg , and chiefly by the extensors of the ankle joint ; running , on the other hand , consists in a continual falling forward and the restoration of equilibrium by a more general action of the muscles of the body as a whole . A walk of four and a half miles an hour is much more fatiguing to a person in good training than a run of four and a half miles an hour , because in the former case a few muscles are thrown into very vigorous contraction and so give rise // to severe local sensations of fatigue , sometimes accompanied by cramps in the muscles . 8 . Some Examples of General Exercises : Cycling . ? bicycle riding is remarkable for distributing the total work over large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by each is relatively small ; consequently , where there is but little hill-climbing or no strong head winds , local fatigue is but slight , although the total work done by the body is considerable . Actual measurements of the carbon dioxide excreted have shown that this is much greater per minute in a ride of eight miles an hour on a smooth level track , than in walking three and a half miles an hour ; in other words , the total work is greater . The well-known increase of perspiration brought about by such moderate riding points in the same direction ; the chemical changes in the body are greater and so is the associated heat production ; and yet any cyclist knows that the conscious fatigue of the ride is as nothing compared with that of the walk . Moreover , in wheeling the , weight of the body is not supported on the feet , and we are thus to a large extent relieved from the unpleasant sensations produced by pressure and jar in the ankle and knee joints . It is a characteristic of moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chemical change with a minimum of fatigue . This is of great practical importance . The larger production of carbon dioxide involves deeper breathing , and , as the student now well knows , increased work on the part of the heart . Within proper limits this is , of course , good for the heart ; there is some danger , however , that in the absence of conscious fatigue we may throw upon that organ more work than is good for it , and medical experience leaves no doubt that many cases of injury to the heart have resulted from injudicious cycling ; that is to say , from " scorching " // against strong head winds and in " showing grit " by refusing to get off and walk up very steep hills . There are occasions when it is not wise to be too ambitious , and when , , discretion is the better part of valor . " 9 . Some Examples of General Exercises : Games . ? Somewhat similar considerations apply to most of our more active games , such as basket-ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are perfectly safe for healthy people when not played more vigorously than the training of the heart justifies ; the fact that there is an element of danger in them is no reason why they should not be used , but it is a very good reason why they should not be worked to extremes , and especially why we should be sure , from competent medical advice , that there is in those who play them no organic trouble to begin with , and that players are in good training when they play most intensely . The choice of the kind of muscular work and exercise involves so many considerations other than those which are strictly physiological and hygienic that it is impossible to give in an elementary treatise like this any detailed discussion of the special merits and defects of each . We often have other aims in view besides the purely hygienic ; thus the group games , such as football , baseball , basketball , hockey , etc. , train the spirit of cooperation and may be made useful means of moral training . In camping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise , but also a means of transportation ; and under other conditions the same thing is true of horseback riding , rowing , etc . Woodchopping , digging , porterage , and plowing are valuable means of livelihood . It is believed , however , that the principles here given will help the individual to form a correct judgment as to whether his work in life supplies him incidentally or inevitably with the needed general muscular activity for hygienic purposes , and , if it does not , to plan to meet the want intelligently . // The combination of muscular exercise with some other pursuit is highly desirable , and when practicable often simplifies the hygienic conduct of life . But it is nothing short of a hygienic misfortune to lose the youthful love of activity for its own sake . It is well as we grow older to have golf , or a horse to be exercised ( ! ) , or a fishing preserve in the woods , to " take us out in the open air " and make us use our muscles . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drag him into activity cuts a sorry figure from a moral standpoint . Man 's highest distinction is the fact that his actions may arise so largely from processes of psychic life within rather than from some immediate stimulus from without . The proper hygienic conduct of life involves moral fiber as well as physical fiber , and this is especially true of that absolutely essential part of hygienic conduct which depends upon the use of organs like the skeletal muscles , which are so largely subordinate to the commands of the will . 10 . Importance of Walking as a Means of Exercise . ? In their enthusiasm for athletic games and outdoor sports in youth , and for other outdoor activities in middle life , the American people are always in danger of losing their love for the various forms of walking , such as tramping and mountain climbing . Walking is the one form of general exercise for sound people which can always be had for the taking . For this reason , if for no other , it should ever be a part of all sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to walk . Apart from the obvious fact that it is in this way that we can get closest to nature and the real beauty of the world iii which we live , the possession of the love of the activity involved is one of the most precious possessions of our hygienic life . The man or woman who does not keep and improve this power by use must look forward to the same fate as the servant in // the parable who hid his talent in a napkin , only to have it taken from him in the end . 11 . Fresh Air not a Substitute for Muscular Activity . ? A word of warning is needed against the folly of supposing that fresh air is a substitute for muscular activity . Fresh air is one of our greatest hygienic blessings , and it is very desirable to live an outdoor life as far as possible . But too many think that lounging in the shade , or riding in the open air in an automobile , a carriage , or an electric car , does for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeps over us and the love of activity wanes from its disuse , more and more does the idea grow upon us that " fresh air " is everything . To many the possession of a comfortable carriage and a pair of thoroughbreds is a misfortune . At one of our most beautiful summer resorts some one said to a local physician , " Medical practice at such a place as this must be very unremunerative . " " By no means , " replied the man of experience ; " people come here where they are tempted to overeat ; in the place of exercise they lie back on the cushions of their carriages while they are driven about ; their adipose tissue increases rapidly , and very soon it is true that to no class of people is the doctor so absolutely essential as to them . " The student can easily make the application for himself . Indigestion , fatty degeneration , insomnia , loss of appetite , nervous prostration , and kindred ills rarely come to those who labor with their hands ; and these ills can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sedentary occupations , by a wise and intelligent conduct of the physical life , and especially by the daily employment of an hour or so of vigorous general muscular activity properly correlated with the other work of life . // G ! MUSCULAR EXERCISES FOR SPECIAL PURPOSES . CORRECTIVE WORK . THE GYMNASIUM The muscles may be used not only to produce those general influences which are necessary to the maintenance of health but also to produce desirable special effects , among which the prevention and correction of faulty carriage and action are of great importance . In considering the use of muscular work for this purpose our subject naturally groups itself under two main divisions : first , faults of form or carriage of the body at rest , ? in other jr . words , ! a bad figure ; and second , faults of handling the body while it is in motion , ? in other words , awkwardness or clumsiness . 12 . The Shape or " Figure " of the Body . ? The human body may be chiseled in marble or molded in bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind the shape or figure of the person it represents . But the shape of the living body is not rigidly fixed , as is that of the statue . The bony skeleton is sometimes called a framework , which supports the muscles , viscera , skin , etc . While this is to some extent true , the organs are not rigidly supported by the skeleton , as the canvas is supported by the poles and ropes which constitute the framework of a tent . In other words , the bones of the skeleton are not rigidly joined together ; they do not of themselves make a selfsupporting framework ; the strong ligaments which pass from one bone to another simply limit or guide the movement of the bones ( p. 16 ) ; they do not , strictly speaking , bind them together . If all organs save the bones and ligaments were removed , the skeleton would collapse . It is itself held upright by the muscles , which determine what position the bones shall have with regard to one another ; and it is more correct to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeleton supports the muscles . // 13 . Round Shoulders as a Type of Faulty Carriage . Their Cause . - The carriage of the shoulders well illustrates the closing statement of the last paragraph . Some people have square , while others have sloping , shoulders ; in some the shoulders are held back so that the upper portion of the back is approximately fiat , while in others they droop forward , thus causing the upper chest to be more or less contracted and the back ? round . " To some extent these differences maybe due to hereditary structure ; but they result , for the most part , from causes which are largely if not entirely under individual control . There is little or no excuse for round shoulders in healthy people , and the marked effect of training is evident in the fine bearing of well-trained soldiers . The truth of this statement is seen when we consider how the deformity is usually acquired , the chief causes being the following . ( a ) Faulty Posture . ? Round shoulders are uncommon among people whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , among those who carry things upon the head . With most , however , the occupations of daily life lead to bending forward over work ; a writing , drawing , sewing , lifting , gardening , paving , machine and tool work at once occur as examples . The trunk is held in such a position that the shoulders tend to fall forward of their // own weight . This tendency is aided by the wrongly curved backs of most chairs , ? which seem as if planned especially to force the shoulders forward , ? and in boys by the use of many forms of suspenders. ( b ) Improper Balance in the Play of Antagonistic Muscles . ? The position of the shoulders with reference to the ribs , // vertebral column , and breastbone is largely dependent upon the action of several groups of antagonistic muscles , the most important of which are those of the breast and those of the back . Figures 106 and 107 show the general antagonistic action of these muscles . The contraction of the great breast ( or pectoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the contraction of the back muscles ( rhomboideus , trapezius , and others ) pulls them backwards and nearer the backbone . Both groups of muscles are kept in a state of sustained moderate contraction ( or tone ) by the nervous system ; but if the back muscles relax , while those of the pectoral group remain in tonic contraction , the shoulder will be pulled forward and the back will be round . Obviously the maintenance by the nervous system of the proper balance in the action of these and other antagonistic groups of muscles is essential to correct carriage of the shoulder . ( c ) Deficient Use of the Back Muscles , with or without the excessive Use of the Breast Muscles . Most occupations and activities involve greater use of the breast muscles than of the back muscles . Striking a blow with a bat or an ax , throwing a ball , and similar actions are more usual than acts , like pulling taffy , which extend the arms and draw the stretch the back muscles ; those of the second kind have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends // to elongate the back muscles ; and unless this is counteracted by movements of the opposite character , which stretch the breast muscle , the pectoral and back groups become set , " as we may express it , in improper relative lengths . The result is round shoulders . Consequently one of the most important things to have in view in gymnastic work is the use of movements which train the back muscles and stretch the pectorals , thus counteracting the effect of the one-sided use of these two groups of muscles in ordinary occupations . 14 . The Period of Growth Especially Favorable for the Acquisition of Round Shoulders and Other Deformities . ? The length of a growing muscle is determined largely by the distance between its origin and insertion 1 during the period of growth . The breast muscle will grow to be a longer muscle when the shoulders are held back by the back muscles than when they are habitually allowed to droop forward . In the former case the pectorals grow to sufficient length and do not tend to pull the shoulders forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back muscles , which makes it necessary for them to take up their own slack before they can keep the shoulders in position . // The student can now appreciate the fact that it is in youth , during the period of growth , that deformities are most readily acquired and most easily corrected ; for the muscles , the ligaments , the bones , are then in their formative stage . In the case in point , if the boy or girl holds the shoulders properly , the pectoral and back muscles of each side adjust themselves to their proper length ; and the shoulders grow into the correct form , just as the sapling which is not bent nor deprived of proper sunlight grows into the symmetrical , beautiful tree . During the period of growth , then , ? say up to at least the twentieth year , ? we can hope to accomplish most in correcting and especially in preventing deformities . The correction and prevention of round shoulders evidently depends upon the proper training and use of the muscles which play upon the shoulder ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for to remedy or prevent , special exercises are required . These are of the general character of the " setting-up " drill of the soldier , and in the case in point we accomplish our purpose by using movements which in the first place stretch the pectorals and even overextend them ; in the second place , give to the back muscles the exercise which they fail to get in our ordinary occupations , and so bring up their strength , their ability to withstand fatigue and to maintain the tonic contraction demanded of them ; and which , in the third place , give us the knowledge of the correct position of the shoulders . 15 . Education of the Consciousness of Correct Posture . In explanation of the last point we may say that when one habitually carries the shoulders properly he feels that he is taking an awkward position when he allows the shoulders to droop ; on the other hand , the man who // habitually allows the shoulders to droop forward feels that he is in an unnatural position when he holds his shoulders back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back muscles and in the second the pectorals must be put on a stretch ; it is also due to the fact that the sensations derived from the habitual posture , whether it be correct or incorrect , have impressed themselves on consciousness as signs of the normal conditions ; to take any other position is to experience the feeling of something unusual or abnormal . We learn of the position of parts of our body with reference to one another by sensations derived from the muscles , tendons , joints , etc. ( see Chapter XIV , p. 262 ) ; and the sensations of position which result when we assume the habitual posture fix themselves in our thought as signs of the normal posture . Our practical , working , idea of normal posture , indeed , is nothing more nor less than our experience of the sensations of position resulting from habitual posture . The man who never carries his shoulders back really knows nothing of their correct position , because the sensations from correct posture are lacking ; he knows no more about them than a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape . One of the first steps in correcting this and similar faults must be to experience the muscular sensations which come from correct carriage ; and the more frequently these sensations are experienced , the better does the subject become acquainted with them , the more likely are they to replace his erroneous judgment . It is only through the sense of positions that we can hope to acquire the practical working knowledge of correct carriage . What we learn by reading about the matter or by looking at pictures or statues of the correct figure is of little use ; for such ideas come to us only through the eye , and we obviously can not depend on our sense of vision // to inform us whether we are carrying ourselves properly or not . We do not " see ourselves as others see us " ; generally we do not " see ourselves " at all . It is only the sense of position that is capable of reminding us the instant we go wrong ; and this sense can be trained properly only by actually assuming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Form and Carriage . ? We may now pass to the consideration of the more important deformities , which it is the aim of special muscular exercises to prevent or correct . ( a ) The failure to hold the neck erect ( allowing it to bend forward ) . ? This results naturally from the fact that the weight of the head will do this , provided the tendency is not corrected by the proper training of the muscles of the back of the neck and trunk . The position of the head usually taken in reading , sewing , etc. , is another cause of this bad habit . ( b ) Round or stoop shoulders . These defects have already been sufficiently dwelt upon ( p. 322 ) . ( c ) Too great backward ( dorsal ) convexity of the spine in the thoracic region , and too great forward ( ventral ) convexity of the spine in the abdominal region . A certain amount of such curvature is normal in these regions ( see Chapter II ) ; but there is usually a tendency to excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , body which the spine must support . Every one knows that it is an effort to sit erect ; and this feeling of effort comes from the fact that the spine is straightened , or rather its curvature kept normal , by the action of a rather complicated group of muscles , ? the erectors of the spine . To // sit , or stand , or walk erect involves the activity of these muscles ; when they cease to act the faulty curvature becomes more pronounced . Hence the value of all exercises which tend to straighten the spine , ? exercises , for example , in which , while standing on the feet , we try by our own muscular effort to make ourselves as tall as possible . They train and strengthen the muscles in question ; they stretch their antagonists , just as throwing the shoulders back stretches the pectorals ; and they impart to us by actual experience the sensation of being erect . ( d ) Lateral curvature of the spine . ? When the spinal column and its attached ligaments and muscles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spine ; the two halves of the body are symmetrical with regard to the median plane of the body , although a considerable amount of bending of the spine as a whole to one side or the other is possible . It is , however , quite possible , by maintaining incorrect positions , to acquire a more or less pronounced lateral curvature in which the muscles and ligaments of the concave side become shortened and those of the convex side lengthened . Perhaps nothing is so responsible for all these faults of curvature of the spinal column as improper positions at the school desk , and much can be done to prevent them by properly constructed school furniture and careful attention to correct position . But it is not wise to depend on these alone . No desk has been constructed in which correct posture can be indefinitely maintained with ease , and we have still in any case to contend with the force of gravity . Active exercises which straighten the spine should supplement the other measures . Experience has well established the fact that the true preventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e ) We have elsewhere ( p. 172 ) pointed out the important action of the muscles of the abdominal wall in // supporting the abdominal viscera , especially those , like the stomach , the spleen , and the intestine , which are suspended from the dorsal wall of the abdominal cavity . I+gig. 137 will at once make clear how the relaxation or elongation of the abdominal muscles , by removing support from these viscera , permits their weight to pull unduly upon the mesentery , and so to stretch this support . It is also not improbable that the tense mesentery at times , by pressing upon thin-walled veins and lymphatics , interferes with the circulation of blood and the flow of lymph in some organs , and so leads to trouble . A pot-belly is not a thing of beauty , and there is every reason for thinking it to be undesirable from the hygienic point of view . It is prevented , in the first place , by every movement which prevents undue lumbar curvature of the spine , and , in the second place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their improved tone . These , however , like all corrective exercises , must be followed up by maintenance of the correct position of the trunk . 17 . Special Exercise for the Training of Nervous Coordination . ? A man or woman may possess none of the deformities noticed above , ? the anatomical form of the body may conform to the best ideals , ? and yet the positions and movements of the body may be awkward , inexpert , ungraceful . In other words , the muscles may be well developed but the individual may be deficient in the power of easily coordinating their action in the accomplishment of desired ends . After what has been learned of the part which the nervous system plays in directing our actions , the brevity of any reference to this purpose of physical training will not mislead the student into thinking that it is of little importance . We have learned that the maintenance of equilibrium , when the body is at rest and when it is in motion , and the execution of complicated movements , both require training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of activities for which we can train is very extensive ; playing upon musical instruments , the execution of gymnastic feats on the parallel and horizontal bars , the traveling rings , or the trapeze , are only a few examples of what can be done by the training of the nervous system by practice . A large part of gymnasium work consists in this sort of training , and there is almost no limit to the forms of exercise to which we may train , ? vaulting , jumping , balancing the body on one foot while various movements are made , the tricks of the parallel and horizontal bars , trapeze , etc . Is there any principle to guide us in the choice of what we shall do ? In reply to this question we nay say that the leading principle should undoubtedly be that of training for what will be useful , and while we need not discard all training which can not be justified on this ground , that which is useful should not be sacrificed to that which is not useful . A large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the feet in the air , and the thing can be done very gracefully by training ; but it is certainly better to cultivate the habit of walking gracefully upon the feet . And ' yet one may see professional gymnasts who are extremely graceful while performing their tricks , but whose gait is clumsy and awkward . 18 . Balance Exercises . ? It is evident that by far the greater number of our customary coordinated movements are made on the feet . Hence the value of so-called balance exercises in the widest sense , whether they consist in the execution of difficult movements while standing on one foot or on the " walking beam , " or in making a proper landing from a jump or a vault ; all of them afford training of those reflexes by which we retain control of the body in motion , thus securing grace of posture and carriage . The general purpose of training these reflexes is the same as the purpose of those exercises which correct // deformities ; they do for the nervous mechanism of the movement what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play upon them ; they give the training of use and prevent atrophy from disuse . Both these ends , the corrective and the so-called coordinative , are best secured by the use of gymnastic movements ; and the increasingly sedentary character of much of our modern life correspondingly increases the value of gymnastic work , especially in the period of youth . It is well to learn and understand the most useful exercises , and even in adult life to have resort to them two or three times a week in order to hold fast what has been gained . 19 . The Gymnasium as a Means of General Muscular Exercise . ? Under the conditions of city life , especially in winter time , the gymnasium is also useful in supplying general exercise in the form of running , gymnastic games , etc . It is better to seek outdoor work as far as possible for this exercise , but there are times when those living in the heart of crowded cities can not get to the country , and outdoor exercise in town is not all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extol unduly the value of gymnastic work , there is equally marked ignorance in other quarters as to what the gymnasium may accomplish . Our cities are vastly better off for their Y. M. C. A. and other gymnasia , and we can not afford to discourage any means of properly directed physical training . 20 . Hygienic Value of Corrective Work . ? Before leaving the subject of corrective and coordinative work we may answer a question which is frequently asked : Has it , after all , any hygienic value ? All will readily grant that this part of physical training has an aestheti.c value , and that- . the cultivation of the taste for correct form and carriage in one 's own person is to be commended . But is a man less healthy for being round-shouldered ? The answer is that he may or may not be less healthy . The deformity // of round shoulders carries with it the lessened use of the upper ribs in breathing ; and while one man or woman may escape dangerous consequences , another may not , ? indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wisdom to avoid the danger as far as possible . In one a pot-belly may be consistent with perfect health , while in others it is not . One may go through life with some faulty curvature of the spine and not suffer from it ; but thousands of persons have to consult physicians every year because of such faults . Many a man wears improper shoes without bad results ; hundreds pay for it with flat foot and suffering which at times amounts to torture . There is not a single deformity enumerated above which may not prove a serious matter ; and when it is so easy to avoid most of them , it would seem from a hygienic point of view well worth while to do so . The hygienic value of corrective and coordinative work is justified , however , still more effectively on another ground . The tendency to take general exercise is directly proportional to the excellence of the neuromuscular mechanism of the body . The man who is awkward and clumsy , who can make but few movements , does not enjoy general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his muscles and can make many movements . It is probably not too much to say that a very large proportion of the people who settle down to a sedentary life with the coming of their thirty-fifth or fortieth year do this because they can do so little with the body , and because exercise is consequently monotonous and distasteful . We can undoubtedly preserve more readily the love of movement for its own sake when we have a body which can move freely and easily , skillfully and . joyously , than when we have one which is never so much at home as in an easy-chair or upon a soft bed ; and we have shown above ( p. 311 ) how valuable is this joy of movement to the body as a whole . CHAPTER XVIII THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM . REST AND SLEEP In no respect do the conditions of modern life stand in more striking contrast to the life of former times than in the increasing importance of mental work in contrast with muscular work as a means of support . Not only are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors , physicians , teachers , and the like , ? but the character of modern business life involves no less the use of the nervous system both on the part of those who direct large enterprises and of those who occupy subordinate positions . The clerk in a bank , as well as the president or cashier , is " living by his wits " and is using his brain to an extent rarely seen until within the last century . Never was competition so keen ; never has it been so necessary to inform oneself minutely as to market conditions of demand and supply ; never before has the margin of profits been so small ; never before has it been so necessary to avoid waste ; and never before has it been so difficult to protect oneself against novel and unforeseen conditions . Truly the modern business man must be ever awake , ever alert . Nor is this all . With the introduction of the telegraph and telephone , communication between man and man is facilitated ; the widespread employment of stenographers results in an increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of matters demanding attention is multiplied many-fold . Moreover , the increase of wealth has enlarged the possibilities of life ; concerts , art 334 // exhibitions , books , crowd upon us ; social engagements are multiplied ; so that as a result we are kept ever on the alert , and the man or woman who does not firmly decline invitations , engagements , and efforts which would overcrowd life to no good purpose , experiences elements of distraction , or fatigue , or worry , ' which tell upon health and too often lead to what we call nervous prostration . For no student of the practical problems of hygiene can shut his eyes to the marked prevalence of nervous prostration and even insanity , or fail to recognize the evident connection between these things and the intensity , the hurry , the unrestful character of the lives we lead . Probably there is no more pressing problem of practical hygiene than that which is here presented . And even where there is no question of nervous prostration or insanity , a large number of people suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously with their work and with the legitimate enjoyment of life . We have seen how close is the connection between all parts of the nervous system , and also how conditions of the nervous system may and must influence nutritive and other functions of the body . The two are most intimately bound together , and many a man or woman fails to secure the blessing of good health because intense , unremitting work is demanded of the nervous system , such as would never be imposed on the muscles , or the stomach , or the skin . Consequently the avoidance of actual nervous prostration is but a small part of what must be accomplished by the hygienic conduct of life ; a far more pressing practical problem is the lessening of daily strain , worry , and fatigue which are the precursors of the more serious troubles , and the avoidance of which affords the only sure means of defense against the all too common and distressing breakdowns of useful lives . // Christian nations have always had in Sunday one day in seven when most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the preservation as far as possible of Sunday as a day of rest is a matter of sound hygienic policy . Recent years have also shown encouraging signs of relief from steady strain in shorter hours of labor , in the early closing of shops on Saturday , and in the more general use of vacations in summer . These are all to be welcomed and encouraged , but a large amount of strain still remains ; the value of the Sunday rest is largely nullified when we go back on Monday morning to an intense application which continues without break until Saturday night . 1 . What causes Nervous Strain ? ? The nervous system , in common with all other organs of the body , is unfavorably affected by unwholesome conditions or acts of life . Improper feeding , sedentary occupations , bad ventilation , or overheating of houses tell upon its working capacity ; and the effects of such conditions upon the nervous system are often wrongly attributed to mental work or ovrrwork . Especially is this true in the matter of muscular activity . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spinal cord have been overworked , but because , in an excessive devotion to business , or science , or literature , or art , or pleasure , or even because of sheer idleness , the muscular system has been neglected and has accordingly failed to minister to the rest of the body . At the same time it often happens that despite proper muscular activity , proper feeding , etc. , the element of strain is still present . Muscular activity itself entails extensive nervous work , and the nervous activity which participates in muscular work may be only a part of the sum total which produces overstrain , and even leads at times to nervous prostration itself . 2 . Misdirected Nervous Activity . ? It is very important to understand clearly that it is misdirected nervous activity , 11Y ( , IENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 337 and not mental work in itself , or the concentration of attention which mental work requires , that leads to bad results . It is a part of our normal life to do mental work and to cultivate the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of education to develop the power of concentration - and attention against resistance and inclination , and experience shows that this may be entirely consistent with the maintenance of health . But when a student " crams " for an examination for two or three days , with the minimum of sleep during the period , and breaks down after it is over , it is n , pt merely mental work which should be blamed for the result ; for he would probably have broken down if he had attempted to work a typewriter during the same time , with no more relaxation or rest . The real cause of the trouble is the too long continued use of the nervous system . 3 . Mental Work and Overwork. ? Much nonsense is said and written about " working the brain too hard . " If by this is meant working it too long at a time without rest , or without stopping for muscular exercise ; if it means the attempt to do more sums in arithmetic , to read more Latin or German , to write a longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of study justify , and so prolong these hours of study to the neglect of other hygienic demands , no objection can be made to the phrase ; but if it refers to the hard mental work and close application required for a reasonable time by a sum in mathematics or a passage in Latin , we may well hesitate to regard such work as in any degree dangerous . The world is overflowing with people who have never acquired habits of mental concentration and hard thinking ; and yet their general health is no better than that of persons who have acquired such habits , while their mental powers often suffer severely by comparison . In the physiological portion of this work the anatomical and physiological aspects of the nervous system were // carefully described . One of the chief reasons for doing this was to impress upon the student the extreme complexity of the mechanism , the great number of parts ( neurones ) which are concerned in our actions , and the natural difficulty , as well as the necessity , of proper coordination . In the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fibers fail to do their work , provided the remaining fibers work harder , and so exert the same pull on the tendon , for the work will still be done . But it is not so with the nervous system ; if ten or twenty neurones of a given nervous mechanism fail to work , the work will not be done at all , or will at best be done imperfectly . In any mechanism of interdependent parts , weakness of one part means weakness of the whole . The secret of efficiency in the nervous system as a whole is the maintenance of the efficiency of each and every unit . 4 . The Care of the Nervous Machinery . Rest and Sleep . ? If a locomotive is to be kept in the state of high efficiency , it must not be worked without ceasing until something goes wrong . When a train is to be pulled three hundred miles it is customary to change engines two or three times on the run ; and these changes are made , not because the first engine can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because heating occurs , or dust finds its way into the bearings , or the strains and jars impair adjustment ; and it prolongs the life of the machine and its good working to remove the dust , cool the parts , and otherwise frequently put the engine in perfect order . When an engine breaks down , it is usually because some one part has given way . With proper care a good machine should wear out but not break down . The central nervous system , although infinitely more complicated than the steam locomotive , is far less durable as a mechanism . Its bearings are not made of hard steel , but of living , irritable protoplasm keenly susceptible to // fatigue . In the numerous connections between neurone and neurone there is the same chance as in the steam engine that some one part will fail to do its work ; and the main principle of its hygienic care is to oil the bearings and clean and repair the machinery , by repose and sleep , before the danger of a breakdown is imminent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one preventive for these unfavorable conditions ; by these alone is the fatigued neurone withdrawn from work and given the chance to repair itself and to return to its normal condition . 5 . How Much Sleep is Advisable ? ? Different people undoubtedly require different amounts of sleep ; but it is safe to say that the vast majority of adults require from seven to eight hours a day ; children and young people require more . It is , however , an interesting question whether all of this should be taken at one time or not . Since the nervous life of to-day is more intense than was that of our ancestors , it is all the more needful that we keep the nervous system in a continuous state of high efficiency . To go about the duties and pleasures of life from early morning until late at night without a moment 's rest is a great mistake ; we are then doing what the engineer would do who should run his engine all day , feeding it with coal but without giving it a drop of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the play of nervous activity goes on , now calling upon one combination of nerve cells , now upon another combination , those nerve cells which . belong to more than one mechanism are called on for more than their share of work , and every mechanism to which they belong may be to that extent impaired . The stimulus of the will must be more vigorously applied , and as this becomes ineffective , the individual is tempted to use stimulants , as the whip is applied to tired and straining ' horses , or as blows were showered upon galley slaves in time of battle . // Contrast with this the benefit of brief sleep during the day in facilitating night work . Some persons , it is true , do not seem to be thus benefited , but the vast majority are . And the benefit is out of all proportion to the time spent asleep . We are tired and work is difficult , not so much because the whole nervous system is exhausted , but because unfavorable conditions of fatigue , etc. , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nap , with its marked muscular and nervous relaxation , normal conditions are restored and the whole mechanism then works on with less effort , less general fatigue , less local injury . 6 . Nervous Rest in Change of Work . ? Sleep is the very best means of insuring local nervous repair , because it is the only condition which involves complete relaxation . There is , however , some rest , or at least some refreshment , in mere change of employment ; as when , for instance , we pass from mental work to physical exercise . Calling into play a new group of nerve cells gives a chance for rest to many cells which have previously been active . And at times we feel tired after mental work because we need muscular activity rather than sleep . The tired feeling may come not from tired nerve cells but from the want of what the muscles might furnish ( see Chapter XVII ) . At such times muscular exercise to some extent , perhaps to a great extent , refreshes us ; and in general we maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity . But it must be remembered that , in the long run , neither muscular exercise nor any other change of occupation can take the place of the complete relaxation and refreshment found in sleep . It is , indeed , doubtful whether there is any change of employment which brings with it an entire change of nervous activity . A certain number of the same cells , already weary , are still kept at work , as has already been explained above ; and it is by sleep alone that every cell has its natural opportunity // for repair . Those who would define rest as " selected excitement " should bear this fact carefully in mind . The cardinal principle in the care of the nervous system is thus the same as that in the care of the steam engine . Do not often call upon it for activity of any kind when conditions of undue fatigue are likely to be present . Go to the performance of every physiological activity , to digestion , to study , to muscular work , to social life , ? for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be with a rested nervous system . Of course to do this is not always possible ; there are times when we must ( hive the body to mental work despite the fact that it is physically tired ; but this ought to be the exception , never the regular order of life . 7 . Examples . ? Let us suppose that some one , man or woman , after application at sedentary work for six or eight hours , has some time free before the evening meal , and that , tired and perhaps nervous , relaxation is sought in a brisk walk , which is almost immediately followed by dinner . The effort which the digestion of this , perhaps the heaviest meal of the day , costs the nervous system shows itself in a stupid , almost somnolent condition which often follows . The body is trying to do hard work with a tired nervous system , some of whose bearings need oiling ; its owner is making the mistake of continued activity without opportunity for the rest and repair which a nap of fifteen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxation without sleep , for half an hour or so before the meal , might have given hint . Again , there are times in every one 's life when some unusual strain must be borne ; when , for example , after the day 's work watch must be kept at a sick bed during the greater part of the night . Too often people will undertake this strain , expecting to " make up " the loss of rest when it is over , even when it is possible to prepare // for it by an hour or so of sleep beforehand . We seldom work steam engines in this way . Should we treat the nervous system less carefully than a steam engine ? These examples must suffice . The application must be made by each individual according to his work in life . If work is undertaken which requires constant activity from early morn until late at night , the case is hopeless , and the only remedy is a change of occupation . Only gross ignorance of the plainest facts of human experience , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . Muscular Relaxation in Sleep. ? Sleep and rest involve muscular relaxation . All have noticed , when falling off to sleep , the feeling of relief from strain ; the framework of the skeleton seems to be held together less rigidly , and finally , as we lose consciousness , relaxation seems complete . And at times when sleep will not come , many have felt the inability to relax ; when , as it has been well expressed , we seem to be afraid that the bed will slip away from under us and we must hold on to it . We have seen that during waking life the nervous system is continually sending out impulses which keep the muscles in a state of moderate contraction , and thus among other things liberate heat for the maintenance of the body temperature . Usually this tonic activity of the motor neurones must be more or less relaxed before sleep will come , and the inability to release it is one of the danger signals of the nervous system . There can be no doubt that when nervous work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a condition of excessive irritability , so that they are discharged by afferent impulses or other stimuli which would ordinarily not affect them ; and they maintain this irritable condition even in the presence of general bodily fatigue . Normal rest is , of course , extremely difficult or quite impossible under these conditions , which for this reason alone should be attended to at // once . The trouble may be in some general or special unhygienic condition of life , ? impaired digestion , insufficient muscular exercise , the presence of undue anxiety , etc. ; these should be inquired into and remedied if present ; but the trouble is usually the result of pushing activity of different kinds for too long periods without cessation . In other words , we have lost the ability to relax because we have not practiced relaxation . 9 . Conservation of the Ability to relax . ? The ability to relax is something which , like all phenomena of nervous life , depends on practice . Indeed , it is not improbable that it is something more than a mere process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inhibition ( see Chapter XV ) are concerned in it . All have known people who can go to sleep the instant they lie down ; and they can do this ? it would almost seem by an act of the will ? because they have long done it . It is a power which can indeed be cultivated too well ; by too frequent repetition of the process of taking a nap , and by sleeping too long at night , there may be acquired a diminished irritability of the nerve cells , which makes attention to work a very difficult matter , and long-sustained attention almost impossible . Those in this condition may escape the danger of nervous prostration , but they impair their usefulness in life . The true path , as in other matters of personal hygiene , is that between these extremes . When one rises at seven or eight in the morning , a short period of rest in the afternoon is sufficient ; the persistent practice of the act of relaxation every hour or less is apt to lead to loss of muscular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , the habit of momentary relaxation in the midst of , the day 's work is a valuable aid , partly in bettering conditions at the time , but chiefly in retaining the power to relax when it is wanted for longer periods of rest . // 0 10 . Drugs are Delusive and Dangerous . ? The physiologist can not condemn too strongly the substitution of stimulants for the proper regulation of work and rest . The reader will see at once what this course of action may be expected to accomplish ; the stimulant is an antagonist of relaxation ; the nerve cell becomes more and more irritable as it is pushed harder and harder ; finally it reaches either the condition of excessive irritability or else that of being unable to work without the stimulant . It has adapted itself to the presence of the stimulant in its environment , it is trained to work under those conditions , and it can not work without them . It may be safely asserted that , in general , the time above all others when stimulants should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use stimulants regularly , day after day , in place of rest is shown by experience to be one of the most dangerous of mistakes . Nor , on the other hand , can we condemn too strongly the use of narcotics to produce sleep . Probably none of these drugs are capable of producing normal sleep ; and while in times of emergency the physician must have recourse to them , they should never be relied upon in place of the hygienic conduct of the whole life . Many of them , and some of those in common use , are very dangerous , and none of them is known to be above reproach. 11 . The Influence of Mental and Moral States. ? Finally , it must also be remembered that psychical processes exert a profound influence upon the well-being of the brain and spinal cord . It is a matter of common experience that emotions , feelings , moods , etc. , profoundly influence human conduct , and so indirectly affect health , especially the health of the nervous system . It is also certain that they exert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes which emotions produce in the heart beat are good examples of other changes which are none the less important because they do not lend themselves 1.1.1 UIENE OE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 345 so readily to observation . The bestowal of a healthy attention upon the moral aspects of conduct is a legitimate and essential part of personal hygiene ; and it is not too much to say that much of the ill health from which men and women suffer is to be traced primarily to the absence of sound moral sense or to its abnormal or perverted development . Care and worry often cause weariness and loss of sleep which even diversion and muscular exercise can not overcome . They seldom trouble the young , but as age advances they are sometimes inevitable . Efforts should be made to avoid them , as far as possible , by a wise ordering of life , by forethought , thrift , economy , sobriety , honesty , and the like , which tend to " a light heart " and " a clear conscience . " A heavy heart and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other physical ills . 12. " 6 Mental " Cures of Disease . ? It has been shown that mental conditions are far from being without influence upon the activities of the body , even leaving out of account the voluntary muscles . The effect of emotions upon the heart has been referred to , and so has the psychic secretion of gastric juice . It is known that the movements of the alimentary canal are readily modified by events in conscious life . In the hypnotic state the effect of suggestion upon functions which we habitually regard as involuntary is even more striking . Facts like these have led many to the rash assumption that there is no limit to the domination of the mind over physiological processes . In numerous cases the ascendency which some have gained over certain forms of disease has been as surprising to others as it has been gratifying to themselves . Beyond question the righting of disordered functions and the suppression of pain have been frequently attained , and this fact makes it easy to see why so great a following has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // But certain dangers are always involved in the attempt to overcome disease by resolutely forgetting it and denying its existence . The feeling of pain may at times be banished by believing that it does not exist , but this may be quite as undesirable as self-inflicted blindness or deafness . While relief from pain may frequently favor recovery by promoting rest and nutrition , it may at other times simply mean the loss of warnings which deserve to be heard . Where there is grave organic disease , this may move on to a fatal issue even while the deluded subject consistently ignores its course . It is not wise to try to annul the effects of a disease in consciousness when both cause and effect can be removed by rational medical treatment . Hypnotism may relieve a toothache , but it is not claimed that it will mend a decaying tooth . The dentist 's filling , which does both , is the type of medical as contrasted with psychical methods in dealing with acute disease . Especially foolish is it to ignore or deny the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menaces not only the patient but those about him . The consequences of this folly , when confined to its deluded victim , may end in virtual suicide ; when they extend to others , they may fall little short of manslaughter . CHAPTER XIX THE HYGIENE OF FEEDING The present chapter deals with certain hygienic considerations connected with the taking of food into the body , ? its preparation , its cooking , its quantity , the frequency of our meals , and the adjustment of our habits of feeding to the other work of life.l Mankind as a whole was probably never better fed than it is at present . The opening up of the New World With its vast fields of corn and wheat and its enormous pastures ; the introduction of improved methods of agriculture , agricultural machinery , and education in agriculture ; and especially the improvements in transportation facilities and in arts of food preserving ( such as refrigeration and canning ) , all these have immensely increased the available food supply of the world and made famine and starvation much more rare than formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the central parts of India , that great famines still occur . And yet in the midst of abundance it is still true that many men and women are poorly nourished ; for it is the absorption of food by the blood and not merely the eating of meals which supplies the needs of the tissues . Hence the problem of alimentation in its widest sense involves not only the growing of food on farms or in gardens , and 347 // the preservation of this food so that it may be delivered in proper form to the consumer , but also the eating of it in such form and quantities and at such times as will insure its proper utilization , by the processes of digestion , for the needs of the body . 1 . Appetite as a Guide in Feeding . ? Nature herself has provided us with guides in the choice of food , and these guides are the sensations of hunger and thirst , and what we sum up in general under the term " appetite . " So long as these remain normal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like all physiological functions , they are kept normal and unperverted , in the first place , by attention to the general health of the entire body . Appetite is apt to fail or become untrustworthy in the case of men or women who are suffering from lack of muscular activity or from mental worry . The care of the appetite is never a matter of direct attention to the appetite itself , but of maintaining the bodily conditions in which it normally acts . Consequently the basic principle in securing proper nutrition is attention to the general health . A patient suffering from indigestion once consulted a wise old doctor and began recounting the foods that agreed or disagreed with him , together with his innumerable symptoms , until the doctor interrupted him by saying , " The first thing you must do is to forget that you have a stomach . " The present chapter is not written for people like this patient , or for invalids , or for others suffering from indigestion in any one of its thousand forms . It is written for those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needful muscular exercise and the needful rest ; who will pay proper attention to clothing and bathing , to the heating and ventilation of the home , to the avoidance of dampness and other unfavorable conditions ; who will not abuse themselves by stimulants and narcotics . Those who prefer not to belong to this class , or who because of some // constitutional disease can not , must seek and depend upon medical advice as regards their habits of feeding . At the same time , to insure proper digestion and nutrition , more is required than attention to general hygiene . What additional precautions are required in the taking of food by persons leading an otherwise healthy life ? It is in answer to this question that we shall attempt to give some suggestions . 2 . Good Cooking as an Aid in Nutrition . ? It has already been pointed out that digestion begins with the preparation of the food by cooking , which serves three purposes . 1 . It destroys parasites and disease germs . The importance of this will be shown and emphasized elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food more appetizing ( see p. 113 ) . 3 . It makes some foods more digestible by making them accessible to the action of the digestive juices ; thus the connective tissue of animal foods , when heated in the presence of water , swells , and is more easily acted on by the gastric juice , so that tough - meat in this way is often made tender by boiling . The cellulose walls of the vegetable foods , on the other hand , are softened by cooking , the starch granules are swollen , and their envelopes burst ( see p. 94 ) . At the same time it is possible to render food less digestible by improper cooking . A piece of meat may " have the life cooked out of it " ; and egg albumen , which in the raw state mixes rather easily with the gastric juice , may sometimes be boiled to a leathery consistency which renders the action of the digestive juices a slow process . 3 . Chewing of Food an Aid to Digestion . ? It is unnecessary to dwell at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have already seen that the word " digestion " is derived from the Latin words dis and gero , to tear apart or separate ; and our studies of physiology have // shown how the division of food into smaller and smaller masses is prerequisite to reasonable rapidity of solution and absorption . The student is also reminded of what has been said ( p. 100 ) concerning the importance of caring for the teeth . Vegetable foods especially should be well chewed , partly because the cellulose which holds them together is not readily acted on by the gastric juice , and partly because the thorough mixture with the saliva facilitates the gastric digestion of starch ( p. 110 ) . Meats also should be well masticated . The fact that a dog bolts his . food with impunity is no guide for civilized man , since , for one reason , human gastric juice contains much less acid and so acts less readily upon connective-tissue elements . It is true that the " quick lunch " thrives in busy places , but no one considers it hygienic. 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that gastric digestion may be efficient it is , of course , necessary that gastric juice shall be secreted in proper amount , and we have learned that the first step toward this secretion consists in the pleasurable sensations connected with the satisfaction of appetite . Consequently it is one of the first hygienic requisites of gastric digestion that the food shall be appetizing , and that the condition of the body and especially of the digestive system shall be such that the food shall be eaten with relish . This is not the same thing as saying that food which is appetizing will be digested ; it merely means that food is more digestible for being appetizing , and that , when it is not enjoyed , its stay iii the stomach is apt to be unduly prolonged . For this and other reasons the appetite should not be impaired by eating candy , or by visiting the pantry between meals for something to eat ; on the other hand , a good appetite should be encouraged by healthy living , by proper preparation of the food , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table appointments . There was wisdom as well as pleasure in the old custom of having , a jester at the dinner table , and there is reason in the saying , " Laugh and grow fat . " 5 . Excessive Quantity of Food . Overfeeding . ? It is furthermore important that the amount of food eaten at one time be not excessive , and that the stomach under no circumstances be unduly distended . A large proportion of those cases of dyspepsia which have their origin partly or entirely in the conditions of feeding are due to overeating , which may take various forms . Too large a proportion of the total food may be taken at one meal , usually dinner ; or too many meals may be taken , ? three should suffice ; or each of the three may be full-sized meals , ? a very undesirable custom among those engaged in sedentary pursuits . We have seen that the one condition of life which calls for heavy feeding is that of muscular activity , whether in the performance of external work or for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is engaged in some occupation which involves large amounts of muscular work can and should have three full meals daily ; with others the habit is attended with considerable risk . Gluttony has always been a vice of the idle and luxurious . As the world has grown wiser ' it has become less common , because a larger intelligence makes it plain that gluttony defeats its own ends , and that the secret of the greatest pleasure in eating , as in everything , lies in temperance , not in excess . Many persons , however , without any desire or even any thought of gluttony , regularly overeat . These are usually healthy persons leading sedentary lives , " blessed , " as they say , " with a good appetite , " and because of quiet or even indolent disposition giving but small heed to muscular activity . As the years go by , such persons are apt to grow fat , and by and by to find themselves suffering from a weak heart , or shortness of breath , or something worse ; seldom // realizing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal cause of their undoing . If sufficient manual labor or other exercise of the skeletal muscles is practiced , trouble from overeating rarely comes . It is the sedentary , inactive , and indolent who suffer most from this source ; for them a good appetite often proves to be a curse rather than a blessing , and a poor appetite , by preventing overeating , has often been a blessing , though a blessing iii disguise . 6 . Fried Foods . ? Caution is required in the use of fried foods . When a layer of fat varnishes over a particle of food the digestive juices do not readily penetrate the mass , and digestion is to that extent impaired . This is not of so much importance in intestinal digestion , since in that portion of the alimentary canal the layer of fat is itself digested and removed ; the stomach , on the other hand , does not digest fat , and we can easily see how , because of its interference with the first processes of digestion in this organ , the use of too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , care should be taken to have the temperature of the fat high enough to coagulate promptly the surface layers of the food , thus preventing the penetration of the fat into the food , which , moreover , should not be served swimming in fat , but as dry as possible . The frying pan is still used far too extensively in some parts of America . Most of our foods should be roasted , broiled , boiled , or baked , rather than fried . 7 . Perspiration in Relation to the Hygiene of Feeding . ? The secretion of gastric juice is seriously impaired by excessive perspiration , especially when the loss to the system is not made good by drinking sufficient amounts of water . This is probably true of the secretion of all of the digestive juices , but it is especially important in the case of the gastric digestion , upon the proper performance of which the subsequent work of intestinal digestion so largely depends . Therefore , in general , smaller meals // should be eaten in hot weather , ? we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy meals should not be taken immediately after vigorous exercise involving profuse perspiration . Indeed , it is a general rule that excessive loss of water by perspiration should be made good , as far as possible , by drinking water more freely . 8 . Digestion and Bodily Fatigue . ? Digestion , like all other functions of the body , involves to a very considerable extent the intervention of the nervous system ; and we may repeat here the advice already given ( p. 341 ) not to go tired to the digestion of a heavy meal . It is one of the objections , probably the chief objection , to evening dinners that they so frequently follow immediately upon a hard day 's work , when the nervous system is in a poor condition for its share in digestive work . A rest of half an hour before dinner is , however , generally all that is needed , and usually prevents the mental heaviness which so often follows a full meal . 9 . Mental Work after Meals . ? An exaggerated importance has probably been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals . There is no proof whatever that the demand of the brain for greater blood supply will seriously interfere with that to the digestive organs . While it is true that indigestion often affects people who go straight from their meals to hard mental work , it is also true that these are usually people who take insufficient muscular exercise , rest , and sleep . The relation of the circulation in the brain to that in the digestive organs is too imperfectly understood to justify some of the glib but shallow utterances frequently met with on this subject , especially when the statements in question are not clearly supported by experience . ( See page 155. ) 10 . Muscular Activity after Meals. ? Vigorous muscular activity immediately after meals is quite another matter . Here we know that blood is taken away from the digestive // organs and sent through the muscles and skin ; this fact suggests caution , and experience amply confirms the need of the caution thus suggested . Even here it is vigorous exercise , and especially after heavy meals , that is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Drink . ? Many people , and especially many women , drink too little water . Water is constantly being lost through the lungs , skin , or kidneys , and this loss is only partially made good by the oxidation of the hydrogen of the proteids and fats.l No rules as to the amount can be given , since it varies so much with temperature and the amount of muscular activity ; but the habit of drinking no water between meals and but little at the table , in spite of popular opinion on the subject , is to be strongly deprecated . We have already shown that the abstraction of undue amounts of water by perspiration may seriously interfere with the secretion of the gastric juice , and there is every reason to believe that a deficiency in the supply of water to the blood similarly interferes with the secretion of the other digestive juices , and so , by impairing intestinal digestion , favors constipation . Undue emphasis has been laid upon the danger of drinking water with meals . The reasons given ? that such water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal secretion of saliva ? are questionable . As a matter of fact , the water thus taken is soon discharged into the intestine and .. absorbed . It is true , however , that the use of too much fluid with the meal is apt to lead to insufficient mastication because it makes it easier to swallow the food ; and from this point of view caution is advisable . It is probably also true that much drinking with meals tends to overeating , by facilitating rapid eating ; // and it may be that this is one reason why fat people are usually great drinkers . A further point in-the hygiene of gastric and intestinal digestion is the avoidance of those inflammatory conditions of the bowels which follow exposure to cold . This subject will be dealt with in Chapter XXI . The student will also recall what has been said in Chapter XVII with regard to the importance of general muscular exercise , and especially of exercises involving the use of abdominal muscles . 12 . The Importance of Coarse Foods . ? In treating of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain amount of indigestible material in the food is helpful as a stimulus to the muscular action of the intestine . Food may be , and nowadays often is , especially in " delicate dining , " too largely composed of very digestible substances , which leave an insufficient residue of solid material in the lower intestine to stimulate proper peristalsis . Our main reliance for the needed coarse or indigestible parts of our diet is the cellulose of many of our vegetable foods ; oatmeal and fruit are two of the more important foods which serve the purpose . Indian corn is also an important laxative , although its action is probably dependent on other things than cellulose . The laxative action of prunes and figs is well known . Graham flour , bran , " whole wheat , " etc. , which retain more or less of the hull of the grain , have the same action . In selecting the diet care should be taken , especially in winter , to include in it a sufficient quantity of such foods , and a judicious addition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Individual must study his own Needs. ? In thus sketching the broad outline of hygienic feeding little or no attention has been given to what we should or should riot eat ; and this has been done in order to discourage looking at the subject from this popular but entirely // misleading point of view . It may be true that " what is one man 's meat is sometimes another man 's poison , " but only in a very limited sense . Each individual in the course of his experience will learn that there are some things he can not eat with impunity , and , if he be wise , will govern himself accordingly . But it must be remembered that man enjoys a wide latitude in the choice of his food . The vast majority of people , if they will but lead otherwise hygienic lives , can eat almost anything ; and the inability to digest something which we have always eaten , or which others eat with impunity , should lead not so much to its exclusion from the diet as to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general unhygienic conduct of life . Those who treat such conditions by constructing a table of the things they can eat and another of those they can not eat , and confine their diet to the former , usually find that as life advances the size of the latter table increases at the expense of the former . It is the same fallacy of dealing with the symptom instead of the disease , which leads others to treat constipation with cathartics , and still others to treat a bronchial cough with so-called " cough medicines . " CHAPTER , XX FOOD ACCESSORIES , DRUGS , ALCOHOL , AND TOBACCO 1 . Food Accessories and Drugs. ? Through the alimentary and respiratory tracts there are received into the blood not only substances such as proteids , gelatin , fats , carbohydrates , salts , and water , which we have described as supplying the material for power and for growth and repair , but also other substances capable of modifying in one way or another the course of events within the body . The flavors which contribute to the enjoyment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gastric juice ; and yet the substances which cause these flavors are negligible as sources of power . Salt belongs under the same head ; for we use in cooking more salt than is needed to make good the daily loss from the body , and we do this to develop an agreeable flavor in our food . Substances of this kind are spoken of as food accessories , and among them must be included coffee and tea , for their effect is not chiefly a matter of nutrition ; certain constituents of tea and coffee absorbed into the blood affect the nervous system , and it is largely for this reason that we use them . We may pass in this way from the necessary food accessories through those , like coffee and tea , which , while not essential , may still be regarded as part of the food of a large portion of mankind , to the great number of chemical compounds known as drugs , which also act by changing the course of events within the body ; and it is difficult to draw any sharp line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine or " stimulants " and those of which daily use is made as food accessories . Animals as a rule take substances into their bodies only to satisfy hunger or thirst or appetite ; man alone takes , in addition to his nutriment , food accessories and drugs for the sake of their special effect upon the nervous system or other organs . Many of the numerous food accessories which human ingenuity has discovered or devised are harmless enough in the form used ; but others contain substances which are capable of poisoning the body . It is an important part of the study of personal hygiene to learn of what these substances consist , what is their action on the human organism , and wherein lie their special dangers . 2 . The Drug Habit . ? It is a lamentable fact that large amounts of drugs are swallowed by men and women apart from any medical need which compels their use . In a subsequent chapter we shall show reasons for avoiding an undue dependence upon drugs as a remedy for various minor ills . Bad as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain action of a drug instead of taking proper hygienic care of the body , it is far worse to make habitual use of drugs for their special effects upon the healthy body , for the habit is one which is only too easily cultivated . There is no reason why a healthy human being , living a normal life amid healthful surroundings , should need to use drugs habitually , and a little consideration will show that the practice is dangerous . 3 . Dangers of the Drug Habit . ? When we eat meat , or vegetables , or when we breathe air , we take into the body materials needed for normal living . These things have always formed part of the food of the race , and , unless wrongly taken , do good and not harm . When , on the other hand , we take a drug , such as chloroform , or cocaine , or opium , or alcohol , or coffee , or tea , we take something // which is foreign to the body , in so far as it has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not needed , as proteid and salt and water are needed ; there i , no special preparation for its reception ; and , while it ay do good , there is danger that it may do harm . In the second place , the exact action of many drugs is ? only imperfectly understood . In an emergency the physician uses them temporarily , for some effect which he desires to produce , thus tiding over a difficulty . He uses the drug only a few times at most , and is consequently not greatly concerned about unfavorable attendant effects ; it accomplishes some needed purpose , and if it does any harm , the organism may be trusted to recover from it . It is very different , however , with the habitual use of any drug . The very fact that it gives some new direction to the events taking place within the body means that abnormal conditions of life are being maintained ; and we have already learned that abnormal conditions of life are apt to be unhygienic . Again , the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygienic conduct of life . We may , for example , take drugs to accomplish something which the healthy body should accomplish for itself without outside help . When any one drinks a cup of black coffee to facilitate mental work which his fatigued condition would not otherwise allow him to do , he is trying to get from a drug the power which he could and probably should secure by normal sleep . The coffee acts like a whip to a tired horse ; the same work is done as might have been done had the horse been allowed a little rest ; but the horse is not as well off when he does the work under the lash as when he does it in a properly rested condition . Similarly , persons suffering from sleeplessness often take drugs used to produce sleep ( hypnotics ) , and , superficially at least , the sleep thus secured resembles normal sleep ; but experience // shows that few if any hypnotics can be used for any length of time without bad effects . Here again a drug is being depended upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pepsin tablets may be taken to aid digestion , and thereby an attack of indigestion may sometimes be prevented or relieved ; but a healthy stomach should furnish its own pepsin ; and the fact that it does not do so is a sure warning that something is wrong in the conduct of life . It is irrational to neglect the duty of attending to the cause of the ailment , and it is foolish to substitute temporary relief for permanent cure . Perhaps if the drug did all that the proper care of the body does , and did no more , no serious objection could be made to its use ; but there is probably no drug of which this is true , and for this reason it is foolish and rash to try to substitute the use of drugs for the hygienic conduct of life . Lastly , if the drugs do not accomplish in the long run what should be done by the hygienic conduct of life , their extensive use becomes all the more dangerous in view of the unquestioned fact that we are apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave , broadly speaking , of the habits he forms , and it is only a question as to whether he will be the willing slave of good habits or the abject slave of bad habits . The man who leads a hygienic life is the slave of muscular activity , of correct feeding , of proper clothing , of rest , etc. ; that is to say , these things become necessary to his life ; lie can not get along without them . If for these proper agents of health he persistently substitutes some drug , whether it be alcohol , or tobacco , or coffee , or tea , or chocolate , or opium , the habit of using the drug is substituted for that of maintaining normal conditions . But since drugs can not entirely take the place of such conditions , the constitution goes from bad to worse , and increasing dependence must be placed upon the drug . It is a safe rule that whenever we are uncomfortable or // unhappy without the use of a certain drug we should cease using it until , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along without it . There are people who are slaves of coffee , of tea , of chocolate , of patent medicines , of candy , and of soda water , just as truly as there are slaves of tobacco , or of alcohol , or of opium . It is worse to be the slave of alcohol than of coffee , because the evil consequences of alcohol are greater than those produced by the corresponding use of coffee ; but it is by the same process in both cases that the man or woman becomes a slave to the drug , and that process is the formation of bad habits . With these practical considerations about the use of drugs , ? by which term it will be seen that we mean , not simply the medicines purchased from the apothecary , but all those substances which are taken into the body in order to give some new or abnormal direction to the course of events in the organism , ? we may pass on to the discussion of those in common use . 4 . Tea and Coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their most important physiological effects are due essentially to the same substances , viz. caffeine ( or theine ) and tannic acid ( or tannin ) . Caffeine is a very powerful stimulant , especially of the nervous system , and also of the heart , although probably to a lesser degree ; tannin , on the other hand , is a bitter , astringent substance , which may considerably hinder digestion and directly injure the mucous membrane of the stomach . Tea contains about twice as much tannin as an equal weight of coffee , but as coffee is frequently made much stronger than tea the actual amount per cup may often be more nearly equal in the two drinks than these figures indicate . The amount of tannin dissolved in tea varies greatly with the method of preparation , and largely for this reason tea should not be boiled , nor allowed to steep too long . The // proper method of making tea is to pour over the dry leaves water which has been brought just to the boiling point , and then to allow the infusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a few minutes . Both tea and coffee seem to have a slightly retarding influence upon gastric digestion . In healthy people this is of little consequence , but when the digestive powers are in any way impaired the use of these beverages may be inadvisable . The more important effect , however , of both tea and coffee is in their stimulating action on the nervous system . No satisfactory explanation has yet been given of the fact that some people can use tea and not coffee , while with others the reverse is true . It is probably safe to say that when used in moderation , tea and coffee are usually harmless to those leading an otherwise hygienic life . They should be used sparingly by nervous people and by those in whom digestion is feeble and slow ( Hutchinson ) . Even by the perfectly healthy they should not be used to excess , nor should the habit be acquired of using them as the whip to the tired horse . Drinking strong coffee in order to keep awake for evening study is objectionable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep is also unwise . 5 . Cocoa is made from the seeds of trees of the genus Theobroma , and chocolate is prepared from cocoa . In the solid form both are highly nutritious , as shown by the following average results of analyses . When used as a beverage , however , the nutriment derived from them is small . In addition , cocoa and chocolate both contain theohromine , a substance closely related chemically to caffeine and possessing much the same stimulating properties . In general , the same hygienic considerations which // apply to the use of tea and coffee should guide us also in the use of chocolate and cocoa . 6 . Soda Water and Similar Beverages . ? Of these little need be said . In general they are harmless enough , especially to those enjoying perfect digestion . The large amount of sugar which they contain is apt to make matters worse in many cases of dyspepsia ; by taking them frequently between meals the appetite for wholesome food is impaired , and excessive indulgence in them under any circumstances is needless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of an alcoholic drink we have to deal with something which , like tea and coffee and cocoa and " temperance drinks , " is used as a beverage and to that extent must be classed in the same group . Alcoholic drinks are , however , taken as stimulants and so resemble tea and coffee and cocoa , but they differ from all of these in their action upon the body . Moreover , their abuse gives rise not only to degraded moral and social conditions but is also attended with bad hygienic effects . Every one should be informed of their nature and of the dangers attending their use . The common alcoholic beverages consist of ( 1 ) malt liquors , including beer and ale ; ( 2 ) wines , such as hock , claret , Burgundy , sherry , and champagne ; ( 3 ) distilled liquors , including brandy , whisky , rum , and gin ; and ( 4 ) liqueurs and cordials . These groups are distinguished from one another largely by the method of preparation and by the amount of alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from three to eight per cent of alcohol ; wines are also fermented liquors , but contain from seven to twenty per cent of alcohol ; distilled liquors , on the other hand , are first fermented and then concentrated by distillation , and contain from thirty to sixty-five per cent of alcohol . In all these the most important constituent , so far as their physiological action // upon the body is concerned , is the chemical compound known as ethyl alcohol ( C2116O or C2H5 . OH ) . 8 . Fermentation . ? The ethyl alcohol in each of these beverages is produced by the action of yeast on sugar , and this action is known as alcoholic fermentation . Yeast is a unicellular plant , and when a small amount of it is added to a solution of grape sugar or fruit sugar it breaks up these substances , chiefly into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas . The latter passes off , while the alcohol remains behind in the solution . In addition to these chief products of fermentation there are always formed other products in small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor of the fermented mixture is due . Different varieties of yeast produce different kinds of fermentation . Thus one variety ( domesticated yeast ) is used in making beer , and another ( wild yeast ) in making wine . The amount of alcohol produced differs with the yeast used , as do also the character and quantity of the secondary products . The growth of yeast , like that of all living ferments , is checked by the accumulation of the products of its own activity . Consequently when the alcohol produced reaches a certain percentage ( usually less than ten per cent ) the fermentation ceases . Alcoholic drinks which contain higher percentages of alcohol are prepared by special processes which will be described later . 9 . Malt Liquors . ? Malt consists of sprouted grains ( chiefly barley ) . The grains contain a large amount of starch which during the process of germination is converted into sugar by diastase , an enzyme produced by the living cells of the plant , ? the action of diastase being essentially similar to that of the ptyalin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable quantities of // sugar , together with salts , proteids , and other substances . The watery extract of malt is known as wort , and it is this which , after being boiled with hops , is acted upon by the yeast . The liquid thus produced from wort by fermentation is known as ale , beer , stout , porter , etc. , according to the conditions under which the fermentation takes place and the character of the malt and the yeast employed . German beers contain from three to four per cent of alcohol ; ale contains from four to six per cent . 10 . Wines . ? Wine is produced by the fermentation of the juice obtained by crushing grapes , and the yeast conies from the " bloom " on the skin of the grapes . The juice , or " must , " thus extracted is allowed to undergo fermentation , and the fermented liquid is wine . Most wines , however , are subjected to subsequent treatment . Some are allowed to ripen in wooden casks , during which process there take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor . In other cases the wine is " fortified " by the direct addition of alcohol . Wines differ from one another according to the variety of the grape used in making the must , according to the variety of yeast used for fermentation , and according to other circumstances . 11 . Distilled Liquors and Spirits . ? This group of alcoholic beverages contains the highest percentage of alcohol , and includes whisky , brandy , rum , and gin . In the making of all of these the essential procedure is the same ; namely , first to produce fermentation in some sugary liquid , and afterwards to distill from the products of this fermentation its alcohol and some other volatile constituents . Whisky is made by distilling fermented corn or rye ; brandy may be spoken of as distilled wine ; rum is distilled from fermented molasses , and gin from a fermented mixture of rye and malt , ? juniper berries and other substances being added to the distilled product .
