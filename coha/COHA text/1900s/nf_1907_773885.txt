txt // ing the strings , has been borne out by Mr Heron Allen . An authority of the period , Jerome of Moravia , who wrote his " De cgentia Artes Musiciea " in 1274 , and dedicated it to Gregory X. , speaks of the rubebe as a two-stringed instrument played with a bow and tuned thus : Unfor-tunately lie does not illustrate his text , but the depth of pitch given by him would indicate an instrument of larger proportions than the one held by the Boscerville figure . In any case , whether this be the instrument indicated by Jerome or not , he has distinctly described the existence of a bass species of viol at that date , and our next picture might certainly be taken as an illustration of his description , giving licence of course , to the third string . This bas-relief in marble ( Fig. 8 ) is preserved in the museum at Cologne , and , looked at with // a twentieth-century eye , is wonderfully replete with omens . Observe the bridge and its position : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the sounding-board joins the neck : the excellent fingerboard and tailpiece . All these items , combined with its size , might easily allow it to be the rubebe of Jerome de Moravia and if one supposes this to be so , it is not amiss to suggest that the Boscerville instrument is also a rubebe , which experience enlarged in the following century to the size before us . It is hardly necessary to add further examples , as these three give a fairly broad idea of the progressive attempts at a definite form , from about the eleventh to the end of the fourteenth century . During this period there were doubtless no hard and fast rules for tuning . The minstrel adapted the pitch of his instrument according to whim , or the compass of his voice . He danced and sang to his own improvised accompaniments . Thus we hear in 1391 of : " Un nominee Isembart jouait d'une rubebe , et , en jouant , un nomme Le Bastard se print a dancer , " and again in 1395 , " Roussel et Gaygnat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , et ainsi que les aulcuns // dansoient. " 1 The minstrel 's person and attainments were undoubtedly of a genial character , yet with all due deference to his merry ways , and the good service he rendered to poetry and music , one can not help observing that his dancing and warbling were the means of retarding the development of musical instruments to a certain extent . If you roam the country with your musical equipment upon your back you naturally require something of a portable size . " A fiddle under my cloak ? " says the indignant Sir Roger 1'Estrange in defending himself against Mr Bagshawe 's insinuations that he frequently solicited private conferences from Oliver Cromwell with a fiddle under his cloak ; Truly my fiddle is a bass-viol , and that 's somewhat a troublesome instrument under a cloak . " The minstrel of the Middle Ages was certainly of the same opinion , and was careful that his fiddle should not assume alarming proportions . He was content so long as he could carry it about with ease like " Gervais de Nevers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck a viol hung For cunningly he played and sung . " // Another obstacle to the progress of stringed instruments was placed in their way by the early contrapuntists who expended their genius entirely upon vocal music . Thus it was that no one appeared to realise that a resonant bass-viol , answering to the pitch of the bass voice , could be constructed by enlarging the rebecs and embryo viols then in use . Not until the middle of the fifteenth century did anything of the sort appear , and when it did , it came at the imperative call of the part-songs then coming into vogue . The singers of these compositions demanded to be kept in tune just as much as the warblers of sweet melodies had required , and it was the desire to do this to the best advantage that led eventually to the construction of complete sets of stringed instruments played with a bow and answering in pitch to the treble , alto , tenor , and bass voices . And now , if you have finished your coffee , shall we return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found amongst them a mongrel species of bass instrument , which certainly acted in no mean way as a factor in the development of low-pitched instruments played with a bow . We allude to the trum melscheit , known in England under the ambiguous // title of marine trumpet . It carries one short gut string tuned to CC , and when correctly played ? i.e. harmonically ? gives out a scale corresponding in pitch to that of the high soprano voice . This trummelscheit before us is rather undersized . Its form and construction are of an advanced type , for besides the short gut string it has the additional sympathetic wire strings piercing the body like a delicate bundle of nerves . Broadly speaking , this instrument was probably made in France in the days when aristocracy prospered , and danced stately minuets at the court of " Le Grand Monarch " : when that cultured son of tapisier , Moliere , wrote his immortal comedies for the amusement of the haute monde , and Jean Baptiste Lully 's impudence and genius placed him upon the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boileau denounced as a coquin tenebreaux , a caur has , and a bat/Yon odieux ? was possessed of talents which quite equalled his gifts as a composer of operas . He could write such divine inspirations as " Bois Epais " : could revolutionise the " ballet de la tour " by the introduction of the pirouette and sprightly allegro : could play the fiddle to perfection , // and conduct his band of " Petits Violons " in a manner to make them quickly famous . He could pen mischievous verse ; take advantage of court squabbles and turn them to good account , and used his histrionic gifts to the most satis factory ends . Many a time did Lully 's im personations of the exquisitely comic situations in which Moliere delighted to place his characters , obtain for him the King 's pardon when his Majesty had been fairly exasperated by the unscrupulous actions of his " Surintendant de la Musique . " The polygamy scene in M. de Pourceaugnac was one of Maitre Lully 's most effective parts for this purpose , and it is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Bourgeois Gentilhorme i must have been interpreted by a man who had him-self risen from obscurity to wealth and fame . It is in the latter witty comedy that we hear of the trumpet marine and its position at that time . Bewildered M. Jourdain 's music-master is ad vising him to give concerts twice a week at his house . LE MAITRE DE MUSIQUE Au reste , monsieur , ce n'est pas assez ; it s6 CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS faut qu'une personne comme vous , qui etes magnifique et qui avez de ? inclination pour les belles choses , ait un concert de musique chez soi tous les Mercredis ou tous les Jeudis .

In spite of Moliere 's just , or unjust ridicule , the marine trumpet figured in the royal band of Louis XV . Several names of artists who // played this instrument at the French court are recorded in the Etat de la France for 1702 , and among them we find Danican Philidor , a favourite musician of Louis , " le bien aims " ( ? ) and as rampant a chess player as was his contemporary Diderot . Whether from motives of economy or because the marine trumpet was looked upon as " no great shakes " ( as our Yankee cousins say ) , all players of that instrument at the French court were also performers on a species of hautbois ? now obsolete ? called the Cremorne . How these virtuosi managed to juggle notes out of both instruments at the same time , history does not relate , but in the face of such a feat as that achieved by Don Jumpedo , who nightly jumped down his own throat at the Little Theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem possible . England was not behind France in her use of the marine trumpet . Gay King Charles would have all things at court in accordance with the French fashion , and the marine trumpet doubtless found its way to the British coast in the company of truffles , perruques , pirouettes , and long - ear 'd puppy dogs . Whether it was bundled in with the Cremorne , as was its fate // in France , or ignored , as in Italy , is not recorded , but its advent was apparently announced in the following stirring advertisement published in The London Gazette for 4th February 1674 : A rare concert of Trumpets Marine , never before heard of in England . If any persons desire to come and hear it they may repair to the Fleece Tavern near St fames ' about two of the clock in the afternoon every day in the week except Sundays . Every concert shall continue one hour and so begin again . The best places are one shilling and the other sixpence . " The marine trumpet was not only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a market value of its own , for we find in Thomas Shadwell 's play , The Miser , of that period , that a certain loan includes a " Bolona lute , a roman Arch lute , 2 gittars , a Cremona Violin , a Lyra Viol , i Viol da Gambo , and a Trumpet-Marine , very fit for you if you be a lover of musick . " But it was in Germany ? the scene 9f the trumpet marine 's birth  --  that it found its real vocation . In that land of sausages and romance , beer and love sonnets , it was known under the double title of " Trummelscheit " ? from its resemblance to a sword sheath ? and " NonnenTrompett , " for the reason that the nuns themCHATS // to cope with the mouth-distorting horn ; yet they required an instrument of that type to add selves employed it in their convents . The delicate lips of the fair religeuses were unable 6o CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS vigour to their heaven-sent praises . Their difficulty was in reality not unlike that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at rehearsal to sustain a certain note . " It is very easy for you , Mister Baumgarten , to say , hold out that note , " replied he quietly , " but who is to find the vind ? " The wind instruments must have their human bellows , but these being weak , the marine trumpet became a substitute for the horn , and every German cloister was furnished with , and employed , a nonnen-trompett or nonnen geige . Until almost the end of the eighteenth century , this quaint custom continued , after which the nuns apparently grew bolder and fearlessly attacked double-basses and violoncellos and whole orchestras of instruments . Kastner , writing at the beginning of the nineteenth century , says : " All who go to Lichtenthal near Baden can hear the nuns of the convent of this name sing divine service with an orchestral accompaniment in which many of them took part , " which proves that even at that date the custom of supplying their own music had not been excluded from convent life . How the marine trumpet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that possibly // finds its solution in the form of the instrument itself . The shape in its earliest form resembled the long speaking-trumpet familiar to sailors . Thus we can account for the nautical touch which is given to this instrument by the first half of its title , while the trumpet part must be engendered by the timbre produced by the ingenious arrangement of the bridge . One does not often find the correct bridges on the existing marine trumpets . To be accurate , the bridge should be made of wood in the form of a shoe . The heel part should be attached to the table of the instrument and the gut string passed over it , while the toe part should rest unattached upon a little square of inlaid ivory or glass . The toe acts like the baton of the chef d'orcbestre ; each throb of the pulsating string is faithfully translated by a tap upon the ivory or glass when the player sets the string in vibration with his bow . It is this ingenious arrangement that contrives to give a sonorous burring ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonies of the marine trumpet . Mr E. J. Payne , who wrote the able article upon this instrument in Sir George Grove 's " Dictionary of Music and Musicians " ( first edition ) , there says : " The facility with // which the marine trumpet yields its natural harmonies is due to its single string and its lop-sided bridge . Paganini 's extraordinary effects in harmonics on a single string were in fact produced by temporarily converting his violin into a small marine trumpet . As is well known , that clever player placed his single fourth string on the treble side of the bridge , screwing it up to a very high pitch , and leaving the bass foot of the bridge comparatively loose . He thus produced a powerful reedy tone and obtained unlimited command over the harmonics . " Michael Praetorius , writing in i62o , gives a good deal of interesting information about the marine trumpet . He says that its ancient origin is undoubted : that the roaming musicians played upon it in the streets ; and plasters it with faint praise by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance than close to it . " Marin Mersenne , most exact and careful critic , scribbling in Paris sixteen years later , discusses this instrument lengthily . In the course of his remarks ? which are full of interest ? he mentions that the marine trumpet was very difficult to play for the reason ( oh ! mark this , ye modern violoncellists of the dexterous digits ) that it was necessary to move the thumb or another finger // with swiftness . " I have no doubt , " he adds , " that one could not play it perfectly until one had studied it as long as the lute or viol . " Mersenne 's allusion to the thumb movement of course speaks for itself , still , it is interesting to note more particularly that the movable thumb was employed by marine trumpet virtuosi long before it was ever included in the technique of the violoncello . The genius of Berteau was the means of introducing thumb movement as a special aid to the high positions on the violoncello , in the first half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained unknown . Truly there is nothing new to be discovered ! Here was the modern violoncellist 's particular recourse in use probably a century or so before he became slightly acquainted with it as a novelty , at the beginning of the eighteenth century . To make a long story short , and end the tale of the marine trumpet , we will briefly outline its origin . In ancient times it was nothing more nor less than the monochord , an instrument , as we know , invented by Pythagoras of Samos , for measuring musical sounds , B.C. 530 . When he departed this life , this learned Greek exhorted his disciples to " strike the monochord " and there64 CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS by rather inform their understandings than trust to their ears in the measurement of intervals . His followers and pupils not only hearkened , but performed , and thus from century to century the monochord was preserved . It acted as bass to the rebecs of the Middle Ages ; it replaced the horn in the German convents ; it originated the thumb movement ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into vogue in Germany in the first half of the sixteenth century . From the pictures and descriptions of these " Geiges " given by authorities of the period , the earliest were made in two kinds ? i.e. those with bridges and those without . Both appear in complete quartets , and both were provided with six or more strings . With the bridgeless " Geiges , " or viols , we may adopt Toole 's remark about China in one of his inimitable impersonations . " China , " said he , " is divided into two parts , China proper and China improper . With the latter we will , of course , have nothing to do . " As a matter of fact we do n't want to have anything to do with these bridgeless viols or " Geiges , " because in our heart of hearts we feel very dubious as to their existence . Though we may tremble when we say it , we instinctively assign their creation to some facile artist long since // passed away . Either this erring gentleman forgot to sketch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more nor less than big guitars beside which the officious delineator added a bow . In any case we will dispense with them and hasten to that immediate predecessor of the violoncello , the viola da gamba , a leg viol , which was known all over Europe by its Italian name . To begin with the makers of these and their kind , we find the earliest known names are those of Hans Frey , and Jean Ott , who worked in Nuremberg in the first half of the fifteenth century . It may be remembered that Nuremberg was at that time one of the most active commercial centres in Europe , and in addition fostered all the talent and intellect of the day . Within its precincts dwelt the poetic cobbler , Hans Sach , penning his four thousand master songs , his numberless comedies and tragedies , and making slippers for dainty Eva besides . Then there was Adam Kraft , modelling his limestone tabernacle in the Church of Lawrence , and Peter Vischer , the brass worker ? and Albert Durer . Before this illustrious name we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viol , while the viols to be found in his paintings are doubtless most accuratelv nortraved for ? was not Hans Frey the viol66 CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS maker his father-in-law ? It is said that Hans Frey amassed considerable wealth in his native town , but his affluence was certainly not due entirely to the patronage of his viol-playing clientele , for we know that he was a " respected citizen skilled in all things , " and that not the least of his accomplishments was his skill in copper repousse work . Many are the decorative figures , tankards , cake moulds , and other char acteristic designs which owe their existence to his expert fingers . How redolent are they of guilds , master-singers , rules , institutions , and all the elephantine conceit and narrow-mindedness which went to make the life of the middle-class Nuremberg citizen ! After Hans Frey and Jean Ott we hear of Joan Kerlino who , according to Fetis , worked at Brescia , in Lombardy , in 1449 . A " viola da Braccio , " or arm viol , of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koliker , in 1804 , mention of which had been made by De Laborde in his " Essai sur la Musique " some twenty-five years previously . ' Herr von Wasielewski traces Kerlino 's name to a German origin , assuming that he settled in // Brescia and founded a school there . If this most probable assertion be true , then it follows , " as does the night the day , " that the Italian viola family owes its creation to Germany . Notwithstanding Germany 's precedence in the matter of originating the viol form , it is curious to note that the earliest known book in which a picture of a viol is to be found is that by Carmine Angurelli , which was published in Vienna in 1491 , just forty-three years after the German Kerlino is said to have been making viols in Brescia . A copy of the little work is in the British Museum , and the woodcut of a seven-stringed viol which graces its title-page is a type ahead of its time.l It is quite equal to the viols shown in Hans Judenkiinig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna thirty years later , and far in advance of any representation of a viol in Martin Agri-cola 's " Musica Instrumentalis , " which appeared in 1528 . The form of Angurelli 's viol has much more grace than the German " Geiges " // of that date . There are no upper bouts , the curve from the joint of the neck sweeps straight down to the lower bouts , a shape , by-the-by , adopted for his grand old tenors by Gasparo da Salo , the Brescian maker , at a later date . The head of the viol is square , it has seven pegs , and one which projects at the side of the head and supports two more strings . The bridge is well delineated , and is almost identical with the familiar form now to be seen on every violoncello ; moreover , it stands in the right place and not close to the short tailpiece as we find in Diirer 's pictures . The sound-holes are in the primitive C form , also freely used by Da Salo , and the tailpiece is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following century . Perhaps the most puzzling part of the picture is the bow which hangs on a peg beside this viol , for it is even of a more advanced type than the viol itself . Does this woodcut represent the consummation of Kerlino 's work in Italy , or is this viol and bow but one of those freaks of fancy which leap the bounds of an artist 's idealism and suddenly appear in completeness , as did Minerva from Jupiter 's ingenious brain ? Whichever the case may be , we have in this picture the earliest woodcut representation of // a viola da gamba extant , and to those who enthuse over these things we say : " Look at it in the works where it is to be found ! " ( p. 67f ) . After Kerlino there was a famous performer on the lute in Germany , named Hans Gerle , who made stringed instruments , and contributed to the literature of musical instruments by writ ing his " Musica Teusch , " which was published in 1532 . In 1500 we find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Ventura Linarolli was likewise occupied in Venice in 152o , and Peregrino Zanetti was busy in Brescia in 1540 . Morglato Morello was also a diligent craftsman in Mantua in 1550 , and Gaspard Duiffoproucart was making beautiful viols , lutes , and chittaras at Lyons in 1558 ? Until Dr Henry Contagne published his " Gaspard Duiffoproucart et les Luthiers Lyon naise , " in Paris in 1893 , Choron and Fayolle 's version of this maker 's life which appeared in their " Dictionnaire historique des Musiciens , " in 181o , was pretty generally accepted . According to the latter authorities , Duiffoproucart was born in the Tyrol at the end of the fifteenth century , and worked in Boulogna . He was supposed to have travelled in Germany before settling definitely in Boulogna in 1515 , and when // Francis I. visited that town he made Duiffoproucart a handsome offer to accompany him to France . The King 's proposition proving tempting , Duiffoproucart is said to have accepted it , and made many viols for the musicians belonging to the court orchestras . But apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His health suffered , and for this reason he obtained leave to settle in Lyons . Like a bolt from the blue , however , Dr Coutagne , bristling with authentic documentary evidence , has refuted the whole story . Through his careful research we learn that Duiffoproucart was born at Freising in Upper Bavaria in i 514 : that he established himself in Lyons about the middle of the sixteenth century : that Henry II . of France granted him his " Lettres de naturalite " in 1558 , and that he died in Lyons in 1570 , leaving several children , among whom one son followed his father 's profession . Thus has the life of the Lyons viol-maker confined itself into reasonable limits at last , and instead of our imagining him settling in Boulogna , a young man full of ambition , in 1515 , we now picture him at that date in long clothes , felicitously celebrating his first birthday ; all of which has a tint of an IEsop fable about it which is // most attractive . But there is something even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career by the aid of document and script , and that is ? his much-discussed portrait which is in the Bibliotheque National in Paris . This picture was engraved in Lyons by Pierre Woeiriot in 1562 , and is supposed to have been copied from the original portrait , which graced the back of one of Duiffoproucart 's own viols . At the base of the picture the maker 's name is inscribed and spelt thus : " Duiffoprougcar , " which , by the way , is the most familiar form , but according to M. Coutagne is incorrect orthography . Under the name are two Latin lines which we shall have reason to refer to later , and then follows : " seta. ann . XLVIII , " and the date : 1514 . " The true meaning of these words and figures remained a puzzle until Dr Coutagne solved it by discovering that the Roman figures indicated the age of the maker to be forty-eight at the date of the publication of the engraving , in 1562 , while the Arabian figures give the year of his birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this engraving for evidence of the number of viola da gamba made by Duiffoproucart , we might be led to imagine that he had never // made such an instrument in his life . The artist has represented him as a man of fine physique , surrounded by various specimens of small viols , lutes , and guitars , but no sign of a bass-viol is visible . Notwithstanding the artist 's omission , however , three ? if not four ? of this maker 's viola da gamba are in existence , and if we would see one of these we have not far to go . Indeed , here close beside us , guarded by the policeman 's watchful eye , is a specimen of Duiffoproucart 's skill ( p. 74 ) . It hangs in a good light and its glass house exposes every side of it to view . The property of Sir George Donaldson , there is no doubt but what he has a very unique possession in this singular little bass-viol . Its small proportions suggest an exceptionally large knee viol ( originally it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quinte ) or an instrument especially constructed for use in church processions . The deep brown varnish , with a glint of red in it , is particularly good , and adds to the elegance of the outline and tout ensemble of the viol . The front is free from ornamentation but the back bears an inlaid design , in coloured woods , of a saint and an angel . Round the edges and in the upper part there is an interlaced design of flowers . The // peg-box is surmounted by a horse 's head well carved , while the fingerboard is also inlaid in coloured woods and bears the Latin inscription so indelibly associated with this maker : " Viva fui in Sylvis : fui dura occisa securi Dum vixi tacui : Morte Dulce cano . " and his particular mark is on the back where the neck joins the ribs . This instrument be-longed to the Parisian lathier , M. Chardon , before it became the property of Sir George Donaldson , and , while in the hands of its former owner , aided in identifying the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repos ing in the Musee Instrumental of the Brussels Conservatoire . This beautifully inlaid specimen ? known as the " basso de la ville de Paris , " owing to the fifteenth-century plan of the gay city which adorns the back ? is slightly longer than Sir George Donaldson 's , though its dimensions are smaller than those finally adopted for the violoncello . It has had an adventurous career , this viol , belonging successively to M. Roque-fort , M. Raoul ? an enthusiastic Parisian musical // amateur , who published several compositions for the violoncello as well as a method for that instrument ? and also to the mighty fiddle-maker , J. B. Vuillaume . At the death of the latter it went through many vicissitudes and wandered about Russia , passing through several hands . M. Coutagne describes the beauties of this graceful viola da gamba so accurately and delightfully that we can not do better than quote his words : " One is at first struck by the richness and variety of the decoration , " says he . " The neck curves forward at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions , but the back of this is covered with delicate and complicated carvings representing the head of a woman , a satyr playing a Pan 's pipes , the whole being framed in designs of animals , fruit and musical instruments . The peg-box itself is covered with carved encrustations of a woman playing a lute ; a dog attached by a collar , and other ornamentation . " The upper table is of pine , the back and the ribs are of maple . The front is covered with a dull red varnish , that of the rest of the instrument is clear yellow . A similar contrast is observable in the character of the two tables . The front is covered with representations of // butterflies , and bunches of roses , and carnations in a pot : some birds on a branch and a building of varied shapes , remarkable for a tower and a Chinese pagoda : briefly , a design in the decor ative Dutch style of the seventeenth century . The back , on the contrary , is covered with a complicated marqucterie design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken up with a scene which is apparently inspired by Raphael 's ' Vision of Ezekiel ' ; it represents a profile of St Luke seated upon an ox and being raised in the air towards the clouds from whence angels are seen blowing trumpets . Below this is an unpretentious plan of a good-sized town situated by a stream dotted with islands and surrounded by walls ; more than two hundred houses measure at the most half-a-square-inch , other edifices constitute the background of this picturesque decoration , where some micro scopic figures of men also appear . Inscribed beneath is the name , ' Paris , ' and we have found an almost identical plan , dated 1564 , at the Bibiotheque Nationale . To complete the description of this inlaying we must mention several bunches of flowers which encircle the principal subject . " M. Coutagne says that this viol shows signs // of recutting and also attempts to change the C-shaped sound-holes into the f form , now so familiar to the eye of the connoisseur and virtuoso . The absence of any name signature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour observable between the front table and the rest of the viol , caused several experts to doubt its authenticity until it was placed side by side with this viola da gamba of Sir George Donaldson 's . Then the incontestable evidence given by the close resemblance existing between the two instruments at once allayed all doubts as to the authenticity of the back , head , neck and ribs of the " basse de la vine de Paris . " The front , however , with its dull red varnish and painted design never felt the touch of Duiffoproucart 's hand . Beyond a doubt this is of English manufacture : and more than possibly the work of seventeenthcentury Barak Norman . Can anything be more bizarre than this union of the work of good John Bull Norman and Lorraine Duiffoproucart ? Imagine such methods applied to other beautiful and valuable works of art , and we might come across such incongruities as , Cleopatra 's Needle nicely finished off with a druidical stone , or the // statue of Wellington supporting Napoleon 's head upon its shoulders , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might go on endlessly summing up such horrors were vandalism a ruling power , but fortunately it is not ; even the remotest cottage dweller now knows the value of his various household gods , and only parts with them " at a price . " The third example of Duiffoproucart 's work is known as the " basse de viole au Vieillard ci la chaise d'Enfant . " A drawing of this instrument by M. Hellemacher is included in M. Vidal 's " Instrument a Archet " ( Paris , 1876-78 ) , and M. Soubie also gives a clear representation of it in his " Histoire de la Musique Allemande " ( Paris 1896 ) . In form and size , this viola da gamba resembles the two already mentioned . It is small , the same horse 's head surmounts the peg-box , and the picture on the back is said to have been copied from a design of Baccio Dardinelli , which was engraved by Duiffoproucart 's contemporary , Augustin Venetien . The inlaying is in the characteristic style of the maker , in several coloured woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur Chardon ? exists in Switzerland and completes // the number of known examples of violas da gamba by this maker . Not many yards away from this graceful Duiffoproucart viol of Sir George Donaldson 's is a viola da gamba of strikingly beautiful workmanship . The inlaying is exquisitely rich in ivory and tortoise-shell , reminiscent of the luxurious decorations lavished by past makers on that much-treasured instrument ? the lute . As you gaze at this viol 's profuse charms , you are seized with a longing to assume a mantle of gorgeous ostentation , to powder your hair , and wrap rich brocades around you , to dance stately minuets , to discuss my Lady Castlemaine and that pretty , witty jade , Nell Gwynne , behind your fan , to traverse London in a chaise ii porteur , to listen to the King 's four-andtwenty fiddlers " at Whitehall : in short , ? to comport yourself as a loyal subject of Charles II . But before we allow ourselves to lapse into such delights , we have here two interesting photographs of an Andrea Amati masterpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-eight bow instruments sent to Charles IX. , King of France , by Pope Pius V. We shall linger over these pictures with more than ordinary interest , for the reason that they // introduce us to the first wavering incursions of the violoncello against the viola da gamba . This Amati violoncello was but the advance guard of the main body which followed at a later date . Very slowly , but yet surely , the violoncello ousted the gamba , but its victory was not a matter of delight to everyone . Many were the comments upon the matter , and M. Hubert le Blanc even wrote a clever little book upon the subject entitled , " Defense de la Basse de Viole contre les Enterprises du Violon et les Pretensions du Violoncel . " This was brought out in Amsterdam in 1740 , and it is said that the author was so delighted to find a publisher , after having tried every firm in Paris , that his enthusiasm led him to rush off to Amsterdam and settle there , when he found a publisher in that town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can sit down close to this beautiful majolica and endeavour to place Duiffoproucart and Amati in the world of music which surrounded them . Come ! Figure CHAT THE THIRD The Renaissance ? The Influence of the Netherlands School ? A brief Outline of the growing Use of the Viol in Germany , Italy , England , France IT must be allowed that both Gaspard Duiffo proucart and Andrea Amati were fortunate in living at a time when Art , Science , and Litera ture had taken a new lease of life . The meet ing of sixteenth-century modernity with antique culture had created a new atmosphere of learn ing ; in a word , the Renaissance had dawned , and progress had begun its march over Europe . Il Divino Raphael , Leonardo da Vinci , Savonarola , Galilei , Lassus , were as comets in the horizon of advancement .

Sebastian Virdungcompiled a species of miniature Grove 's dictionary devoted to the musical instruments of his time . The work was published in his native town , and was afterwards extensively cribbed by Agricola and Luscinis . The numerous woodcuts with which Virdung 's work is interspersed are of interest , especially when such guileless incongruities as a " Grosse Geigen "  --  without a bridge ? and a " Kleine Geigen " ( a rebec ) with a bridge present themselves . Ten years after Virdung , Hans Judenkiinig was busy penning little pieces for voices and stringed instruments , a style of composition that counted numerous imitators at a later date , both on the Continent and in England . His manuscript ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of a number of short pieces , songs and dances , with the lute and viol pieces written in tablature . A precious copy of this work is jealously preserved in the Royal Library at Vienna . When one realises that it is easily within human capacity to feast // upon its secrets , one can not help wishing that a " magic carpet " could be requisitioned to take us to the spot where it now lies , at once . Could this be accomplished , and we were suddenly confronted with Judenkunig 's dog-eared elderly tome , our feeble attempts at description would collapse like a Gibus hat . There is something about time-honoured volumes that commands silence . There are other points of interest about Judenkiinig 's work besides that of its being the earliest attempt to mingle instruments in a methodical concerted manner . For instance , the title-page monopolises our attention , for the name Geygen is among the first to be found in print . Then again , further on , there is a woodcut representation of a man standing erect and playing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him.l The instrument does not touch the ground , and , doubtless , it is attached round the player 's neck by a cord or ribbon , although the artist has not shown anything of that description . Similar woodcuts of the period intimate that this manner of playing the bass-viol was not at all uncommon during the sixteenth century . // The custom was , doubtless , a survival of those " musiciens ambulants , " the minstrels , who could not be burdened with many accessories , and , like the Egyptian camel , carried their belongings on their backs . It was doubtless with their fiddles slung round their necks that the Chester minstrels sallied forth in the reign of King John , and , unarmed , conquered the besieging Welshmen by making such a noise that their enemy imagined themselves to be opposed by an overwhelming force , and flew . Also , at a later date , it is easy to imagine the genial Anthony Wood desiring to escape a little from University pedagogism and stealing out with five chosen comrades " in poor habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their livings . " Roaming the country with their viols on their backs , Wood states that they went to " Farringdon Fair , " and , to the house of Mr Thomas Latton , at " Kingston I3akepaze , " who gave them money and sent drink out to them . After playing dance music at the inn and visiting other private houses , a most depressing encounter with some soldiers considerably damped Anthony Wood 's spirits . These men of war forced them to play in an open field without paying them a penny . " Most of my companions , " // says he , referring to the incident , " would afterwards glory in this , but I was ashamed and could never endure to hear of it . " Among the five gentlemen who assisted in this escapade he mentions that " Edmund Gregorie , B.A. , and gent . corn . of Mert . Coll. , Ox. , played the bass-viol . " Another call for playing the bass-viol in the position depicted by Hans Judenkiinig came from that all-powerful patroness of music ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious processions , the bass-viol was attached round the neck of the performer . A small hole was made in the upper part of the back of the instrument so employed and a peg inserted . A cord or chain was attached to this peg , and passed round the player 's neck ; an arrangement which allowed him to play with some degree of ease . Bass-viols so employed gained the title of " viola da Spala , " or shoulder viols , in Italy , from the position in which they were held . The early violoncellos , which were of a small size ? not the size destined to live ? were submitted to a similar chaining and carrying ; of course , thumb movement and the numerous treasures of the high positions were unknown , and the player confined his efforts to the first position . // Two years after Hans Judenki.inig 's publication , Martin Agricola , whose real name was Sore or Shor , published his " Musica Instrumentalis Deudsch , " a remarkable work , both from the point of view of literature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viols of the day , and they are probably there found for the first time in complete O artets , with the names under each instrument as follows : ? " Discantus " ( treble ) , " Altus , " " Tenor , " " Bassus . " The tuning of all these viols at this period was always regulated by that prescribed for the lute . Gerle and Judenkiinig states this to be composed of fourths , with a third intervening , while Agricola instructs the executant to " Draw up your fifth string as high as you may That it may not be broken when on it you play . " This confusing method was even practised in the following century , for the worthy John Playford , in his " Introduction to the Skill of Music " ( Twelfth Edition , 1694 ) , tells the would-be player of the bass-viol that : " When you begin to Tune , raise your Treble or smallest String as high as conveniently it will bear without breaking ; then stop only your Second or // Small Mean in F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treble open , " and so on with each string . Imagine a modern orchestra tuned according to this recommendation ! Turning to Italy during the same period , we find much of interest . There a princely school of musicians had grown from the seeds scattered by those Netherlanders who became welcome guests of the Medici and other great Italian families . The cultured cliques of dilettanti , who were to be found in almost every town in Italy , were speeding the advancement of music and musical instruments , while other nations were at a musical standstill . Amateur viol players were far from few , and some idea of the growing popularity of the instrument may be gathered from the fact that the contemporary painters elected to introduce it into their pictures . Raphael 's painting , of " Saint Cecilia " ? now in the Dresden Gallery ? gives a faithful representation of the form of the viol of the period , in the instrument which lies at her feet . It has no strings upon it , and how the well-drawn bridge stands upright without support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Melozzo da Forzi , which graces the walls of the Sacristie of St Peter 's in Rome , // Among the musical angels there represented is one who plays on a viol . The strings of this instrument are depicted raised to the accustomed distance from the table of the viol , but no trace of a bridge to support them is visible . Paul Veronese also elected to introduce the viol into his masterpiece , the " Marriage in Cana of Galilee , " which is in the Louvre in Paris . The group of viol players in the background have a special interest when one realises that it is Titian who is playing the bass-viol , while behind him may be seen Tintoretto playing the alto-viol , and Paul Veronese himself the tenorviol . The treble-viol ? called Discantus by Agricola and Discant in England ? is in the hands of an ecclesiastic . In Titian 's picture entitled the " Music Lesson , " to be seen in the National Gallery , he has shown the custom of singing and playing to the accompaniment of a bass-viol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Virgin , " in the same gallery , demonstrates another practice of the period in his two angels playing the lute and viol . Many other similar examples of viols are to be found in the paintings and engravings of that time , and in every case it is observable that ( I ) viols were entirely subservient to the voice ; ( 2 ) that neither artist , // engraver , nor dilettanti paid much attention to the violins and violoncellos which were being made by Andrea Amati in Cremona . That the shape of all viols was doubtless influenced by the advent of the stranger violin and still more foreign violoncello , is probable ; indeed , one can observe the coming ascendancy of the new form in the bass , which Domenichino has placed in the hands of his matchless " St Cecile . " The f f holes are full of grace , the primitive C form being entirely cast aside . The whole outline of the gamba too is very handsome , and its resemblance to the bass-viol by the old Brescian , Pelegrino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris Conservatoire , is so exact that it is easy to imagine that that instrument , served as Domenichino 's model . In the first half of the sixteenth century , the tentative efforts made by such men as Galilei , Cavalieri , and Peri towards the composition of music of a more dramatic character than that which surrounded them at that time , resulted in a higher status for the viola da gamba , and later , for the violoncello . For the latter it was a waiting game , but " tout vient d celui qui Bait attendre . " One result of the general agitation among musical circles was the appearance of a // notable book on the art of playing viols by Silvestro Ganassi del Fontego . This interesting work , entitled " Regola Rubertina , " was published in Venice in 1542 , and was exclusively devoted to the art of fingering and tuning treble and bass viols . A most important fact is to be learnt from the inscription on the title-page , which states among other particulars that the book is suitable for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a surer technique . Perhaps nowhere in Italy was the dominant idea of restoring the learning of the ancient classics more deeply and fittingly rooted than in the birthplace of the greatest medieval poet ? Dante . In beautiful Florence there were coteries composed of the most prominent men of the day who found a common cause in their zeal for the revival of the culture and polish of former ages . The house of Giovanni Bardi , Count of Verino , was more especially a meeting-place for the restless spirits of the day . Among the company who there assembled frequently was Vincenzio Galilei ? the father of the astronomer ? Jacopo Corsi , Ottavino Rinuccini , Strozzi , Jacopo Peri , and Emilio Cavalieri . To Peri is accorded the honour of writing the first opera , and to Cavalieri the first oratorio ? two mighty steps these // towards the emancipation of musical instruments , for both these forms of composition gave birth to the orchestra . Bent upon freeing music from the severe canonical style to which the Church confined it , Galilei made an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he himself sang sweetly to the accompani ment of a bass-viol before the Bardi dilettanti.l After this effort , Emilio Cavalieri , a Roman gentleman of good family , and another devoted member of the Bardi coterie , wrote the important La Rappresentazione di Anima e di Corpo , wherein he brought about a more equal unison of voice , poetry , and instruments . This com position was performed at the Church of Vali cella , in Rome , and the orchestra consisted of a Harpsichord , a double Guitar , two Flutes , and a Basso Viola da Gamba ( double bass-viol ) . No separate parts were given to the performers , so doubtless they were left to work out their way through the maze of figures and signs which graced the Harpsichord part . These two experi ments led to others of a similar kind . Then Jacopo Peri , another of the Bardi faction , who moved in the highest circles of Florentine society , essayed a still higher flight . Instigated to the // effort by Jacopo Corsi ? another Florentine nobleman , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day ? and Rinuccini the poet , he attempted a musical drama which was believed to be identical in style with that of the ancient Greek tragedies . This work is the earliest known opera , it was entitled Dafne , and was performed at the Palazzo Corsi in 1597 . According to Giov . Batt . Doni , " it charmed the whole city , " so that three years later Peri was commissioned to write an opera to be performed on the occasion of the marriage of Henry IV . of France with Maria di Medici . The title of this second opera was Euridice ; it also scored a great success , and in the preface to the composition , Peri himself records that Jacopo Corsi played the graviciembalo ( the piano of the period ) , while the rest of the orchestra comprised : a chitarrone ( a kind of guitar ) which was in the hands of Grazio Moritalvo ; a lyra grand ( species of bass-viol with a large number of strings ) played by Battista del Violino ( note the name ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sani . Thirty years later Giovanni Legranzi introduced the viola da gamba into his orchestra , and five years after that a similar number of violas da gamba , together with two contrabassi // di viola , are included in the orchestral score of that mighty innovator , Claudio Monteverdie , in his opera , Orpheus . Music in England at the end of the fifteenth century was but another name for noise . The dignified minstrel of former times was gone , as was also the significance of his title . True , there still existed little bands of wandering musicians who claimed the name , but they were composed entirely of the most degenerate classes of society . Indeed , so noted were they for their evil practices that it was thought necessary to issue certain regulations to prevent " idle persons under colour of minstrelsy going messages or other feigned business , being received in other men 's houses to meate and drinke . " But neither protective laws nor Edward IV . ' s charter , which was granted to keep outsiders from assuming the livery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had formerly been the privilege of their sect . Thus music and musical instruments having lost their chief support in the lordly though uncultured minstrel , other patrons had to be found . In Henry VII . ' s reign , Dr Burney tells us of a certain " Dr Fayrfax of Newark // Cornyshe " and a few others who set popular poetry to music , " which , " says he , in his dry way , " was uncouth but superior to the music . " Then again , we hear in the same reign of the " Stryng Minstrels at Westminster , " and of the " waits " who belonged to each town in England and made " merrie musick for the kynge " when he passed that way . Henry VIII. ? whose musical abilities were of no mean order ? included two viols in the State band in the year 1526 . The fifteen trumpets and ten sackbuts , receiving the most pay , with which the viols had to compete , doubtless allowed them no chance of being heard , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal music ; dejd quelque chose . Henry VIII . ' s son , Edward VI. , increased the number of viols in his musical establishment to eight , which was a significant augmentation , when we find that his father 's sackbuts had been reduced to six . About this time compositions styled " songes for several voyces " came into vogue , no doubt instigated by the visit to these shores of the great Netherlands composer , Orlando Lassus . The first of these " severall voyce " compositions was published by Winken de Worde in 1530 , and we make mention of them here because it was // these very " songes " for " three , fower , and five voyces " that later became " Apt for voyce and vialls , " and were eventually succeeded by that form of composition called " Fantesies . " In 1540 , the Italian gambist , Ferabosco , established himself in London , and gave lessons in the art of viol playing , and , as the cult of the gamba grew in England , ventures in the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the dumb show English play entitled Gorbodic performed in i 56 i ? the earliest English tragedy to be acted on the stage , music was executed by voices and musical instruments between the acts . The first ? act opened with the instructions that : " Firste the Musicke of Violenze began to play , durynge which ( ' came in uppon the stage sixe wilde men clothed in leaues . " Likewise Gascoyne 's : ocastu , of about the same date , was preceded by a dumb show accompanied by viols , cittaras , bandoras , and other musical instruments . The year 1558 saw the publication by Anthony Munday of " A Banquet of Daintie Conceits , " to be sung to the lute , bandora , virginals , or any other instrument , and in 1593 one of the earliest and best music printers of the day , William Barley , brought out an important work entitled " A New Booke of Tablature containing Instructions to guide and dispose the Hand , to play on sundry Instruments , as the Lute , Orpharion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous lutanist John Dowland 's " First Booke of Songes or Ayres of foure Parts , with Tablature for the Lute . So made that all the Parts together , or either of them , severally may he sung to the Lute , Orpharion , or Viol da Gambo . " The year 1599 gives us the Psalms of David , " in Metre to be sung and played on the lute , orpharyon , citterne , or base violl , ' ' by Richard Allison , " to be solde at his house in the Duke 's Place near Alde-gate , " and dedicated to the Countess of Warwick . It is interesting to note that some MS. lute compositions of Allison 's are preserved in the British Museum . In the same year , Thomas Morley , gentleman of the Chapel Royal and pupil of William Byrd , " by whose endeavours , " says Anthony Wood , he became , not only excellent in music , as well as in the theoretical as practical part , but also well seen in the Mathematicks in which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lessons , made by divers exquisite Authers for six Instruments to play together , " dated 1596 . The " six instruments " selected // to " play together " consisted of the " Treble Lute , " " The Pandora " ( a species of bass-lute ) , " The Citterne " ( small guitar ) , " The Base violl , " " The Flute , " and " The Treble violl . " What this mixture sounded like it is difficult to surmise . No doubt the players sat round a large circular table with their " parts " spread out before them ; no doubt there was a fine display of lace ruffles and graceful white hands : no doubt there were many glances exchanged between the coquettish lady with the " Treble Lute " and the ( lark man playing " The Base viol ) " : no doubt the beauties of the " exquisite authors " were perhaps somewhat lost upon these two , but " The Pandora , " " The Citterne , " " The Flute , " and the " Treble violl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to their hearts ' content . Side by side in a ring lay the parts before the performers then , but to-day , what a strange irony of Fate it is that has scattered them about in different museums and libraries . In the British Museum you will find the Flute part printed by " Thomas Snodham for John Brown " and " sold at his shop in Dunstones Church Yard in Fleet Street 1611 . " The " Trebel violl " part is preserved in the library G // at Magdalen College , Oxford . " The Pandora " part is at Christ Church , Oxford , and the " Cittern " part is in the Bodleian Library , Oxford . The " Base Viol " part and the " Treble Lute " part have , curiously enough , disappeared completely . Did the lady of the " Lute " jilt the gentleman of the " Base violl " and he in a fit of rage ? consequent on the event ? destroy the treacherous parts that were the means of bringing them together ; or , did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the - parts ? so full of tender reminiscences ? to be buried with them ? Morley attempted no other composition of the kind , for the very good reason that he did not supply a " public want " as do so many of our modern composers and authors . The reissue of his work in 1611 proved that it was appreciated at a later date , but at the time of the first publication the English people had not yet broken away from the habit of combining voices with musical instruments . So Morley had to capitulate , and in 1600 contented himself with pleasing the popular taste by bringing out " The first booke of Little Aires to sing and play to the Lute with the Base violl . " People delighted in singing these little " Aires " in those days . It was a favourite pastime and must have put a // stop to a great deal of gossiping , scandalous chit-chat . The " Base viol , " like the guitar in the barber 's shop , was kept hanging on the wall , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how delightful it was to reach down the " Base violl " and sing a " Little Aire " to its accompaniment ! John Maynard wrote a similar set of compositions which were also published by Snodham in the same year . These he named " The XII . Wonders of the World , " classified under the following headings : ? " The Courtier , " " The Deune , " " The Souldiour , " " The Phisition , " " The Merchant , " " The Country Gentleman , " " The Bachelor , " " The Marryed Man , " " The Wife , " " The Widow , " " The Maide . " Each of the little songs arc provided with an accompaniment for the lute and bass-viol . The style of the poetry is quite . in the Gilbertian vein , as may be judged by the following lines purporting to describe the duties of a medical man :  --  " Studie to uphold the slippery fate of man Who dies when we have done the best and all we can . From Practise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the knowne receipt or Pothecaries bill . The Earth my faults cloth hide The World my cures doth see What youth and time effects is oft ascribed to me. " zoo CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS This curious and interesting little volume concludes with some " lessons " for the lute and viola da gamba , in all of which the player of the bow instrument never quits the first position . The whole is dedicated to Maynard 's " Honoured Lady and Mistris the Lady Joane Thymne of Cause Castle in Shropshire , " to whom he addresses a ponderous hyperbole on her gracious qualities beginning with the amiable wish that Nestor 's years on earth , and Angels ' happiness in heaven " might be hers . The musical attainments of " La Belle France " were full of interest during the same period . At the beginning of the fifteenth century the figure of the good King Rene of Anjou faces his kingdom , viol in hand and whistling the refrain of his latest composition . A kingly creature with noble gifts of mind and person which opened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigour with the culture of Provence . The influence of this minstrel Prince in the domains of Art was powerful at the time , yet it was soon obliterated by the coarse tastes of his conqueror , Louis XI . An instance of this monarch 's musical vagaries is instanced by his command that a concert of pigs should CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS l o t be provided for him . The master of the Royal Music , M. ? Abbe de Baigne , complied with the demand of his royal master by inventing an ingenious arrangement which was a mixture of pork and piano . He procured swine of various ages and sizes , placed them in a tent and erected a keyboard , the notes of which were each fur nished with a spike which was to each pig like the business end of the nail to the man who inadvertently came into contact with it . When the good Abbe attacked the notes vigorously , each pig became acquainted with his own par ticular spike and burst forth into long and pro nounced squeaks . Heretofore we have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as instrumentalists as due to the inventive caprice of the writer . Con-fronted with Louis XI . ' s practical application of such idiosyncrasies , the following couplet is but a representation of real life after all : " Come dance a jig To my granny 's pig With a rowdy , rowdy , dowdy ; Come dance a jig To my Granny 's pig And pussy cat shall crowdy. " 1 We assume that the pig and the cat formed the 1 02 CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS instrumental part of the performance , while the guests footed it lightly . An instance of feline dexterity is afforded us in the following : " A cat came fiddling out of a barn With a pair of bag-pipes under her arm ; She could sing nothing but fiddle cum fee , The mouse has married the bumble-bee ; Pipe cat ? dance mouse We 'll have a wedding at our good house . " 1 Louis XII . ' s visits to Italy encouraged the further spread of those artistic tastes introduced by King Rene . He imported the Italian crafts and architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court of Francis I. , had not its equal in Europe . It was Louis XII . ' s influence and taste that laid the foundation of a new era in French musical art , a foundation upon which Francis I. built a solid structure . This monarch 's tastes were of great assistance to art , for he keenly encouraged the importations of Italy 's treasures and gave appointments at his court to the Netherlands musicians . He sanc tioned the establishment of Petrucci 's system of music printing by Robert Ballard ? who for many years rejoiced in the privilege of being " seul // imprimeur de la musique de la chambre , chapelle , et menu plaisirs du roi . " The King was himself a lute and guitar player of no mean order , and he could sing his own chansons " to the accompaniment of these instruments , excellently . It was this monarch who founded the royal " musique de chambre " by establishing a separate band which should perform in his anteroom and on particular occasions . The services of these musicians were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapelle " band , and included some of the best artists of the day , among them Claude Gervaise and the famous lutanist Albert were especially noted . Gervaise held a similar post in Henry II . ' s regime and figured also in Charles IX . ' s musical establishment . In 1 556 he published seven books of " Gaillard s , Pavan 's , " and popular songs for four and live viols . The appearance of these compositions in France nearly half-a-century before Morley 's " Consort Lessons for six different Instruments , " in England , is in the nature of an anomaly , seeing that both Maugars and Rousseau state that in their day ( seventeenth century ) the viol was in its youth in France , whereas the English , ? who had received that instrument straight from Italy ? were the finest performers in the world . 1 04 CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS Both Henry II. , and his son , Charles IX. , were loyal to the traditions of the musical tastes of their family . The first of these monarchs we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is quite within the bounds of possibility that his gamba , now before us , and the Amati violoncello , which we are about to discuss , came in contact with one another at the French court . The Machiavelian-like manoeuvres of Marie de Medici at her son 's court did not squash Charles IX . ' s ardent love of music and poetry , any more than Henry VIII . ' s matrimonial imbroglios prevented him from attaining a degree of excellence on the flute . It is said that the French king frequently took part with the . choir of his " Chapelle " in singing Mass in the manner of his father , and that he was greatly attached to his musicians . In spite of his affection for them , however , he advocated low living and high thinking for them . " Poets and musicians resemble horses , " said he , " they become soft and lose their vivacity if surrounded by abundance , let them be nourished but not fattened . " It was during this monarch 's reign that the important event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a distinguished // poet and musician ? Antoine de Baif ' ? took place . The premises of this establishment were situated in the poet 's own home in the Faubourg Saint Marcel . All the most eminent musicians of the day , both native and foreign , were received and handsomely entertained at this " Academie , " and each week a grand concert of vocal and instrumental music was given and regularly attended by Charles IX . Marguerite de Valois , the King 's sister , in imitation of De B ( ( of , also established an " Academie de Musique " at her Palace of Issy and herself presided at the concerts , which were held in the grounds of the chateau . At the base of a limpid fountain the Princess and her musicians assembled each week , and the poets of the day named the fountain ' ' Castalinus " in memory of that which flowed at the feet of Parnassus , consecrated by the ancient Greeks to the Muses . It is under the date 27th October 1572 ? but t Iiree days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Archives Curieuses de 1'Historie de France " 2 records a certain flautist , named 1o6 CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS Nicolas Delinet , receiving money wherewith to buy a " Cremona Violin " : ? " A Nicolas Delinet joeur de Fluste et Violon dudict la somme de 50 livres tourn pour lui Bonner moyen d'achepter ung Violon de Cremonne pour le service dudict Sieur , " so runs the announcement . From this purchase of a Cremona violin , it may be inferred that the exquisite Ainati " set " to which this violoncello belonged had not yet arrived from Italy . Yet they were sent in the year 1572 . The thought presents itself irresistibly that Pope Pius V. sent this handsome present to Charles IX . as a token of his approbation of the St Bartholomew Massacre . The completeness of the " set " : the novelty of shaping the bass instruments in the same form as the violin , and the appropriateness of such a gift to the musicloving Charles , all point to an intimate personal graciousness , which might well be taken for a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " MIKE COIIGLER , of Mush Island , Lexington County , owns a violoncello made of copper which can be heard two miles away .

This exquisite brocade is valued not so much for its rich texture as for the memory of the shapely shoulders of a Du Barry , or a Castlemaine , which it once graced . This china vase : this tapestry : this antique ring ? we have but to look at them and they tell us many an unwritten story , impossible to repeat , and appealing to us alone . Of all the mute romancers carefully preserved from time 's destructive grasp , none can tell such tales as do the grand old fiddles . Those constant yielding companions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many centuries that each curve and bend teems with a secret . Take this masterpiece of Andrea Amati for instance ( p. 114 ) . Made in Cremona by a man of the mature age of fifty-two or thereabouts , the impulsive hazard of his youthful efforts had long since passed away : definite aim had developed his gifts , and ripe experience had given his hand an exquisite cunning . Little did he think as he sat in his sunny Cremona workshop , smoothing the back of this violoncello , bending the ribs , letting in the purfled edges , while he chatted now and again with a neighCHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS bour who dropped in , that he was building a monument to his own memory . Sent with its fellows to the French court , this violoncello arrived , with the painted armorial bearings of Charles IX. , exquisitely pure and fresh in colour , upon its back and sides . It was relegated to the King 's " Chapelle , " or private oratory , doubtless occupying a humble position in the band where the Duiffoproucart viol was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old ones lost their skill : seeing the intrigues of the court life : hearing the cries of , " The King is dead ! Long live the King ! " observing each phase of human love and folly , and watching the vagaries of Princes for over two hundred years . Truly your tales would outrival Balzac himself could you speak , and your royal title ? " the King " ? is but a welldeserved panegyric . At the time of the French Revolution , in 1790 , this violoncello is said to have been still in use at the court of the unfortunate Louis XVI . On the 6th and 7th of October in that year the mob destroyed the whole magnificent " set " ? consisting of twenty-four violins ( twelve large , and twelve small ) , six tenors , and eight basses ? to which it belonged . Two of the violins of // this number were afterwards recovered by Viotti 's pupil , M. J. B. Cartier , and one of the small violins belonged to George Somes , Esq. , in 1884 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? are apparently the only members of the " set " that survived the reckless vengeance of the mob . When one realises how easily such delicate constructions are ruined in sacrilegious hands , their preservation in the midst of the pandemonium , which reigned supreme at that time in Paris , is miraculous . After the Revolution a glimpse of the whereabouts of " The King " is afforded us by a pencilled note written by the father of its present owner on the back of the frame , containing the interesting slip of paper which has accompanied this violoncello for at least a hundred years . On the paper itself the following inscription is written in French characters : Basse faitte par erndre ermati Luthicr a cremonne eu italic en 1572. envoyez par le pipe 3 : a Charles 9 roi de france pour sa chapelle. ? avec ses amories et se devise , pietate justicia . " Turning this little framed document over , the three faintly pencilled words , " Duport had it , " seem to imply that " The King , " during the Napoleonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil , Jean Pierre Duport , known generally as " Duport Paine . " If this was the case , then this violon cello went with him to the court of Frederick the Great at Berlin . It is more probable , how-ever , that it fell into the hands of Jean Pierre 's brother , Jean Louis Duport ? one of the finest violoncellists of his day ? as he became a member of Napoleon 's band and professor at the Conservatoire of Music . Another pencilled note in the same hand , at the back of the frame , stating that " A Hollander brought it to Betts in 1812 , and he sold it to H. W. Curtis 71 ( after-wards Sir William.Curtis ) still further points to Duport , the younger , as its owner , for Duport was in sore straits at one time . This accom plished artist , it may be remembered , also held an appointment at the court of Frederick the Great , but when the defeats of Auerstiidt and Jena placed Prussia in the position of a suppliant at the feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the violoncello had belonged to his brother it is possible that Jean Itletre may have ceded it to the more accomplished Jean Louieand the latter brought it to Paris in 1 14 CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS 18o6 , where his misfortunes induced him to part with it to a dealer . The next we hear of " The King " is on the death of Sir William Curtis , when it figures in the catalogue of his musical instruments ? which were sold by auction on 3rd May 1829 ? as : " Lot 9 , a violoncello by Andrea Amati Crenwnencis Faciebat , 1572 . A document was given to the proprietor when he purchased this instrument , stating that it was presented by Pope Pius V. to Charles IX. , King of France , for his chapel . It has been richly decorated , the arms of France being on the back and the motto ' Pietate et Justitia ' on the sides . The tone of this violoncello is of extraordinary power and richness . " The Rev. Canon A. H. Bridges , Rector of Beddington , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Curtis 's survivors . On the death of Canon Bridges , in 1891 , it became the property of his son , the present owner , John Henry Bridges , Esq. , of Ewell Court , Surrey . Some connoisseurs describe " The King " to be nothing but a curiosity at the present time . This is hardly correct , for , in spite of its having been very much knocked about in the past , it still retains a sweet quality of tone which makes it a delightful drawing-room instrument . Like // Amati 's fiddles " The King " is of small dimensions ; indeed violoncellos at this early date were nothing but extra large tenors , and it was not until makers turned their attention to evolving violoncellos out of the viola da gamba that the former began to take a prominent place in the ranks of stringed instruments . The transition itself from gamba to the early form of violoncello took place in the second half of the sixteenth century but  --  " Who effected the change ? " Was it lluilh proucart in Lyons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking forth over the sunny plains of Lombardy ? The correct reply is perhaps ? " All 1 " Duiffoproucart reduced the size of the huge German geiges so as to furnish what Rousseau in his " Dictionnaire do Musu1uc " defines as " les instruments cic reiupli.csage . " Previous to tl-ic dispersion of viols into various sizes , they were universally large both in Italy and later in France and England . " The first viols in use in France , " says Jean Rousseau ? the eminent violist ? in his " Traitc de la Viole " ( Paris , 1687 ) , " had five strings , and were very large . . . of such dimensions indeed , that tlhe Pre Mersenne says that a young Page de Musipe could be shut within to sing the treble part , 1 ' 6 CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS while the bass was played upon the self-same instrument " ? an arrangement which certainly could not contribute to the happiness of either the little page , or the bass-viol , and the di-minishing process which necessarily did away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors in the trio . Owing to the breaking up of the viols into various sizes , orchestras grew in proportion , so that we find in the Etat de France for 1645 , that the " Musique de la Chambre de Monsieur " ( Louis XIV . ' s brother ) boasted " Nicolas Fleury " and " Pierre Montigny " as players of the Haute Contre , ' " Pierre Noinne " and " N . . . le Vert " as players of the Taille Basses , ' while " Francois Martin " and " Guil-laume Mercer " disported themselves on the " Taille Haute . " ' In the beginning of the following century , further names of instruments de remplissage , appear in the Paris Opera orchestra : for instance " 2 quintes " 4 " 2 tailies , " 5 and " 3 haute contres . " This was the result of Duiffoproucart 's creation of the small viola da gamba , a size which broke // into many degrees and kinds . Then Andrea Amati made a further step in the right direction by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violin , which had at that time assumed the shape now so familiar . The moot question ? " Was it Andrea Amati in Cremona , or Gasparo da Salo in Brescia who first made violoncellos in the form of the violin ? " ? is of course unanswerable at this space of time . Da Salo was a man of progress , ready to fight for his opinions . He made some fine double-basses and grand tenors which are sought after to this day , and Herr August Reichers , the Berlin violin-maker , possessed a small-sized violoncello by this maker in 1884 . If this instrument was not a cut-down bass-viol , or an exceptionally large tenor , it is apparently a solitary example of a violoncello by Da Salo , but even though its existence be allowed , the numerous violoncellos made by Andrea Amati must necessarily admit him to be ? if not the inventor ? at least the earliest known luthier to make violoncellos . Although Da Salo may be looked upon as no enthusiast where violoncellos were concerned , he was not neglectful in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed no fewer than three fine basses by the Brescian 1 18 CHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS maker , of various sizes , and Mr Hart , in 1875 , owned a small double-bass of Da Salo 's which had been brought from Italy by Tarisio , and was looked upon as the ne plus ultra of its kind . A Da Salo viola da gamba , catalogued as of the year 1570 , was to be seen among the sumptuous display of musical instruments shown at the Special Loan Exhibition held at Fishmongers ' Hall in the summer of 1904 . But , fortunately , we need not rely entirely upon catalogues , description , and speculation for an idea of Da Salo 's skill as a gamba-maker , for , here beside us , in their neat glass house , two examples of the fine old Brescian repose in calm tranquillity , like veterans silently ruminating over many campaigns . They both face us with the quaint C-shaped sound-holes , so dear to the hearts of the old viol-makers , and both display upper tables of remarkably well-chosen evengrained pine wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the seventh is a later invention , for the earliest viols had five strings , then six , and it was not until the last part of the seventeenth century that Sainte Colombe ( some say Marais ) added another to the six . A true unaltered seven-stringed viol is hardly ever to be met with now . A solitary and exCHATS // cellent example , however , was lent by M. Galley to the Special Loan Exhibition at South Kensington in 1872 . This was a remarkably handsome gamba and had remained untouched , with the exception of an attempt to attach sympathetic strings . A further adjunct to be found in this Da Salo gamba before us is the scroll , which curves round in a unique manner like a wisp of twisted ribbon : this never felt the touch of Da Salo 's hand . It may be the work of Barak Norman , for a similar , indeed identical , scroll crowns his gamba now in the Donaldson Museum , but certainly it is not Da Salo 's work . In his day sculptured human and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporaries , he carved these himself , or employed special artists to do so . In Germany the followers of Jacobus Stainer of Absam ? whose favourite ornament was a lion 's head ? freely adopted this practice , but the custom died out first in Italy , where viol-makers discovered that such a system was far from remunerative. ( lose to this gamba of Da Salo 's with the spurious scroll , his second example exhibits his skill as a wood-carver , in the exquisitely chiselled head of an old woman , which surmounts the neck . ' I'lie varnish is slightly darker on this // gamba than on the one beside it . Age is no doubt responsible for this and not the maker himself , as it is also for the black Da Salo fiddles of which some connoisseurs speak with a degree of scorn . It may be noticed that there is but one line of purfling round this gamba . This was such an ordinary custom with Da Salo that comment is unnecessary . It is clumsily let in , lacking the grace and finish expended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all others excelled in the neatness of their purfling , and the customary three lines is always to be met with in their fiddles as well as in those of Stradvarius . The latter , however , on one solitary occasion reverted to one line of purfling in the violoncello upon which Bernard Romberg played for many years . This instrument is unique in many ways , for the gifted Cremonese maker made the back and sides of plane wood and poplar , material which he employed occasionally in the early part of his career , but which he had discarded at the date ( 1711 ) he made the violoncello . Speaking of wood , by-the-by , the proper selection of timber was held to be a matter of great importance by the ancient luthier . M. Fetis , in his Antonio Stradivarius , " has given some interCHATS ON VIOLONCELLOS I2I esting information regarding the source from whence the old viol-makers obtained their wood . He says that maple was sent from Croatea , Turkey and Dalmatia to Venice in the shape of galley oars , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently fre quently at war with them , took care to choose wood with the handsomest wave , knowing well that it would break the more easily . It was from among this selection that the viol-maker had to gather his timber . In his own country there was certainly little difficulty in obtaining wood , but , where would he get such maple as came to him from Dalmatia ? Secretly he welcomed this " . . . thing devised by the enemy " and turned it to good account . The illustrious Da Salo was very partial to pear wood as well as sycamore , which he cut slab-ways from the tree , as did most of his contemporaries . Stradivarius preferred maple to any other wood , but he went with the times and also employed the woods favoured by his brethren , such as poplar , lime , and even grained pine . A species of red pine , common to the Tyrol , and known to the Italian makers by the name of " Azarole , " was more in favour with the Cremona luthier. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south side , the side exposed to the drying rays of the sun , was used . Indeed , this precaution is one which has been observed by makers for over three hundred years , knowing well that it is one of the first aids towards solving the problem : Given : A log of wood . Make : A fiddle . The timber must be blameless , free from knots or blemish , and ? above all ? free from worm , a fate which has destroyed whole forests of pine if the trees are cut at the wrong season of the year . Also the tree must have arrived at a maturity of ten years , and the question of sap flowing through the outer part of the tree must be duly considered . Speaking on this subject , Mr Davidson 1 remarks that , owing to the sap passing through this part of the tree , the wood abounds in saccharine matter and is quickly sus ceptible to decay . In trees which have arrived at maturity , there is no distinction between the sap and heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost uniform . The proper time for cutting trees is when the sap ceases to flow , and experience has deter-mined the month of December to be the best // time for this purpose , as the wood which has been cut during this month has been found to have always been of superior quality to any cut during the other months . Monsieur 1'Abbe Sibre , author of " La Chelonome ou le parfait Lutherie , " which was published at the beginning of the nineteenth century , voices the merits of wood cut in December and January long before Mr Davidson , and adds the admonition that the wood must be cut from between the bark and heart of the tree . The wood being cut as re-quired from the healthy pine or maple , it is sawn into planks , and , ? though the fiddle-maker 's hands are madly twitching to commence opera tions on it , ? subjected to a drying process to be effected by sun and air for at least six years . If at the end of that period of time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may clamp it and cut it and scrape it into the violin or violoncello of his fancy . Monsieur Simoutre , the French violin-maker and author of some patent improvements which , in common with all innovations connected with how instruments , have had no lasting effect , contends that the Dust pine wood conies from Silesia , from La Valtt lint , 1 , es ( . risons , he Simmenthal in the lietnes ( ? Alps , iron ) certain sheltered parts of // the valley of the Lac de Joux , in the Canton de Vaud , Switzerland , and from the southern slopes of the Jura Bernois . Modern violinmakers generally employ maple cut from trees growing on the southern slopes of the Carpathians and also in some parts of the Eastern Alps , but where this is not procurable , it has been found that it is not absolutely necessary to range the Alps or the Carpathians in search of suitable wood , for many a fine violin and violoncello have been made from the wainscot or beam of an old-time cottage or mansion . J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sole purpose of picking up choice bits of pine which had probably formed part of a beam or support in some residence for hundreds of years . Out of these purchases he undoubtedly made some of his finest instruments . His example has recommended itself to many other makers , and only the other day we heard of a contemporary English maker whose best violins and violoncellos have been formed from an old beam obtained from a house near Eltham . Such practices as these certainly place lutherie within the range of everyone so inclined , for , who is there in these days that does not possess a // likely piece of old furniture ? some familiar escritoire , or table , or panel , out of which a possible rival to Cremona 's ehefr-d'oeuvre may be conjured by the aid of gouge , chisel , bending iron , and glue pot . In spite of the timesaving effects which the appropriation of the family heirlooms for this purpose would effect , how much more appealing and poetic were the methods of the ancient luthier , who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture Stradivarius storing up old beams , and tables , on the roof of his house in Cremona ? Can we imagine Guarnerius roaming about the country seeking likely bits of wood in cottages , or the Amatis , or Da Salo , the maker of these gambas , resorting to such a commonplace expedient . No ! a thousand times . They went straight to the forest for their timber , wandered through the misty depths of clustered pines , pondering in the deep silence upon many a knotty point of their craft . Or they stood at times on the rocky borders of the wood , where the trees looked clown upon the valley from whence the sound of the rushing brook could he faintly heard . li'rom a point of vantage they watched the trees being felled : hearkened to the tone they emitted as their // torn limbs bounded from rock to rock : counted the number of circles to ascertain the age of a likely tree : examined the colour with care to judge of its health . If they were satisfied with these various preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planks on the sheltered side of their workshop or on the roof of the same , and watched the hot Italian sun do its work of drying . Not only did the most eminent makers of the past carefully store their own wood , but if they became possessed of a particularly handsome piece they did not scruple to patch and piece it together , so that no scrap of the treasure should be wasted . Gasparo da Salo , as we have already said , was an adept in the choice of wood , and he was fortunate in lighting upon some particularly evengrained pine . In these days his work is looked upon as rough , or , to put it more gently , primitive . The recent researches of I1 Cavalieri Livi ? the keeper of the Brescian state archives ? have , however , proved that this was far from the case in his lifetime . Until the results of the Cavalieri 's investigations were published in the Nuova Antalogia on the 16th August 1891 , nothing definite concerning this maker 's life was known . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary evidence it is now proved that Da Salo 's real name was not Salo at all but Gasparo di Bertolotti , that he rejoiced in a grandfather named Santino di Bertolotti who was a lute-maker at Polpenazze , that his father was one Francesco Bertolotti , a painter familiarly called " Violino " by his friends , and that his son , Gasparo , the future violin-maker , was born at Salo , a small town on Lake Garda , not many miles distant from Brescia . Unfortunately the date of Da Salo 's birth still remains unknown , owing to the loss of the pages from the parish register where it should appear , but the income-tax returns for 1568 state him to be twenty-six years of age at that date , and those for 1588 , forty-five , thus locating his birth approximately in the year 1542 . It is presumed that he learnt his art from his grandfather first , and later from a Brescian viol-maker of the name of Gerolamo Virchi , who stood sponsor to Gasparo 's son , Francesco . The earliest efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow-countrymen , and , this being so , he became discouraged and contemplated trying his fortunes in France . A certain Father Gabriel saw the gifted man 's dispirited efforts , and // also observed his intentions . He was reluctant to see one of his flock go forth to a foreign country , and to prevent such a calamity came forward with a loan of ? 6o . Curiously enough this small sum changed the bent of Da Salo 's life . He remained , and encouraged by the faith of the good priest set to work with such definite aim and earnestness , that as a result he soon established himself in a house with a shop in the Contrada del Palazzo vecchio . This event occurred in the year 1568 . He paid ? 2o rent per annum for this establishment , valued his stock of musical instruments at about ? 60 , and styled himself Magistro di Violini . In 1579 he exhibited the added title of Magistro di Cittaris , and in 1583 called himself Art jfce d'instrumenti musica . Twenty years after his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his residence to the Contrada Cocere , where he claimed to be the owner of violins finished and unfinished valuing quite ? 200 , and where he had acquired the ostentatious title of Magister instrumentorum musicorum . The year 1599 found him purchasing another house in Brescia , situated in the Contrada di St Pietro di Martero , and between 1581 and 1607 he owned land adjoining Calvagese , near Salo . It was at // Calvagese that Da Salo 's son , Francesco , found his bride , the Signora Fior . He also followed the captivating profession of his father , until the latter 's death on the 14th April 1609 , when he apparently lost heart , for from that time he ceased to be a luthier . Probably he sold the excellent business to Da Salo 's gifted pupil , Gio . Paolo Maggini , who had worked as an apprentice in the Brescian master 's workshop for quite eight years , and was then a bachelor of thirty or there abouts . In any case , whether he became pos sessed of the business or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructor fell to his share . On the whole he deserved all the support he gained for he not only equalled Da Salo as a maker but surpassed him in everything save the ugly still sound holes which , for some unaccountable reason , he retained . In the history of the violoncello , it is a puzzling and curious circumstance , that no viola da gamba by Maggini is extant . ' His violins , violas , violoncellos and double-basses have re sisted the onslaught of over three hundred adventurous years , and , this being so , one can-not help wondering why his gambas have not // also withstood time 's ravages . The obvious reply seems to be that , " He made none ! " However , whether he did or did not , his attitude certainly had no effect on the position occupied by the violoncello at that time . The general feeling about the instrument was akin to the sentiments expressed by the Comte de Rabutin in his Epistles " : Not being liked , and yet appearing among them , musicians were confronted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant " in the obscure position of playing the fundamental bass in the music of the Church . As regards the lack of Maggini violas da gamba , circumstantial evidence may be right after all . The man was a genius , and , true to his instincts , sought after new methods rather than personal gain . He threw aside the useless and picked out the good , and , this being so , it is not surprising that he should prefer to turn his attention to the budding violoncello , rather than the pristine viola da gamba. // In the delightful monograph of this maker 's life ? already mentioned ? among the excellent summary of the instruments made by him , there is an interesting description of a quartet of instruments generally known as the " Dumas Set , " from its having once belonged to a family of that name . In an ancient chateau near Lyons the members of the Dumas household passed through the terrors of the first Revolution and saw the establishment of the Empire . They were enthusiastic musical amateurs ? friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music they collected together four magnificent examples of Maggini 's skill . Of the four instruments  --  i.e. violin , viola , violoncello and double-bass ? which comprise the " set , " the violin and viola are of the most characteristic and perfect type , although the violoncello is also excellent . According to Lady Huggins 's description of the last , " it has two lines of purfling , but no ornamental device . ' I'lie bottom circle of the sound-holes is smaller than the top . There is the same under-bevelling of the inside edge of the sound-holes , as in Maggini 's other instruments , the same arching of the model . The wood of the back and the sides is cut on the slab " ( parallel with the // growth of the tree ? a favourite practice with the ancient viol-makers ) . " The back is joined , also the belly , the latter having the wood the ordinary way of the grain , the coarse grain being outside . " As we look at the instrument , the thought involuntarily rises in us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What a curious mixture of the " old " and the " new " is to be found in this instrument . The back cut on the " slab " ? in accordance with the long-standing custom ? and the belly cut in the improved manner . Maggini , although a great innovator , and the first to cut the wood in the new way ? i.e. wedge-ways from the tree ? was evidently in a state of uncertainty when he made this violoncello . To balance matters he mingled the divers ways , yet , in spite of his hesitation , he came nearer to gauging the most equitable proportions for the violoncello than any other maker of his time . It would be of great interest if it were possible to discover by what means Maggini and his predecessors arrived at their conclusions . Whether it was in the manner of old Mrs Tibbins , who made a fiddle by means of a blunt knife , a piece of glass , and a bent file , or , on the principles of Monsieur Felix Savart . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific basis , then he was accurate in every detail , for no more satisfactory experiments on the construction of bow instruments have been attempted . The idea of these experiments was suggested by a guitar-shaped violin made by Stradivarius and owned by the elder Chanot . Imagining that so eminent a maker would not have constructed such a violin without good reason , Monsieur Savart ? a doctor of medicine ? threw up his profession for that of science and interested himself in organising a series of tests in the first half of the nineteenth century . As a result of his labours luthiers were at last confronted with the astounding assertion that an arched surface vibrates less readily than a plane one : that there are points where the vibrations are greatly reduced , and that the aggregate vibration is least at the sound holes and at the corner blocks of a violin or violoncello . Starting from this groundwork , M. Savart constructed a violin entirely made of flat surfaces and straight lines with narrow rectilinear slits for sound holes ( so as to cut as few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailpiece , the drag of the latter on the tender part of the belly being considered detrimental to the // instrument . The most astonishing part of this fiddle was that it passed the test of comparison with a Stradivarius victoriously . The members of the Academie des Sciences formed a council and , assisted by such eminent musicians as M. Berton , Catel le Sueure , and Cherubini , sat in solemn judgment . The merits of the instrument were considered by them at several meetings , and the gifted violinist , M. Lefebvre , was requested to play alternately upon a chef-d ' - auvre of Cremona and the Savart " box-fiddle , " in an adjoining room . The decision arrived at by these gentlemen was that the square fiddle was every bit as good in tone ? if not better ? as the Cremona violin . Of course this was most flattering to the inventor , yet it is a question whether such excellent results would have taken place had the Savart fiddle been in less skilful hands . The great violinist Remenyi maintained that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiddle as out of a i 000-guinea one . Monsieur Lefebvre 's handling of the " box-fiddle " was doubtless superior to the fiddle itself and , ? as Voltaire said of Duport 's violoncello playing , ? he made the council of impulsive Frenchmen believe in miracles " by making a nightingale out of an ox . " // A few years previous to Monsieur Savart 's researches M. Chanot ? a naval officer , and a member of the distinguished family of violinmakers of that name , being compelled to leave the navy on account of his staunch Royalist predilections ? had turned his attention to constructing guitar-shaped fiddles and violoncellos . These were also subjected to similar tests by the members of the Academie des Sciences and ? as in the case of the Savart fiddle ? pronounced to be superior to the instruments of Cremona . There were independent experts , however , who considered them faulty in tone and only to be regarded as curiosities . In the midst of diverse criticisms , these instruments found a market for a few years , the violins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price demanded for the violoncellos . Those who desire to pursue the subject of vagaries , will find much to interest them in Mr Davidson 's " The Violin , " and Mr Heron Allen 's " Violinmaking as it was and is " ; sufficient for present purposes is it to know that such grotesqueness as eighteen stringed violins played with a bow and producing the combined effect of the violin , viola , violoncello and double-bass : the combination violin and violoncello with piano which can be played by one person : the melephone , which was nothing more than a concertina enclosed in a species of violoncello , and other such fallacies , have been relegated to the land of oblivion . Certain it is that the ancient viol-maker never dreamed of such horrors . Once in a way he attempted such a mild invention as a detachable neck , which could be unscrewed and placed inside the instrument through a door in the ribs , like the viola da gamba in the Donaldson Museum , but otherwise his methods , like his varnish , were so simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no necessity for rushing into print , or taking out patents , or wrangling , or arguing . The traditions of his graceful craft were transmitted by word of mouth and practical demonstration to his pupils , and the pupils , living in an atmosphere of lutherie , sucked in the un-written lore as naturally as the earth absorbs rain . What need to cry out the sky is blue , when all the world can see it ! It was among such surroundings that the mighty Stradivarius learnt his art in the work-shops of Nicolo Amati , grandson of Andrea Amati , who made " The King . " The atelier of this maker was a very nest of talent in the middle of the seventeenth century , for Nicolo // // Amati 's renown attracted all the most enthusiastic young aspirants of the art . It is easy to imagine the grand spirit of emulation , and even rivalry , which must have existed within the four walls of ' Amati 's premises in Cremona . An unrivalled master of his art at the time , bestowing care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt that he did much towards advancing the construction of the violoncello in the matter of experimenting with thicknesses , but he did not alter the dimensions of the violoncello which was at that time about 31 inches in length , if not longer . The majority of Amati violoncellos have been cut down , so that it is difficult to judge of their original size , but it is probable that they originally measured over 31 inches in length . The paramount influence of the Church in musical matters was responsible for the large dimensions of the violoncello at that date ; it was looked upon as useful to reinforce the double-bass , or " bass-violin " as it was then called , for the big viols had already gone out of use in Italy in the middle of the seventeenth century . In " The Familiar Letters of Abraham Hill " ( London 1767 ) , his brother , Thomas , writing to him from Lucca , 1st October 1657 , speaking of the instrumental music // he had heard there , says that it " is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are masters of , but the bass-viol they have not at all in use , and , to supply its place , they have the bass-violin . " According to Maugars in his " Reponse fait a un curieux . . . " ( 1639 ) the viol was going out of use in Italy , quite twenty years before the above date . " Re-garding the viol , " he remarks , " there is no one in Italy now who excels on that instrument , and even in Rome it is still little cultivated : I am very astonished at this , seeing that they had formerly one Horatio de Parme , who was a marvellous player . " The writer of these lines was himself a magnificent performer on the viola da gamba . He visited Rome , where he found the gamba , the theorbo , and harpsichord the most fashionable instruments , and , in spite of the numerous violins and violoncellos being made by Nicolas Amati in his busy workshops in Cremona , these latter were considered to be what Lord Chesterfield would have called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur was rash enough to adopt the violin , he was careful to hide the fact from his friends for fear of being thought disreput-able . This antipathy to the fiddle was just // as keenly felt in England , when the encroachment of the new-fangled four-stringed instruments began to endanger the position of the viol . Anthony Wood , writing in 1653 at Oxford , says in reference to this : " Before the Restoration , gentlemen played three , four and five parts with viols . They esteemed a violin to be an instrument only belonging to a common fiddler , and could not endure that it should come among them for fear of making their meetings vain . " This prejudice against the violin is even felt to-day by many people . We ourselves remember an old lady 's astonishment when we confided to her that we could play the violin : " Why ! " she exclaimed , " I thought such instruments were only played outside public-houses . " The degree of excellence attained by such men as the Abbe Maugars , Hoffman , Sainte Colombe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly detrimental to the development of the violoncello . Maugars spent four years studying the gamba in England in 162o , and when he visited Rome , in 1639 , his performances at the house of Signora Leonora Baroni , a famous Italian singer ? who was herself no mean performer on the harpsichord and gamba ? gained him the highest eulogies , which he recounts with no uncertain // voice in the pamphlet already referred to ( p. i 38 ) . In the face of the prodigies performed by gamba players , makers were content to follow the times and allow the violoncello to retain its large proportions . Even Stradivarius , who made the violin what it now is , did not occupy himself with the dimensions of the violoncello , but adopted the measurements of his contemporaries . A complete account of this maker 's violins and violoncellos is to be found in Messrs Hill 's valuable monograph " Antonio Stradivari , his Life and Work . " In the chapter devoted to a resume of Stradivari violoncellos , they make the interesting assertion that no violoncello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1680 . The earliest dated instrument of the violoncello type known to them was made by the great Cremona master in his twenty-third year , 1667 , and , although it has been considerably altered , it apparently originally contained many of the features of the viola da gamba and violoncello . They are of opinion that the instrument was primarily strung as a gamba , which was doubtless the case , for at that time it was customary to make gambas in two forms ? i.e. with flat back and true viol-shaped upper bouts curving high into the neck , and also in the violin form . // Christopher Simpson , the most renowned English gamba player of his day , gives excellent representations of both these forms of gambas ( p. 8o ) in his " Division Viol " ( Second Edition , London , 1667 ) . He recommends the violin shape as superior to the viol form for playing divisions on a ground as " the sound should be quick and sprightly , like a Violin ; and Viols of that shape ( the Belleys being digged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Another violoncello by Stradivarius , which shows similar signs of alteration , belonged to Mr Leo Stern in 1902 . Its proportions , although cut down by Dodd , are still of the largest , and the presence of a fifth hole in the head for a peg indicates that it was originally strung with five strings . No doubt this was originally an extra large viola da gamba of the form recommended by Christopher Simpson . Messrs Hill also give the interesting piece of information that they are acquainted with a viola da gamba by Stradivarius , or , to speak more correctly , with the material which once formed one . The often over-generous hand of the modern maker has employed itself in adding fresh wood in all directions with a view to transforming the instrument into a violoncello . Brought from France // to Italy in its original state , it may possibly be the viol made by Stradivari in 1684 for the Comtessa Cristina Visconti , the patterns of which are preserved in the " Della Valle Collection . " Still referring to Messrs Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violoncellos between the year 168o and 1700 and that it was not until the latter date that he shows any signs of turning away from the violoncello of large proportions . Two instruments which bear evidence of this important change of construction are the Cristiani ( 1700 ) and the Servais ( 1701 ) . The first of these measures 30 bare inches in length , while the Servais measures 313 inches , but even these proportions were large as compared to the violoncellos he made ten years later . The Cristiani is of particular interest at the present moment as it has recently become the property of the nation . It originally belonged to a charming lady of that name who gained repute as a professional violoncellist in the forties of the nineteenth century . Felix Mendelssohn paid her the compliment of playing her accompaniments at her concert at Leipsic , and dedicated one of his " Songs without Words " to her . She was not a great executant by any means , but the violonCHATS // cello at that date did not count so many women players as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was possessed of much personal beauty , so that her critics judged her in the same manner as they did the handsome Madame Catalani , of whom it was said that : " If to her singing some few errors fall Look in her face , and you forget them all . " Mdlle . Cristiani 's violoncello ? after her death at Tobolsk , in Siberia , in 1853 ? fell into the hands of M. Benazet , a Baden-Baden amateur . Through the medium of Messrs Gand &; Bernadel , it became the property of the eminent violoncellist , Herr Hugo Becker , in 1884 . Ten years later Messrs Hill bought it , and still later Mr Charles Oldham , a well-known ophthalmic surgeon of Hove , Brighton , purchased it from them . At the latter 's death , on the 24th January 1907 , he bequeathed the " Cristiani " violoncello , together with the famous inlaid " Rode " violin ( 1722 ) , a violin of the Amatasie period dated 1687 , and the handsome inlaid viola made by Stradivarius for Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . These four instruments have been confided to the care of the British Museum , but it is to be devoutly hoped that // the authorities may find some clause in Mr Oldham 's will , by which they may avoid the necessity of placing them under a glass case . There is no more melancholy object than the violin or violoncello which is relegated to a museum and compelled to silence . The handsome violin by Stradivarius in the Musee of the Paris Conservatoire , and Paganini 's violin in Genoa ? standing under a glass case like an eight-day clock ? are melancholy examples of such a useless practice . It would be of much more practical use to art , if wealthy connoisseurs would follow the example of Mr John Rutson , and leave their valuable collections of musical instruments to some musical institution for the use of gifted pupils unable to purchase a suitable instrument for their public debut and early appearances . It is undeniable that , as a rule , genius is poorly endowed with this world 's goods , and often lacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or violoncellist has been balked of success for lack of a good instrument to play upon . After the year 1700 , Stradivarius made some fine violoncellos , the most superb of all at the present time , being the instrument he made in his seventy-sixth year . This grand example is // dated 1720 , and , besides its intrinsic merits , it has a special interest , having been the favourite instrument of Signor Piatti . Many were the hands through which it passed before finding a safe haven with the gifted Italian violoncellist to whom it was presented by Colonel Oliver in 1867 . Like Ole Bull and his Gasparo da Salo , Piatti was enamoured of the violoncello the moment he saw it , on a visit to Dublin , during the first year of his sojourn in England in 1844 . Its memory lived in his mind for years , and he longed to possess it . The most consummate of storytellers and most genial of men , Piatti was never weary of recounting the romantic manner in which his violoncello crossed his path from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was bebarred from so doing by want of sufficient capital . However , it was a case of " Kismet . " He did eventually become its proud possessor , and like a pair of lovers they found no hardship in overcoming obstacles together . The career of this instrument is traced by Messrs Hill from the year 1818 , when it was brought to this country from Cadiz , by a wine merchant named Mr Dowell . For 300 guineas it passed into the hands of the Rev. Mr Booth , who ? like Mr Dowell , ? was an // Irishman . The purchase was effected through the medium of Paul Alday , an Irish violinist , whose name is responsible for the story that he was once so lost in the labyrinths of a seemingly endless cadenza at a concert , that an exasperated member of the audience exclaimed : " Well , Mr Alday , are you going to play all night ! Ten years after Mr Booth became the possessor of the violoncello , another change of ownership took place at a sale by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dublin violoncellist , Mr Piggot , purchased it . The sum paid by the latter is unknown to Messrs Hill , but from some notes kindly supplied us on the subject by Comtessa Lochis ? Signor Piatti 's daughter ? through the medium of Mr Whitehouse , the statement that " it was sold for L I oo to a professor of Dublin , " may allude to the price paid for it by Mr Piggot . After Mr Piggot 's death , in 1853 , Sir Robert Gore Booth , an amateur violoncellist , undertook the sale of the instrument for his deceased friend 's widow , and , bringing it to London , invited Piatti to come and see it . As soon as Piatti beheld the violoncello , he recognised it to be the exquisite instrument he had seen in 1844 , and never forgotten . Great was his chagrin at being // unable to purchase it , but at the time it was impossible . By his advice , however , the violinmaker , Maucotel , went to see it , and managed to obtain it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought it of Maucotel for k350 . To Piatti ? already a frequent visitor at Colonel Oliver 's house ? the Stradivarius violoncello was a still further attraction , especially as he could play on it whenever he felt inclined . He used to care for it like a child , and at length , on a memorable day in the year 1867 , he was at the Colonel 's house , occupied in comparing the Stradivarius ' merits with that of a violoncello by the brothers Amati and another by Montagnana , when Colonel Oliver suddenly inquired ? " Which do you prefer ? " Piatti at once indicated the Stradivarius without hesitation . His astonishment and embarrassment were unbounded when in reply to this conclusion , the Colonel said laconically : " Take it home then ! " But nothing would induce the simple-minded virtuoso to accept the Colonel 's offer , and after thanking him , he left the house hurriedly , fearing that his great longing for the violoncello might make his refusal " tremble in the scale . " Scarcely had he arrived home , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and // from that day to his death remained with him always . It was on this grand Stradivarius that Piatti delighted audiences week after week , and month after month , at the Saturday and Monday Popular Concerts , ( now , alas ! ? be it said to our shame  --  dwindled out of existence for want of support ) and it was on New Year 's day , 1901 ? six months before his death ? that he played his Swan Song ( the " Danza Moresca " ) before a party of friends at his daughter 's house , with all his accustomed skill and brilliancy . Although it is not part of our subject here to detail the lives of violoncello players , yet we can not leave this artist , so beloved in England , without mentioning the touching tribute to his memory , which is celebrated annually by his resting-place , in the private chapel of the Lochis family . The funeral , which was a public one , attended by the Prefect , the Mayor , and representatives of the leading Musical Societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lard of July 1901 . In spite of the tempestuous weather , hundreds of townsfolk and people from the neighbouring provinces turned out to do homage to their esteemed countryman . Four professors , from the Music School at Bergamo , played the // Andante from Schubert 's Quartet in D minor , according to the last wishes expressed by Piatti , and a week later again visited the Lochis Chapel , where they made a solemn compact to meet each year , and perform the same Andante on the anniversary of the master 's death . Thus is the memory of the great artist , whose lovable nature made him a boon companion and cherished friend , reverently preserved . Signor Piatti 's violoncello at his death passed into the hands of his daughter , Countess Lochis , who , although realising that it was a precious relic of her father , still felt that it would harm the instrument if she kept it without being played upon . She therefore accepted the offer of Herr Robert Mendelssohn , the Berlin banker , and sold it to him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the composer of that name , is himself an excellent amateur violoncellist , and , in conj unction with his brother , owns a fine Quartet of Strads . During the latter years of Signor Piatti 's life he had offered him ? 2000 for the violoncello , but had , on the sum being refused , asked Piatti to name his own price . But the Italian violoncellist stubbornly refused to part with the instrument although he no longer played in public . However ? as we
