txt Adniiral Dewey said to-night that the report published in ' a New York afternoon newspaper to the effect that he intended to withdraw his candidacy for the Presidency was all a mistake ; that he had never given any one whatever any such information . Another story that is. having some circulation to-night is that Admiral Dewey will go to Kansas City not as an opponent of the Chicago platform , but as a rival of Bryan for the nomination on any platform that the convention may adopt . Nobody of standing can be found who believes this report or the one regarding withdrawal . There is a revival of the Vice Presidential rumors , but the Silver Democrats feel hurt about the Admiral 's mysterious remark concerning " the clowns who are trying to get the nomination , " and believe that it means Bryan . The Republican leaders incline to think that it means , and there are some who think he meant both . There is consequently no disposition at present to offer him the Vice Presidency , even if there was any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might get it if he said please , " said a Silver Democrat to-night . The gossips are still unwilling to give up their belief in a political origin for the Dewey boom , and reports to that effect still crop out , though the number is diminishing . To-day a story which gained Bogie circulation in the South a tow days ago was talked about in Washington . This was to the effect that Dewey was brought forward as a candidate at a dinner given in New York City seine time ago by Gold Democrats . According to the story , which is not as circumstantial in its Washington version as it was when it first appeared , a number of candidates were considered at this dinner , and Dewey was fixed upon . A prominent Gold Democrat of the State of Washington ' named Wallace , who . is the son-in-law of Chief Justice Fuller , it is said , was appointed to sound Dewey . The Admiral consented to the use of his name , and surprisecO his political sponsors by bringing-out his boom himself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the usual adornment of the name of William C. Whitney and Arthur ' P. Gorman . Mr. Whitney figured in the original story . It finds many believers , but apparently has as little foundation as the many other stories tracing the Dewey boom to anybody besides the Admiral himself . - pursuance of . this - new policy of avoiding .. people as ' much as possible , Admiral Dewey kept carefully away from Washington the greater-part of the day . His house on Rhode Island Avenue has not yet been olbsed , and a couple of servants still remain there. - It is understood -- that his - country home is - rather scantily furnished , owing to the haste of the Admiral 's departure , but he prefers , seemingly , - to remain out of ' each and complete ' the- renovation of his house by degrees , in order to ? keep away from the crowds of visitors . It can not be learned , however , that the visitors whom he is trying to dodge include ' any persons of political prominence . Washington , people have given up expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , although the Admiral still continues to receive assurances of support , they are still from people like those referred to a day , or two ago ty his secretary , J. W. Crawford . Mr. Crawford was referring tohe mass of televams and letters the Admiral had that day received , when a reporter asked if he might see some of them and copy the names . " Oh , you would not be interested , " replied Mr. Crawford . " They are from people of no importance . " POOH-POOHS DEWEY BOOM . Senator Jones of Arkansas Thinks It Will Be Short Lived  --  Expects Bryan 's Nomination . Senator James K. Jones of Arkansas , Chairman of the Democratic National Committee , came to the city from Washington last night for a brief visit . While he is here on a business mission primarily , he will in all likelihood meet and talk with any prominent Democrats who may desire to see him , but no conferences have as yet been arranged . Shortly after Mr ... lones 's arrival at the Fifth Avenue Hotel James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee , reached the hotel and reported to his chief . After a short talk Mr. Oliver announced that he and Mr. Jones would go to Washington to-day , and that %cave arrangements for the convention would begin at once . Senator Jones said that the express4d purpose of Admiral Dewey to run for President had not unduly excited him or any other Democrats . In fact , he thought the Dew ey boom would be short-lived , and that under no circumstances could it interfere with Mr. Bryan 's candidacy . Wheo asked what ne thought of the anti-Bryan sentiment ; which was ' growing up , especially among the Democrats of the East , Chairman Jones said . " I have heard something of anti-Bryan conferences and such things , but I doubt if ' there is anything in it . I have not been taken into the confidence of the opponents of Mr. Bryan , which , of course , is not surprising . It is my belief that Mr. Bryan will be nominated on the first ballot , and that there will ' ; be no opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is it true that Tom L. Johnson is to succeed you as Chairman of the committee ? ' " Senator Jones was asked . " I have seen such a statement in the newspapers , " was the reply . " The convention meets on July 4 and selects a committee , which in turn will select a Chairman . It would , take a prophet to foretell what will happen at a convention . " " Who - have you heard most talked of for Vice President ? " " There are a great mapy men whose names have been suggested , " Mr. Jones said . " Judge Caldwell of Arkansas , who has received some prominence as a possible candidate , has been saying that he can not permit his name to be used , but there is plenty of good material left . " Mr. Jones expressed himself as being extremely well satisfied . with the prospects for Democratic success . So long as he remains Chairman of the National Committee . he said , headquarters would be maintained in Chicago , but he said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituting Washington for the Western City . He did not believe , he said , that headquarters would be opened in this city , though such a thing was possible . When asked what the convention would do as regards the platform . Chairman Jones said that the Kansas City Convention would not recede from any position heretofore as , slimed. though it was a matter of conjecture as to what additions or changes might be made . Rrill the passage of the new currency law affect materially the free-coinage feature of the Chicago platform ? " the reporter asked . Conventions do n't make issues . " said Mr. Jones . " They are made in the minds of men , and the platform , if a popular one , is the expression of the mind of the people . " " What do you think the Populists will do at their conventions ' in Sioux Falls and Cincinnati ? " Senator Jones was asked . The Sioux Falls convention may put up another than Mr. Bryan , " was the reply ; " but I doubt it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my impression - that it wo n't . The Cincinnati people are opposed to forming any coalition with the Democratic Party , but I do n't know what action they will take . "
