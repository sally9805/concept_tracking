IN the early spring of 1900 the retire- ' . ment of Lord Pauncefote from the British embassy at Washington is sure to call forth all over the United States expressions of heart-felt regret . It is safe to say that never before has the representative of another government accredited to Washington attained to such popularity with the American people as her Majesty 's present ambassador . Not only among those who know hint personally ? and the circle is large in the eastern part of the country ? but also with the great multitude who know public men only by their public actions , is this appreciation of Lord Pauncefote 's work in America to be found , Proof of it springs up continually in the most unexpected places ? places where the merest suspicion of Anglomania is impossible . Chance expressions are heard in railway trains in the South and West ; unexpected paragraphs are found in newspapers known to be hostile to the very idea of a reciprocal understanding between their own country and Great Britain . I remember , on my way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to travel for the greater part of a day with a very well known and well-to-do , but seemingly not very well informed , Florida cattle-man . We were discussing the troubled outlook on the Continent , and I called his attention to the strong possibility which existed of a combination against us , composed of the friends of Spain and the enemiesof the United States , as an argument that we were not so invincible as he seemed to think , But he laughed at me . He said he did not doubt the truth of my opinion . There was perhaps some danger from that quarter . " But , " he said , " if that should come to pass , you would see the English coming to our assistance so quickly that it would frighten all of our ' Dutch ' and Latin enemies to death . That man Pauncefote at Washington has opened the eyes of old England to the advantage of being on good terms with us , and to rating us a little higher than some South - American republic . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that he has not opened our own eyes a little as to who is our best friend when trouble comes . ' ' I at once ceased to instruct my chance acquaintance upon the international situation , for evidently he knew more of the truth than even attested history will tell . Another instance happened last summer , when the American papers were wasting a great deal of emotional indignation over the expatriation of a well-known millionaire . A leading paper , which has always been one of the foremost opponents to any idea of an Anglo-American alliance , and which was in the van of the opposition to the PauncefoteOlney treaty of arbitration , contained a paragraph as amusing as pertinent . It suggested that if Great Britain would give as Lord Pauncefote for our own in exchange , she could take the rich man , with several more of his kind thrown in as welcome good measure . Speaking seriously , Lord Pauncefote 's work in Washington , extending over more than the last ten years , has been so far-reaching in its character , has actually so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . Times have indeed changed since Lord Stratford de Redcliffe , who was in Washington as Sir Stratford Canning before he became " the great Eltchi , " wrote in his memoirs that while Washington was a very pleasant place socially , it did not require any great talents politically . There has , during the last decade , been no more exacting post iu the whole of the British service . And frankness compels me to add that the " great Eltchi " was more kind in his opinion of its social charms than the majority of his colleagues of the corps . Even as late as the past summer I read in one of the leading London papers that the life of the British representative in Washington had always been very onerous from a social and personal point of view . I am quite sure that this expression of sympathy for any one compelled to live in Washington grows out of mere-ignorance , and that those who have the advantage of experience , from Sir Stratford Canning down , will disagree with it . Certainly Lord Pauncefote and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Washington , and America generally , and their profound regret at leaving it . In fact , twenty-five years ago one could not have realized that it would ever be possible for the British minister , as he was then , to play such a prominent part in American affairs ? to become such an actual figure , one may even say , in American history ? as the first British ambassador to Washington has become . He came at a time when the then British legatiou was under a cloud , and when much of the public resentment which had been directed against his predecessor included the English people generally . It is not necessary here to recall in detail the sad blunder which caused the government at Washington to hand his passports to Sir Lionel Sackville West ( now Lord Sack-vile ) , and which established a memorable precedent in our diplomatic history . Suffice it to say that Lord Pauncefote 's entrance to his office was in itself at a noteworthy point , and that the circumstances of the situation were against him . Aside from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations between the two countries were very much strained " in consequence of differences which had risen out of the Bering Sea fisheries . It may be further noted that the foreign policy of Mr. Blaine , at that time Secretary of State , was never of what may be called a pacific character , The work which Lord Pauncefote did to bring this matter within the jurisdiction of a court of arbitration , the treaty for which he concluded with Mr. Blaine , at once makes him a lasting figure in American history . Soon after this ? in 1893 , in fact ? an act of Congress having empowered the President to appoint ambassadors to nations which should be willing to be similarly represented at Washington , he was promoted to that rank by Lord Rusebery , then her Majesty 's Minister for Foreign Affairs , and became in consequence again a noteworthy figure ? the first ambassador ever accredited to the United States . He is still the doyen , or dean , of the diplomatic corps at the capital . Two years later , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relations between the United States and Great Britain , and consequently the conduct of the British ambassador became a more important matter for the general welfare of the English-speaking people of the world and for history than that of any of Lord Pauncefote 's predecessors had ever been . President Cleveland 's ringing message to Congress giving his reading of the Monroe doctrine in relation to the long-pending dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela , which enclosed an equally stirring and perhaps more forceful despatch from Secretary-ofState Olney , aroused the greatest enthusiasm in the United States , and , in fact , very bitter and ardent feelings on both sides of the Atlantic . The beginning of 1896 found the relations between the two countries decidedly strained . They were , to tell the truth , nearer to actual war than they had been since 1812 , and therefore nearer to a war of immensely greater significance than any which had gone before . History will , it is to be hoped , do full justice to the tactful and conciliatory efforts by which the then Sir Julian brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the difficulty , The treaty which Sir Julian Pauncefote concluded at Washington in 1897 with Mr. Olney has borne peaceful and eminently satisfactory fruit in the decision of the court of arbitration of Paris , sitting to try the boundary controversy between Venezuela and British Guiana . Almost at the same time the British ambassador concluded with Mr. Olney a general treaty of arbitration , which marked a distinct world-step forward , and which was received with enthusiastic approval on both sides of the Atlantic . And although in its wisdom , or . as has been urged , its partisan division , the Senate at Washington refused to ratify this last general agreement , it will always be remembered as an outpost on the frontier of universal peace . It was . in fact , a prominent basis of argument in the late Peace Conference at The Hague , where Lord Pauncefote 's scheme , enlarged and generalized , was finally adopted , arid is now in course of ratification by all of the nations participating . The work which will most endear Lord Pauncefote to his American cousins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to my friend of the Florida ranch . Certainly he remained at his post during the whole of the long and trying period embracing the troubles which first arose about Cuba , and their later development into war . And a few men share with him what will perhaps be always , for the larger part , the secret gratification which he must feel over the fact that in the discharge of very important and delicate functions he has established the entente cordiale which now so happily exists between the two nations . Lord Pauncefote 's career in the service has been a Iong and memorable one ? so memorable , in fact , that he has enjoyed the very unusual distinction of having his term of service extended for a year over the age limit . When the pressure for place and promotion in a service as great as the diplomatic corps of Great Britain is taken into consideration , it will be seen how seldom it is possible to postpone the long list of promotions throughout the line which the retirement of an ambassador brings about . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one may call it so , of Lord Pauncefote 's acknowledged ability over the claims of the men in the ranks . vol .. C. ? No. 599 ? 8 1For he had never been a member of the diplomatic service when he was appointed minister to Washington . When one remembers the man who has served for years as secretary at Rio and at Bangkok , and who is as anxious as a man can be for deserved promotion , it will be understood why only unusual fitness and exacting demands will cause the government to overlook the claims of the corps and give a prominent appointment to some one from without its ranks . Lord Pauncefote is the youngest and only surviving son of the late Robert Pauncefote , Esq. , of Preston Court , in the county of Gloucester . He was born in Munich , on September 13 , 1828 . His education was received in Paris and Geneva , and subsequently in England , at Marlborough College . Thus the young man was an early traveller , and grew up in that now seemingly golden time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment . It is said that young Pauncefote fell under the spell of his age , and was no inconsiderable poet and musician . Certainly there remain to-day a number of very attractive poems and songs of which he is the author and composer , under the name of " A Templar . " He was originally destined for the military profession , having received a commission in the Madras Light Cavalry . But on the death of his elder brother he abandoned his intention of going out to India , and decided to enter the legal profession . Accordingly he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1852 , eating his dinners and following the wonderful course set down by tradition to this end which seems so curious to latter-day iconoclasts . He then joined the Oxford circuit . In July , 1855 , when the late Sir William Molesworth became Minister for the Colonies in the Palmerston cabinet , which took up office after the downfall of Lord Aberdeen 's government , he selected young Pauncefote as his private secretary . This brought the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following October , hence Mr. Pauncefote 's first experience in a government department was of brief duration . But it is significant to note that it was in this same department that he subsequently rendered such noteworthy service . The departmental and colonial administrative part of his life work was not yet to begin . If his public work be divided into three parts , one would call them legal , departmental , and diplomatic . The legal phase actively commenced when he went to Hongkong and began a successful practice at the bar ? so successful , in fact , that we find him appointed , in 1866 , to the office of Attorney-General of the colony . He became , therefore , ex officio a member of the Executive and Legislative Councils . And while there he prepared for the government a comprehensive code of civil procedure , which is still in force in the Supreme Court . He was also , for a time , Acting Chief Justice . For his services to the colony , on his departure he received the public thanks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands , which had been under separate governments , were federated into one colony , and Mr. Pauncefote was appointed the first Chief Justice , and proceeded to open the federal Supreme Court and to organize the administration of justice . It was at this time , in January , 1874 , that the honor of knighthood was conferred upon him . He subsequently prepared a code of civil.procedure adapted to local requirements , and embodying the rules of procedure of the Imperial Judicature Act , so far as they were applicable . This system is still in force , But Sir Julian only remained in the West Indies for a few months ; for when , in the same year . Mr. Disraeli came into power , the late Earl of Carnarvon , then Colonial Secretary , appointed him Legal Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the Colonial Office . Here the important . period of departmental work begins . There was great need for the advice at home of some one familiar not only with the laws of the colonies , but also the conditions surrounding their execution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished that the more important Foreign Office , a few years later , claimed him in a similar capacity . If I am not greatly mistaken , the position of Legal Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was then created for him and for his work . This was when the late Earl of Derby was at the head of the foreign policy of the Disraeli government , July , 1876 . It was here that Sir Julians capacity for political as well as legal work became noteworthy , and in 1882 he was promoted to the important diplomaticposition of Permanent Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs . As most Americans know , this position is practically the head of the Foreign Office , for it is permanent , no matter what governmeu Is come and go . This promotion was made at the hands of the late Lord Granville , and Sir Julian succeeded in this high and important post the late Lord Tenterden . For distinguished services during this period he was made , in 1880 , a Companion of the Order of the Bath , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George . In the year 1885 he acted as the British delegate to the commission which sat in Paris for some months to draw up regulations for the navigation of the Suez Canal , and for his services in this matter , so important to Great Britain , was rewarded by promotion to the Grand Cross of St. Michael and St. George . . He continued at the Foreign Office until 1889 , when he was selected by the Marquis of Salisbury to succeed Sir Lionel Sackville West as British minister at Washington . This was a great compliment to his political and diplomatic ability , as well as full recognition for his then distinguished position as an authority on international law , always perhaps his most noteworthy force . His record in Washington I have quickly gone over from the stand-point of American history . But it was distinctly in view of the reputation which he had made there as perhaps the foremost authority on all questions of international arbitration which caused his government to select him as its first delegate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanting as reward for his services at Washington , for in 1892 he was promoted to the Grand Cross of the Bath , perhaps the most coveted of all British decorations , and in 1894 , during a visit home , he was sworn in as a member of the Queen 's " Right Honorable " Privy Council . At The Hague , in conjunction with his American colleagues , Sir Julian took the most important part in the establishment of a permanent international court of arbitration , which of itself will make the conference memorable in the history of civilization . Upon his return from this important and successful work the Queen announced her pleasure in conferring upon him a peerage of the United Kingdom . In this way the services which have been so successfully devoted to the welfare of his government in Washington will be continued , after his retirement , in the House of Lords . The government of Great Britain , as able as it is , can not afford to lose the assistance of such a man just because he has reached his seventy-first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secures Lord Pauncefote 's continuance in public affairs . He chose the title of Lord Pauncefote of Preston in the county of Gloucester . Of his marriage with Miss Cubitt , daUghter of the late Major ? tibia of Catfield , Norfolk , five children were born . The eldest was a son , who died in infancy . The four daughters are all in society and well known in Washington . The personal impression which Lord Pauncefote makes upon one is always of gentle courtesy and kindness of disposition . In his method of conducting diplomatic affairs in Washington he has shown unfailing patience , moderation , and firmness in the upholding of his country 's interests , at the same time never failing courteously to have a due appreciation of the point of view of his opponent . This is why he has earned : such golden . opinions from all parties in the United States , and why he will carry away with him the good wishes of all Americans . The social loss to Washington which will come with the closing of the Pauncefote regime at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There will be a blank which for some time it will be difficult for any successor to fill . For ten years and more Lady Pauncefote , with untiring and unfailing hospitality , has seconded her husband 's public work among the people to whom they are accredited . There has been put down in the midst of that interesting and cosmopolitan city an ideal home of old England , which has been a favorite resort for those so fortunate as to secure its invitations . And in return no entertainment in the high world has been considered complete without some representative of the ambassador 's family . All four of the young ladies fully share the popularity of their father and mother , and all of them will be very much missed . Ten years mark quite a time in the associations of life , and it is no wonder if the departure of Lord Pauneefote and his family , after this time spent among them , should be marked on the part of Americans by a general clethonstration of regret .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
