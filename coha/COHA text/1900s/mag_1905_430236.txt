 |p883  LEAST known among the possessions of the United States is the Island of Guam , with its inhabitants , the hamorros . Except when devastated by the hurricane of November 13th , 1900 , and again by the earthquake of September 22d , 1902 , public attention has not been forcibly called to it . The violence and destruction of these fearful occasions arrested momentarily the interest of our people , but not to the extent excited by the hurricane of Porto Rico in August , 1899 , nor that caused by the loss by disease of draft animals in the Philippines . In the latter cases Congress appropriated several millions to aid the afflicted communities . Guam Island of Guam . From a Survey Made Under the Direction of Civil Engineer Leonard M. Cox , U. S. Navy was left to rise unaided , tho the condition of the Chamorros was the more pitiful . Guam is the southernmost , as well as the largest and most populous , of the group called Marianas , consisting of fourteen islands lying nearly four hundred and fifty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenwich , between the 13th and 20th parallels of north latitude . It is thirty miles in length and averages about six and a half miles in width . Its area is two hundred and seven square miles . Centrally located in the Western Pacific and possessing the only good harbor in that part of the ocean , it commends itself as an important point for a naval and coaling station . It is 3337 miles from Honolulu and 1,506 from Manila . There are no deep recesses in the island except at the harbor of Apra . A coral reef , barely covered at low tide , incloses the island . The surface is divided into  |p884  two distinct parts by a ridge , varying in bight from 700 to 1,300 feet . The northern half is a large plateau from 300 to boo feet elevation . From the interior the slope is gradually upward to the sea , where it terminates in high , steep , forbidding cliffs . The eastern exposure of the northern half is so abrupt and the coral reef so near that the waves break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mountainous , with several valleys and small streams . On the west the ridge drops rapidly to a low shelf , not much above the sea level , which extends from the city of Agana south and upon which the majority of the inhabitants of the island have their dwellings . This narrow strip is very fertile . The soil is composed mainly of disintegrated coral . It is shallow and red owing to the presence of oxide of iron . Vegetable mold has accumulated in the forests and valleys , and in damp , swampy places it is quite rich . There is not much stone suitable for the purposes of construction , but from the limestone found in the hills and the coral taken from the reef two grades of lime are manufactured . The pure , disintegrated coral found everywhere , called " cascajo , " makes a hard , smooth surface and is valuable for the construction of roads . There is no known mineral wealth of any significance in the island . Some indications of iron ore have been found and there is a tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is also said that gypsum exists . Much of the northern plateau is heavily wooded . Of the valuable hard woods it is estimated that there are of Ifil ( Eperua decandra ) , Palo Maria ( Calophylluni inophyllum ) , and Chopag ( Ochro carpus obovalis ) at least two million dollars ' worth . This is all difficult , of access and exists only in sufficient quantities for use in the island . There are wild bread-fruit trees of large size , banyans , ironwood , numerous kinds of ferns and several varieties of palms , the most valuable of which is the cocoanut . The pulp of the nut , dried , is known commercially as " copra . " This is the principal article of export . Rice , sugar , coffee , cacao and tobacco are cultivated , but not in sufficient quantities to supply the necessities of the people . The principal crops , corn and sweet potatoes , are raised only for home consumption . The principal animals are horned cattle , including the carabao , or water buffalo . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American horses and mules have been brought here for the use of the Naval Station . Goats are found running wild and there are sufficient hogs , chickens and ducks for the use of the natives . Besides the domestic animals there are deer , wild hogs ,  |p885  ducks , curlews , snipe and pigeons . In the shallows of the reefs are many varieties of eatable fish , but , except several kinds of lizards , no reptiles are found . Mosquitoes , flies and centipedes abound and occasionally scorpions of a harmless kind are seen . There are large fruit-eating and small insect-eating bats . Fruiteating doves of several species and a great variety of brilliantly marked birds exist . A little Chinese partridge has been introduced recently . There are several species of land crabs , the most interesting of which is the robber crab ( Birgus latro ) , which feeds on cocoanuts . Its flesh is highly prized . Guam lies on the dividing line between the northeast trade winds and the monsoons of the China Sea . From December to June the prevailing winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air is frequently refreshed by showers . From July to December southwest winds , accompanied by heavy rain showers , are frequent . Hurricanes may occur at any time and are much to be dreaded . Earthquakes are frequent . They are not generally violent , but there have been very destructive ones . The mean annual temperature , about 81 degrees , varies little . The population of the Island of Guam , as determined by the American census in 1901 , was 9,686 . It is now 10,300 . These are mostly gathered in the capital , Agana , and in the villages of Anigua , Asan , Tepungan and Piti , lying on the west coast of the island , on the road from Agana to the harbor of Apra . Across the bay , southwestward from Piti , is the village of Sumay , where the cable station of the Commercial Pacific Cable Company is located and where a large tract of land has been bought by the Government for purposes of a Naval Station . Continuing down the coast on the west side are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southeast corner of the island , the village of Inarajan . The sole interior village is Sinajana , about one mile south of Agana . All of the people of the island live in these towns . Agana , the capital , lies on a low , sandy plain on the seaside , having an elevation  |p886  of about three feet near the beach and eleven feet at the foot of the hills . A sluggish stream , the Agana River , with a fall of only four feet in its course of two miles , flows through the town for the last three-quarters of a mile and serves jointly as a laundry , bath and open sewer . The inhabitants do not drink this water , because it is brackish from the sea . They dig wells in the town , striking water at from three to six feet . The hight of the water in these wells does not vary materially between the dry and rainy seasons , because the ground water maintains itself approximately at the level of the river and the sea . This ground water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain which has fallen in the town and stink directly and very rapidly through the sand to the general water level beneath . The sand is not flint ; it is only finely divided coral , limestone and shell . The rain , soaking through , dissolves a great deal of this lime , and the well water is therefore very hard . Agana has no surface drainage . It has no sewers except the open river . The excreta of men and animals are deposited over the whole surface of the ground , and the rain washings percolate directly into the general body of ground water tapped by the wells . This water is therefore nothing but drainage or sewage water . The wells are only openings in the surface which give access to it and are responsible for a constant and general epidemic of a loathsome disease , the lumbricoid worm . In a clean community , supplied with proper water , there is an occasional patient , generally a child , inhabited by two or three ; but in Agana is a state of things which probably can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumbricoid worm infests the intestines of nearly every inhabitant . The eggs deposited by one person on the ground are soon afterward in the bucket of water dipped up by another from a well . Persons of all ages , from three months to eighty years , have these parasites in very large numbers . It is quite common for a victim to have from fifty to a hundred full grown worms . As irritants and carriers of infection they are responsible for intestinal inflammations which cause an important part of the death rate . It is a condition that is entirely remediable and its existence constitutes a reproach to us who have been in charge of these helpless people for eight years . And how shall we answer for the responsibility that will rest upon us if cholera or typhoid makes an accidental entry here ? It would decimate the entire population . A proper water supply is the simple and complete remedy and could be easily obtained . The majority of the houses in Agana consist of a wooden box perched on wooden piles three or four feet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every two or three years . There are , however , many houses with stone foundations and tiled roofs , and since the Americans came corrugated iron , used as roofing on the public buildings . has been more or less adopted by the well-to-do natives . The dress worn by the people consists of a shirt , worn outside , trousers and straw hat for the men , and a skirt and a short chemise for the women . On festive occasions the well-to-do dress very much as Europeans in this climate . There is an excellent macadamized road from Agana to Piti and dirt roads , passable for the native carts in the dry season , extend into many parts of the island . These are supplemented by trails , over which the carabao can generally make his way at any season . All parts of the island , therefore , are very accessible and its development only waits the expenditure of a little money by the Federal Government to make the roads suitable for traffic . Owing to the fact that disintegrated coral exists everywhere the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources of the Island of Guam are insignificant . The tariff was established by Executive Order of February 1st , 1900 but , in view of the decisions of the Supreme Court , it is questionable if this tariff , based on Executive Order , can he much longer maintained . The island can , under no circumstances , be regarded as a modifying influence in the economics of the United States . Owing to its small size , its generally shallow soil , its great distance from the Pacific Coast of the United States and the small number of its inhabitants it can never produce or manufacture enough of any  |p887  one article to affect the American market . Aside from its physical insignificance , its primitive inhabitants are probably the most exclusively agricultural of any people in the world . It is convincing evidence of this devotion to agriculture that , tho excessively fond of fish food and with the sea teaming with fish just outside of the reef , with another island inhabited by people of the same race and language only forty miles distant , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats in the island . There are no manufactures , nor is there material for any . The exports for the fiscal year ending June 30th , 1904 , actually produced in the island , are as follows : Of this amount only $1,014.75 went to the United States , $942.75 in copra and $72 in harpoon poles . The normal imports of the island for the fiscal year ending June 30th , 1904 , were : The gross normal receipts of the Insular Treasury in any fiscal year , under the existing tariff , may be estimated at about twenty thousand dollars ; but of this sum , the sole support of the Government , more than fifty per cent . is derived from the duties imposed under the provisions of the Executive Order . The other sources are a land tax of one-half of one per cent. , a heavy poll tax , fines , fees for licenses for the use of firearms , passports , planting fish weirs , marriages and tapping cocoanut trees .  |p888  The land tax of one-half of one per cent. , while apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has already resulted in the abandonment of a number of pieces of property , and there are authentic instances where land has been offered for sale at prices absurdly below the appraised value . The increase in the cost of living in Guam since the American occupation amounts to several hundred per cent . The Spaniards subsidized a line of steamers from Manila and fixed a schedule of reasonable freight rates , so that Guam was regularly and economically provided with supplies . At present there is no line of merchant steamers from any point . Five schooners , of less than 15o tons burden each , call on voyages to and from Japan and impose very high freight rates . The army transports call once a month on the voyage out from San Francisco to Manila , but not on the return trip . The naval transport calls irregularly twice a year . No merchandise for the natives is permitted to be brought in these ships . Under Spanish sovereignty only about one-fifth of the expense of the Government was borne by the island . Since the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the result is that , approximately , twenty-five times as much money must be raised by local taxation as before the Americans came . The island Government is struggling to make both ends meet with very much underpaid but fairly efficient native officials . In a number of cases it is forced to ask gratuitous service from minor employees . The Insular buildings are inadequate , unfurnished and not in good repair . There is but one suitable school building in the island and that is not properly equipped . Under present conditions the Government of the island is faced continually with the probability of not having enough funds to meet the necessary expense of the present economical administration . The change of sovereignty in the Island of Guam , due to its isolation , has imposed additional functions and expenses upon the Insular Government , the Supreme Court and the segregation and maintenance of lepers and criminals , for example , which , in other and more favorably situated territories , have always been regarded as a proper charge upon the National Government .  |p889  The administrative staff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is also the Commandant of the Naval Station ; one line officer , three medical officers and a paymaster , all of whom have important duties connected with the civil government . There is a company of marines , consisting of about one hundred men , commanded by a captain , assisted by two lieutenants . There are three classes of courts : The courts of the Justices of the Peace , of which there are four in the island , from which all cases can be appealed to the Court of First Instance , which sits in Agana . Criminal cases originating in this court are subject to revision by the Supreme Court , and all civil cases may be sent up to it on appeal . The Supreme Court was established by the American authorities . The Governor has usually been the Judge . As Congress has never legislated for this island , there is no provision for an appeal to any of the courts of the United States . The Judge of the Supreme Court is the only American in the Insular Judiciary at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The natives are well behaved , tho somewhat given to litiga tion . The city of Agana is governed by a Mayor , called the Gobernadorcillo . He is also the warden of the jail and chief of the Island Constabulary . The latter consists of a body of fifteen uniformed natives , who are the jailers and police of town and country . The outlying towns are also controlled by Gobernadorcillos and all are divided up into districts , which have a sub-official in charge called a Teniente ( Lieutenant ) . The people are accustomed to this system , which is fairly effective . The law which prevails is the Spanish law which was in force in the Philippines , modified somewhat , but not extensively , by Executive Orders of the several American Governors . Until funds are available to properly and thoroughly reorganize the Insular Government it would be most unwise to change that which effectively controls the inhabitants and to which they are accustomed . Certain fundamental principles recognized by the Constitution of the United States , however , but not formerly recognized here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress does finally legislate for the island there need be no violent transition in this respect .
