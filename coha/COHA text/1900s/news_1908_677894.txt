txt That opponents of Gov . Hughes for the Republican Presidential nomination are beginning systematic work to make the most of the charges that his boom.is being directed by the " Wall Street ' financial and political set " is evidenced by a letter made public ' here to-night . The letter is anonymogs , and is addressed to a man in this city whose name also is withheld . He Is described as " a gentleman of high and influential position , whose sympathies with the candidacy of Secretary Taft are so pronounced that more accurate Identification is superfluous . " The letters In part follows : " We all recognize the splendid work the Governor has done in New York State , and we know whose quiet and potent influence it was which gave him the opportunity to do the work , but I do not like the anti-Rooseveltism of many of his supporters . " It seems to me that nearly every opponent in the Republican Party of President Roosevelt 's splendid policies for the effective governmental control of powerful and predatory wealth is lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great many other cordial friends in the State of New York and elsewhere , who do not see the game . But that is the game . " But there is one thing that these industrial protagonists of the Hughes movement dread more than any other , and that is that the rank and file of the people . workers of the Nation , who are true as ever to the policies for which the President has so faithfully and intelligently stood , will get on to the game . And they should be put on to the game as soon as possible without In any particular misrepresenting the attitude of Mr. Hughes and his real friends . " Another ambassador of Gov . Hughes and his Presidential boom visited the White House to-day and sang praises of the New York Executive without exhibiting credentials . The visitor was State Senator William W. Armstrong , who headed the Insurance Commission appointed by the New York Legislature and who brought Mr , Hughes into the limelight by selecting him as the chief counsel in the insurance investigation . The attitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected . He said that the methods of the Governor 's mind are always the same ? judicious , reasoning , absolutely refusing to cross a bridge until he got to it . " How does the Governor stand as to the policies that have been followed by the l'resident ? " " I think the best description of Gov . Hughes 's political intentions that I know of is that he is a radical in purpose , but a conservative in action . That tells the sort of man he is . I may say right here and now that I do , not believe any man can be elected President of this country who fails to indorse the policies of President Roosevelt . If the issue should go before the people as to standing by Roosevelt or opposing him , the people would rally to Roosevelt by an overwhelming majority . I say this because I believe that the President and Gov . Hughes are in close sympathy as to certain policies , and I believe that the understanding between them will grow closer from . now on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at any time that Gov . Hughes will say nothing or do nothing more than he has for the Presidential nomination and that he will be perfectly unconcerned what is done . This is the man , and he is conscientious in his position . " Col. Micheal Dady of Brooklyn to-day visited the White House and the Treasury Deepartment . He had quite a long talk with Secretary Cortelyou . When asked about the probability of the Brooklyn County organization indorsing Hughes at its meeting on Jan , 14 , Col. Dady said : " The voters of Brooklyn are waiting for a crystallization of sentiment . Until that time it would be unfair to rush into the game indorsing anybody . " WANT A HUGHES DECLARATION . Republican Club Committee Will Discuss Plans To-morrow . Gov . Hughes will be tusked by the Committee of Twenty-five of the Republican Club , appointed to aid in bringing about his nomination for the Presidency , to make clear at an early date his exact position with regard to the nomination .. This , it was explained by Chairman James S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee and of the club . The committee will meet for organization to-morrow night at the Republican Club . Mr. Lehmaier said last night : " The time has undoubtedly come when something practical must be done to bring about the nomination of Gov . Hughes for the Presidency . As I understand it , the purpose of this committee is to try and crystallize the Hughes sentiment , not only in the city , but in the State and Nation as well . This can be brought about by co-operation with other organizations all over the country , and it will be part of our work to obtain that cooperation . We will arrange meetings and conferences with the leaders wherever we think such steps are necessary . " It seems to me very apparent that the fight is to be between Taft and Hughes . and no one will dispute the assertion that the sentiment in this State is for Hughes . The opinion of the Republican Club is that Hughes is far the stronger candidate , and we intend to work for an instructed delegation from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor 's message has undoubtedly strengthened his position very greatly . It is a thoroughly business-like document . and , unlike the majority of such messages , is entirely free from egoism. "
