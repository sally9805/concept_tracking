txt At the beginning of this last week , there were certain cynics in New York , and perhaps there were such in Philadelphia , who maintained that the deciding series between the champions , respectively , of the National and of the American League would be conducted strictly according to the chances of " the gate , " without reference to the merits of the teams . It is a pleasure to own that these predictions have been falsified . ' To verify them in the highest degree , each team should have won three games , and then the deciding game should have been played in New York , not as the more enthitsiastic of the two cities . but only as the more populous . In fact , Philadelphia has won only , one of the games actually played . And nobody who saw th-at game will give any credit to any report that it was . not Played , on both sides , sincerely and for , all it was worth . It is true that one game was not played because the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretext for not playing it being that the day was showery and threatening . But it is one thing for a team to " throw " a game , and quite another for it to decline to exert itself to its utmost before a small congregation of the faithful . For the charge of the former offense there is reallY no evidence at all . We remark with interest that the cognoscenti of baseball are inclined ftb scout our suggestion that , , the bat should be flattened ( by the way . we never said widened , also ) in order to put the batsman more nearly on an equality with the pitcher : But we also remark that , however much they may disagree with our conclusion , they agree to pur , premise that the preponderance of the pitcher is injurious to the interest of the game . The pitcher , In fact , is too . important a player , and the other players are too unimportant . The better pitcher , or the luckier , wins the game , in professional baseball as now conducted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put the two sides more nearly on an equality , or whether it be some other device , is not important . The important thing is that some device to that end should be sought and found .
