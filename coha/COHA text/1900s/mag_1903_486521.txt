THE APPEAL TO CONSCIENCE . Colombia 's appeal to the American people , issued on Saturday , is a document at once dignified and pathetic . It is the voice of a weak people asking considerate treatment by a nation of resistless power . Admitting that we have a giant 's strength , Colombia implores us not to_the use it to her wrong and undoing . As if cherishing the belief that the events of the past few weeks have all been a hideous mistake , the rash and overbearing act of men for a little time in authority at Washington , the Colombians go straight to " the national conscience of the United States , " in which there resides , as they fully recognize , a power more dread than army or navy , or the arrogance of temporary rulers . Now , whatever success or failure may attend this appeal , it is a peculiarly awkward one for the Administration to deal with . Bluster or threats it could have smiled at  --  would have welcomed eagerly : virtuous indignation is easily aroused against those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from recovering property which we had filched from her , might even have been popular But for a moral and Christian Government to be approached with reasonings about right and justice ; for an Administration which has loftily lectured Russia on the necessity of keeping faith , and has stood aghast at England s oppression of the weak , to have its own doctrines turned upon it with a de to Tabula  --  that is the particularly hard thing for a churchgoing President to have to face . What shall it profit him to gain a canal and lose his self-respect ? Mr. Roosevelt ought not to be the man to be deluded or satisfied by the applause of the unthinking . Any President striking an heroic pose in the presence of a foreign nation can evoke the shouts of the vulgar . Mr. Cleveland did it in 1895 . From being the best hated and most isolated President in Washington , he passed in an hour to floods of praise and congratulation  --  all becauk he had appealed to the baser instincts of the people . So to-day President Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that we " ought to have taken the canal long ago " ; of every muddle-headed man who argues , " Well , you see , under the Monroe Doctrine , we ca n't let those revolutions go on , " or who reasons , " Under the treaty , you know , we just had to recognize Panama the moment she said she was independent . " And , of course , every American who belieVes in bullying , or loves a row , or thinks that his country is never great . unless cheating some-body , or has the mere " loveless lust of territory , " is hurrahing for a President who was " too quick on the trigger for the d  --  d Dagoes . " But what can all this mean to an educated man in the White House , who knows the difference between the groundlings of the purchased Press and the judicious of  --  let us say  --  his own Harvard ? Some good people , still believing in the sanctions of the moral law , and mindful of what the prophets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are looking about as for some supernatural intervention to prevent the completion of our outrage of a weak and friendly nation . They even say that a just God can not permit the fruition of such a wrong But history laughs  --  or weeps  --  that down . Not directly or immediately is the penalty for national aggression visited upon the aggressor It comes in subtle ways , delayed often , but none the less sure . In our own case , it is probable , one form of punishment will be a deterioration in the Presidency . This ' may not come in Roosevelt 's day . But his example will live and work mischief after him . Some weak and little scrupulous man ; carried into the White House by political accident , may hereafter find himself in great difficulties at home , and , thinking of Roosevelt 's success in firing the crowd by reckless conduct in foreign relations , may seek to imitate him , and plunge the nation into untold miseries . This is an aspect of the Presidential office often overlooked . Each President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation for deliberate and lawful action ; its constant eye to the country 's dignity , and not the passion of the hour ; its willingness to err , if at all , on the side of justice rather than on that of oppression  --  all this is as an accumulated treasure which every President is under obligation to guard and swell . But Mr. Roosevelt , in the Panama proceeding , has done his best to squander it . Whatever may be done with Colombia 's moral arguments , two points in her legal statement demand the immediate attention of the Administration and of Congress . One is that she stands ready to " concede through pacific and equitable ways " all that the United States is attempting to obtain by force That is to say , all the shrill outcry about the " robber politicians " of Colombia , and the rejected canal treaty being an end of friendship , falls to the ground . Colombia will give us a satisfactory treaty if we ask for it in the usual way . Furthermore , says the Colombian Foreign Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he states , was notified by the United States that , if the treaty were nat ratified without change , we should " take painful measures " Where is that dispatch of Secretary Hay 's ? Who authorized him to assume such a minatory attitude ? Why was not this critical dispatch sent to Congress , in answer to its request for the correspondence ? These questions require instant answer by the State Department Failing it , Congress should again- make itself heard in a matter so nearly affect= ing the national honor . THE ISTHMUS HOLDING COMPANY , LIMITED . In seeking an apology for the recent Isthmian negotiations , we have found it in their striking similarity to certain established methods of finance . It has come to be axiomatic , for example , that when several warring companies can not control each its own affairs , they may collectively be controlled and recognized by simply putting them all in the hands of a holding company . The operations of such holding company , naturally , must be underwritten by some responsible party . But , curiously enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been questioned even whether they are entities in a strict legal sense . No one denies , however , that they exist so far as holding the disputed interests is concerned and for all purposes of voting the stock  --  a service usually rendered by self-appointed " voting directors . " The greatest of all these holding coo panies is beyond question the new Republic of Panama Recall the circumstances of its organization . The conflicting interests were the national rights of Colombia , the French Panama franchise , the claims of the United States , and the unfinished canal itself  --  all hopelessly disjoined . The need of a holding company for these unmanageable concerns was urgent , and the Republic of Panama  - -  emerged . Holding the canal already , it assumed the rights of Colombia , and asked France and the United States to surrender their stock in exchange for certificates of benevolent intentions . whom redounds the credit for transferring this familiar financial device to the sphere of world politics it would be premature to say . Clearly , Colom-bia had nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulate Let history distribute the glory between the French Panama Company and our own State Department . Whoever did it was quite as much an inventor as an adapter , for the Panama Holding Company differed from the financial sort in being absolutely self-constituted . There was no tedious demand for the deposit of stock or other authorization  --  or , if such there were , the thing was done covertly and without delay . A consolidation that requires neither persuasion nor the consent of the consolidated may well make Mr. Morgan look to his laurels . A further advantage lay in the Panama consolidation : whereas financial holding companies are made big and powerful so that they may be beyond the possibility of dangerous attack , the Panama Trust was made so small that its underwriter could hold it in the hollow of his hand . If the French Company may have seemed to deserve credit so far , there is no slightest doubt that any further thanks are due to the swift executive action of President Roosevelt . That transfer of a great steel plant to a bankrupt ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with greater celerity and certainty . The historic moment at which the infant republic found itself irrevocably underwritten by the United States may be pictured to the imagination as follows : President Roosevelt , having happily learned in some mysterious way that the . promoters of the holding company were lurking in the back alleys of Panama , telegraphs to Cansul Ehrmann : " Is there by any chance a holding company with you ? If so , tell them they are underwritten by us . " From Consul Ehrmann ticks back the response : " Not yet . You have forgotten the difference of time . The holding company will organize in two hours . Will underwrite it . " For two hours the instrument was silent , and then the dispatch flew from Panama ? " There now happens to be a holding company " . ; and from Washington the emphatic reply . " Underwrite it immediately . " So a new chapter of history opened . At this point the fine Italian hand of Secretary Hay intervenes ; applying the principle of limited responsibility to the newest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hitherto voted through their trustees . That complicates matters even for the banking houses which have chosen the trustees . How much more available , thought Secretary Hay , a company which should merely hold , while we , the underwriters , do the voting ! That principle ? " vote first , then discuss " ? was established , it will be recalled , at the stockholders ' meeting of a local traction company The astute combination of the two principles in a case in statecraft is Mr. Hay 's most original contribution to international polity Malicious critics may be inclined to cite the case of the dummy directors of the Shipbuilding Trust , but the analogy is superficial . The dummy directors held nothing whatever , but they did vote The Isthmus Holding Company , Limited , has actually held the canal for a matter of a fortnight , but it will not be allowed to vote at all ; unless , indeed , Minister Varilla 's compliance in the presence of Secretary Hay 's stern eye and a new pen may be interpreted as the casting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We present this remarkable instance of the combination of all . the approved Wall Street methods not by way of defence . The affair needs none . From passers of the " flimsy " to Trust organizers there is only one voice . " It is the slickest yet , " is the universal comment But we do wish to impress upon those who have organized previous holding companies a sense of their paltering and half-hearted methods . When Wall Street sees a holding company that does not require the assent of those Whose Property it takes in charge , and that can not vote , then indeed it may proclaim the promised time when musty old precedents shall have been relegated to the junk heap . It will pay the Trusts to study President Roosevelt 's recent flotation . When they kiss the hand that smote them , they will be recognizing not only their master , but their most resourceful exemplar . FROM GROTIUS TO GROSVENOR . Who can maintain that Grotius contributed more to the science of international law than our own Professor Grosvenor ? The great Dutchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dregs of conscience ; but he represents an exploded theory . He made the mistake of confounding law and justice He lived long before the days of that American community which , after profound meditation on the proper inscription to be placed over the portal of a new court house , decided on lex instead of justitta . Moreover , Grotius , with all his vast learning , was weak linguistically . It is fine to write elegant Latin , but far better to use the vernacular with subtlety . That is where our Amherst professor stands . head and shoulders above Grotius . He knows how to fit the euphemistic word to the . ugly act . Nearly three centuries have elapsed since Grotius wrote ' De Jure Belli et Pacis , ' but Professor Grosvenor is quite right in saying , on his own principles , that " international law is still in its in-fancy . " The capstone will be put on the Science of international law when means have been discovered for a " court of last re sort . " Then the ideal of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attained . Heretofore , that end has seemed , like the Golden Rule , a dream It has been in the domain of international politics what " competition " was in the economic field until our - captains of industry and our barons of finance took the matter in hand . This is a revolutionary age , and nothing so much attests the greatness of Professor Grosvenor as the fact that he has kept abreast of it . Amherst surpasses Leyden at one definition ? " the right of eminent domain among States . " There you have the easy solution of the greatest problem that has vexed the minds of publicists since Aristotle . The " court of last resort " has finally become a possibility . - It took a powerful mind to think out the doctrine that competition could be eliminated by " capitalizing the future . " But it was an even higher wisdom which discerned that the true " comity of nations " can be attained if every nation will constitute itself a court of last resort . To be sure , in the first instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second it truly means the arbitrament of arms . But that is where the euphemism comes in . In the case of our capitalizing the future , it made possible and dignified the distribution of some hundreds of millions of worthless securities among innocent and deluded investors . In the case of " the right of eminent domain among States , " it makes the- worse appear the better part in a flagrant and vulgar act of international bullying . Of course , it is not to be expected that the new law of " eminent domain " among States should be perfectly applied at the start . It takes time to reduce great discoveries to practice . But all that will come . The great thing is to maintain the unities There should be no announcement of revolutions two hours before they actually occur ; but a mere inadvertence of that sort can not vitiate a great law . As well might you belittle the science of gunnery because your young artilleryman fails to make sufficient allowance for " windage , " as to cast ridicule on " eminent domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as longitude . The virtue of a principle lies in its application ; and it is safe to say that no principle admits of wider and more successful application than this new one . The universality of Gresham 's law is bound to seem a very lijnited affair beside the universality of Grosvenor 's law . Every foreign office will welcome its discovery , because of its labor-saving quality . From Xerxes 's invasion of Greece to Roberts 's invasion of the Transvaal , the rulers of mankind have racked their " brains to frame pretexts for aggression . No more will this be necessary . Henceforth they will only have to plead " the right of eminent domain , " What would not Louis XIV have given for that term when he was striving to determine " the natural frontier " of France ? Even Dr. Jameson could be rehabilitated if it could be proved beyond peradventure that he was consciously invading the Transvaal in behalf of the right of eminent domain . And only think of the future when " Destiny " and " Eminent Domain " shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of the prophets to foresee what will happen . Some day the " interests of mankind " will demand the absorption of Holland by Germany Can Holland object , any more than a man whose land has been condemned in the interest of a railroad corporation ? What a tremendous use Russia can make of Professor Grosvenor 's law ! She is more in the clutch of " Destiny " than any nation on earth . Not only does she kill off her Jewish subjects in accordance with this great law , but she comes pretty near to treading on our on toes in Mantchuria . Think , too , what rights under " eminent domain " she is entitled to in China proper . Shall that country of wonderful natural resources be allowed to withhold them much longer from the use of suffering mankind ? Not if Amherst College can prevent it . Professor Grosvenor has provided the true salve for the lacerated feelings of Finn and Macedonian . But why multiply instances ? There are gods many and lords many , but we have added one more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Grosvenor is its prophet . CHATTER ABOUT FOREIGN TRADE Secretary Shaw was as delightful as ever in his speech about foreign trade , at the Chamber of Commerce dinner last week . No man excels him in taking for granted premises which are in dispute , and reasoning from them with brilliant inconsequence . It was said of Burke that he discussed national finance and trade with the zeal of a man talking all the while about his private affairs . Mr. Shaw brings to the men actually engaged in the great commerce advice as of a small banker in Iowa , announcing his firm belief that there is such a thing as foreign trade ( since he has just discovered it ) , and asserting that we ought to have all there IS going , but displaying no real conception of what exchange of goods with other nations really is , or how it is Fought about . It was as if to characterize such talk as the Secretary 's , leading nowhere , that Mr J J Hill said on the same day , with expert authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we wo n't sha n't be in that trade until we get people who realize what it means . " One good instance of . Mr Shaw 's insouciant mixing up of things was his Jingo declaration that the Government was not going to " waste time in carrying out this canal project , " coupled immediately with his statement- " We must have the trade with the countries to the south of us " Now , what has been the first and inevitable trade effect of our high-handed course on the Isthmus ? Undoubtedly , to give us a considerable . setback Only week before last an ardent patriot was discoursing to a business man on the glorious Yankee smartness with which the Government had got the better of Colombia . " Well , " said the other ruefully , " all I know is that it has killed my business . " He was in the Colombian trade , and all orders had , of course , been cancelled Nor is this by itself any joke to a country imperatively requiring , as Secretary Shaw says , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , our best customer in all South America in the matter of cotton manufactures For the nine months , ending in September , she took of us 15 , - 376,677 yards  --  twice as much as Brazil , seven times as , much , we may add , as the Philippines . It is , surely , a fine stroke of business to cut off a market like that , with the cotton manufacture depressed as it is to-day ! One might not think , from the all too fresh mind which Secretary Shaw brings to the problem of South American trade , that a great body Of official and economic evidence on that subject had been laboriously gathered . Our consuls have for many years been dinning into the ears of the exporters of the United States the homely truths to which heed must be given if trade is to be won in South America . They have shown how , first of all England and France and Germany held the advantage of position . Fifst to cultivate the field , their representatives on excellent terms personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents of the United States have been notoriously antipathetic ; carefully studying the needs of . themarket and studiously catering to them  --  in other words , applying intelligence and persistency to the business  --  these countries had far outstripped the United States . Our protection policy not only had made us home-keeping , but had given us homely wits . The Consular Reports have ibeen filled with the ineptitude , the stupidity , the casual and easily relaxed efforts of our exporters to get a foothold in South America , They had talked heroically and resolved enthusiastically about South American trade , but had gone about getting it in a dunderhead fashion . Naturally they had got but a little . It is a fact , however  --  though one of the facts which does not swim into the ken of Secretary Shaw  --  that we have been steadily improving our position in recent years . Our merchants have been More enterprising . Our shippers have been more alert . Great manufacturing concerns have been more intelligently and continuously cultivating the South American market . The result has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shows what might be done by extension of the same methods . Thus , our eiiports to all South America , which in 1893 ' were $32,000,000 , had increased by 1902 to $38,000,000 . During the same period , imports from those countries to the United States had grown from $102,000,000 to $119,000,000 . But this trade of over $150,000,000 a year does not seem to Secretary Shaw to be " respectable " What he really wants is the whole South American trade . He would not let . Europe have a penny of it . " All for us , " is his motto ; and as Long as ordinary business methods do not give us more than our present " paltry " share , he cries aloud for Subsidies and more fighting vessels and more quarrels and interferences . But while he is thus talking about trade , business men have been quietly - getting it . Needless to say , Secretary Shaw 's dreams are all of exports . Imports are , to so stout a " stand-patter " as he , very like the unclean thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look at the actual phenomena of foreign trade as it ' is carried on by the nations that make a serious business of it , he would see that give and take is its one great rule . In the case of Cuba , we are slowly recognizing this elementary truth . If we will not buy of her , she will Met buy of us . But Argentina has been for years knocking at our ddors for a similar reciprOcity treaty . It was negotiated , in fact , and urged upon the Senate by President McKinley , only to go to the tomb of the Capulets . Until we are ready to do the obvious thing of making laws to remove the artificial fetters upon our South American trade , let us hear no more about subsidies . and battleships to make the South Americans trade with us willy-nilly . Mr. Shaw would , of course , call all this mere " theory . " But , the facts being what they are , we may say of that epithet , as Bentham said of the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a term " in use among official persons for the condemnation of whatsoever proposition is too adverse to private interests not to be hated , and at the same time too manifestly true to be denied . " EDITIONS DE L UXE . A curious side current of the recent speculative debauch leads into the usually placid field of book publishing . Widely puffed editions de luxe of no intrinsic merit have , by some gratifying law of compensation , been foisted on the gentlemen who were assiduously creating factitious stock-market values . At a recent sale in Philadelphia many thou sands of dollars ' worth of these books were knocked down at about 15 cents on the dollar  --  an instructive parallel to certain phenomena of forced liquidation in Wall Street A Scott and a Dumas , for example , that had cost $100 a volume , sold for $10 . The decline in prices was out of all proportion to the present , or the possible , fall in what one may call intrinsic book values . The wonder in both cases is not that certain classes of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ever so high , for in both cases the prices were the product at best of manipulation , at worst of fraudulent representations . And here comes in a curious principle of inversion . Stocks were unloaded readily because there were so many of them ; Masons de luxe were floated because there were so few examples of . each . Apparent rarity was the lure . It was tried in all the forms : say , five hundred of the regular edition , beside fifty on " large paper " and ten on Japanese vellum . Duplicate illustrations and the insertion of " hand-painted " water colors still further diversified the bait and confused the mind of the unwary -- purchaser. - In most cases these limited sets were of the slightest intrinsic merit  --  their contents a mere reprint of some standard work ; manufacture showy rather than good , illustrations expensive rather than artistic , editorial features either absent or perfunctory . The appeal was frankly to those whose principle in assembling a library or a collection is " hang the expense . " An edition of Dickens at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The challenge to virtually illiterate wealth could hardly be more flagrant . The success with which many of these issues met was due to the snobbery of the expensive . The buyers actually thought they were getting the best simply because they paid three or four times the price of the standard editions The delusion lay in the fond belief that any inherently worthless thing acquires value when found in only a few exam . pies . Most of the pretentious reprints were not worth even the cost of manufacture , for editions superior in every way were on the market already Thus the ready sale of the most expensive edition was a bit of jobbery between publishers and booksellers , on the strength of the buyer 's ignorance or extravagance . It was bringing into the book trade the criterion of the newest and dearest thing . Most of these " sumptuous " editions were simply " gent 's furnishings " for a library . As always , there are exceptions to this rule . When a book as to be a masterpiece of the printer 's art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number ; only a few hundred perfect impressions can be made from type , while the market for a fine piece ' of printing is necessarily restricted to a small class of connoisseurs Nobody will quarrel with the Boston publishers ' who are offering a superb folio Montaigne in this fashion , nor yet with the New York house which gives to a new and original edition of Shakspere a distinctive typographical form , and limits the issue But in such cases the value lies in every copy , and not in the extraneous fact that the editions are small . For beautiful printing one pays properly , whether it be Jenson 's or William Morris 's or Mr. De Vinne 's , or Mr. " Updike 's . And the laborious editor , too , is worthy of his hire . So far we have assumed that the application of the de luxe idea is conducted in good faith , that the purchaser at least gets the money 's worth he has bargained for . A little inspection of the " cut-rate " book stores will prove that nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraudulent . The same plates often serve for a dozen " strictly limited issues , " each one solemnly offering its small paper , large paper , Japanese vellum , etc . By changing the title-page , thus evading the law , and cheapening the illustrations , your fivedollar-a-volume treasure will turn upas a 37 cents a volume bargain  --  but still de luxe , and " strictly limited to one thousand copies . " Furthermore , the levant morocco advertised in such cases will hardly bear inspection , while the audacity of a publisher who promises special binding by a famous French binder , dead a half century , needs no comment . Bibliophiles and readers certainly - have no reason to regret the ' depression in this industry . The victims of that peculiar form of inflation usually belonged to neither class . Bibliophiles know how to weigh the respective merits of , say , the Scott that his publishers put forth in the miniature form that the author loved , and with the Turner vignettes he admired ; and the latest Waverly novels with special illustrations and an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value in printing or illustration , or sentimental value through some personal association , the bibliophile will none of it . Since the peculiar form of vanity to which these flimsy rarities appeal seem ineradicable , we propose that all whom it concerns should form a De Luxe Protective Association , Limited . Such a body could at least hold speculative publishers to their contracts , and could ensure that extra water-colors and the like were really ; hand-painted . "
