SIR : The letter of Mr. George Dwight Kellogg in the Nation No. 1842 opens with an extraordinary , if unwitting , mistake involving great injustice to a much injured man of genius . The attribution to Comm . Boni of the restoration of the Ducal Palace at Venice has no justification whatever . He was in that work a pupil and underworker of one of those peculiarly Italian bidders of whom Maitani , Arnolfo di Lapo , and the heads of the Comacine builders were earlier examples  --  neither architects in the modern sense nor master masons , but builders in the best sense , and known- as eapimastri . Vendrasco is , or perhaps was , so far as I know , the sole survivor in our days of his craft , and to him is due every detail of the long and marvellous work of the restoration of the Ducal Palace  --  a work I watched from 1876 down to the day when Vendraseo was dismissed , to the disgrace of the Italian Government , from the position of head of the works on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ministry , mode Amerteano , in the person of the restorer of the Fondaco del Turchi , a piece of restoration which is the disgrace of Venice and its Municipal Council Comm Bom was a very intelligent and studious assistant and pupil of Vendrasco , but was not responsible for a single detail of the work , which was a matter of pure engineering . I made . his acquaintance in that position , and became interested in his profound and curious researches into the old work of Venice , its geology , and building materials , and I called the attention of the Ministry of Public Instruction to his remarkable abilities in research as deserving a wider field He was , mainly in consequence of my so doing , called to a place in the Ministry at Rome . My relations with him have always been , and remain , most cordial , and his late successes in a more responsible position than that in which I first knew him have been to me a personal gratification , but he does not want the laurels of Vendrasco . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz. , that he restored the Ducal Palace under the advice of Ruskin . But Ruskin opposed tooth and nail any and all restoration of the Ducal Palace , and denounced it to the last ; and when Sir Henry Layard took him to see the completed west and south facades , and Ruskin had to admit that he could not distinguish the restored from the untouched capitals , he still said , " But it should not have been done . " As the most marvellous piece of restoration ever executed , the honor it may give must not be withheld from the old eapomastro who was the deviser of every device and appliance employed in it .

The paper , type , and binding are most harmonious and pleasing , the reproductions of busts and bas-reliefs of the Emperor are excellent . A companion book to Bury 's ' Philobiblon ' ( previously noticed in these columns ) is ' Bibliomania in the Middle Ages , ' by F Somner Merryweather , a somewhat obscure London bookseller of the earlier part of the century , chiefly known as the compiler of those ' Lives and Anecdotes of Misers ' with which Silas Wegg pandered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bros &; Co. ) shows him to have been an enthusiastic student of old book-lore ; and he has here assembled a store of curious information about old monastic libraries , their management and treasures . Perhaps the most remarkable book he mentions is the superb Bible written by Alcuin for Charlemagne , and containing an inscription in Alcuin 's own hand . This precious relic was presented by Charles 's grandson to a monastery in Lorraine , and was preserved by the monks until 1793 , when , their property being confiscated , it fell into the hands of dealers , and , after various vicissitudese found at last a resting-place in the British Museum for the sum of ? 750 ? a ridiculous price , if the genuineness be unimpeached . The printing and general make-up of this book are excellent ; but we could wish that the editor had paid more attention to the proofreading . Of the Latin quotations in ' Artie= ular , there is scarce a line that is not barbarously mangled Merryweather makes some pretensions to Latin scholarship , though his translation of porri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of a nature to beget a suspicion. , The last volume in the Dent-Macmillan " Medieval Towns , " ' The Story of Florence , ' by Mr. Edmund G. Gardner , deserves nothing but praise . The historical account is all that we should expect from such a Dentist as is Mr. Gardner . True , he confines himself perhaps a little too closely to the Middle Ages , and even Brunelleschi 's dome does not so overshadow Florence as Dante does its history in the little volume before us . But if this be a fault it is on the right side , perhaps . Nor is the age of the Medici and Humanism by any means neglected As a guide-book we seldom have seen anything more commendable , and , considering that Mr. Gardner is , after all , a compiler and nothing more , it is surprising how free he is from errors , either of fact or of judgment . Miss Erichsen 's illustrations are a welcome improvement upon those by the late Miss Tame in previous volumes of this series . An excellent feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engraved towards the end of the fifteenth century . ' Dr. Charles Conrad Abbott 's ' In Nature 's Realm ' ( Trenton , N. J. : Albert ' Brandt ) is one of the author 's characteristic monologues on the aspects of Nature among the Jersey meadows . Some of the chapters have already seen the light In print , others are new , all have been revised , enlarged , and now brought together in luxurious typography , and attractively illustrated by Oliver Kemp . Of the artist 's work nothing can be said in criticism , its delicacy , truth to nature , and decorative effect are as admirable as they are unusual . There are ninety of these little sketches , besides a charming frontispiece in photogravure . The whole get-up of the book testifies to the good taste of the publisher . Of the teat little can be said but that it is in Dr. Abbott 's usual vein , which , while never rasing to the first literary excellence , has an attractiveness of its own that has insured him an appreciative audience for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether just or unjust , is best forgotten by the brookside or under the trees , and that his most successful chapters are those in which there is no reference to the tribulations of authorship . The volume entitled ' Francis , the Little Poor Man of Assisi , ' by James Adderley ( London Edwin Arnold ) , is curious as a product of the movement in the Anglican Church- towards medievalism It seeks to present the founder of the Minorites as a model  --  except , we presume , as to obedience to the Bishop of Rome ; but , beautiful as was the character of the saint , this compendium of his acts and teachings ' will scarce produce many emulators of his virtues , or bring a materialistic age to . embrace with him Lady Poverty as the choicest of earthly blessings . The bald , commonplace English robs of all their charm the touching reminiscences of the Fioretti and the Speculum Perfections , and it is impossible not to have one 's sense of congruity fatally upset by such comments as , " Whatever our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite certain-that Francis would have been horrified at the very idea . " A well-digested , well-written life of Thomas Moore is a desideratum . We regret we can not find it in Mr. Gunning 's ' Moore : Poet and Patriot , ' lately published by Gill &; Son in Dublin . The book looks attractive , but that is all . As to style and judgment , the following paragraph may be sufficient . " And what , we may ask , - has- Moore done to merit niches in the temples of poetry and history  --  the great bequests of the ages  --  the recording angels of Time ? He has , we answer , indelibly recorded our national traditions and the glories of our ancient race in lyrics the most sweet and beautiful the world has ever seen . " Irish fairy stories are charming , but they lose much of their charm when not taken neat , and he indeed must be a competent hand that attempts to reset or retell them . Mr. Frost , in his ' Fairies and Folk of Ireland ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essayed the task . We can not congratulate him on the result . They may satisfy as Irish fairy stories those who have not met them in better form . Mrs O'Brien , John , and Kitty may pass as exemplars of Irish Peasantry to those who have never read Carleton or Miss- Barlow The book is attractively brought out and well illustrated. , In so far as Mr. Frost takes stories from Kennedy and others , always with proper acknowledgment , and keeps tolerably close to the originals , the book is of value . The passage of Irish fairies on board an Atlantic liner to this country is really too bad . Few of the publications of the Catholic Truth Society , London , will particularly commend themselves to Protestants . We must , however , make an exception in favor of the ' Catholic Temperance Reader , ' by the Rev W. H. Cologan and Sir F. R Cruise , M D. It is one of the best , most moderate and convincing books of its class  --  one that should find a place in Protestant schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that a gentleman should be a gentleman especially in his hymns and prayers Mr Charles F. Dole 's attitude in ' The Religion of a Gentleman ' ( Crowell &; Co ) is not of the superior and critical kind ; his contention is not merely that " a gentleman " should have something in the way of a religion , and not at all that " any old religion will do " His terms are taken in the modern and democratic sense ? by " gentleman " he means any young man who aims to know and do the right , and the religion he recommends is a life and not a convention His ruling ideas are those of his own time and not of former ages , and he urges them in a manly and kindly way , which leaves small room for objection . His little book will not add to the learning of the wise , but it can benefit those who are beyond catechism and Sunday-school , and ready for secondary instruction in spiritual things .

This , in such a connection , is a pity , since Americans ( always excepting the Yankees ) are , as a race , by no means deserving the contempt which all cultivated minds entertain for the preeminently vulgar wealth-worshipping denizens of the United States .

Among other articles is a reminiscence , by Gen. Greely , of the cyclone which destroyed Indianola . Texas , in 1875 . In a report on labor conditions in France in the Consular Reports for November there is a reference to an employers ' syndicate in Lyons . Its object is " to further the interests of builders , to study and propose improvement in buildings , to secure the employment of the best material , to decide all disputes relating to the execution or the interpretation of contracts , the fixing of prices , etc " Since its organization in 1862 , twenty-three strikes have occurred , all of which have been settled by committees of the strikers and of the syndicate It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractors and men or companies for whom they are doing work .

The society has a reserve fund from which prizes are given yearly to students in architecture and other pursuits pertaining to building . There are 625 members . The United States Department of Agriculture has published a report upon the field operations of the Division of Soils during 1899 , describing soil surveys of various areas scattered throughout New Mexico , Utah , and Connecticut , and aggregating 720,000 acres . It comprises an introduction by Milton Whitney , the chief of the division , and special reports on the several lines of field work by scientific assistants ( in cooperation , in sonic instances , with educational institutions in different parts of the country ) .

A second instalment of papers relating to the ' Fossil Remains of Lake Callabonna ' forms the latest number of the memoirs of the Royal Society of South Australia In the first of these , E. C.

This creature is believed to have been over six feet in height , and to have resembled in many respects the emeu and the cassowary . The second paper is by E. C.

In December , 1897 , a committee was appointed by the American Philosophical Society to examine the manuscripts in the possession of the Society , with the view to making them more available to the public . The first results of the labors of this committee are calendars of the correspondence of Gen. Nathanael Greene , Gen. Weedon , and of the Lee papers  --  manuscripts of Arthur and - Richard Henry Lee . The last-named papers were printed by the grandson of Richard Henry Lee , and are well known for their interest . The correspondence of Gen. Greene is all new , and , covering the period of his service as Quartermaster-General of the Continental army during the darkest days of the Revolution , they emphasize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a study of the effects of an inflated paper currency , these records are of general value . There was a plenty of money , and bills could be had for the asking ; but when it came to obtaining commodities for them few were willing to receive them after 1779 , and in 1780 , when Congress declared itself bankrupt and unable even to reiterate its most solemn pledges of redemption of old and provision of new issues , they disappeared from circulation True , an attempt was made to wipe out thirty-nine out of every forty dollars of obligation ; but what remained was merely another form . of unsupported paper . The suf fering must have been intense . With wheat at twenty-five dollars a bushel , and all things else in proportion , what was a salary of one hundred and forty dollars a month ? The assistant quartermasters were charged with depreciating the money , because they offered such high wages to meet an emergency .

In October , 1779 , Col. Hay found that a whole year 's salary was required to pay for a suit of clothes . Poor pay produced poor service . A distemper prevailed among the horses near Fishkill , and the farrier , " after a tolerably decent flogging , " ran away . To pay one corps of claimants produced discontent in others , and precipitated heavy demands for settlement , which could not be met . Artificers , smiths , and wheelwrights struck from time to time for higher pay , and transportation ceased at times for want of a little ready money . It is a striking picture , and deserves careful study , both for the exposition of - economic fallacy and the full display of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Society has done well to encourage their publication . ? The first volume of the writings of James Madison has been published in the Putnam series under the editorship of Gaillard Hunt . Madison 's correspondence has a value peculiar to itself , for it forms one of the most minute and detailed records of events and policies which have come down to us Throughout his life he was making notes for the information of others . With his first entrance into the Continental Congress in 1780 , he became the constant correspondent of Jefferson , Randolph , and Pendleton Later in life he formed close friendships with Washington and Hamilton . He took notes of the debates in the Congress , digested them for these friends , and told a consecutive story of what was done and said . His debates of the Constitutional Convention are the best sources of information on that notable assembly , and wherever he was , the habit of recording passing events dominated him He lived a life of comparative calm , and the activity around him interested and amused him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as a closet politician he will best be known , as a man who could draw distinctions so fine as to be misinterpreted by his friends as well as by his opponents . ? To edit his writings a wide knowledge and high accuracy are demanded of the editor . Mr. Hunt seems to possess both of these qualities , and his first volume gives promise of a task well performed . He has wisely included the entire debates in the Continental Congress of 1782- ' 83 , which were accessible only in Gilpin , and has used the correspondence of that period as footnotes where the letters were needed to explain the text He has found some new letters to Pendleton , some reports made to the Continental Congress , and prints in full the important instructions to Jay . By referring to the manuscript , he has been able to make good the many omissions of the editor of the ' Wntings of Madison ' ? omissions of no little importance , and troublesome to the reader because not indicated . For one example , in 1780 Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , " Unless liberal principles prevail on this " ' occasion , I shall ' be under the necessity of selling  --  a ' negro " Mr Hunt has not hesitated to apply to ' others for aid in his notes , and Mr Phillips identifies for him a map described by Madison . He might have included the ' Observations on the Influence of Vermont ' and a letter to Jefferson of May 5 , 1781 It is to be regretted that he had not access to the McGuire collection , where the original drafts of the letters included in the ' Madison Papers ' were to be found The letters to Randolph on pp. 132 and 133 were both written in 1782 , not in ' 1781 ; and the name of the general scratched by Madison ( p 379 ) was in all probability Gates , as a paper by Rufus King shows It is true , Hamilton suggests Knox , and Jefferson hints at Steuben , but their relations with Washington would have prevented such a plot . ? There is nowhere else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the dwellers in large cities are proportionately so few , as there are in the eleven States which formerly constituted the Southern Confederacy . Of their nineteen million inhabitants , less than one million three hundred thousand , or about one in every - sixteen , live in cities of over twenty-five thousand inhabitants . In the other thirty-four States of the Union there are more than eighteen million urban residents , and these constitute nearly one-third pf the entire population As we have already pointed out , during the last decade the Southern cities grew but very little more rapidly than the rural districts of the same States , and the percentage of the total population residing in cities of over twenty-five thousand inhabitants , which was 6 52 in 1890 , is but 6.77 in 1900 . In the rest of the country the proportion of urban residents rose during the decade from 29 30 to 32 58 per cent . It is possible that when the figures for the smaller cities are made ' public , it may appear that the recent growth of manufactures in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - towns with between four-thousand andtwelat5s-five thousand inhabitants. - The ' statistics for Alabama-and Arkansas , which are now available , ' do not indicate , however , any marked movement in that direction The fact that so small a proportion of the residents of the South live in cities perhaps accounts for its relatively large rate of natural increase The eleven States of the former Confederacy probably gained little , either by immigration from abroad or from the other - sections of this country , yet in the last ten years their-total population has increased at a slightly greater ratio than that of the other thirty-four States , although those other States have received probably nineteen-twentieths of the nearly four millions of immigrants who during the decade have come into the coun-try ? Since 1890 the Southern States have grown at the rate of 20 82 , the other States at the rate of 19 91 per cent The rate of increase in these eleven Southern States is almost precisely what it was in the - preceding decade , the falling-'off having been , less than one-tenth of one per cent , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 per cent. , or from 26.02 to 19 91 per cent About 3 per cent of this falling-off is due to the decrease in immigration during the decade . Thee rest seems to ' be attributable to a steady lowering of the birth-rate , and probably to somel increase in the death-rate If theie has been any increase in the latter , it is , of course , due to the fact that ' a larger Proportion of the population now live in cities , in which the mortality is heavier than it is in the country regions , and not to any increase in the death-rate of particular cities . For years past the political conditions in the eleven States under discussion have been abnormal They have representation in the House of Representatives and in the electoral college in proportion to their aggregate population , and yet one-third or more of that population is in law or in fact , or in both , absolutely disfranchised . Outside of East Tennessee , some portions of western North Carolina and western-Virginia , practically all the population which has the franchise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States habitually vote in national as well as in local elections . The fact that in these States population is growing as fast as it is in the rest of the country , and even a little faster , shows that the problems arising frdra their political conditions are not likely soon to lose their practical importance . The census of ' 1900 gives New Hampshire 411,588 inhabitants The population has a little more than doubled in a century . At the first national census in 1790 it was 141,097 , in 1800 , 182,998 . The present figures do not altogether bear out the expectations entertained a hundred years ago , based upon the extraordinary growth which had marked the previous decades in spite of the active part taken by the people in the Revolutionary struggle . We read in Guthrie 's ' New System of Modern Geography ' ( first American edition , Philadelphia , 1795 , vol . II , pp. 346-7 ) , apropos of Dartmouth College : " This seminary possesses an immense landed property , extending to eighty thousand acres . . . The revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forty pounds currency . In less than sixty years , it is probable that New Hampshire and Vermont will be as populous as England , or very near it this refers to the population per square mile , let us hope The value of these lands will then rise in proportion . At five shillings sterling per acre , which will , by that time , have become a very moderate rent , these lands will then produce twenty thousand pounds sterling per annum . Such a prodigious revenue , if divided between twenty or thirty professors there were three professors and two tutors in 1792 , may injure if not ruin the college of Dartmouth , as far as regards every purpose of public utility . . . . It is the duty . therefore , of the Legislature of New-Hampshire , to guard against the absurdity of bestowing upon a professor , so immense a regular . salary , as to place him beyond the necessity of attending , in the strictest manner , to the duties of his office . " ? Primarily Mr. Richard Harding Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scribners ) is a record of personal experience . Incidentally , it is a forcefully presented argument concerning the war in South Africa , well calculated to stagger even the established opinions of those whom Mr. Davis declares to have been " misinformed and blinded by a propaganda against the Boer , a manipulation of press and Parliament which Has never been equalled in dexterity of mis-representation - nor audacity of untruth " Mr. Davis adthits that his prejudgment was decidedly pro-English , though his sympathies were with the " under dog . " His present position results from ' personal contact with , and personal " investigatiOn of , both sides . His verdict is , that the Transvaal war was " Murder , with intent to rob " This , like the preceding quotation , and some other statements in the book , might be pronounced hysterical . A thoughtful perusal of the work , whether or no its conclusions be accepted , disabuses the reader 's mind of any idea of hysteria . Mr Davis gives us a panorama of life with the English column in Natal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burghers in the Free State , and with the officials in Pretoria . All is picturesque , not a little is dramatic . He thus pictures the entrance of Buller 's relieving column into Ladysmith- " You must imagine the dry , burning beat , the fine , yellow dust , the white glare of the sunshine , and in the heat and glare and dust the-great interminable column-of men in ragged ' khaki- , crowding down the main street , ' 22,000 strong , cheering and- - shouting , with , the sweat running off ' their red faces and cutting little rivulets in the ' - dust that caked their cheeks . " Equally vivid and dramatics " though of another character , is the picture of a group of burghers who , after their defeat at Sand River , " stood immovable , leaning on their rifles , silent , homeless , looking down without rage or show of feeling at the great waves of khaki sweeping steadily towards them , and possessing their land : " ? Though not strictly a contribution to bird-literature , Mr. Maurice Thompson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be read by all bird-lovers The writer of these essays combines in a singUlas ? manner a genuine delight in the study of bird-life and an overweening passion for shooting the objects of his admiration . The fact that he carries no deadly gun , but a long bow made of seasoned yew , with which he more often misses than not , may serve to palliate his offences ; still , we fancy that members of the Audubon Society who are attracted to these pages by the really fascinating descriptions of Southern birds , will hardly find-themselves in sympathy with the likely author . Mr. Thompson writes in the " Jocund and intimate- style " of Montaigne , to whom one of these essays is devoted . He will do well to stick to studies of birds and flowers and Southern swamps , and spare us such literary criticism as the essay on Theocritus . Life in Louisiana , as Mr. Thompson paints it , is purely idyllic , and we imagine that the Gulf Coast in winter has rarely been more happily described . No-aspect of those woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . The Greek Anthology and Horace share his wanderings and appear with his lunch , but the literary criticism lacks sincerity . These touches , the quotations from Meleager , the reflections on Keats and Tennyson , are there for effect . But in his impassioned tale of the adventures of a purple Louisiana egret with a hawk , or when he studies the brutal tactics of the butcher-bird or the mockingbird 's " dropping-song , " his powers of Observation and of expression are-at their best ; and , in his own field , Mr. Thompson 's best is very good indeed . , A CHEERFUL FAILURE . Letters of Thomas Edward Brown . Westminster : Archibald Constable &; Co. ; New CO. 2 " vols Letters , apart from their original private use , may be of value as illustrating man= ners , chiefly of the liast , or otherwise contributing to history ; as exemplars of style , most cultivated in more leisurely ages , and especially in France ; as essential elements of biography , in the case of famous or important men , anything concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely , as revealing in obscurer writers a personality worth knowing and otherwise missed by the public . Mr. Brown 's letters belong to this last class , for he had no renown , except in a small way as a minor poet . A Manxman , born in 1830 , he became a servitor of Christ Church , Oxford , in 1849 , and a fellow of Oriel in 1854 , married in 1857 ; taught in his native isle 1856- ' 62 , then for a short time at Gloucester , where Henley was his pupil , and at Clifton ( Bristol ) till 1892 , when he settled at Ramsey in Man These facts , or some of them , are given grudgingly in an " Introductory Memoir , " which is rather laudatory than enlightening as to externals , and practically ends with his going to Clifton . All else , it says , " must be left to the letters to tell , " and they tell as little as may be of concrete details  --  house , income , family , and the like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown was no egotist . He was sundry other and better things , and-far from the common type of clerical schoolmaster . He spoke , indeed , of " schoolmastering " as " but a sorry business , " and of " a life steadfastly or normally rebellious against the calling to which circumstances had compelled " him . Mr. Irwin , in the Memoir , says : " It was known that Brown rather resented his calling , and it was generally believed that he was meffective and indifferent as , a teacher " ; but he thinks the boys knew better . Brown , however , seldom reviled his lot , and was as far from mental dyspepsia as from hypocrisy . Priest 's orders he took late in life , and in 1896 thus pleasantly discoursed on a topic he rarely mentions : " Sir , you do n't take any notice of my ' pastoral care .

" Reading and writing ppetry , seeing or writing to his friends , taking long solitary walks , were to him satisfying pursuits ; for common ambitions he had no use . " His cloth , his classes , his scholarship , sat upon him lightly ; none of them could monopolize him . His was the old choice , not often so sincerely made , or so happily realized as in his later years : give him a cot , a crust . and liberty , his inward resources could supply the rest .

But ' there 's odds o ' ' burlesques ' , I ' whiles ' get glimpses of quite a celestial travesty , which I suspect is the Odyssey . Undoubtedly , it is full of laughter .

In 1894 he could claim it as " somewhat of a distinction at my time of life to have teeth , and teeth that can ache " And a year later he could say , " I grow old naturally , comfortably , easily , and with assent and consent , " regardless of the facts that his income was modest and his fame based merely upon five ( or rather four ) small volumes of verse , mostly in dialect , whereof perhaps the best known was the unsigned ' Fo'c'sle Yarns , ' 1881 . ( These books received " a notice at once discriminating and informing " in the Quarterly Review for April , 1898 , and are now reprinted in one volume by Macmillan . ) So unaspiring and ineffective a spirit can hardly be called highly selected ; and yet he is not such as should be let wholly die , if only for these letters .
