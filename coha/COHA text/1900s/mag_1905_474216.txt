a hillside by the Quinebaug River , where once a prim little church shone white through the trunks of the maples that brushed their leaves against its tinted windows , a few blackened headstones , all atilt , still show through the obscuring briers like queer mushrooms thrust up from the mould . Only the cellar of the church is left , and its walls lean inward ; for the great roots of old , old maples ? that once stood guard by the vestry door ? have coiled themselves round the blocks of the stone foundations , slowly widen ? ing every chink , loosening each stone from its bed , yet holding it in a mighty grip that will not let it fall . The tops of the maples have long been dead ? the soft wood pierced with woodpeckers ' holes and riddled with the carved gal ? leries of the wood-ants , ? but the big boughs lower down still bear a luxuriant covering of leaves , and in the glare of noonday still cast their dappled shadows on the network of greenbrier beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , over the bared fantastic roots of the maples , over the lichen-grown gravestones . ? over every stump and boulder on the hillside . It is a very jungle of greenbrier . " Brier-town " I called it ? as a lad , when I used to visit it in winter , hard on the snow trail of some " cottontail " rab ? bit ; and as " Brier-town " I think of it still , for it was very populous . In their twisty runways through the briers a score or more of rabbits lived safe from hawks . But they were shy fellows , and hard to discover . A family of chipmunks were more friendly . They bunked in a cranny in the cellar wall , and kept a well-filled storehouse , too , in the hollow of the biggest maple . I used to sit , with my back against the bole of their tree , and absent-mindedly empty my pockets of acorns ; then stay dream ? ily quiet while one of those sly little thieves peeped round at me from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creep nearer , his claws scratch ? ing faintly on the bark behind me like the almost inaudible nibbling of a mouse in a bureau drawer at night ; nearer , nearer , ? whisk away again in fright , to circle the trunk from the other side ; then snatch a nut and scamper off , per ? haps to his storeroom above me , perhaps to the top of a tilting gravestone , there to chisel through the shell of the acorn and enjoy the bitter meat . One of the gravestones the chipmunks never mounted . It was the oldest one of all , and leaned nearest earth ; and on its under face a colony of white-faced hornets every year built their cone-shaped nest . Hour after hour they passed me , one at a time , on their way to the weather-worn shanty , across a neighbor ? ing field , where they collected the wood-pulp which their nimble mouths turned into the gray paper used in all their art . The droning crescendo of a hornet 's flight close by my car often startled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I knew my quick motion would frighten away the bird I might be watching . In just such a way , I remember , I scared off a wary old crow who had not seemed to notice inc where I lay in the maple 's shade , or who perhaps took me ? dressed as I was in overalls and half hidden under a farmer 's wide-brimmed hat ? for a tumble-down , empty-faced scarecrow , not deserving his attention . He was intent on pecking off a piece of one of the stones in the ruined cellar , and so near me that I could see the rows of feathers on his big neck play back end forth on each other when he deleted material forgot all else . In the scrap of gleam ? ing tin which he bad found ? for his prize was no more than a short strip of tin , broken perhaps from an old tobacco-box ? he took an eager delight wonderful to see . Near the foot of a birch-tree a rod away a big gray stone lay with its bulging sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crow took his bit of tin , and dropping it on the stone , fluffed up his feathers , and stood blinking in evident satisfaction to see the sparkle and glint of the metal . Again and again he shifted it about on the stone , or turned it over by a dexterous stroke of his beak , as if he continually sought for a brighter spot in which to display it . After a few minutes he picked it up and sprang into the air . Through the interstices of the full-leaved maple boughs I could sea him circle upwards , perhaps a hundred feet , and then balance himself on his broad wings , his wise-looking head hung low , the bit of tin flashing in his beak . Sud ? denly he let it fall , but with surprising agility swooped after it . Striking the stone , the tin rebounded , spinning in the sunlight , and dropped into a luxuriant mass of orange-flowered jewelweed . The crow , in swift pursuit , brushed the stone so closely that he , too , seemed to rebound from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While he was hidden in this maze of flowers and leafy stalks I crept nearer for a better view of him when he should appear . Before long he came pushing out of the tangle , with scraps of leaves and petals clinging to his dishevelled plumage , and with one long festoon of the groundnut-vine circling his neck and trailing behind him . But he had his strip of tin once more . Half flying , half walking to the stone under the birch-tree , he put down his recovered prize and went through with a deliberate toilet , snipping off with one grip of his beak the encumbering vine round his neck , then plucking torn petals and leaves from his feathers , and smoothing his plumage till his dusky back shone again with iridescent purples . A rabbit , scuttling through the hazel-bushes near by . startled him into flight at last ; and off he went , holding tight that bit of tin , whose gleam I followed with my eye through a mile of the clear summer air . In the bed of the brook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraps of tin and iron , relics of some camping party ; and I guessed that " Crusoe " ? as I came to call him from his solitary habits ? had more than once visited the grove on an errand similar to this recent one . He had not seen the bright thing in the brook wholly by chance , but had come to look for a new trinket for his treasure-heap . I had heard of a tame crow who collected in a hidden nook the silver spoons , rings , and bright-colored toys which he had pilfered from his mistress and her children . " Crueoe " evidently had a. like treasure-heap ; but where should I find it Day after day I came to the maple grove by the brook , hoping that if the crow revisited the spot I might trace his homeward flight more closely , and win a clue to the whereabouts of his hoard . In the leaves clustered round the boulder under the birch-tree I found a dozen or more black feathers ; and some of them had lain there long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sure ? ly the crow had come to rho boulder often . But I did not see him there again for many days . Two weeks slipped past , and often during a long afternoon not a stranger would visit the grove . The clover in the field near by was cut , and lay in odorous heaps awaiting the arrival of the hay-wagon ; and the bees were gone . The fledgling king-birds sprouted wing feathers and flew away ? all but one that a blackeneke captured when it flopped out of the nest a clay too soon . Hour after hour each day I sat quiet under my maple . A spider , one August afternoon , let him ? self down from a branch , like a sailor coming down hand over hand from aloft , and deliberately spun a web on strands extended between my - upturned feet . And I stayed motionless long enough for him to snare a ladybug in the net . Still , while the red in the west , like the glow from a dying camp-fire , sent its last wavering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , though I heard nothing , saw nothing , I felt uneasy , ? I was no longer unseen . With a sudden impulse I turned my head and looked round me . Then I heard a laconic caw above me , and a big crow flew swiftly from his silent perch in my maple-tree . As his dusky form melted into the blackness of the woods I stood up stiffly and smiled after him , acknowl ? edging my defeat . The lone crow had baffled me ; and I was discouraged . Surely I had cause to be ; for the maple glade by the brook was the one spot , besides his roost in the hickory woods , where I could hope to spy on him . His roosting-tree he always left at dawn , and the maple glade he would visit no more , I knew , for many days . Yet a week had not passed since his discovery of me beneath the maple before good luck put me once more on his trail . Several miles from " Brier-town " was a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams , and with an outlet into one of the many tributaries of the Quine ? hang . In the alders almost countless pairs of red-winged blackbirds built their nests of woven grasses . Bitterns hid in the reeds beside the muddy pools deep in the marsh ; and innumerable smaller birds twittered and whistled and sang in the willows by ? the lake 's edge . Right through the very heart of the swamp flowed the smaller of the lake 's inlets . The plumelike foliage of great drooping willows on either bank almost hid the stream where it glided into the lake ; festoons of grape-vines bridged the space from tree to tree ; rank chimps of bul ? rushes and pickerel-weed clogged the way ; and farther out , the green rafts of close-packed pond-lily leaves tugged at their anchoring stems as the current of the brook sifted through to deeper waters . Four days after abandoning my post in the maple grove I went to that cove in the early morning . The sun was well in view , and its rays sought out the farthest cranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the marsh to the spot where I had hidden my canoe . When I pushed it from its screen of bushes into the lake , three crows rose hurriedly from the opposite shore ; and one of them had a ragged spot in the primaries of his right wing . it was " Crusoe . " This was the first time I had seen him in company . Presently the three appeared high against a puffy white cloud . They beaded straight for " Brier-town . " Would they come again ?  - -  that was the question . The next morning , before the sun had burned away the mist that hid the lake , I went through the pine woods to the stony cove where the crows ' had been the day before . There They were , all three , when I got there . Two walked up and down at the water 's brink , looking for dobsons and grubs among the pebbles . " Crusoe " stood apart , eying a mussel that lay tight closed on the gravel beside him . The shell-fish had clapped together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now it lay there , a feast to tempt any crow ? but impregnable . " Crusoe " stood on one leg beside it and croaked gutturally to himself . Then , picking up the mussel with his beak , he dropped it gently in a shallow puddle among the stones , and , with head cocked on one side , waited results . The mussel , once more at home in the water , opened just a crack . " Crusoe " waited , quite still , while the other crows turned to watch . The mussel opened a bit more , and " CrUSOF " drew back his head , ready to strike . The other crows lifted their wings and craned their necks with ex ? citement . The mussel opened half-way ; in a flash " Crusoe " had wrenched it from its shell . The two crows who had watched him now ran forward squawk ? ing and squatted down in front of him . With fluttering wings and wide - open mouths they begged hard for the deli ? cious morsel held fast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head he swallowed it himself . The two young crows snapped their beaks together in disappointment . " Crusoe " was a father , and these were his fledglings ; there could be no mis ? taking that after the way the two had begged for the mussel . And in further proof of this I saw the old crow several times give grubs , which he had picked out of the gravel , to one or the other of the smaller crows . They hurried aft ? er him wherever he went , and did but little hunting for themselves . They fol ? lowed him as closely as chicks do a hen ; and when he flew away towards " Brier-town , " they were close behind . Somewhere near " Brier-town " there must be a nest ; and at last , after two weeks of hunting , I found it , thirty feet and more up in a lone pine , in the middle of the hickory woods . I should never have discovered it had it not been for a pair of red squirrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " Crusoe " and his mate moved out . They did not take possession undisturbed . For young crows have a peculiar fondness for the nest from which they first took wing , returning often in the summer to sit on the nest rim for hours , as if they half expected to be fed again by the old birds who have long since deserted them . These red squirrels , therefore , had scarcely begun their nest of leaves and twigs ( built plumb on the top of the crow 's ) before " Crusoe 's " youngsters re ? turned and threw the litter to the ground . Probably this was repeated several times ; for underneath the pine-tree lay , scat ? tered over the needles , enough sticks and rubbish to build three squirrels ' nests . Attracted by the clatter of falling twigs , I came upon the two crows in the very act of tossing the squirrels ' building material overboard . Round about them , leaping from branch to branch , scurried the furious squirrels . Their tails jerked back and forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chitter of help ? less rage . If ever squirrels swore , those did : they squeaked , they chattered , they almost hissed like cats . But all to no purpose . They had to seek another building-place . When the crows were gone , I climbed the pine-tree , and found , not one , but the relics of three nests . Like many crows , " Crusoe " evidently used the same nest ? ing-tree year after year . Here was luck . The next year I should know where to find this wary old bird . The snow was melting fast . Far and wide the slopes in view of " Brier-town " iay piebald in the April sunlight ; every ? where the diminishing patches of white disclosed the shrivelled grass and weeds of the year that was past , and everywhere the moist earth steamed in the heat of the noon . By the river bank the alders showed mistily gray in the distance . Above them the swamp-maples spread their red-flowered branches , and here and there gleamed white masses of shad-blossoms . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bronzes and yellows of the twig-tips told of sap hur ? rying to a million million leaves furled green in buds distended to bursting . Higher than all the other trees , the lone pine waved its huge branches against the sky . And coasting down the warm south wind a solitary crow ? seeming the size of a robin in the distance ? flew to the pine , circled it , and disappeared in its branches . A little later another crow appeared , tossing in the wind , above the pine . Then the first crow sprang into view , and together they wheeled round the tree , to disappear , as the first crow had done , in the shadows of its spread ? ing boughs . " Crusoe " and his mate would nest yet another season in the old tree . They had chosen their retreat well . For from their lofty eyrie they could at a single glance survey for miles the rolling hills and valleys which flank the long ridge covered by the hickory woods . And they had but to spread their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree to glide with effortless speed to their distant feeding-grounds on the east or on the west . The mother crow , sitting in her big nest , nearly forty feet above the rocks where the great roots of the pine found anchorage , needed to fear no ordinary foes . To approach her unobserved was almost impossible . Until the hickory-trees had shaken out their crinkly new leaves , forming a dense screen beneath which I could steal up the hillside , rod by rod , all my attempts to come upon her unseen were unsuccess ? ful . I could not discover the crows at the building of the nest . Day by day I noted the progress of the nest toward completion ; but the crows stopped work whenever I came within seeing distance , and fled silently away through the woods , not to return until I should he home ? ward bound again . And fearing that I might drive them to desert the nest , I soon left off my visits to the hickory knoll , and watched them from afar . But one morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I climbed the lone pine for one close look at " Crusoe 's " work . The crows had slipped away , as always , at my first approach ; but when I was cautiously pulling myself up the last ten feet of exposed trunk below the nest , the big black birds came hurtling hack to heat me off . While I crept slow ? ly higher I could hear the swish of their wings as they shot close by me , and the angry snap of their beaks in the intervals between their raucous caws of rage . From the height of fifty feet above me the mother crow would curve swiftly downward , as if she would drive her beak into my face , then throw hack her head and check herself on half-closed wings scarce ten feet away . And once she struck the trunk above rne , and clung , with tail spread wide , an instant to the bark , turning her head sidewise. to glare at me . Soon I reached the shelter of the radiating branches which upheld the nest , and peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale-blue eggs on their cushion of moss within it . The nest was bulky , built loosely of big dry sticks which the crows had carried in their claws from the pine woods by the lake . Through it were woven care ? lessly long ribbons of bark stripped from woody grape-vines , and one loop of grape ? vine , stern and all , swung like a trapeze from the bottom of the nest . When the blue eggs in the crows ' nest hatched in the middle of June , I no longer stayed away from the hickory knoll . For although " Crusoe , " with a malignant glance over his shoulder at me as he flew , would glide off down the hill just as often as he discovered me , the mother crow would not desert the feather ? less youngsters . She seldom was absent from the nest for long while I was near ; and often when apparently she was gone away , she was keeping close watch on roe . Usually I took my post a rod or two from the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shadow-flecked rock , the more easily to look upwards at the do ? ings of the crow . If I left my post for a half-minute , the crow would discover me . Each day I would test her alertness by making as if to clamber up the trunk of the pine . She might have been gone one minute or ten , but I could never get more than started up the rocks at the foot of her tree before she would appear , as if out of nowhere , and with glittering eyes swoop repeatedly past my head . Although her absences from the nest were short , she seemed to have no dif ? ficulty in finding food for her young . Caterpillars , clobsons , beetles , and mis ? cellaneous bugs disappeared over the nest rim by thousands . Sometimes , too , she brought scrape of bread and other stolen provisions . Once I saw her carry a small trout to the nest . Perhaps she had frightened a king-fisher into drop ? ping it . And for one whole week She fed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet from their first sprouting . The nearest corn ? field was two miles away ; yet she fre ? quently returned with a fresh bunch of uprooted sprouts after an absence of scarcely two minutes . This surprised me beyond all measure ; for it meant a speed in flight of one hundred and twen ? ty miles an hour , without taking account of the time needed for pulling the corn . A happy accident explained the puzzle . I. came upon " Crusoe " pulling corn sprouts in a field near " Brier-town . " He methodically dropped them in a little heap on the earth , all the roots together ; and when he had collected enough he clutched them in his claws and bore them away in the direction of the lone pine . Strangely enough , however , he did not gn all the way to the hickory knoll , but stopped on the bare limb of an old dead chestnut , which had been seared by a lightning stroke . There another crow came to him , and almost immediately afterwards he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? while , as I soon guessed , his mate was carrying the first supply of corn sprouts up through the hickory woods , to stuffs them down the expectant mouths in her nest . " Crusoe " would not go to the nest while there was chance of a visit from me ; but he would do his duty , neverthe ? less , as the father of a family . His mate could guard the nest , leaving it only for short trips to the dead chestnut-tree , where he would bring her the fruits of his industrious foraging . Day by day the four youngsters in the nest grew lustier . Their voices soon were loud enough to reach my ears . One fellow especially , when he was not bolting food , croaked and croaked inces ? santly . His voice had a queer crack in it , as if he had a heavy cold in the chest . At last the nest became too crowded for the full-feathered fledglings , and one or another of them would he forced to sit on the nest rim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ping his wings uneasily in fear of top ? pling over . It would not be long before all would take wing . On the morning of the 25th of June I was at my post on the hickory knoll before dawn , eager to see the young crows ' first flight from the lone pine . The lopsided moon , looming big in the thick mist of early morning , was edging with uncertain radiance the ragged film of cloud which scudded northward before the freshening breeze . The dense mists in the valley hid every tree and house . Dusky hills and slopes rose above it like islands and peninsulas in a vast inland sheet of water ; as far as the eye could reach stretched one level sea of mist , white and luminous in the light of the dim moon . Up the hillside , layers of mist came drifting past the lone pine , twisting upwards through its boughs like stray wisps of smoke . The boughs of the pine showed inky black against the sky . Only the tips of the needles on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a sound was in the woods but the soft drip from mist-wet foliage . Then in the east came the glow of dawn , and the whole expanse of mist , began to sparkle and scintillate like a field of snow ; and as the light grew stronger , the mist steamed and whirled upward , while the distorted moon in the west grew waxen pale as it neared the brightening hills . Before the sun appeared , " Crusoe " was gone . And his mate was soon awake and urging the young crows to leave the nest . The crow with the queer voice croaked and croaked without a moment 's rest . All seemed to feel that the hour was important . Presently one crow walked unsteadily over the edge of the nest out along the branch . Another stepped after him ; then a third ; but the fourth would not follow . The mother crow perched beside them , spread her wings , and dived towards the tree-tops below , curving upwards again to show them how easy it was . Still they sat huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were like a lot of lit ? tle boys on the edge of a cold stream . " You go first , " each seemed to say , and the others kept replying , " No , you , " Meanwhile the fourth fledgling , the fel low with the crack in his voice , was crawling backwards over the edge of the nest , flapping his wings desperately , and clinging tight with claws and beak to the wall of the nest . In her excitement the mother crow grew doubly vociferous . Round and round she flew , cawing nerv ? ously , and now and again perching on the nest , where with many gestures of wing and tail she signified her eagerness that the fledglings risk a tumble by jump ? ing from the bough . The fellow on the nest did risk it , but snatched at the swinging loop of grape-vine and swung there upside down . The three on the bough huddled closer together , and stopped their noise , watching him . Just as he contrived to gain his balance the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his perch and flew . Instead of flying forward , he was borne backward by the wind , and half fell to the top of a hickory which grew beside my rock . It was hours before the others ventured to leave the branch , and all the while this fellow sat in the hickory-tree , straining his cracked voice in an endless series of squawks . He seemed to know that , for a crow , his voice was remarkable ; and he never tired of using it . He had , I thought , a strange desire to sing . A few days later I became convinced that he thought himself a song-bird. c Crusoe " had the four youngsters ? now steady-winged flyers ? on the edge of a corn-field , where he had been teaching them , perhaps , the way to tell a scare ? crow from a man . When I discovered them , lie was perched unconcernedly on the head of a scarecrow , plucking hay from what should have been its face . On the fence by the field sat the young crows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could imagine that their clatter was in admiring comment on the wisdom of their father . A robin lighted on a fence-post near them , and sang a cheery snatch of a song , for no particular reason . With that one of the young crows flew to another fence-post , where he listened attentively to the robin . When the robin flew away , this crow sat up , gave one preliminary squawk , and then , in ludi ? crous imitation of the robin , gurgled and croaked and squawked with all his might . The others , including " Crusoe , " gathered round him . They were much excited . The would-be singer was unmusical as only a crow can be ; yet I had little doubt but that his noise gave him and his hear ? ers pleasure . When he had done , they all set up a cawing , which only ceased when " Crusoe , " after a minute or two , discovered me , and led them away over the hill . After the nest in the lone pine was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more I stalked him , the warier he grew . Yet I knew that ho still added now and then to his hoard of bright bits of tin and what-not . He could have desired the big garnet in " Brier-town " for no other reason . Hunt as hard as I might , there seemed to be no clue by which to locate his heard , although I ransacked every swamp that I had ever seen him visit . But in vain . And my searches through the hickory woods were unavail ? ing . For weeks I kept up the hunt ; and at last I became convinced that the secret was hidden in a pine near the lake where first I had seen " Crusoe " care for his youngsters . " Crusoe " usually flew high ? probably to keep out of gun-shot , ? coming to earth at the end of a trip by circling slowly downward after many cautious excursions to this side and that . When lie flew to the pine woods , however , I marked how he skimmed low over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had a fence to cross . And he went to the pine woods often , oftener as the season advanced . fle left the woods always in the same sneaking manner , as if he dreaded observation . His hoard must be in the pine woods . Sheer luck led me to unearth its exact hiding-place . I was following ? from a safe distance ? the apparently aimless wanderings of a skunk through those very pine woods . I brushed through the boughs of a cluster of black birches which grew in a small open space among the pines . A big pine , fully eight feetin girth , had been broken off by the wind perhaps twenty feet from the ground , and its heavy top had by its fall crushed several smaller trees to earth . The top of the stump was jagged-edged , and looked as if it were hollow . There is a likely place for " Crusoe 's " hoard , I said to myself , yet had not the least expectation of finding it . I scrambled to the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hollow , but choked with leaves . I poked among them with a stick . Then I smiled in triumph . Under the leaves lay a heap of bright things . There were scraps of tin , two mussel-shells , and the glass stop ? per of a bottle . The garnet I did not find . This was " Crusoe 's " hoard . Surely he had chosen a beautiful spot for his lonely enjoyment of those treas ? ures . In the centre of the dark woods the sun shone each day , through the rift which the falling pine had made , full on this old stump . Every trinket in its top would gleam and sparkle to delight the queer old crow 's heart . Carefully I hid the treasures under the leaves and slid to the ground . Another day I should spy on the miser while he gloated over his treasures . But this I never did . In a day or two the treasures had been removed . And old " Crusoe , " the big crow with the ragged right wing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an outlyer , a one bird , and perhaps this was because of his love for bright trinkets which he feared others might covet and steal . When he found that his treasure had been disturbed he doubtless attributed it to me , since I had so pestered him for a year . I had known him for several summers , and win ? ters , too , and he never had left his ac ? customed range before . But his hoard , the centre of his life , was threatened , and he took wing for new woods and fields where I should nevermore disturb his peace of mind .
