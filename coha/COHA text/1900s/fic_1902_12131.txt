The hall of Sir Peter Temple 's house in Devonshire . The table is equipped with jugs and tankards , pipes also lying about as for a meeting of gentlemen roisterers . As curtain rises , Sir Peter in advance of three young men , Mr. Will Playfair , Mr. Harlowe Wetheridge and Sir Harry Hastings . SIR TEMPLE I tell you my good fellows , he 's a damned presumptuous dog . Are times so poor , so damnably poor that every barking upstart of a poetaster may dare aspire to the hand of the leading lady in the country ? SIR HASTINGS MR . WETHERIDGE ( together ) Right , Sir Peter . ( Will Playfair silent ) SIR TEMPLE What say you to it Playfair ? You are the son of one of our good squires . What say you to the presumption of this man Herrick ? PLAYFAIR I scarce know what to say , Sir Peter . I ' fact , I scarce have right to speak in this , our cause . First off , Bob Herrick is my friend , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand with these two other gentlemen , and therefore , must some enmity feel ' gainst him who is the peer himself of any here who speaks him ill . HASTINGS Come , come , a gentle speech , that , good will . p. 3 MR . WETHERIDGE ' T is seldom Will says aught ' gainst any man . SIR TEMPLE And yet , I find him all too gentle now . Why , ' t is a thing should rouse the blood of any gentlemen , and make it mount first to his faer , the drop to his heart , where it should shoot fair forth into his hand and make him turn his sword ' gainst the parading churl . PLAYFAIR Your pardon , good Sir Peter , if I say that Bob comes of no new family , and no base ; tho ' far it be from me to plead my rival 's cause . But I am here with you and these by you enjoined , to work what is your will in any honest way to check his suit . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happy he who wins fair Cynthia 's hand . The thought doth rouse my heart . Go on . SIR TEMPLE Well spoke . Now to our plot . Know ye to-night my daughter come with her good Aunt Lucinda from the country where she has taken retreat from numerous suitors and her own unrest . Now , I have brought her hitherward that she may look on those whom most I favor ; take some account of these and their family , manners and wealth that she may think on marriage with one of them . You gentlemen , have I asked to meet her here , and with you asked that rhyming , dangling boy , Bob Herrick . A woman 's mind is a light thing and Cynthia in her younger days did lean toward him , and in your hands to-night I leave the chance to break this fancy 's chain , to make a boor of him ; before she comes to make him drunk , and when she 's here to make him so behave before her face that she will as soon hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his ladies ' songs . p. 4 MR . WETHERIDGE SIR HASTINGS ( together ) Ha , ha , a good plot , Sir Peter , and worthy of you . PLAYFAIR ( slowly ) But is it fair ? SIR TEMPLE Fair ? MR . WETHERIDGE Fair ? HASTINGS Oh , fair be damned . What 's this that speaks of fairness in the game of love ? Who would be fair with poets who but sing and pour the insidious poison of their verse into a lad 's ear and make her drunk then poison all her maiden life . MR . WETHERIDGE Ha , fairness , Will in time of war and unto him who wears his sword beside his hips , but in the hour of love and unto him who only sings and tinkles softly on his gentle lute , all things from men who wear the sword are fair . SIR TEMPLE Good Harlowe , thou hast spoken well , and Will objects no more . PLAYFAIR Sir Peter , I have done . SIR TEMPLE And now , to further what I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , are to put this Sir Poet to the test before her face , to taunt him with his verse . Make him the butt of your own keenest jests . Laugh at his airs , his gait his form . p. 5 PLAYFAIR ( slowly ) Laugh at his gait , so you laugh not upon the halting of his verse , I doubt me if he will care . SIR TEMPLE Then taunt him on the halting of his verse . Say how he halts and stumbles over the lovesick lines . Quote some of it to him and laugh you loud and long at it . MR . WETHERIDGE We 'll do it , by the rood . HASTINGS Aye , we 'll laugh , ha , ha . MR . WETHERIDGE I will mock him how he walks when entering a room with lovesick looks cast on each lady 's face . Ha , ha . HASTINGS And I will sing him some sweet song as he is wont to sing it to his lute , ha , ha . PLAYFAIR I prithee , gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whom you would taunt ? SIR TEMPLE Temper ! HASTINGS Temper ! MR . WETHERIDGE Temper , ha , ha ! I will mock him to his very face , and he will answer with an epigram . SIR TEMPLE But gentlemen , good gentlemen , I prithee first remember thy friendship to our guest and are thou bringest him to the test later do thou make him drunk , drunk as the swine who reel in Ciree 's wood . p. 6 MR . WETHERIDGE We 'll make him drunk , ha , ha . HASTINGS We 'll make him rolling drunk , ha , ha . PLAYFAIR ( calmly ) Aye , we 'll make him drunk , though we be drunk ourselves . SIR TEMPLE Ho , to the plot . Good gentlemen , a cup with me in my most private room before you come to clip the feathers of the cock who sings but never crows . ( Exeunt laughing . As they pass out , the arras at the back of the stage is pulled to one side , and the roguish face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking after the departing gentlemen . ) TEMPLE ( Mocking them ) We 'll make him drunk , ha , ha . We 'll make him rolling drunk , ha , ha . Good Will Playfair , thou has spoke truly . Thou will make him drunk though thou be drunk thyselves . I warrant that thou will be drunk yourselves ere you made good Bob Herrick drunk when Cynthia has warned him of thy plot . Oh , father , father , thou art keen , but now I know where comes some of that wit that meets your wisdom point to point . Ha , ha , ha , I wonder where my Aunt Lucinda is ? ( Going to door and looking out ) I left her on the road and hither flew because scented something of a noisome plot . Oh , man , oh man , you may compel a woman 's hand ; you may command a woman 's mind , but ah , you can not force a woman 's heart nor stifle yet a woman 's will . Oh , Herrick , Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she comes not ere Bob comes , I will warn him so to arm that he will turn aside the shafts of all their foul intentions . ( At door ) Who 's there ? ( Enter Robert Bob Herrick. ) p. 7 TEMPLE Oh ! HERRICK The sun rises on my day at last . TEMPLE Oh , Master Herrick . HERRICK What ? Master Herrick ? So long a day since I was Bob and thou wert Cynthia . Nay , nay not Master Herrick , but thy Bob , thy darling singing Bob whom thou didst love , thou saidst . ( Cynthia raises her hand deprecatingly ) How now , has thy love grown cold ? Dost thou not remember how long years ago we stood beneath that oak that spreads its branches by thy father 's brook and I did take thy hand as I do now and kiss it with the selfsame throbbing heart and ask thee wouldst thou love me evermore ? Hast thou forgot what answer thou didst make ? TEMPLE ( Bending her head ) Nay , Robert , oh ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERRICK Ah , Cynthia , love is like good wine , and mellower , richer grows with age . Dost love me now ? TEMPLE I can not tell . HERRICK ( Bending towards her ) I say , does love me now ? TEMPLE I may not say . HERRICK And I repeat , dost love me now , Cynthia ? The tell-tale blush comes up thy cheek as dawn comes up the sky . Fie , fie upon thee . Tell me , dost thou love me ? p. 8 TEMPLE ' T is most unmaidenly of me , Bob , but oh  --  I love thee , yes , thy Cynthia loves thee . ( They embrace . ) And how much thou shalt know and quickly . They have made a plot . They will get thee drunk . I will be brought before thee ; they will disgrace thee in my presence . Remember , drink thou not deeply Bob . ( A burst of laughter from without . ) They are coming . HERRICK I thank thee dear , I thank thee , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of thee . ( Holding her by the hand . ) TEMPLE I must fly . HERRICK One kiss give me here , and then farewell until the trial hour . ( Exit Cynthia . Opposite door enter the men who give a burst of laughter at sight of Herrick who has seated himself at the table . They burst into acclamations of welcome . ) MR . WETHERIDGE How art thou , Bob ? HASTINGS Why , my old friend . SIR TEMPLE I am glad to see thee Herrick : PLAYFAIR ( Slapping him on the shoulder ) Ah , good old pal , how sits thy head upon thy shoulders ? p. 9 HERRICK I thank you gentlemen . I thank you . Am I not late ? HASTINGS Not late according to the hour , but always do you come too late for those who love you , Bob . HERRICK I thank you Harry Hastings . Thou hast a tongue as nimble as thy sword . SIR TEMPLE Come , gentlemen , lets not dally paying compliments as men who ' tempt to storm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Am I too old to join you ? ALL No , no , come on , Sir Peter . The wine , the wine . ( They draw around the table . Will Playfair passes at back of Herrick saying in an aside as he goes " Drink thou not deep good Bob , remember this . " They seat themselves at the tables . ) SIR TEMPLE Now Hastings , a song , a song to make the wine go down as smooth as melody itself . HASTINGS Nay , call you not on me . We have a singer here . ( Bows to Herrick . ) HERRICK Nay , look thou not at me good Hastings . My songs are as the crude and tumbling brook that ripples down to meet the stormy sea , coloured with earth and filled with leaves it finds beside the way ; while thine is like the clear and trickling rill that purls o'er pebbles white , clear trained by the hand of man . p. 10 MR . WETHERIDGE Hear , hear , how the poet talks in verse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the wine . ( Looking strangely at Playfair ) and may it do the most good to the honestest man . ( They fill their mugs drinking . ) SIR TEMPLE And now , sing Sir Harry . HASTINGS ( Sings ) Come fill with me your drinking cup , And fill it to the brim , And he who will not drink it up A murrain , then , on him . Oho . Come fill , good friends , and drink with me The juice that sparkles bright , We 'll give us o'er to jollity And speed the hours to-night . Good wine it warmeth chilly blood , No chilly blood have we , Still we will drink the ruby flood , Lest cold we come to be . ALL Bravo , bravo , good , good ! SIR TEMPLE Fill , fill gentlemen . MR . WETHERIDGE Pipes , ho , pipes ! ( They lift their pipes and Will Playfair leans toward Herrick , whispering " I prithee drink not deep . " ) p. 11 HERRICK I thank thee Will . SIR TEMPLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine is light , and sure thy head is strong . HERRICK Nay , poets have nor hearts nor heads too strong , and yet , because thou askest , I will fill . ( He fills his cup . ) HASTINGS No good without return . Herrick , let us hear something of thy sweet verse , something late , something with which thou hast charmed some maiden 's willing ear . MR . WETHERIDGE Nay , nay , thou art rude . He sings not to charm the ears of ribald men . SIR TEMPLE ( His spleen breaking out . ) Ah , no , he tunes his notes to softer hearers ' hearts , Bah ! HERRICK Nay , nay , Sir Peter , think me not an idle dangler at the ladies ' heels . I pay my court to one , it is true , to whom no man who sits about this board dare say he doth not do likewise , and here , with all due respect before her father 's face , list to me lutless give the " Song to Cynthia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup again . Wetheridge nods at Will Playfair . Playfair smokes in silence . Herrick rises a bit unsteadily . Hastings nods at Wetheridge , Wetheridge nods in turn. ) p. 12 HERRICK ( looking off ) Whats that ? ( They turn their heads . He quickly pours his wine upon the floor . ) SIR TEMPLE I saw naught . MR . WETHERIDGE Nor I. PLAYFAIR Nor I. HASTINGS ' T was but some fantasy of thine own brain . HERRICK ( Laughs unsteadily ) The ghost , perhaps , of wasted yesterdays . ( He raises his cup ) Gazooks , but I be dry . ( Apparently drains it to the bottom . ) ( Quick glances flash around the table . ) SIR TEMPLE Fill it again , good Bob , ere thou dost speak , to mellow up thy voice . ( Herrick fills his cup unhandily , spilling the wine ) ( Then he rises , and speaking thickly , gives the poem " To Cynthia . " ) HERRICK TO CYNTHIA Bid me to live and I will live Thy protestant to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving heart to thee . A heart as soft , a heart as kind A heart as sound and free As in the whole world thou canst find That heart I 'll give to thee . Bid that heart stay and it will stay , To honour thy decree ; Or bid it languish quite away And't shall do so for thee . Bid me to weep and I will weep While I have eyes to see ; And having none , yet I will keep A heart to weep for thee . Bid me despair , and I 'll despair Under that cypress tree ; Or bid me die , and I will dare E'en Death to die for thee . Thou art my life , my love , my heart , The very eyes of me , And has command of every part To live and die for thee . ( All applaud , he lurches forward , spilling the wine from his cup. ) p. 13 SIR TEMPLE How now , man , hold thyself together . Art drunk so early ? HERRICK Nay , nay , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ( rising from the table and staggering forward ) I  --  I have a quatrain in my head . I fain would work it out . ( The others drink as he walks around ) " Its  --  its  --  its a story of the good Samaritan who fell among thieves . ( burst of laughter from the table . ) PLAYFAIR What , Bob , thou hast thy Scripture wrong . Why , thou must spend thy Sabbaths elsewhere than sitting ' neath the parson 's voice . HERRICK ( Looks at him drowsily ) I spend my Sabbaths where God 's preachers are , beneath the woodland trees , by running brooks , outside the breath of men 's deceit . I say of men 's deceit . SIR TEMPLE Come , come , it must not be thus gentlemen . Another bumper . Thou wilt not be drunk good Bob for thou must know the Lady Cynthia has returned and ' t is my will that she should come to us to-night to take your greetings . HERRICK Nay , nay , I will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but let me rest here on this couch , and compose my quatrain ? ( drops on couch . The others rise stealthily , but go out staggeringly . Playfair lingers as he passes Herrick. ) p. 14 PLAYFAIR I told thee that thou shouldst tipple light . HERRICK ( in same low tone ) Good Will , go on , I am safe . ( Exeunt ) ( Herrick sits up on the couch . A servant comes in to remove the things , he lies down and snores ostensibly . When the servant has gone he rises . ) HERRICK This is the province of the poet , to wake when others sleep , to sleep perchance , when others wake , who knows ? To be the jest of others and himself to jest . To love and be despised of his lessors . Ah , me , the world has fallen on evil days , when no one doth respect the poets song and give him ear . ' T is strange , ' t is passing strange , with good Will Shakespeare yet so shortly dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Lucy and his stolen deer , and I my Temple and my stolen love , ha , ha , we go a merry gait who ride that fleet steed Pegasus , and feed on Fancy 's bread . And yet , I 'd rather be a singer chasing the fleeting rhyme and prisoning thoughts in pearls to grace another 's wine than all the lucy 's and the Temple 's that burden England 's soil . For they , with minds as heavy as their wallets are , eat , drink , breathe , die , while we with souls as light as Fancy 's self live on and on and on . Ha , ha . So come Sir Peter , with your minions , come , You 'll find your poet more than usual at home . ( Lies down ) ( Re-enter Sir Peter leading Cynthia who is followed by her Aunt Lucinda . The gentlemen walk behind rather unsteadily . They point to Herrick , laughing. ) p. 15 TEMPLE And is this he whom you have brought me here to meet asleep ? HASTINGS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his sword . Herrick straightens up and looks about him drowsily . Gets up , half stumbling . ) SIR TEMPLE I have brought the Lady Cynthia to you , Master Robert Herrick . ( She gives him her hand and he takes it without a word . ) MR . WETHERIDGE Master Herrick has been giving us some of his verses , my lady to yourself . I doubt not but he hath more upon him . HASTINGS Aye , tax him for them . SIR TEMPLE My sister , Mistress Temple , thou knowest . ( Herrick bows to Miss Lucinda without a word . ) HASTINGS I prithee , lady , tax him for his lines . He can not be niggardly when ' t is his sole wealth which he spends so lavishly . MR . WETHERIDGE ( Laughing ) Even with that he is poor . ( Herrick for the first time raises his head squarely flashing a glance at Wetheridge . ) TEMPLE I prithee , Master Herrick , do thou give us some few lines of thine own making . p. 16 AUNT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimental . MR . WETHERIDGE Yes , with youth and flowers and birds and loves and doves , ha , ha . TEMPLE ( Coldly ) Pray , Master Wetheridge , has thou not asked that I and my dear aunt prefer this fair request ? MR . WETHERIDGE Your pardon , Lady Cynthia . TEMPLE Thou wilt , wilt thou not , good master Herrick , as I say ? HERRICK ( Looks at her dazedly ) Nay , nay . AUNT TEMPLE ( Goes near him ) Then try for me , good Master Herrick . ' T is long since I have heard thy lines . HERRICK Nay , nay , nay . MR . WETHERIDGE Our song bird now grows silent . PLAYFAIR Perhaps our man is not in the mood . Poets have moods , you know . TEMPLE Thou art well named Will Playfair . HASTINGS ( Stung by Cynthia 's manner ) Ah , well , the ladies shall not be disappointed . If our poet will not sing his lines , I will sing myself . p. 17 TEMPLE I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a quatrain on a poet . Wilt hear it ? ALL Gladly . HASTINGS Well , say the poet is our Master Herrick . ( Herrick raises his head and looks at him . Hastings laughs . ) The hero of our idle hours , Who twangs his lute in ladies ' bowers ; His only pride is to be strong , His only strength lies in a song . MR . WETHERIDGE SIR PETER ( Laughing ) Good , good , ha , ha . HERRICK ( Clapping his hand to his side ) Gad ! ( Playfair standing to one side and Cynthia turning away . ) TEMPLE Thou art too bad , Sir Harry . AUNT TEMPLE Indeed it has none of sentiment . HERRICK Have I served as the subject of that poem , Sir Harry ? ( His hand to his side . ) HASTINGS ( Laughing ) As thou wilt , sit Poet . Why holdest thou thy hand to thy side , hast thou a pain ? I see no other reason . Thou wearest no sword as I do . p. 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir Harry , I wear my sword as thou dost thy wits , happly on occasion . It may be that thou shalt find it by my side when next we meet . Then let us hope that I will use my sword less clumsily than thou usest thy wit . ( Hastings puts his hand to his sword ) PLAYFAIR Come , gentlemen , come . SIR TEMPLE Master Herrick , thou dost forget thyself . HERRICK I do not forget myself . I only now remember . I know not if it be you yourself , Sir Peter , who has set these cowards on to taunt me in this unmanly manner to put me to the test , but this I know , Robert Herrick doth defy you all and tells you now right here in your own house that poets know not only how to twang the lute and make a song , but how to wield a soldier 's arm as well . And if these gentlemen singly come to put affront upon me , name your own weapons , and you shall find me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lusty braggart . MR . WETHERIDGE I will put that to the test , good Bob , some day . HERRICK Aye , make your some day not too long . TEMPLE Brave spoken gentlemen . I thank you for those words . p. 19 SIR TEMPLE Cynthia ! HERRICK I thank you lady for that small grace . SIR TEMPLE What , Cynthia ! Thou takest sides with him , a drunkard and a brawler ? ( To Herrick ) Out , sir , upon thee , out upon thee for a graceless scamp . Why , thou art drunk . HERRICK Look not on me , Sir Peter , but on those others whom you have set on to make me drunk , who stand the steadier , they or I ? Look on Sir Harry Hastings and on Wetheridge . I stand as straight in my boots as did my sires when they faced death upon a foreign field , and they , they waver as their fathers did when quailing at a foeman 's shaft . You scorn me , aye , my verses and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love the sound of the absorbing lute , but let me tell thee , Robert Herrick 's name shall live as good Chris Marlowe 's doth when thou and all thou hast art mould . Thou sayest I am drunk . Drunk with the wild winds and the breath of life . Drunk with the sweet wine of thy daughter 's eyes . Drunk with the love of life and with mine own art . But with the poison that thou pourest in my cup , I tell thee , if thou sayest I am drunk , thou liest in thy threat , and these are Herrick 's words . Look at thy minions how they droop . ( The two others are lying on couches in different attitudes of intoxication ) Behold the fowlers caught within their own snare . When they awake , Sir Peter , than another plot . Good Mistress Cynthia , Madam dear , most humbly yours . ( Sir Peter fuming about , Cynthia delighted , Lucinda simpering ) p. 20 SIR TEMPLE A murrain on him , a murrain on him . HERRICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farewell , we 'll meet again to-morrow . ( Exit jauntily , laughing ) CURTAIN @x ( A garden path . Enter Cynthia and Lucinda , right . ) TEMPLE Ah , what a morning for a stroll . AUNT TEMPLE Aye , niece , it ' is most fair , nigh everyone 's abroad . TEMPLE Methinks no soul remains within the house a day like this unless it be those dullards who last night assayed to make Bob Herrick drunk , ha , ha , but I was like to kill myself with laughing . How they did stagger when he stood most straight , ha ! AUNT TEMPLE Ah , Master Herrick 's head is as strong as his heart . TEMPLE ( Effusively ) Well said , good Aunt Lucinda . Truly thou hast a most discerning eye . This , this , is such a day as Bob would love . AUNT TEMPLE He would make a poem of it . TEMPLE It was my thought . He would make a song of it , and liken all the sunshine to some lady 's hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . TEMPLE He would say that the glint upon the dew wet leaves was like the light within her eyes . p. 22 AUNT TEMPLE ( Enthusiastically ) Would he not ? TEMPLE That the perfume of the roses was her breath . AUNT TEMPLE Yes , yes . BOTH ( Hugging themselves ) Oh , Bob ! TEMPLE How well you love him Aunt Lucinda . AUNT TEMPLE ( Hiding her face ) False one , and hast thou probed our secret so soon ? Well , love we areth a tell-tale face . TEMPLE Your secret ? Tell-tale face ? Ah --  what --  ? AUNT TEMPLE Fie , thou dost dissemble now . But thine eyes were keen , ah , I for very joy of it could not hide myself from them . Long since I did mistrust that Herrick cast the eyes of love on me . TEMPLE ( Restraining her mirth ) I can not doubt thee . AUNT TEMPLE But never were my eyes so fully oped until thy father spoke last night . Said he , " Lucinda , hast thou not seen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves thee " he pursued . " Loves me ? " " Aye " quoth he " Loves thee , he is mad about thee . Aye , he hath worn a black cloak for love of thee , but poor timid bashful boy , fearing to approach and sue thee for thy maiden charms , he pays his court to Cynthia where full numbers gives him courage , " and then I say . p. 23 TEMPLE Oh , then you say . AUNT TEMPLE But thy keen eyes did fathom the whole plot , and thou hast found us out . So I 'll be straight with Bob from this day forth and do your father 's bidding , encourage him , keep him apart , hold him in conversation when that others surround you . TEMPLE ( Giving way to mirth ) Oh , good Aunt Lucinda , do . Keep him from all the other brawlers , for though I doubt not his bravery there be a many of them and he might come to harm , now since my suitors singly come to woo me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Laughing and running off ) Come away ! AUNT TEMPLE ( Ambling off ) Oh , if Bob should see me running like this , a very hoyden . ( Stops , arranges her skirts , and walks sedately off . ) ( An interval passes and then a groan is heard from without . Enter Sir Harlowe Wetheridge slowly from the left . ) MR . WETHERIDGE Oh , my head , my head , it seems as if ten thousand furies warred together within , and would burst it asunder . Ah , one of the forces is in retreat now and is coming out on this side . Oh , let me rest awhile . ( Stands in center holding his head . Groan heard on the other side . Enter Sir Harry Hastings , backing in right. ) p. 24 HASTINGS Ugh , the next time I try to make Bob Herrick drunk , a plagge on him ! My head , my head ! If no one were looking I 'd rest me here awhile . ( Walks into Wetheridge , they each start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well met , Harlowe , I was  --  ah  --  admiring the beauty of the morning .

( Aside ) Its burning in my brian . MR . WETHERIDGE And listen to that bird singing , how sweet ! ( Aside ) Oh , if ' t would stop ! HASTINGS I see thou lovest nature too . MR . WETHERIDGE Yes , ' t is that which brought me out . Nature compelled me . HASTINGS How sits thy head upon thy shoulders after last night 's bout ? p. 25 MR . WETHERIDGE As lightly and joyously as ever , and how thine own ? HASTINGS ( Aside )  --  Ah , mine is clear as is this mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A worthy simile . HASTINGS Wilt come and walk with me ? ( Aside ) Heaven forbid . forfend . MR . WETHERIDGE Aye gladly . ( Aside ) Oh , damn ! HASTINGS Then come , thy arm , good Harlowe . ( Aside ) I need it . MR . WETHERIDGE Take both good Harry . ( Aside ) Wouldst thou couldst take my head as well . HASTINGS Now for the sunshine and the breeze ( Aside ) and misery . MR . WETHERIDGE Now for a stroll ( Aside ) and death . ( Exeunt both with forced jauntiness . ) ( Laugh heard from the left . Enter Will Playfair from left . ) PLAYFAIR There they go , the two blundering folls lying to each other I 'll warrant , about their easy heads .

It is sweet to get away for a while from the dust and stench of such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After this , I 'll hunt alone and never more join such a crowd .

Humph . Sir Peter and Sir Godfrey Gailspring . By the rood , if I thought that fatted fools did come a wooer for fair Cynthia 's hand , I 'd let his blood . Ah , the sight of him makes me sick ; too young to be the dotard that he is , too old to be the clownish fool he looks . I 'll away . ( Enter Sir Peter and Sir Godfrey Gailspring . Sir Godfrey is fat , short , red-faced and far past forty . He clutches Sir Peter by the arm as they enter. ) p. 26 GAILSPRING I pray you , hear me out , Sir Peter , I must apologize again .

GAILSPRING But dropping down upon a man at dead o ' night without announcement and unasked . SIR TEMPLE Yourself announces you to us , Sir Godfrey , say no more . GAILSPRING I will speak on . It was all this way . I had no sooner got wind that there was to be a meeting of the maiden 's suitors , then I cried , Gazooks , I 'll have a try . I 'm old I know , but I 've looked on her since she was a little toddling babe , and she 's grown as close to my heart as  --  as  --  as  --  well , as a filly that you have brought up by hand .

I tell thee Sir Peter , though I do say it myself , I 'm a man of parts . p. 27 SIR TEMPLE Of most prodigious parts , ha , ha . GAILSPRING Hah , I 'll hit . SIR TEMPLE Well , let us on . GAILSPRING Nay , nay , Sir Peter , let us rest awhile , you know , I ride better than I walk . SIR TEMPLE Come , come , Sir Godfrey , if you fain would be a suitor for my daughter 's hand you most of all must not be too late . I doubt not that the others are all there , even perchance , Bob Herrick , who loiters by the way dreaming what words he 'll woo my Cynthia in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we 're all assembled . GAILSPRING Ah , my poor shanks , ye do groan with your own prosperity , so it is in love . Stay , Sir Peter , let us moralize . SIR TEMPLE Art thou a suitor or no ? GAILSPRING Suitor , yes , and would be husband , but if thou goest such a gait , thou'lt widow her at once , and make one of those jackanapes happy with both my fortune and herself . SIR TEMPLE Wilt come man ? GAILSPRING Lead on . Oh my poor legs . Thus ages its folly and its wisdom shows , when wooing changeful maids too slow it goes . ( Exeunt ) ( Enter Herrick , dreamily and slow ) p. 28 HERRICK How smilingly the sun looks on the earth , Methinks , he 's glad that Cynthia lives ; Glad with the gladness that I feel , when here alone I do unbare my brow and know the joy That she doth breathe this same perfumed air Which laves my brow with its caressing touch .

And now a kiss to sun and day and air , For they are glad with me that she is there ; Yes , ' T is the very essence of alloy That mortals leap too soon unto their joy ; So , I will bide me here a little while , Enjoy the morning and the mornings smile And while I walk thy ) p. 29 Act 2 , Scene 2 Scene :  --  ( Same room as before in Sir Peter Temple 's house .
