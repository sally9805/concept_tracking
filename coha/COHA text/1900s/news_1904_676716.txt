txt - If a woman has not made e. bad mistake in identification , the police have probably got upon the track of Henry Baxter Kingsley , who has been missing since the night before the Princeton-Yale game on Nov. 14 last . As a result of the woman 's identification , Fank L. Stewart , who gave no address , and whom the police say has often been arrested for petty larceny , was held for one daY yesterday by Magistrate Pool in the Tombs Police Court , bail being fixed at e4,000 . Stewart was charged with being a " suspicious person , " Detective Sergeant Mulligan swearing that Stewart was the last person seen with Kingsley . The detective explained that the missing man at the time of his disappearance had on him a large sum of money and valuable jewelry . Stewart in court refused to make any statement in regard to his case , and , being unable to furnish bail , was locked up in the Tombs . Henry B. Kingsley is , or was , the son of Gen. Levi P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a fortune of his own , is directly related to many wealthy and well-known families . His disappearance on ' ** eve of the big football match , in which he was deeply interested , was thought singular at first , but as the days passed and nothing was heard of him his family became apprehensive and advised the New York police that he was missing . They gave a full description of him under the promise of the police that the alarm would be a " silent " one , and that news of his disappearance would be kept from the - newspapers , because Gen. Kingsley at the time was in very bad health and they feared to alarm him . On receiving word that his father was ill , young Kingsley bade good-bye to his friends at the Grand Central Station , saying that he meant to go to Rutland , and not to the football game . His movements were traced in the neighborhood , where he visited several saloons and made several purchases . The last heard of him was when he left a store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to have a large sum of money with him , which he was careless in displaying . Just before going to the hat store he bought a drink at the , Rossmore Hotel , remarking to the bartender that it was a " night cap , " as he had to ' catch a train after buying a hat . Some days after the insertion of the - advertisement offering a reward Mrs. Hall saw it . She immediately ' communicated with the Kingsley lawyers , saying that she believed the young man had been in her house a few days after his disappearance from New York . She so , impressed Alexander T. Mason of the law i firm , and Hugh H. Baxter that they visited Police Inspector McClusky and arranged that . the woman should be allowed to look over the Rogues ' Gallery to see if she could find the pictures of the two men who had been with the man she believed to be the missing Kingsley . It was agreed that the examination should be private , even the Detective Sergeants of the department not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her search of the photographs Mrs. Hall retold her story to Inspector McClusky , and when closely examined did not vary in any essential detail . She said that about three weeks after the disappearance of Kingsley a. man had gone to her house and rented a room , paying for it in advance . He had not occupied it and did not appear again for ten days , when ! he went to the room with two other men , one of whom she noted in particular because although he seemed young he was so bald that he had to take the most particular care with the little hair he had left . He was better dressed than his companions , although they wore good clothes . The three men were in the room about twenty minutes . Then they left . The man answering the description of Kingsley before going gave her a card on which he had written " Henry Baxter . " This she had saved , not understanding just what was meant by it . The writing is singularly like that in which Kingsley wrote his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Rogues ' Gallery with the greatest care , and then said very positively that she rec , ognized among them the two men who had been in her house with the bald-headed young man . These she indicated io the Inspector . The first was that of Stewart , whom she described as having black eyes , hair and mustache , and a very intelligent expression . The police would not give her description of the second man whom they are trying to find . Stewart was picked up at the Bowery and First Street on Saturday night , and taken to the Tombs , where he was held until to-day . He was closely questioned during the afternoon by detectives , and , though it was rumored that he had been put through several " degrees " of investigation , he insisted that he knew nothing of Kingsley . It is the theory of the police that if Kingsley was robbed it must have been ' while he was under the influence of liquor . Stewart has been arrested several times for robberies of that sort , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends ' of the missing young , man is.as to what could have happened to him after he was robbed , if he was robbed : Inspector MeOlusky said : " The woman seems positive , and I ant duty bound to take her word . She identified the picture , and then identified the man In court , and while the man has a bad record , I feel inclined to throw doubt on the identification , so fax as regards Mr. Kingsley . My men know this man Stewart to be one of the hangers-on around the Forty-second Street Station , the Cortlandt Street Ferry , and other places where strangers land in New York . My men have seen this man ' drinking in barrooms with , persons presumably strangers , but they have never been able to land ' him . Now , if Mr. Kingsley , after leaving his friends on the train , went out to take a drink and met Stewart in a saloon near the ' Grand Central Station ; as seems possible , and then was made away with , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart . We 've got him , all right ; it is up to him , now , to tell the truth for the sake Of the ielafives. "
