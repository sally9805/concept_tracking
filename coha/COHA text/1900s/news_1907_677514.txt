txt At last it is the army that is to build the Panama Canal . President Roosevelt gave the kaleidoscope another turn this afternoon , Anti as a result the civilian constructors disappeared , and the uniformed engineers came into view as the men who are really to dig the ditch . This completes the circle of possibilities . There are no more shifts tha  --  ean be made without stepping in old tracks , and the chances are that this decision will stay decided for some time . The President announced that all bids submitted under the recent advertisement had been rejected . This meant that after , all all his work and negotiations W. J. Oliver , the one big contractor  --  the man in overalls , who was to assume the whole task  --  had been turned down . At the same time the President announced the resignation of John Stevens . chief engineer and but recently named for a place in the Canal /Commission . The resignation has been accepted . A third part of the President 's announcement told of the ordering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Gaillard , and William L. Sibert , to Panama forthwith to take up the work . To-day 's shift leaves one point , however , on which there is still room for I ' alteration of plan . The contract idea , for which Stevens contended so vigorously until it brought about his downfall by threatening to overslaugh him , 4 not abandoned entirely . There are still to be opportunities for contractors , but , Instead of having one big job of the whole work , the canal will be divided into small pieces , so that a lot of men in overalls can get aboard . Dissension and Criticism . About the White House and the War Department this afternoon there was evidence of disappointment and disgust . From the very beginning of the canal undertaking there has been a steady stream of criticism , a very large part of which has been based upon the neverending complaint . dissatisfaction , and accusation that has come from the men iticotrilaPdnemlina ti l'ntlra't " one man knew was the greatest thing ever devised .1,0 00xt he- declared utterly impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accomplished , according to the second commission , headed by Mr. Shonts. very little better than nothing . Then there was reorganization . Shonts and Wallace  --  came In , railroad men of topside ability and experience , who were to go right down to Panama and stay until the ships were sailing through the canal . Shouts promptly developed into a proper Washington office holder , who saw the Isthmus on Infrequent occasions . The exit of Wallace , after a brief but heated spell at Panama , was matter of angry and widespread comment . Then Stevens came in , and he is the one man who has stuck to his job so far . But even Stevens did not stop the back talk , and at last he had the supreme nerve to telegraph the President that unless things went to suit him , he , too , would quit . Shonts had just been got rid of , going out with smiles on both Wes that carefully concealed the real feelings , when Stevens began to display his knowledge of his own Importance . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained the army men , who had never hankered for the job , who realized very clearly that it was a thankless task , with small glory in the end for those who actually did the work , but who are hi the game to the end , and who go where they are sent and stay until they are relieved or dead , with no back talk , no complaint , and no criticism . They make no conditions , but sweat and endure In silence . They work for small pay and they seldom resign , never under fire . So at last the army Is to build the canal , and now perhaps the work will really progress . To Keep the Organization . ' There isno doubt that Stevens has built up a fine organization . That will be continued . Mr. Ripley , who was his chief assistant , is still on the job , and up to date he has Lot submitted a list of grievances nor expressed the opinion that the Isthmus is no place for a white man . The three engineers already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue as far as is possible for them the organization Stevens has built up . Some day the whole story of how Stevens lost out will be told . Now it can only be pointed out that he made a very surprising change of front when it became known that Oliver was the lowest bidder . Ho had been all for the contract bp to that time , but when he heard that Oliver was likely to get the plum , he cabled his ultimatum that he would quit if that happened . He knew Oliver , and could not get along with him . It is the gossip in Washington that Mrs. Stevens is primarily responsible for the attitude of her husband toward Oliver , which led to his resignation . The story is that while the contest over the contracts was at its hottest some of the friends of the combination told Mrs. Stevens things about Oliver which convinced her that tie was not a man with whom her husband could get along . Thereupon she wrote or cabled Mr. Stevens , who acted on her advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , ' so the story goes , the President cabled Stevens for his reasons , and Stevens was unable to make good . Mrs. Stevens has told her friends lately that Mr. Stevens was languishing in Panama for the want of an opportunity to play golf . He was a crack golf player when in this country , but there are no Units on the Isthmus , and he has holed out of his job there in order to take a , fresh drive up here . I No one here is willing to explain just // ARMY IN CHARGE OF PANAMA-CANAL // why Oliver did not get the contract . The Administration spent months perfecting the contract scheme , with liberal advice from Stevens . gliver and Anson M. Pangs of New York submitted the low bid of 0.75 per cent . Their nearest real competitors , the combination , bid 12% per cent . But the Government rejected Bangs . He had not done satisfactorily in other Government contracts , and the President would have none of him . Oliver reorganised without Bangs . Then the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make certain specified arrangements , and these would be satisfactory . He made them . He opened headquarters in New York , a branch in Washington , and he spent much money . It was admitted that he had met all requirements . To-day it is announced that his bid is rejected . The truth is that Oliver did not belong . A right little , tight little ring of New , York financiers and contractors had arranged to cut the melon of a Panama contract and parcel out the slices among the family . Then Oliver , an utter stranger from the South , who had been tunneling ' obscure mountains and bridging strange rivers : a man unknown to the National City Bank , and careless of what Wall Street thought , butted in with a force that upset all their calculations . Since , that time the original outfit have been trying to get rid of Oliver . The indirect attack of the interests has been successful . To-day Oliver is tossed . When the time comes to let little contractors bid for the canal work in piecemeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serenely in person or by proxy . The melon will be sliced smaller , of course , but that is reckoned better than the surrender of the fruit to the man who did not belong , who did n't care to belong , and who would n't whack up or make terms ; It is as easy to sell a gold brick to a Deacon as to a sinner , and even a reform administration that means well can be worked . Meanwhile a grinning Senate is adding another note to some memoranda that will be . used in an effort at the next session to destroy William 14 . ' Fart , Secretary of War , as a Presidential possibility and to discredit the administrative capacity of Roosevelt and Rooseveltism . All Winter there has been whispering in the Senate of the possibilities for scandal in a Panama probe . The dignified gessIppers have pulled horrified faces as they whispered , but if you looked closely you could notice a wink or two . There have been whispers of tangles on the zone in the cash balance accounts , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of miles of rusting locomotives and steam shovels , of cargoes of typewriters stored in warehouses never to be used , of wholesale extravagance and ' generel mismanagement . Nobody would I talk out loud . Nobody. , would say he ' knew these to be true . " I have hearel. and " They say. ? were the introductions to these spicy tales . Then the word was passed out to " Wait until the next session . Then you 'll see . " After a Mud Bath . ' To-day the whispers and winks and chuckles were much in evidence . It was definitely established that the anti-Roosevett Senate crowd has planned a big ' probe of tangled canal affairs for next Winter . They will probe for mud with which to plaster the President and Taft . And the President . by turning handsprings in Panama affairs , by permitting confusion to be daily worse confounded , is playing into the wile hands . To-day was a case in point . One tlilhg still bothers the Administration , the failure of Congress to change the law regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' Senate to confirm the nominations of Commissioners recently made . Two armyofficers are now members of the commission . and . unless the President withdraws their nominations before the end Of this session , they can not be renamed by him as recess appointments , the Con ' troller of tile Treasury having ruled that whet / the Senate falls to confirm . that ends he business . so far as salaries are concerned . The Senate Committee on I nterocean lc Cana is has failed to act oir the nominations now pending , and at its last meeting of the session to-day only four members were present , so nothing could be done . The President has tried to have  --  the law changed , so that he could do away with the present cumbersome commission of seven members . Now he will have to go on in the old way and trust to the next Congress to give him relief . The three engineers already detailed for ? canal work will be named as Commissioners . Senator Blackburn of Kentucky , who retires from the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is slated for a membership . and it Is reported that Senator Patterson , the dying swan from Colorado , who left his party to uphold the President on certain spectacular occasions in the last year or two , is ? also to have a seat on the commission bleachers , where he can watch what is going on , although he will ? not have much of a hand in it . The army engineers are to have a special pay , Major Goethals getting $15,000 a year , half of what has been paid to Stevens . While that part of the army which will have to go to Panama and do  --  the actual work is not pleased with the prospect the as . a whole is delighted that it is to do the ... anal digging . The officers wha will shine with reflected glory are more than proud of the goof work the other fellows are going to perform . The three men selected are described as the pick of about 15 ( 1 of the best among the eMineers . They had warning two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Panama . and have been making Preparations to start right away . - Ardor Goethn is expects to reach the Isthmus about March 1 .

He apd Major Gaillard are members of the General Staff . Major Gaillard has recently been on duty in Cuba . His last big construction work was at Duluth . He and Major Sibert are both graduates of the Engineers ' School of Application at Inlets Point . Major Sibert has been stationed for several years at Pittsburg , in charge of lock and darn work in that vicinity . ? Bidders Filled with Wrath . Oliver and his associates are filled with wrath at the loss of the contract . They do not hesitate to gay that the combination was at the bottom of their failure to get the job , and make . some sharp criticism of the way In which they have been treated . The canal has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first bill was e50,000,000 , of which $40,000.000 went to the French company end 10,000,000 to the Republic of Panama .

The Urgent Deficiency bill of last Spring furnished another $5,000,000 , and the regular Sundry Civil Appropriation bill of last year carried about $20,000,000 for canal work . . The appropriation thiseyeer is something ? less than $2e.000,000 . The latest reports froth " the ; Isthmus are that " we are  --  Just getting fairly started on the digging : " In January of this year the excaireetton on the Culebra. ' ant was . about .
