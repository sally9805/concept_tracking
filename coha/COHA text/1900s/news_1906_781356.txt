txt A group of New Yorkers has been working for several weeks to extricate from extraordinary pecuniary entanglements the Russian company of players headed by M. Orleneff and Mme. Nasimoff . The plans of the players ' friends have now so far advanced that success is assured . A guarantee fund of $10,070 has been pledged , and with this to back the Russian actors it is believed that they can quickly be made something better than self-supporting . Daniel Frohman has consented to take over the management of the Russians , who have suffered for some time from lack of a competent director . Mr. Frohman is in Europe at present , but he will be gone only three weeks . In his absence the enterprise will be looked after by Charles Frohman . The list of guarantors of the fund contains may well-known names . Andrew Carnegie is down for $1,000 , as also are Edward Wasserman and Paul M. Herzog ; Otto H. Kahn is down for $2,700 . The other guarantors are Isaac N. Seligman. $500 ; Jefferson Seligman , $500 ; Mrs. Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Miss Chandler , $50 ; William H. Bliss , MO ; " A Friend , " $50 ; Mrs. Samuel Untermyer , $500 ; Leo Arnsteln , $100 ; Mrs. A. Lewisohn , $100 ; J. Pierpont Morgan , $500 ; Mrs. Charles Rindskopf , $100 ; S. Neustadt , $200 ; Eugene Meyer , $200 ; V. Everit Macy , $500 ; George Blumenthal , $200 ; Edward J. King , $20 ; William L. Cahn , $50 ; Benjamin Stern . $25 ; Mrs. L. S. Wolff , $25 ; William Saloman , $100 ; M. Grab , $50 . While the sum of $10,970 has thus been guaranteed , the committee in charge of the matter thinks it desirable to have it increased to $15,000 , if possible , though none of the subscriptions will be called for unless the venture which the Russian players are now to undertake under Mr. Frohman 's management should prove a business failure . The members of the committee are Owen Johnson , Chairman ; Charles Klein , the playwright ; Ernest Crosby , John Barry , Paul Herzog , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be sent either to Mr. Johnson at the Players Club , 16 Gramercy Park , or to Mrs. Hellman , at 36 West Fifty-fourth Street . M. Orleneff , Mme. Nasimoff , and the company of twenty-six actors they brought with them from Russia last Autumn , were practically starving when their American friends came to their relief . The two principals of the ompanY were here in the Winter of 1904-5 and made such a good impression that the Tcherikoff Society , which is made up largely of Russians in New York , offered to raise a six-thousand-dollar fund to bring another company over in the Fall of 1905 . This offer was accepted and the P.ussians came . But the six-thousanddollar fund did not materialize . The Tcherikoff Society could raise only $2,500 . M. Orleneff had to borrow the remaining $3,500 to get a start . This was where all his troubles began . He has been his own manager , for the most part . He speaks no English whatever , and that $3,500 note has been a burden around his neck ever since he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Theatre , a small house at 15 Third Street . For this they paid $1,400 a month rent . Alter the lease was executed M. Orleneff found that the rent did n't include seats for the audience . This mildly surprised him , but he bought some chairs for $500 . After that it was discovered that there were not enough dressing rooms for his players . The manager declined to put them in . M. Orleneff had to have them built It cost him $1,000 more When the Russians finally were ready to give performances they discovered that over the theatre was a dance hall , from which , at the most solemn moments of plays like " Ghosts , " would come the floor-shaking tread of the , dancers and the blare of an east side orchestra playing " Everybody Works but Father . " Linder such conditions the Russian exiles ( they had been banished from Russia for playing " The Chosen People " ) struggled along for some weeks . They had some encouragement from cultivated persons who appreciated the quality of their work and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre and take their friends . Of course , there was a certain amount of regular attendance from the Russians of the city , but the conditions were too adverse . The company lost money from the start . Soon they had to have more money . M. Orleneff borrowed it . It does n't matter from whom . The conditions under which it was borrowed are so onerous that it is not likely that the lenders would be pleased to see their names in print . For the new loans M. Orleneff had to give his notes . He agreed , in writing , not to touch a cent of the box office receipts until the principal of the notes was repaid . By this time the proceeds of his earlier notes had all been eaten up and the company was reduced almost to the verge of desperation . By Christmas they were almost starving . About that time a group of New Yorkers , among them Richard Watson Gilder , " Mark Twain , " Robert Underwood Johnson . Charles Klein. and Mrs. Hellman , began to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time $1,500 , and at another about $600 . These sums were given outright to the Russians , and kept the actors from starving or freezing to death . Under fashionable patronage a series of matinees was held at the Criterion Theatre , at which the Russians appeared before large audiences and cleared $5,000 . This enabled M. Orleneff to pay his actors . It had been a long time since the ghost had walked for them . These remedial measures did not strike at the root of the matter , however , so the friends of the Russians began to raise the guarantee fund and asked Daniel Frohman to give the foreign actors toe benefit of his advice . To their delight , Mr. Frohman consented . At present the company is playing an engagement obtained for them in Chicago by Ben Greet . On March 1 they will go to Boston to play a two weeks ' engagement in one of the Frohman theatres . About March 21 they will return to this city to beg-in a series of performances under the Frohman management .
