Try to have patience , mother . MRS . G I have waited so long , Robert . Forty years have passed over my head since I looked into mother 's face . WINONA GRAVES ( Aside to Marie . ) I am awfully sorry she is coming . It will be such a nuisance to have such an old handkerchief head , as grandmother is sure to be , always around in the way . Besides we have so little room . I do n't know where she will sleep . MARIE ( Aside . ) It is just too horrid for anything . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graves ? MRS . G She will have to share Winona 's room for the present , as mine is too small . WINONA GRAVES Oh , horrors ! ( Door bell rings : Winona admits Tony Plummer . ) TONY Good evening . I hope I find you all well . What , Robert , poring over a book as usual ? Bah , it makes my head ache to look at a book . p. 14 WINONA GRAVES Yes , Robert is a perfect nuisance . He just reads all the time , and such stupid , dry books ! The books that I like , such as , " The Outlaw 's Bride , " and " The Fatal Marriage , " he wo n't even look at . ROBERT I ca n't afford to fill my mind with such trash . I have an object in life . I look forward to the day when " Robert Graves , Attorney-at-Law , " shall swing in the breeze , and mother 's mortgage shall be a thing of the past . TONY What ? WINONA GRAVES Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer . Massman , for whom he worked so long , promised to take him into his office , but , as you know , Lawyer Massman died quite suddenly , and Robert 's hopes were blighted . TONY ( Tragically . ) What 's the use of a colored man trying to be anything or do anything in this country ? This is the white man 's country and everything in it is his . Over the doorway of every honorable profession he has written in letters of fire " No Negroes Need Apply . " You find prejudice against the Negro in the theatres and hotels , on the railroads of the South , and , yes , even in the churches . A black face shuts you from everything but the menial drudgery that the white man does not care to perform . I had some sort of a silly notion of being an artist once , and I was patted on the back by my white professor and told that my work gave promise of great things , but when I applied for aid , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club , and I accepted . There 's no use trying , I tell you . p. 15 ROBERT ( Rises . ) But I say there is use in trying . What would Benjamin Banneker , the black astronomer ; Toussaint L'Ouverture , the hero of Haiti ; Richard Allen , the founder of the A. M. E. Church ; Frederick Douglass , the orator and Daniel Payne , the friend of Negro education , have accomplished without making a brave struggle to rise against the disastrous wave of prejudice . I care not if it be true , that " No Negro Need Apply " be written over the door of every profession , there are Negroes of genius who will not stop until they have reached the top of the ladder . It will be in the Negro 's case as in the case of the people who have preceded him  --  a survival of the fittest . WINONA GRAVES I 'm like Mr. Plummer . When I graduated from the High School I tried to get a school , just as my white classmates did , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school I would have to go South ; then I applied for a clerkship , but the proprietors said that all of the girls would leave if the firm employed a colored girl , so I gave up the struggle and concluded to enjoy life as best I could in the depths of which my color had consigned me . MARIE As this seems to have developed into an experience meeting , I 'll give my testimony . When I finished school , several of my girl friends entered the business college and learned to be bookkeepers and stenographers ; well , I saved up and took both courses , but , just as Winona says , I found no one brave enough to employ a colored girl . Some have given me job work , but no one would take me into an office on account of this hateful American prejudice that sometimes makes me wish that I was anything but an American . No use trying to be anything in this country . p. 16 MRS . G Do not despair , children ; there 's a better day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERT If you go in to win , you 'll win , but you must have grit and determination if you keep step with the Caucasian race . ( Door bell rings . Winona admits Lucille Woodbury . ) LUCILLE Robert , Mrs. Graves , all of you , I have received such good news today that I ran over to share it with you at once . I have been elected as teacher of the seventh grade at No. 2 . My Principal says that I passed the highest examination of any of the applicants . He says he is personally acquainted with Afro-American teachers in New York , Brooklyn , Boston and Chicago , who are doing a similar work in the mixed schools , and he is glad that I shall have an opportunity to prove what I can do . This hour more than repays me for my years of toilsome drudgery . Excuse me , friends , these are tears of joy . ( Wipes eyes . ) There is not an Afro-American child in attendance at No. 2 . Who says American prejuduce is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best and thus prove to the Board that the Negro blood which flows in my veins does not lower the standard of the instruction I shall give ?

G ( Looking at her watch . ) It 's five minutes past train time , Robert ? What if that should be your grandmother and no one to meet her . ( Winona admits Aunt S. ) MRS . G Thank heaven ! At last !

To think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city ? WINONA GRAVES Tony , stop your nonsence . Suppose you rehearse that song you are going to sing in the concert while we wait for Marie . TONY All right ; anything to please the girls . ( Winona hands him the music . Tony sings . ) Solo . WINONA GRAVES Is n't that sweet ? TONY Not half so sweet as you are Winona . Say , Winona , I ask you for the forty-fifth time , will you marry me ? I earn a good salary , and you shall have everything your heart can wish ; go to all the theatres and balls you like , and be the gayest of the gay . I know you must be sick and tired of this stupid life you now live , with your folks always scolding because you are young and like to have a good time . WINONA GRAVES Yes , I do get tired of it . I sew all day , and then at night if I want to have a bit of fun , I get a lecture . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TONY ( Taking her hand and attempting to kiss her . ) But do you love me , Winona ? I love you madly , passionately . WINONA GRAVES Why , yes , I suppose I do , but I do not want you to kiss me just yet ; wait until I get accustomed to the idea . TONY Perhaps this little gift will enable you to realize it more quickly . ( Pulls out a diamond ring and places it on her finger . ) WINONA GRAVES Just what I have longed for all my life ! How the girls will envy me ! What a perfectly magnificent ring . You deserve a dozen kisses . Curtain . Music . p. 20 Act 3 , Scene 4 ( Sitting-room at Graves ' . Table in centre .

Mrs. Graves , did Robert succeed in getting into Lawyer Graham 's office ? MRS . G No , Lawyer Graham told him that he could give him a job as coachman , but as for practicing law in his office , it was out of the question . LUCILLE And yet , Lawyer Graham is called the colored man 's friend , and when he wants office he never fails to solicit the colored man 's vote . AUNT S What Lawyer Graham is yo ' all talkin ' ' bout ? I used to know a Lawyer Graham ' way down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved here from the South since you came . He and his wife are both lawyers .

Well , we 'll see . MRS . G Poor Robert , I feel sorry for him ; he works all day in the blacksmith shop , and at night he sits up and pores over his studies until past midnight . Everyone says he is talented , but no one seems willing to give him a chance . It 's so hard . I have struggled so long and so hard to educate my children , and now that they are fit only for hewers of wood and drawers of water . Then , too , our mortgage falls due in one month and not a cent to pay on it . I economize in every way , but  --  ( Sobs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Graves , do n't cry , something will turn up in your favor . I 'm sure .

I shall never know a moment 's peace until it is done . ROBERT Is it possible that you , too , are hardened by the weight of that fatal mortgage ? Are you so fond of my mother , Lucille ? LUCILLE Why should n't I be ? She has been just like a mother to me ever since mine died .

LAWYER GRAHAM Do you know who this is ? LILLIAN Oh , if it ai n't my darling Aunt Savannah . ( Embraces her . ) Did you come to live with us ? You know you said perhaps you would . AUNT S Bless my lam ' , Aunt Savannah pow'ful glad to see her chile . p. 28 LAWYER GRAHAM Lillian , that tall young man who has been haunting my office for the past three weeks is Aunt Savannah 's grandson . She wants me to take him into my office so he can complete his law studies . I will leave it to you and mamma to decide . What do you say ? LILLIAN ( Throwing her arms about Lawyer G. 's neck . ) Oh , take him , papa ; give him a chance for Aunt Savannah 's sake . LAWYER GRAHAM What do you say , Mrs. Graham ? MRS . G Is there anything in him ? I do n't want to offend you , Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The profession of law , like other professions , means hard work . There is no royal road to success . I have helped colored girls through school and am willing to extend a helping hand to your grandson . If taking him into our office will help him most , I am willing to do that , if Lawyer Graham thinks it 's expedient . LAWYER GRAHAM Robert Graves is really a fine young man , my dear ; well educated , studious , courteous and refined . He is very deserving . Altogether , there 's nothing against him , except his color . AUNT S Dat 's all ; dar 's not'in again him ' cept his color , en his fo'parents brought dat long ago frum Africa wid em ' , en could n't never git rid of it . p. 29 MRS . G Then I say , take him . What if I had educated my children by hard work and every avenue of success was closed in their faces because of their race , how dreadful would it be . We open our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Indian , Russian , German and every nation on the globe , and why should we be so hostile to this peaceful , industrious people who are striving so earnestly to rise . Aunt Savannah , I will do everything within my power to aid your grandson . LAWYER GRAHAM History contains no record of any race of people who have made the progress that these people have made since Abraham Lincoln issued that immortal document known as the Emancipation Proclamation . Thirty years ago ignorant slaves enriching the soil of the sunny South by their labor , deprived of homes , of wealth , of education , in fact , deprived of everything that is essential to the life of a civilized man , and today able to boast of an orator like Frederick Douglass , educators like Daniel A. Payne and Booker T. Washington , ministers of the gospel like Richard Allen , legislators like Benjamin W. Arnett , to say nothing of their artists like Henry O. Tanner , as well as their poets like Paul Laurence Dunbar , and inventors . It is wonderful . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt I should have accepted Robert at once . MRS . G You forget to mention that this race has also made their way into law and medicine ; Judge Straker , of Michigan , and Lawyer Waring , of Maryland , are lights in the legal profession ; and Dr. McKinney , of New York ; Dr. Williams , of Chicago , Dr. N. F. Mossell , of Philadelphia , and Dr. Purvis , of Washington , are succeeding in medical lines . p. 30 AUNT S Caesar , gim me my hat . You 'll hab to ' scuse me terday .

It seems that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems cheerful and I suppose she holds up for our sake . Let come what will , Robert and I have determined to provide her a home as long as she lives . ( Enter Robert almost breathless with excitement . ) Robert , have you found my child ? ROBERT No , I have not , mother , but I have placed the matter in the hands of a detective and I will renew my own search as soon as I have acquainted you with a strange piece of news . Grandmother has interceded wtih Lawyer Graham and secured me the position I so longed for , and Mrs. Graham thinks of employing Marie Plummer as her private secretary . MRS . G Your grandmother ! How in the world could she influence Lawyer Graham to do such a thing ?

I was only dazzled by his manners and sweet words . I feel as if grandmother 's hand had pulled me back from the brink of an awful precipice . ( Enter Marie Crying. ) p. 35 MARIE My poor brother has been arrested . It was all Winona 's fault ; she was always wishing for a diamond ring and Tony could deny her nothing .

The other part is , I have secured you a pension of $10.00 a month and a thousand dollars back pension ; this with the money you have out at interest , makes you worth in the neighborhood of $2,000 .

May we profit by your example and prove alike to enemies and friends that we are as worthy of freedom as any race of people on God 's green globe , and that , though surrounded by ostracism , we will continue to educate , to accumulate wealth , to cultivate the principles of morality and to worship the God who hath delivered us from bondage until all men everywhere shall know that Ethiopia hath stretched forth her hand unto God !
