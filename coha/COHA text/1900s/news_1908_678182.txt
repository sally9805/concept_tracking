txt E. F. Buchanan and his two partners , A. 0 . Brown and Lewis Groter Young ' of the failed Stock Exchange firm of A. 0 . Brown &; Co. , had a warm session before the special investigating committee of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday afternoon . Some ofl the questions the committee asked as to the methods pursued in last Saturday 's excited trading were so pointed that after the adjournment of the committee Mr. Buchanan declared some of the questions asked to have been impertinent . The committee did not finish with the partners , and will probably resume the probe to-day . A statement as to what took place before the committee was given out at midnight last night by Mr. Buchanan . It reads in part as follows : " In view of the conflicting rumors that are current I wish to deny that our suspension was due in any way to the speculations of any bank or trust company official or to any official of the Rock Island Company , Mr. Lawson or any of the other gentlemen so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are likely to reflect upon innocent parties , particularly when such stories have no basis in fact . I will not at this time disclose the names of any of our principals . As you will concede , until the firm 's affairs are straightened out such information must be withheld from every one but ourselves . This afternoon Mr. Brown , Mr. Young , and myself were summoned to the New York Stock Exchange in connection with the investigation being conducted into last Saturday 's business . " We were unable to answer all the questions put to us without referring to our books , and some . of the questions were of a character that we considered impertinent . Some of the questions referred to were in regard to 100 shares Of Canadian Pacific which was tendered at our window by a messenger from another firm , which owed us the stock and which stock we owed another firm , according to the Clearing House tickets pent out as usual every morning to all of the brokers of the Exchange after the Clearing House has figured out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " Mr. Brown and Mr. Young were both on the Stock Exchange , and I seas diligently hustling around the Street with I collateral under my arm in the endeavor to make loans sufficient to induce our banks to give us sufficient certification to handle the enormous business we had I to put through during the day . As Is the custom in the Street , one of our stock clerks received the 100 shares of I C. P. and delivered it to Trippe &; Co. , who gave us their check for the proceeds , which was deposited in the bank in the usual way . " During the investigation by the special committee of the Stock Exchange this afternoon great importance seemed to be placed upon this transaction because our clerk did not give a check for the 100 shares in question when it was thrown into his window . After we were dismissed from the Stock Exchange committee room I investigated the case , and our clerk explained that he was awfully busy and had told the boy to call back for his check later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices on busy days when check writers are necessarily behind . " After our assignment I have a slight recollection that a member of the firm which delivered the Canadian Pacific to us came to our office and complained that he had not received his check . He was told that we were sorry that he had not brought the matter to our attention earlier as the firm was In the hands of an assignee and lawyer , and that we were powerless to correct any errors made during the day , but I immediately referred him to the assignee and requested the assignee to straighten out the case . " I was amused this afternoon to learn that legal action was liable to be brought against the firm immediately for conversion . The matter is of course of little importance , but it is due the public as well as ourselves to have such matters understood before they have an opportunity to reflect discredit on innocent people and stir up undue apprehension in regard to the firm 's action and present position . " The investigating committee appeared highly indignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our firm in declining to answer off-hand the questions put to us . We have , however , written the following letter to the Secretary of the Exchange : re connection with the interview we had with your committee to-day , we beg to say that inasmuch as we were unable to answer offhand many of their questions without referring to our books , we shall be glad to have your committee examine the books , provided the asignee has n ) objection , in order that you may get full and accurate information upon all the points in question . " You ask me the cause of the assignment . The assignment was brought about by the refusal of our banks to give us the usual daily certification to take care of our business , also the attitude taken by the officials and members of the New York Stock Exchange . " The firm 's position was strong , and it was perfectly able to meet all obligations , and would have easily avoided any trouble had they received the fair treatment that had previously been accorded , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brokers to cover our contracts , which the banks had refused to give us the usual facilities to deliver , we reported to the Exchange that in view of such a handicap we would suspend until matters could be adjusted . All of the foss sustained is due to the bidding up of prices during the operations of buying in the stocks that we were to deliver . " In regard to liabilities and assets , from what figures I have I do n't believe there will be much of a gap between them . " The mystery surrounding tn. ? . failure wag dissipated yesterday after inquiry by important interests and by a process of elimination Wall Street arrived at the ' conclusion that the firm 's difficulties were not traceable to any single market operator or group of operators , but were laid at the door of the firm Itself . The offices of ' A. 0 . Brown &; Co. , 30 Broad Street . were Inked yesterday and none of the members or the firm was in evidence . although there were a number of their former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel sent out word that they were too busy straightening out the books to talk , but it was intimated that E. R. Buchanan. , who has been acting as the spokesman of his firm . might have a statement o make . If the firm had a large clientele in New York there were no crowds of anxious patrons around the Broad Street Afice to bear out this assumption . The satisfaction of the conservative Interests in the Street over the elimination this nouse , which , for many months has been considered a danger spot , was em : . hasized by the naming yesterday of the ; ersonnel of the Stork Exchange Committee of Five , appointed by President Thomas to investigate the manipulation If the now famous Saturday 's market . the men chosen arc Ernest Groesbeck of the firm of Gro , r.sbeck &; Co. , an oldlithe member of the Exchange . who has served many terms on the Governing H. K. Pomroy , until last year ' resident of the Exchange ; C. W. Maar:4 , , It . Doremus. and ** E. 1. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known on the Exchange for their cot servatistn , and ! heir rigid adherence to the best traditions of the stock market . as well as their . ntitnate knowledge of the technique of ! coding . Their appointment is taken as a guarantee of the thorough character of , he housecleaning which the Exchange Las determined upon . Bon Errs ' Would n't Lead to Firm . It was said in banking quarters yesterday that the case of A. 0 . Brown &; : 2o. is a fair example of the disrepute Into which highly speculative methods ' have fallen . As much as six months ago accommodations to the firm were refused by large lenders of stocks , who looked with uneasiness upon its methods , although there was no question of the firm 's solvency , and notwithstanding its willingness to pay full value for stocks borrowed . It was the extension of this hesitancy in accommodating A. 0 . Brown &; Co. after the scandal of Saturday 's market that also aided in precipitating the failure . A man connected with the house attempted yesterday to palliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual accommodations . He told a story , which was afterward depied by the banks concerned , of the firm 's inability to obtain loans on Monday morning on high-class bonds . According to this man 's story , Mrs. Young , the mother of Lewis . Ginter Young of the firm , whose individual fortune is estimated at $9.000,000 , came to town on Monday and took $2,500.000- 5 per cent bonds of the American Tobacco Company to the large banks downtown , and was unable to obtain a loan on them on any terms . This story was denied in positive terms by the banks in question . One of the banks with which A. 0 . Brown &; Co. did business had notified them , It was learned yesterday , several days before the failure , that they could not expect further accommodation , and it is said that an3ther bank had been on the point of requesting the firm to withdraw its acCount . Those who were in a position to waten tl ) e operations of the firm said yesterday : hat there was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing.rig the business which the firm did last : week . and this statement Is taken in the Street as sufficient denial of the rumors which have associated first one and then another of the best-known Stock Ex : ? hange operators with the firm 's Willzulties . WeEntyre Methods Used , It Is Said . Chords were freely made yesterday that the firm 's operations , in some in ; . -. taces at least , were similar to those which got T. A. &; Co. and Cos-1 ter , knanp &; Co. into trouble .
