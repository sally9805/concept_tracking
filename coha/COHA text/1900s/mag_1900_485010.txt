" The business men in every part of the country , typified by this great organization , were a mighty factor in the recent contest . And may we not also ascribe much to the influence of the home , with its affiliations ? In any previous election was it greater , or in any did the counsels of the fireside determine more largely the vote of the electors ' , " So said Mr McKinley at a meeting of the Union League Club of Philadelphia , not long ago Notwithstanding the absurdity of the claim , now , after the political battle is fought and won , it is not remarkable that President McKinley should attempt to array the moral forces of the country on his side . and that the " influence of the home " and " the counsels of the fireside " should by him be brought forward as factors contributing largely to his success . This slight " acknowledgment " of the women of the country could , at this time , do him no possible injury , while , of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might prove efficacious in soothing the evident irritation of a large class who , although without recognized political influence , may , in the not distant future , become a power to be reckoned with . Perhaps never before in the history of this country have the issues at stake involved greater or more far-reaching principles than did those which confronted the people during the campaign which has recently ended , and it may be safely asserted that never before has the interest of intelligent women been more thoroughly aroused It is to be observed , however , that this interest was not occasioned by their enthusiasm for the principles involved an Mr. McKinley 's policy . Women , as a rule , whatever their degree of intelligence , are opposed to war , spoliation , and conquest ; it is only reasonable , therefore , that they should be averse to the present regime , and especially to the growing tendency towards militarism and despotism . When viewed by the light of actual facts , it will be readily perceived that Mr. McKinley 's adroit " acknowledgment " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publican party , during the recent campaign , is pointless , and that , notwithstanding the saccharine quality of the sop thrown out to them , no sensible woman will be lured by it . The result of the late election was exactly what might have been expected in an age in which greed constitutes the motive force in human action , it might have been and doubtless was foreseen that the sordid appeals to selfishness which were scattered broadcast over the country would result in a victory for the forces which are organized for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many . It matters not that these appeals were senseless  --  that they were employed for no other purpose than to deceive the ignorant masses the point to be observed is that they accomplished the object for which they were intended As has been truly said , " The great American stomach has spoken " In other words , a majority of the voters of this country have shown themselves too selfish to consider principles involving the rights of others , too bloodthirsty to desire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inordinate greed are sure evidences of a low and brutalized state of human society  --  a state of society in which the principles of justice and honor are ignored , and in which only those measures which promise immediate opportunities for personal gain are worthy of consideration With bullets we force our religion and our vices on peaceable Peoples , and are surprised that they fail to appreciate the blessings which we confer upon them Were the results of the late election an expression of all the people , then might we well fear for the future of this country ; but when it is remembered that the desires and opinions of only one-half the people were registered , that only few more than half those who voted cast their ballots for Mr. McKinley , and that fully one-third of those who sanctioned his policy did so . under protest , we may not lose all hope that this country may yet be redeemed from the position of dishonor into which it has been dragged . ELIZA BURT GALLIUM . DETROIT , Ilion , December 3 , 1000 THE SHIP-SUBSIDY BILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order fully to understand the arguments of those who are urging this bill , it is necessary to hear in mind that the excuse for the subsidy is not that the trans-oceanic carrying-trade is unprofitable , but only that it is unprofitable under the American flag . Probably no one has more accurate knowledge of this subject than the President of the International Navigation Company In his testimony before the Senate Committee last winter , as reported in the newspapers , he gave the following very significant information- " The four fast ships never made the Company a dollar , and he figured the net loss to the Company at $415,00 annually . The eleven ships under foreign flags supported the other ships . " Of course it is understood that the other four ships were under the American flag . In a subsequent interview , with a representative of the New York Herald , he explained that the loss on the four ships was mainly on account of the higher " wages which we are compelled to pay while sailing under the American flag , as compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The point to which I wish to call particular attention is the inherent profitableness of the business Here we have a transatlantic steamship company , with fifteen ships , sacrificing $415,600 annually on the altar of an alluring sentiment  --  an impalpable form of patriotism tangibly represented by four unprofitable ships  --  and gaining a satisfactory profit on the capital required to own and run eleven ships besides In other words , the eleven ships yield at least $415,600 clear gain annually above a sufficient profit Even if we accept the facts as marshalled by those who are advocating the bill , the situation , reduced to its simplest terms , is just this : Our navigation laws have practically driven the American merchant marine from the high seas . These laws are maintained , ostensibly , for the protection of American labor . Instead of protecting American labor , they have suppressed a wide field for American labor It is now proposed to reestablish the American merchant marine on the high seas , not by repealing the laws that destroy it , but by the taxation of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were repealed , ships sailing under the American flag would be manned by foreign labor But certainly it would be better to have ships sailing under the American flag manned by foreign labor than to have either no ships at all under the American flag , or ships under the-American flag maintained by the taxation of American labor It should be remembered that sailing the ships would be very far from all the labor that a merchant marine under the American flag would involve If the ships under the American flag were to be sailed by foreign labor , as alleged , it would only be because American labor would be more profitably employed in building and repairing the ships , and en making American goods and preparing them for shipment With the American flag restored to the high seas by a subsidy , we should have a merchant marine reconstructed and maintained , not by the profits of commerce , but by the taxation of the American people . All the merchandise transported on these ships must be laid down in the foreign markets-for less than cost . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up the difference between cost of transportation and the value accruing to the goods by being transported . If the cost of transportation is not greater than the value accruing to the goods by being transported , there is clearly no possible need for the subsidy . It would serve only to enrich the transportation companies at the expense of American labor . Of course , there is no objection to the people of the United States bestowing goods on other nations for less than cost , in the way of almsgiving , whenever there is occasion for it . But here almsgiving is neither the intention nor the result . This is not even a case of underselling the market , but of production at a greater cost than the market warrants . It is producing goods at a cost greater than the price at which they can be sold . And . obviously , the loss must fall on the producer , while the consumer neither gains nor loses . The amount by which the cost of the goods delivered in the foreign market exceeds the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the American flag , or , more correctly , under our navigation laws . Of course , the shipper can not afford to pay this extra cost . It would make the goods cost him more than he would get for them , and , therefore , to charge him with it would simply prohibit him from shipping goods by these ships . Hence , he is charged what he can afford to pay , or the market rates of transportation ; and the extra cost , due to our navigation laws , is recovered to the transportation company by the taxation of American labor . All this is ostensibly for the protection of American labor  --  labor protected by unprofitable industry , which is maintained by the taxation of labor . The proposition is preposterous . Thou art the apple of my eye , my brother , says Avarice to Labor ; it is the desire of my heart to help thee improve thy condition ; let me take a dollar from thy pocket , and I will buy thee a crust of bread . FREEMAN STEWART . PHILADELPHIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE COLONIES . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SM : In his Life of Cromwell , Mr. John Morley writes : " The future growth of vast West Indian interests , of which the seizure of Jamaica was the initial step , has made it possible to depict Cromwell as the conscious author of a great system of colonial expansion What is undoubtedly true is , that such ideas were alive , nor had the famous tradition of the Elizabethans died It is perhaps a reading of modern phrases into old events to say that the statesmen of the republic deliberately designed to show that England was not merely a European Power , but the centre of world-wide empire . Be this as it may , Cromwell 's colonial policy was that of his predecessors , as it was that of the statesmen who followed him " How any learned writer , conversant with the early history of the . English North American colonies and of the Stuarts ' dealings with them , could make the statement that Cromwell 's colonial policy was that of his predecessors James and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the charter and grant of Nova Scotia given by King James to Sir William Alexander , of the commission given to Sir David Kirke to conquer and take possession of a great part of North America ? Has he ever read the story of Kirke 's conquest of Canada under this commission ( he can see the commission in the English Record Office ) ? Has he never read about this gallant captain 's exploit  --  how he took Quebec and all the French possessions in America , and sent Champlain and all the Frenchmen prisoners to Europe , or how the English King , acting on the policy of scuttle and subserviency to France and Spain , surrendered all this splendid empire to his enemies ? How the Second Charles , a pensioner of the French King , basely surrendered the fairest part of Newfoundland to Louis XIV. ? None of the Stuart kings took the least interest in or set the least value on the colonies All their colonial charters were mere gifts to favorites like Baltimore , Hamilton , and Kirke .

To compare the policy of James the First , who betrayed Raleigh 's plans to Spain , and sent him to the scaffold by order of the Spanish Ambassador , or the craven surrenders of Charles , with Cromwell 's vigorous action and defiance of both Powers , is an incorrect rendering of history . The Protector took Jamaica from Spain ; be risked a war with France in order to retain Nova Scotia under English rule after Charles had surrendered the colony to France ; he extended the British dominions in America from Virginia to Cape Canso , embracing what is now Maine and New Brunswick , while he suppressed rebellion in Barbadoes and an incipient attempt in Virginia . He gave to both New England , the Southern Colony , and Newfoundland protection from all foreign enemies , absolute constitutional liberty , and free government . Never were the colonies so prosperous and contented ; never more loyal to the home Government . Cavalier Virginia , after Groin-well 's death , proclaimed Richard Protector . Nowhere is the sagacious statesmanship , the firm , strong hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newfoundland . For the first time in the history of the unfortunate colony , it had a real Governor supreme ruler over the whole island , its shores protected from invasion , and its great fishing fleet convoyed by men-of-war on their voyages home and to the Mediterranean . For this appointment , Cromwell selected a young American , a New Englander , John Treworgie . His six years ' rule is the one bright spot in the sombre annals of the island , and in striking contrast to the succeeding reign of Charles II. , who actually ordered the expulsion of all the resident settlers , in order that the fishery might be reserved solely for English adventurers It is perhaps placing Cromwell on too , high a pedestal of fame to claim for him the . immortal honor of being the founder and maker of our colonial empire .

Sin In connection with the complaints recently made by your correspondents from England ( Nation , Nos 1841 and 1845 ) , with respect to the feeing of servants in private families , it may be worth noting that the custom is one of long standing , as appears from a piece which was printed in the London Chronicle of March 26-28 , 1765 , xvn. 300 .
