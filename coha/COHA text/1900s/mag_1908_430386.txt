 |p1291  WHY not abdicate ? comes clamorously to the Kaiser thru many channels which presume to speak for his people . " Monarchy , " answers the Kaiser , " is a divine institution ? a sacred trust ? a Hohenzollern burden of which I can no more divest myself than of my duty to wife , children , parents or God ! " The Kaiser knows his German history ? he knows that his illustrious grandfather , the founder of the German empire , the man who three times during one lifetime marched with a victorious German army into Paris , was himself once so cordially hated by his own Prussians that he had to fly from Berlin and conceal himself in England . - His elder brother , who then sat on the throne of Prussia ( Frederick William IV ) , had to bare his head to the Berlin mob and wear the cockade of the ' 48 revolution ? yet his memory is today an asset of Prussian monarchy . He it was who , on the eve of that great upheaval , swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his people . That man 's father ( the husband of Queen Luise ) , carried his personal views of government so far ' in 1813 that his outraged people organized a popular militia and marched against Napoleon not only without royal assistance but in open defiance of royal wishes ; and more than one of his best generals incurred his displeasure for having helped to save their country at this moment when Prussia had sunk so low that it seemed to have only the alternative of being the vassal either of Russia or Napoleon . Thruout the whole of the nineteenth century Prussia offers the curious object lesson of monarchy whose kings have , without exception , boasted of divine inspiration , and yet who have yielded at some time to popular clamor : and who have died respected , if not beloved , by their subjects . The Emperor Frederick , who ruled but for 100 melancholy days ( in 1888 ) , appears to be an exception , for he inaugurated his accession by frankly avowing his sympathy with constitutional liberty . But many a prince has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political pressure . The theory of the divine right of kings has been abundantly maintained by Hohenzollerns , but also abundantly violated for exceptional reasons ? we might refer to the deposition of the King of Hanover in 1866 by his cousin of Prussia ? one divinity disputing the divinity of another . The Prussian monarchy is but a thing of yesterday ? scarce more than two centuries ? less in years than the organized civil governments of many of our States . Who gave the first Prussian King his title ? He placed-the crown himself upon his head and gave thanks to God ? and to his trusty sword . From that day to this Prussian history has been a curious picture of a kingdom won by the sword , governed by the sword , yet on the whole setting ' an example in most of the virtues which commend themselves to thrifty and lawabiding Germans . Prussia was one of the first of Continental states to abolish personal favoritism in promoting officials in the public service or in the army . In days when most courts were hotbeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich and poor , andmen who entered upon a public career gave the best of their talents in the confidence that their positions were secure ( luring good behavior . Whence now this strange hold of the Prussian kings upon their people ? Why ( lid no revolution upset Prussia radically as it did so many neighboring states , commencing with the fall of the Bastille in 1789 ? Louis Phillippe never returned to France after his flight in 1848 , nor did Ludwig I of Bavaria ever again sit  |p1292  on his Munich throne after the shake which Lola Montez gave to his rule . In Russia emperors have been removed by violent death more than once , yet in theory the constitution of Prussia is modeled after that of the Czar 's dominions . Let us for the moment forget the fulminations of a press which is not famed for fairness or accuracy ; let us bear in mind that editors are not necessarily philanthropists ? that they seek the sensational in their news columns , and do n't wish to spoil a good story by questionings . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with power are likely to abuse it . Hence we check our legislators and officials with so many hindrances to activity that we end by producing a machinery in which no one is able to accomplish anything good because all fear that he may do something wrong . Without questioning the many instances where kings have shown indifference , cruelty , rapacity and folly , Prussia is worth raising into relief as one instance , at least , of a royal rule that has endeared itself to the people . Monarchy may not be responsible for all of this , but every Prussian schoolboy believes that the throne of Prussia has been occupied for those many years by a line of monarchs who , on the whole , have set their people a good example in the way of thrift , hard work and national habits . Is William II an exception to this rule ? He has been now twenty years King of Prussia and Emperor of Germany . In his domestic relations he has been a model husband and father . As an officer of the army and navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a conscientious officer eminently fitted to earn any salary connected with the position of chief admiral or field marshal . The tongue of his bitterest enemy has never yet been able to invent a story derogatory to his honor and love of truth , to his purity in domestic life or his courage in doing or saying publicly what he felt to be right . During his reign German commerce has made immense progress , German welfare has been noticed by every traveler who is able to compare things past and present . There is now scarce a port of the Far East where the German flag does not play a good second to that of England . Today Germany scarcely knows such a thing as a slum in her cities or tramps on her highways ; sanitary rules are enforced , to the great improvement of the public health . The public service is honest . The idea that an official should make money out of his position is today scarce dreamed of in any German city . In 1895 the Emperor opened the great canal between the Baltic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was not a penny of graft in the whole eighty miles ; it was opened on the day promised ; constructed in the most perfect manner . Am I here to whitewash Emperor William ? Far from it . He would not thank me for doing so , much less the editor of THE INDEPENDENT . In 1896 Jameson invaded the Transvaal with a ridiculous band of adventurers , who surrendered with cartridges still in their belts . The Boers easily captured the whole body , and for one I assumed that Jameson would be hung for piracy and the whole matter settled on the spot . But no ! The Emperor saw fit to send to Paul Kruger a message whose wording gave in Pretoria the notion that William II was inclined to side with Boers versus Britons in a prospective war . On the evening of the day when that famous despatch startled the cabinets of the world it happened that I was in Berlin at a big diplomatic dinner . There were two German ministers at this dinner , and a German general who had been chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room I turned upon the three Germans and said : " Well , what do you think of this message to Kruger ? " They threw their hands over their heads , as Germans do when the feeling uppermost is : " My God , what madness ! "  |p1293  To my surprise , the German Parliament took no notice of this message . It is only today that they enter protest . Prince Hohenlohe did not then offer to resign , neither did he show in any way that he resented the publication of an important state document without his countersignature . That same year I was in South Africa , mingling freely with Boers of all parties ; and I felt the evil wrought by this hasty message . The Boers felt much as did the Confederate States of this country when Napoleon III gave them indirect encouragement to continue the struggle . On my return home I publisht my impressions frankly in a book on the subject and did not whitewash William II , much less his pliant old granny of a Prime Minister , who dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time . These opinions of mine gave offense . Then came the Boer war in 1899 . President Steyn 's most intimate friend and chief of his transport service , who was captured during the war and paroled , told me in Stuttgart ( after the war ) that an officer in German uniform , who claimed to speak for the German Emperor , urged the Boers to keep on fighting , assuring them that if they should win one or two victories the German Emperor would intervene in their favor . Possibly this officer exceeded instructions . Admit now the Emperor 's many lapses from politic caution ; pile up the account against him ; take this last interview with an English paper as a last straw ? and what does it all amount to ? It amounts to this , that Germany is not ripe for government in the English sense . Had any English sovereign , even a Stuart , done any one of the many things laid now to the Emperor 's charge , there would have been such a storm out of doors as would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament has spent the bulk of its time in quarrels of petty faction , in bringing parliamentary government into contempt rather than vindicating its right to be the legal mouthpiece of the whole people . The popular clamor now going on has arrested the Emperor 's attention , and it is well that the noise has been made . It shows us that when Parliament in Germany unites on any one subject the Emperor listens respectfully . That he means to recede from his opinions regarding absolute government is not likely . He himself does not believe in government by majorities , for to him the majority means the inefficient and inferior section of mankind ; and this view is that of Germans in general . Germany has not grown powerful and prosperous under government by majorities . The example of the United States has ceased to exercise the same spell in that direction that it did in the days when Carl Schurz sought these shores in search of ideal political liberty . Germany is today seriously irritated at its Emperor . He has made them look a little foolish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has suffered thru the cowardice of his ministerial advisers , and most of all thru the flunkeyism of such men as the late Prince Hohenlohe and the present Buelow , who is of a family that never resigns and rarely dies . When Germany produces a few modern Luthers , willing to speak frankly to the political Pope and suffer the consequences , then shall we see a new light about that throne . Otherwise Germany will go on illustrating the old saying that every nation has the Jews it deserves . Some weeks ago Chancellor Buelow was cartooned in Simplicissimus as amusing his Emperor with a funny story , while the monarch laughed merrily . " Buelow , " quoth the monarch , " you are such a good fellow I propose to promote you to the position of court fool ! " " For God 's sake , " quoth the frightened Prime Minister , " anything but that . For as court fool I should have to tell you the truth ! "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
