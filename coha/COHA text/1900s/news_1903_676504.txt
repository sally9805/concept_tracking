Fire during the rush hours yesterday afternoon in a power house of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company , at First Avenue and Fifty-second Street , that borough . did damage which the police estimate at $175,000 , and tied up practically every stirface and elevated line in South Brooklyn . Men were making repairs in the basement of the power house , where the huge feed wires run Into the building , when shortly after 4 o'clock a huge electric switchboard blew out with a loud detonation . A socalled " short circuit " had been caused and fire began to spurt from the damaged wire . The fifteen large feed wires , carrying the power to as many sections of the South Brooklyn trolley system , run into the basement through an underground tunnel constructed of steel . In the basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires with the dynamos on the upper floor of the power house , just under the roof . The sparks from the damaged switch set fire to the rubber insulation not only of the wires running through it but to the Insulation of every one of the hundreds of wires in the basement . When Chief Engineer Small , who had heard the detonation , ran from his office he saw dense smoke issue from the basement stairs . Summoning some of the employees he . organized a bucket brigade , but his effort to extinguish the fire without outside assistance soon was abandoned , as the smoke grew in volume , rendering access to the basement impossible . An alarm was turned in. which brought all the fire-fighttng apparatus in the neighborhood and Deputy Chief Lally of Brooklyn . For from two to six hours during and after the fire the service on the various surface and elevated lines in that section of Brooklyn was entirely disorganized . For about an hour almost the entire rapid transit system in South Brooklyn was tied up altogether . The lines affected were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay Ridge , and Coney Island lines , the Third Avenue surface cars , and the Fort Hamilton line . On the latter line traffic had not been resumed up to a late hour last night . Worse off than any , probably , were the crowds at Coney Island and at the Sheepshead Bay race track , where the tie-up was complete for two hours . and where , even then , traffic was resumed only in a desultory way . Visitors to the race track in many cases started to make their way back to the city on foot , while others returned in all sorts of conveyances which had been pressed into service to meet the requirements of the situation . It took some of them until midnight to reach the city . The crowd on Coney Island was practically marooned . No word had reached there about the fire in the power house and no one seemed to have the slightest idea as to what caused the delay . At the Thirty-ninth Street station on the Fifth Avenue elevated line there was a tremendous crush of passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding section . On the platform an employe of the railroad was handing out transfers for the surface lines , accompanied by the cheerful information that there was no cars running beyond Fortieth Street , which rendered the transfers useless . No information was vouchsafed the passengers as to what had caused the delay or when traffic would be resumed . DROVE ENGINE INTO CROWD . Driver of Fire Apparatus , Striving to Avoid Collision with Chief , Injured Several Persons . While trying to avoid running down the wagon of Deputy Fire Chief Fitzpatrick at Bridge and High Streets , Brooklyn , about 10 o'clock last night , Driver William Hamilton of Engine No. 107 pulled his horses up on the sidewalk , knocked down and injured a half dozen persons , smashed the big plate-glass window in Michael Corney 's saloon , and was himself hurled from his seat through the window to the barroom floor . While the accident threatened the lives of several uersons , no one I IN as seriously injured . The fire , which was of small consequence . was in High Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their way to it . The engine was going down High Street at a rapid rate , while Chief Fitzpatrick was driving down Bridge Street at an equally rapid pace in his fire wagon . Both I reached the crossing at the same time , but Hamilton saw the Chief first and realized ! that he would probably kill him if he did not swerve his engine from its course . He pulled to the left over toward the sidewalk . hoping to miss the Chief and also keep off the sidewalk and the crowd gathered to see the fire . But to his horror one of the horses slipped I in swerving , and quick as a flash the en-gine was thrown toward the sidewalk and I by its own force dragged the horses upon I the crowd . The frightened pedestrians scrambled out from under the horses ' feet as best they could and the animals kept I on along the sidewalk . Their course was short but destructive . Several in the crowd ' were knocked down before the engine was brought up short by the pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wheels struck the sidewalk edge and Hamilton was thrown through the window . I The rear wheels meantime swung around against the Fire Chief 's wagon . knocking off a hub and sending Fitzpatrick sprawling in the street . Firemen from the truck ran up and seized ? the engine horses and picked up those of the crowd who were injured . The worst ! hurt was Kate Shea , eighteen years old , of I 1112 Bridge Street . whose arms and legs were badly bruised . George Rooney of Bridge and High Streets and Michael Kelly of 100 High Street also were bruised and cut by the glass from the saloon window .
