txt Official announcement was made yesterdaY of the decision of the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Opera and Real Estate Company under which Heinrich Conrial , Director of the Irving Place Theatre , was to be awarded the lease of the Metropolitan Opera House for five years , to succeed Maurice Grau . The other bidders were Walter Damrosch and George H. Wilson of Pittsburg . The men interested in the new company . which will conduct grand Opera here , are James H. Hyde , Vice President of the Equitable Life Insurance Company ; George J. Gould , Jacob H. Schiff , William M. McIntyre , also a Vice President of the Equitable Life , and Henry Morgenthau . The company will be organized formally at an early date , with Mr. Conried as its dramatic head , and will take up the task of opera management when the Grau company lays it down , on much the same lines and without startling change , for , as one of those concerned said yesterday af-ternoon : " We know that we are dealing with an assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition , in which there must be a stirring up process first of all , but a proposition , on the other hand , in which Mr. Grau has not only come out well financially , but achieved an artistic triumph . " The decision to award the lease to Mr. Conried was reached by the Directors of the Opera House company Friday afternoon , and notification was sent to Mr. Conried that night . The decision was unanimous , it is understood , and was made with little discussion . Talk of close division of opinion- was declared by a member of the board yesterday to be absolutely without foundation so far as the vote was concerned . The fact which , above all others , is said to have weighed in influencing the Directors in their decision on the lease , was that Mr. Conried was able at their meeting Friday to submit a definite proposition , and had his financial backing , so to.say , with him . It was said by a member of the Directors ' Board yesterday that Mr. Conried 's offer was by far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important financial ground , and that the Directors of the Opera House Company felt that the lease in his hands would insure the successful conduct of opera during his term . Another important factor was the success which Mr. Conried has attained at the Irving Place Theatre , his intimate knowledge of the foreign stage and its people . both before and behind the footlights , and his general familiarity with things theatrical . DAMROSCH NOT ASSOCIATED . Mr. Damrosch will not , as reported yesterday , be connected with the management of grand opera in association with Mr. Conried . This was stated positively by one of the organizers of the new company last night , who explained that Mr. Conried 's proposition was attended by no conditions involving others in his managerial enterprise . The best of feeling , it was said . had existed between Mr. Conteed and Mr. Damrosch. and that the latter might in the course of things be called upon to conduct from time to time in German opera . Herr Hertz , the present conductor , who has scored the triumph of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his position , and there will ' be no changes in the company of artists . " Why should we make any changes ? " said the organizer referred to . " Mr. Gran has gathered the best singers in the world , and since there are none better , there is absolutely no reason why we should go searching for others . " While the vote taken by the Directors simply placed in the hands of the Executive Committee of the Opera House Company the power to negotiate a lease with Mr. Conried provided satisfactory terms could be arranged . it is learned that these terms are about the same as those upon which Mr. Gran holds the present lease . The only difference will be that the new lease will include in the compensation named the amount now paid separately for the rent of the building on Thirty-ninth Street . erected some little time ago by the Opera House compary for the storage of scenery and other properties . The changes in tile Opera House which have been under contemplation for some time past will be carried out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These include an almost complete making over of the stage , which has been woefully small for the accommodation of a grand opera chorus and generally inadequate for the staging of productions on the scale followed in similar houses abroad . These stage changes will be carried out practically as planned now , but it is understood that Mr. Conried will have some suggestions-to make about the auditorium that will probably be put into effect when the other work is done . It was not very easy to see Mr. Conried. but about 10 o'clock last night he entered the Irving- Place Theatre . where the audience applauded heartily when they caught sight of him . A little later he talked to the newspaper men in his office in the theatre . He sat at his desk before a pile of telegrams and cables , which he opened and read in the pauses of the con-versation . I have been so busy . " said Mr. Conried. " that I have not had time all day to cat a square meal . It is all the time shaking hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with congratulations . I have telegrams from all over the country at my house , and now at the theatre I find more . I have one from Mr. Wilson and one . very kind , from Mr. Damrosch . Mr. Damrosch says he does not think there could be a better man-for the place . " and then Mr. Conried added : " Except-himself . " Then as Mr. Conried opened a cable he cried : " Ala Berlin ! Do they know it already in Berlin ? " Then he cried again , " - Vienna " ; then " Oscar Hammerstein. " and finally " Here is one from my leading lady  --  one of my leading ladiese-who says she will be my prima donna . " Above Conried 's deelahUng the diplomas of the orders given him . the Emperors of Germany and Austri . All my colleagues have been awfully nice . " Mr. Conried went on in his . quaint German-English. " for all my hard work since twenty-five years to-day and yesterday is. the reward far above what I expected . " I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anybody ' working with - me will be in my employ . I am impressed with the great responsibility of the work I am to undertake , and . I shall consider my plans very carefully . In a fortnight 's time , per , hags , I shall know better what should be done . When the plans are made will " be glad to let the public hear about them , but the management of the Metropolitan Opera is not . a matter , for unconsidered speeches . " deleted paragraph of support from subscribers that he could easily have raised-$1,000,000 . " Only $130 , - 000 is required by the Metropolitan Opera Company , " he explained . " What I shall need , is another matter , about which I ca.nrfot now speak . " A member of the new opera company was asked last night concerning the general policy to be followed . other than as affects the stars of the Grau troupe . He said that Mr. Conried would direct his attention first to the putting on of his productions . looking to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is safe to-say that there will be more stage room , perhaps a better chorus  --  but less orchestra . " he added , with a smile . MR . CONRIED 'S CAREER . Heinrich Conried was born in 1855 , at Bielitz , in Austrian Silesia , where his father owned a yarn factory .
