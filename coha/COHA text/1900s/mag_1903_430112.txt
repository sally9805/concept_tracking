 | FROM stenographer to cabinet officer in a little over seven years is rapid promotion in the public service . This is the success of George Bruce Cortelyou , of Hempstead , N. 1. , achieved at the age of forty , and , so far as I know , it is unparalleled . Moreover , Mr. Cortelyou not only comes to the cabinet table of the President of the United States younger than almost all other cabinet officers have been when appointed , but , as secretary to the President , he has been for nearly three years , in effect , the ninth member of the cabinet . Such an extraordinary official career would attract attention and excite emulation even if it were that of a politician favored by powerful political influences , but it is more remarkable because it is well.known that Mr. Cortelyou is not a politician , and that he has had no political pull , " but has made his way solely on his own merits . This is what makes his success so admirable and commends it so strongly as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the practically unanimous approval given by Senators , Representatives , and other public men acquainted with Mr. Cortelyou 's work , and by the press of the country , all without regard to party politics , to his selection , first by President McKinley , and then , and quite independently , by President Roosevelt , for cabinet honors . When it became known that Mr. Cortelvou was to be made Postmaster-General by President McKinley if a vacancy occurred in that office during his second administration , the expressions of approval were as cordial as they were general . And when , upon learning that Congress would pass the bill creating the new Department of Commerce and Labor , and so add a new member to the cabinet , President Roosevelt said that when the bill became a law he would appoint Mr. Cortelyou as the first head of the new department , there was not only substantial unanimity in the expressions of approval , but no candidates appeared for the new office , notwithstanding its attractions for many men . No similar incident has occurred in our history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon as remarkably interesting . In - Washington , where the ambition for cabinet offices and the great difficulties in the way of aspirants for such appointments are especially well known , the significance of such success is probably better appreciated than elsewhere . The salary of a cabinet office is only eight thousand dollars , and is practically inadequate to meet the social demands upon the incumbent , so that it is not a financial prize in these days ; but the honor and the dignity o such a place are as great as ever , and they are as much sought for as at any former time . Secretary Cortelyou has doubtless had attractive invitations to go into business from prominent financiers who appreciated his unusual executive and diplomatic abilities . Doubtless he might have had similar success to that of President Cleveland 's first secretary , Mr. Daniel S. Lamont , in the business world , but he has preferred to remain in public life , with the certainty that he would soon receive one of its great opportunities , with the corresponding honors and the corresponding exactions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not had the integrity and the industry required for any degree of success anywhere ; but , without diminishing the value of his example , it must be said at once that what he has accomplished could have been done only by a man of peculiar power , and with exceptional opportunities . Success in a degree will doubtless come to any young man who prepares , by hard , steady , and intelligent effort , as Mr. Cortelyou did , for whatever opportunities may cone to him . But he may not have the opportunities leading to great success , or he may not have the ability requisite for them . Mr. Cortelyou has demonstrated , by the way in which he has improved unusual opportunities , that he is a man of unusual abilities . As no young man can tell , however , until after long trial , what his powers are or what his opportunities may be , there is the greatest encouragement in Mr. Cortelyou 's success for every young man to make the most of what he has . Thousands of young men come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail of any considerable achievement because they " mark time . " Mr. Cortelyou came well equipped by general education and as an expert stenographer to do valuable service and determined not to stand still , but to continue to improve his mind and to improve every opportunity that came to  | him . So when his opportunities came he was ready . He had a good inheritance of mind and heart , from a fine ancestry . but no considerable heritage of property . born in the city of New York , on July 26. 1862 , he received a good . kmerican education at public and private schools , taking a coarse at the Hempstead ( Long Island ) Institute and the State Normal School at Westfield . Mass .. and mastering stenography , so that he was able to support himself immediately after graduation , and by the time lie was twenty-one was aide to act as a verbatim reporter of court proceedings in New York City . After two years of this work , lie had four years ' experience as principal of preparatory schools in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil service , with his stenography as a key , so that he was soon promoted to be a private secretary , serving first , at New York , the post-office inspector , and then the surveyor of the port , after which he was transferred to the Post-office Department . where lie served with the fourth assistant postmastergeneral . Instead of settling down , as the great majority of men do , content with his place and his skill as a stenographer , this young man redoubled his efforts , and availing himself of the evening law schools of the colleges in Washington by hard study at night took the degree of Bachelor of Laws from Georgetown University . and that of Master of Laws from Columbian University . Then . as always . he showed the strength of character which scorns delights and lives laborious days for the sake of a worthy object . In November , 1895 , a new door was opened to him , and he was able to enter at once upon the path which has led to his present distinction . As the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that month : I wish you gentlemen to bear in mind that I want a firstclass shorthand man . Some of you must have the right kind of man in your departments , and I wish you would look around and let me have one . " Postmaster-General Bissell spoke right up , saying : " I believe I have in my department the very man you want . He 's a handsome young fellow , as smart as lightning , and as methodical as a machine , and , above everything , a gentleman . " That 's the kind of man I want , " replied the President . Who is he , and where is he , and when can I have him ? He 's a New Yorker named Cortelyou. " said the Postmaster-General , and he 's now private secretary to Maxwell , the fourth assistant postmaster-general . I 'll speak to Maxwell , and we will send him up to you to-morrow . " Thus , without any seeking on his own part . without any political backing . without even being asked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Cortelyou , at thirty-three , went to the - White House , where he has moved steadily forward ever since in the same way in which he began . President Cleveland liked him from the first , as everybody does who knows him , and a year before he went out of office , and only three months after . Mr. Cortelyou came into office , promoted him to be executive clerk . This place he held until July 1 . 1598 , when , in the midst of the Spanish - War. on the recommendation of John Addison Porter , the faithful and lamented public servant who first held the office of secretary to the President . which had formerly been called private secretary . Mr. Cortelyou was promoted to be assistant secretary to the President by Mr. McKinley . Later , when Secretary Porter 's health failed , Mr. Cortelyou acted as secretary to the President until April 13 , 1900 , when , President McKinley having reluctantly accepted Secretary Porter 's resignation , Mr. Cortelyou was appointed his successor as naturally as though it were inevitable . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cortelyou would be reappointed , as he was , on March 15 , 1901 . It was equally certain that , after the tragedy at Buffalo , Secretary Cortelyou would be reappointed by President Roosevelt , as he was , on September 16 , 1901 , although if a different man had held the office he would probably have been superseded , in the natural course of events , by Mr. Roosevelt 's own private secretary , Mr. William Loeb , Jr. , an able and accomplished man , who was appointed assistant secretary , and is now to be secretary to the President . as the successor of Mr. Cortelyou . But it had been demonstrated that Mr. Cortelyou was the man for this place , and the only question was whether he would feel that he could afford to remain at the comparatively small salary of $5,000 a year . Three men more different than President Cleveland , President McKinley , and President Roosevelt . although their aims and aspirations were so much alike , could hardly be found in public life . The point of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing public papers or writing letters , of each of these Presidents was entirely his own and characteristic of his temperament , yet each of them found Mr. Cortelyou perfectly suited to his needs , and each of them came to call him , not servant . but friend . The relations between the President and his secretary must be of the most intimate character . Conceivably , a President might not be on such  | intimate terms with any member of his cabinet as with his secretary . His secretary must be with him day and night . Secretary Cortelyou , for example . in his characteristic single-minded devotion to duty , has accepted practically no social invitations during the busy season in Washington , because he might be needed at any time . The secretary 's business hours are practically from the time he gets up in the morning until he goes to bed at night . When he is not with the President , he must be , most of the time , the representative of the President . and to many people and in many important matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must direct the large clerical staff and the large volume of business in the executive offices , besides keeping an eve on all that goes on in and around the White House , and especially the means for safeguarding the President from unnecessary intrusion , and from any possible danger . He 300 THE AMERICAN MONTHL p 300 must aid the President in making engagements , political , social , and general , often far in advance , and he must plan and supervise all the details of all the President 's journeys . This is not given as a complete list of his varied and exacting duties , but only to show what the secretary 's relation to the President is , and how thoroughly each must know the other . Leaving President Cleveland out of account , because Mr. Cortelvou did not rise above the office of executive clerk under his administration , we know absolutely that Mr. ( ' ortelyou has completely met the most searching tests of that relationship , under the severest conditions . tinder the strain of the Spanish War summer , which broke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fell upon Mr. ( ' ortelyou : in the tragic and sorrowful week at Buffalo ; in the process of beginning a new administration , under a new leader . so suddenly and under such trying circumstances called to that great responsibility , Mr. Cortelyou showed the same sanity , strength , modesty . and equanimity . " Unstampedable , " ? Garfield 's word about his noble wife , ? is the word for Secretary Cortelyou . He is human , he gets weary . doubtless he makes mistakes , although I never heard of any sufficiently important to be remembered . and he is a man of like passions with his fellows : but in ordinary days , at the White Douse offices , which are trying enough , through the exactions of the scores of callers and the bristling difficulties of important affairs , and in extraordinary emergencies such as actually try men 's souls , no one has ever seen Secretary Cortelyou unduly excited , or unequal to the demands made upon him . The common sense which is so uncommon , the sense of humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , and the courtesy which never fails because it is from the heart , have made Secretary ( ' ortelyou master of every situation because he was master of himself . None who saw what he did for President McKinley at Buffalo , and what he was doing at the same time for the Government and the country , in the hours when their interests were for the time being practically in his hands , failed to see that his qualities and powers were equal to any necessity . When McKinley fell in his arms at the Temple of Music . Cortelyou had to act for the President . and also to act as the President , and he showed equal wisdom and courage in both relations , besides that tenderness and loyalty which only his closest friends fully know . And all with such modesty of heart reflected in such simplicity of manner ! No wonder that Secretary Cortelyou is so popular in the best sense of that word . In an office where fidelity to his chief and to the great interests of his charge requires him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all kinds of politicians , of all grades and of all shades of character , each important in his way , or at least in his own estimation , and with the most intelligent . cultivated . and experienced people of all sorts , including some of the best and most representative newspaper , men , not only of the United States . but from abroad , with whom he may be frank but must be discreet , Mr. Cortelyou has so conducted himself that all speak well of him . In his relations with the Washington newspaper correspondents he has shown how a secretary to the President can keep official secrets without making enemies , either for the President or himself , and how he can communicate news most tactfully and efficiently , and without self-advertising . The secretary to the President can do his administration infinite harm , simply by tactless or foolish treatment of newspaper men . Secretary Cortelyou has done nothing better for the Presidents he has served than in his wise performance of his duties with respect to the press . Nothing appeals more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honesty , ? than  | modesty . Nothing in Secretary Cortelyou has appealed to them more than that habit of mind which prompted him to withhold from the newspapers the perfectly just but eulogistic remarks President Roosevelt made about him last summer when visiting Westfield , Mass. , the seat of the State Normal School , where Mr. Cortelyou was graduated . It might seem from this rough outline of Secretary ( ' ortelyou 's public career that he had no private life at all . This has been almost true at times during the past five years . But , except in the very busiest days , he has always found time for his family . He has continued to live , since he became secretary to the President , as he did before , in comfortable but simple fashion , in an unfashionable neighborhood , three blocks northeast of the Capitol . He has the happiest kind ' ENS DAWES . 301 of home life , with a wife who has been a perfect companion , and four bright and active children . We would not , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacredly guarded , but it is not improper to record the fact that Secretary Cortelyou 's wife , who was Miss Hinds , of Hempstead , the daughter of the principal of the institute there , where Mr. Cortelyou met her while a student in the institute , has had much to do with her husband 's success . In all his aspirations , in all his efforts , he has had , not only her sympathy and support , but her active cooperation . At the same time , she has neglected no home duty and . no social obligation . There is no more popular woman in official society , for very much the same reasons that there is no more popular man than her husband in Washington official life .
