 | WHEN I now go to Amiens , I take with me the memory not only of Ruskin 's eloquence , as everybody must , but of my own impressions on my first visit of all . For 1 had seen no other French cathedral then , had seen hardly anything of France , and the beauty of town and church was the more astonishing to me because I did know many of the English cathedrals , and did not imagine that any others in this world could be more beautiful . I was almost afraid afterward that to return to Amiens . would be to risk disappointment . I have been there many times in the many years since then , ? again only the other day , ? and it has lost nothing when thus put to the test of my enthusiasm and Ruskin 's approval . It was as astonishing on my last visit as on my first ? its beauty equal to the demands of my old memories and associations . The cathedral would come out of a still more severe test triumphantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most perfect of the French Gothic cathedrals . It belongs to the finest period of Gothic in France , the thirteenth century , and was almost all built within that period . It has greater symmetry , less chance picturesqueness , than almost any one of its rival churches , and few have preserved so much of the original detail both of exterior and interior . It is well placed , for , if the immediate surroundings are swept a little too bare and clean , it is on ground high enough for the old town below to provide more appropriate backgrounds . In the streets about the principal hotels one can not forget that Amiens is a big , busy , modern city ; but to the south of the cathedral there are picturesque old streets of gabled houses almost untouched , and through several the Somme and its branches , or canals , go winding , giving Amiens the name of " the Venice of France , " and bringing to it on marketdays a large fleet of the peasants ' curious , low , flat-bottomed boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unloaded , they are moored in long lines along the riverside ; the market is on the quay close by ; there is the green of many trees ; and high over all looms the cathedral , in its immense , buttressed length , from apse to western towers . If before one explores the old town , he obeys Ruskin and walks to the top of the near hills for his first point of view , there , looking back " to the cathedral and ascending slopes of the city , " he may get at the very beginning the right understanding of the " real height and relation of tower and town . " But for pure beauty , for Amiens at its loveliest , I should say , follow the Somme or one of its canals until it brings the visitor beyond the ugly suburbs into the country , where he sees the cathedral set in the midst of the lagoons and poplared glades , and under the pale skies , of Picardy . Laon and Chartres have greater majesty of position , Rheims broods more sphinx-like over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of a more animated city life ; but for loveliness of form and line , for delicacy and elegance in harmony with the French landscape of which it is the commanding feature , Amiens has no rival throughout the length and breadth of France . II FORTUNE seems to have seized upon Amiens for her own , lavishing upon the  | Church of Our Lady all the . great gifts more sparingly distributed among other cathedrals . Everything about it is interesting . The town can not be left out of any history of France , whose first capital it was , and to Clovis , as a leading hero , Peter the Hermit plays a good second . To me the saints of Amiens make a more than usually human appeal : Firmin , who converted it , appearing " out of space , " preaching in the public places like any modern reformer , and no doubt making himself as much of a nuisance to the authorities , for the Romans , who had a more effectual way of getting rid of nuisances than we , beheaded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patron of lrakers , and so of course of the " charming /latissurs ' ' Ruskin has not been alone in discovering at Amiens ; and ; Martin , who divided his cloak with the beggar on a near windy hilltop , and who has been painted almost as many times , and made almost as beautiful , as Sebastian stuck full of arrows , but never so gallant and gay as in that early picture of him by Vandyke.  | And Amiens inspires the people who write about it to more than common eloquence . Viollet-le-Duc described the cathedral as the " Parthenon of Gothic Architecture , " and almost every authority after him has had to quote the phrase . Even Arthur Young , chary in praise of most cathedrals , thought Amiens " very large and beautifully light and decorated " ; but that may have been because he generously gave his countrymen the credit for having built it . When Ruskin set to work to record " What Our Fathers Have Told Us , " it was with Amiens he began . And it was Amiens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how he loved the grand churches of northern France : " For I think these same churches of North France the grandest , the most beautiful , the kindest , and most loving of all the buildings that the earth has ever borne . " " The crowning glory of Gothic art , " Mr. Charles H. Moore says of Amiens , looking at it with the eyes of an architect . " The greatest house made with hands , " " like a precious casket adorned for some priceless jewel , " ' 1Ir . Arthur Symons writes , seeing it with the eyes of the poet . Pater , the man of letters , found the architecture " full of excitement " ; to L'Abbe Roze , the priest , the church was the " Queen of Cathe-  | drals . " Few have written quite calmly who have written of Amiens at all , and enthusiasm is roused in the reader long before the cathedral is known . History and praise would count for less if the cathedral had not been still more fortunate in its architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic church of France was entirely completed within one architectural period , Viollet-le-Duc says , but Amiens came nearer it than anv other , and the period was splendid . Paris , Chartres , Rheims , and Amiens are the four greatest of the great French Gothic churches , and Amiens was the last of the four in the order of their building . The architect therefore had the experience of the builders of the other three by which to profit . Moreover , he could come to the work with a free hand . Fire after fire had raged in Amiens since the erection of the first little chapel over St. Firmin 's grave , and the last , in 1218 , did what it had to do with all its might so successfully that when , two years later , the foundations of the new church were laid , there was no older building or any part of one to be incorporated into it . The architect , Robert de Luzarches , knew how to make the most of this opportunity , and one feels that it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects seldom were . At the end of sixty years ( 1288 ) , the cathedral was finished almost exactly as we see it now . Little was left for later generations and masters of new styles to add , except the western towers , the flechc , and details of decoration . And not only was the cathedral quickly built ; it was stanchly built . It never met the fate of Beauvais ; it was spared the turn-  | bling in of roof , or tower , or too highsoaring spire . Some weak parts had to he strengthened , some bracing and girdling had to be done here and there , and the restorer has been too often let loose upon it ; but the wear and tear of time has called for comparatively few changes , and there is not in France so complete an example on so large a scale of thirteenthcentury work . I do not think one can look at the cathedral without being impressed by the unity that is the result . It has the harmony and the repose of all perfect works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe . Fergusson regrets that the west towers are too low and that the facade is a sham , since it gives no true idea of the size and height of the huge church behind it . Others criticize this facade as a mere screen for the display of sculpture . Ruskin objects to the fleche as the pretty caprice of a village carpenter . Nor is modern meddling beyond reproach . Every one must deplore the disappearance of the old steps leading up to the western portals and the new painting of the chapels , and the tidying-up of the stonework in places . But these are minor blemishes , and they can not destroy the perfection of the cathedral . Indeed , I could sometimes almost wish the nave less perfect . The exquisite formality , unrelieved in the clear light of the ample windows , is more in character with its lay purpose as the house of justice it once was than the religious ends to which it has since been adapted . I should like to give it the color of a warmer devotion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry fire " that at Chartres awes one into prayer . As it is , it has never made me feel , with Mr. Symons , " an immense cheerfulness in this daylight church , " and , anyway , cheerfulness would be the last thing I should wish to feel . One of the missions of the Gothic architecture is said to be to lift the eyes of the faithful heavenward ; but another is to suggest mystery , and there is no mystery in a nave so perfect . It has rather a serenity more in keeping with the spirit of Greek , than of Gothic , beauty . Transepts and choir , however , are full of the color , the chance picturesqueness , the magnificence , the richness , the variety , that I expect Gothic to supply for my pleasure . Ruskin , bullying his reader in his usual fashion , insists that the cathedral must be entered for the first time by the south transept door ? the door of the T'ierye Doree . This is a case when I do not mind being bullied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , he is in a world of golden shrines and splendid tombs and elaborate carvings . And the transepts are like a beautiful antechamber to the beautiful choir , which is the richest and most magnificently adorned part of the cathedral , as the Holy of Holies in the Temple should be . It is true that I should like to set alight in the choir , as in the nave , the solemn fires of the windows of Chartres ; but there would be no need to borrow the choir-screen , another of the wonders of Chartres , for Amiens has one still more wonderful . It is not as complete as the screen at Albi , but the series of sculptured stone panels surpass in detail even the carvings of the Southern cathedral . St. John the Baptist is specially honored at Amiens , where his head , after many adventures , was brought to rest in peace , the cathedral 's most precious possession . The panels on the north side of the choir wall , facing his chapel , are the chronicle of his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the faithful expected of the sixteenth century sculptor and the fine sense of decoration that was instinctive with him . Realism could scarcely go further than in the rendering of the castled , turreted background , and the people who look from the windows or sit at table or crowd the foreground , and the costumes which are those of the sculptor 's own day , the artist then being happily free from archeological responsibility . He could reserve his energy and imagination for the treatment of his subject , and the incidents in the saint 's life were never made to follow each other with such dramatic movement . They begin with his sermons in the wilderness , and lead on , one by one , to the last act in the tragedy , when his head is presented to Herod , Herodias pierces it , and Salome faints in horror . The story of Firmin , carved a century earlier , fills the panels on the south wall of the screen , and moves with the same simple realism and dramatic force . You see the saint entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meekly bowing his head to the executioner , in  | vivid red tights , a delightful little dog at his heels . And then you assist at the discovery of the saint 's relics , and watch Clem as they are borne triumphantly into Amiens . Each panel is packed with detail , and each figure was assuredly studied from life , a faithful portrait . The realism never takes away from the quality of the design , and time and the Revolution have dealt gently with the detail . As at Albi , the sculptures are painted . The colors may have been , most likely were , strong and crude when fresh ; but they have faded into pale , tender tones , and the spaces of tinted stone break in softly upon the grayness . The richly fretted surface seems placed there for the more brilliant and subtle play of light and shadow . On the wall behind the choir , perched on a big , pompous tomb , a little seventeenth-century cherub ? the petit pleureur who reappears in every material  | in every shop window of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tears flow less over the emblems of death at his side than over the degeneracy of a public who for long preferred him to the unconscious actors in the tragedies of Firmin and John . The choir walls , with their sculptures , inclose a greater marvel of carving . I must quote Ruskin , for I know I could not , and I do not think any one could , describe the choir stalls more graphically and with more charm . Aisles and porches , lancet windows and roses , you can see elsewhere as well as here ? but such carpenter 's work you can not . It is late ? fully developed flamboyant , just past the Fifteenth Century ? and has some Flemish stolidity mixed with the playing French fire of it ; but wood-carving was the Picard 's joy from his youth up , and , so far as I know , there is nothing else so beautiful cut out of the goodly trees of the world . Sweet and young ? grained wood it is : oak trained and chosen for such work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carver 's hand it seems to cut like clay , to fold like silk , to grow like living flame . Canopy crowning canopy , pinnacle piercing pinnacle ? it shoots and wreathes itself into an enchanted glade , inextricable , imperishable , fuller of leafage than any forest , and fuller of story than any book . There is not a square inch of it all uncarved , and there is not a square inch of carving that does not relate or make beautiful the history of events without which the cathedral , and therefore the different parts of it , could never have been : the history of prophets and patriarchs , saints and prodigals . There is not an inch that is not lovely both in itself and as a subordinate part of a regal whole . Kings or emperors on their thrones may well envy these stalls , where twice a day , at the hours of office , a few old and feeble canons meet to chant matins and vespers . Outside , the cathedral has the same variety and magnificence . The buttresses seem less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most churches as large . Ornament is everywhere : buttresses and walls and transept doors are laden with it ; but nowhere does it blossom and flower with such profusion and loveliness as on the west front . Here the sculptor used the same realism in the choice and treatment of subject as in the choir-screen and choir stalls . It was his edition of the Holy Scriptures , the " Bible of Amiens , " Ruskin called it , for the people to read in those days when they could read no other . Old and New Testament were translated into stone , plainly that the people might understand , beautifully that God might be glorified . In the center of the central porch stands the Beau Christ D'Amiens , as the Amienois name him , appropriating him with familiar reverence . Prophets , apostles , and saints , each in his canopied niche , are in attendance . Below , carved in relief , stories from the Bible and stories of saints fill a double row of quatrefoils . There you will find Adam and Eve , Noah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burning Bush , Jonah stepping in imperturbable placidity out of the whale 's mouth ; there , too , are the Wise Men coming out of the East and adoring at Bethlehem ; the Innocents being massacred ; there the Blessed Mother of God lies on her death-bed , ascending into heaven , is crowned by her Son . Above the central door is a Last Judgment only less naive and grotesque and terrible in its realism than the Last Judgment at Bourges . Wherever the sculptor could , he added symbolic and allegoric figures : the Wise and Foolish Virgins , the Signs of the Zodiac , strange beasts and monsters . And this mass of detail was copied by him accurately and vividly from the life he knew . The people of the Scriptures go about their daily affairs as he saw the people of Amiens go about theirs , allegory is expressed in the terms of every-day life ; the monsters are the bogies of a child 's imagination . Reality is aimed at and achieved , with no concession to convention , except that demanded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As far as the eye reaches upward , the ornament is carried . I have spent days , as the Amienois spent them , studying it out and reading its meaning . And yet it never obtruded itself , was never disturbing , when I turned from it to look at the beauty of the facade as a beautiful whole . Then the multitudinous detail would lose itself in the surface , giving a new quality to the texture of the stone ,  | making the west front extraordinarily rich at all hours , but never so resplendent as when it glowed and shone in the eveningllight more radiantly than any mountain slope , and held the shadows with a deeper mystery . III I DO not know whether to account it another piece of good fortune that Amiens is easy of access . Cathedrals like Beauvais and Albi , to which a special journey must be made , are visited only by the few with a genuine love for cathedrals . But Amiens , on the main line between London and Paris , attracts the many , to whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in whose trail the disaster of commonplace is too apt to follow . The crowd of tourists bring after them guides who do not let you stray comfortably where you will , and beggars , who do not let you stray anywhere alone and unattended . The beggars at the cathedral doors in the South have their picturesque value , no less than the statutes in their niches . But the beggars of Amiens , who overflow the interior , have not even picturesqueness to recommend them , and the very babes in arms pursue you as persistently as if they had read Ruskin and knew his advice to give them a sou prettily and without question . Tourists also bring money , and money may mean restoration , and the restorer , so far , has been Amiens 's worst enemy . An interval of neglect , if not too prolonged , would do the cathedral no harm . Old buildings have been cleared from its immediate neighborhood . The parvis is as neat as a newly paved square can be . The little house for the Suisse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the windows and red geraniums on the sills . has the look of a lodge at the park gates of some pretentious modern mansion , though at least it helps to give the scale and that touch of domesticity to the House of God which is to me one of the charms of every Catholic church . Inside the cathedral , when I remember the fate of Angouleme and Perigueux and many another national monument , at the learned hands of Viollet-le-Duc , I tremble before the evidence of official interference . Time , in its indifference , can be more merciful than the government , in its paternal care . However , the church of Our Lady may be strong enough to outlive popularity and prosperity , as it has outlived wars and revolutions , heresies and persecutions , and many generations to come should still be able to react " What Our Fathers Have Told Us " in the carven stones of Amiens .
