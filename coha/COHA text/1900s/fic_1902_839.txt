DISCONTENT *** Produced by David Widger SOME CAUSES OF THE PREVAILING DISCONTENT By Charles Dudley Warner The Declaration of Independence opens with the statement of a great and fruitful political truth . But if it had said :  --  " We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all men are created unequal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ; that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , " it would also have stated the truth ; and if it had added , " All men are born in society with certain duties which can not be disregarded without danger to the social state , " it would have laid down a necessary corollary to the first declaration . No doubt those who signed the document understood that the second clause limited the first , and that men are created equal only in respect to certain rights . But the first part of the clause has been taken alone as the statement of a self-evident truth , and the attempt to make this unlimited phrase a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with the neglect of the idea that the recognition of certain duties is as important as the recognition of rights in the political and social state  --  that is , in connection with the doctrine of laissez faire  --  this popular notion of equality is one of the most disastrous forces in modern society . Doubtless men might have been created equal to each other in every respect , with the same mental capacity , the same physical ability , with like inheritances of good or bad qualities , and born into exactly similar conditions , and not dependent on each other . But men never were so created and born , so far as we have any record of them , and by analogy we have no reason to suppose that they ever will be . Inequality is the most striking fact in life . Absolute equality might be better , but so far as we can see , the law of the universe is infinite diversity in unity ; and variety in condition is the essential of what we call progress  --  it is , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brotherhood of man and the duty of the strong to the weak  --  is in sharp contrast with this doctrinarian notion of equality . The Christian religion never proposed to remove the inequalities of life or its suffering , but by the incoming of charity and contentment and a high mind to give individual men a power to be superior to their conditions . It can not , however , be denied that the spirit of Christianity has ameliorated the condition of civilized peoples , cooperating in this with beneficent inventions . Never were the mass of the people so well fed , so well clad , so well housed , as today in the United States . Their ordinary daily comforts and privileges were the luxuries of a former age , often indeed unknown and unattainable to the most fortunate and privileged classes . Nowhere else is it or was it so easy for a man to change his condition , to satisfy his wants , nowhere else has he or had he such advantages of education , such facilities of travel , such an opportunity to find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind have been spot where they were born . A mighty change has taken place in regard to liberty , freedom of personal action , the possibility of coming into contact with varied life and an enlarged participation in the bounties of nature and the inventions of genius . The whole world is in motion , and at liberty to be so . Everywhere that civilization has gone there is an immense improvement in material conditions during the last one hundred years . And yet men were never so discontented , nor did they ever find so many ways of expressing their discontent . In view of the general amelioration of the conditions of life this seems unreasonable and illogical , but it may seem less so when we reflect that human nature is unchanged , and that which has to be satisfied in this world is the mind . And there are some exceptions to this general material prosperity , in its result to the working classes . Manufacturing England is an exception . There is nothing so pitiful , so hopeless in the record of man , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Revolution , as the physical and mental condition of the operators in the great manufacturing cities and in the vast reeking slums of London . The political economists have made England the world 's great workshop , on the theory that wealth is the greatest good in life , and that with the golden streams flowing into England from a tributary world , wages would rise , food be cheap , employment constant . The horrible result to humanity is one of the exceptions to the general uplift of the race , not paralleled as yet by anything in this country , but to be taken note of as a possible outcome of any material civilization , and fit to set us thinking whether we have not got on a wrong track . Mr. Froude , fresh from a sight of the misery of industrial England , and borne straight on toward Australia over a vast ocean , through calm and storm , by a great steamer ,  --  horses of fire yoked to a sea-chariot ,  --  exclaims : " What , after all , have these wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was . Science grows , but morality is stationary , and art is vulgarized . Not here lie the ' things necessary to salvation , ' not the things which can give to human life grace , or beauty , or dignity . " In the United States , with its open opportunities , abundant land , where the condition of the laboring class is better actually and in possibility than it ever was in history , and where there is little poverty except that which is inevitably the accompaniment of human weakness and crime , the prevailing discontent seems groundless . But of course an agitation so widespread , so much in earnest , so capable of evoking sacrifice , even to the verge of starvation and the risk of life , must have some reason in human nature . Even an illusion  --  and men are as ready to die for an illusion as for a reality  --  can not exist without a cause . Now , content does not depend so much upon a man 's actual as his relative condition . Often it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that disturbs me . I should be content to walk from Boston to New York , and be a fortnight on the way , if everybody else was obliged to walk who made that journey . It becomes a hardship when my neighbor is whisked over the route in six hours and I have to walk . It would still be a hardship if he attained the ability to go in an hour , when I was only able to accomplish the distance in six hours . While there has been a tremendous uplift all along the line of material conditions , and the laboring man who is sober and industrious has comforts and privileges in his daily life which the rich man who was sober and industrious did not enjoy a hundred years ago , the relative position of the rich man and the poor man has not greatly changed . It is true , especially in the United States , that the poor have become rich and the rich poor , but inequality of condition is about as marked as it was before the invention of labor-saving machinery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulation of vast fortunes , acquired often in brutal disregard of humanity , marks the contrast of conditions perhaps more emphatically than it ever appeared before . That this inequality should continue in an era of universal education , universal suffrage , universal locomotion , universal emancipation from nearly all tradition , is a surprise , and a perfectly comprehensible cause of discontent . It is axiomatic that all men are created equal . But , somehow , the problem does not work out in the desired actual equality of conditions . Perhaps it can be forced to the right conclusion by violence . It ought to be said , as to the United States , that a very considerable part of the discontent is imported , it is not native , nor based on any actual state of things existing here . Agitation has become a business . A great many men and some women , to whom work of any sort is distasteful , live by it . Some of them are refugees from military or political despotism , some are refugees from justice , some from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they assume that the hardships they have come away to escape exist here , and they begin agitating against them . Their business is to so mix the real wrongs of our social life with imaginary hardships , and to heighten the whole with illusory and often debasing theories , that discontent will be engendered . For it is by means of that only that they live . It requires usually a great deal of labor , of organization , of oratory to work up this discontent so that it is profitable . The solid workingmen of America who know the value of industry and thrift , and have confidence in the relief to be obtained from all relievable wrongs by legitimate political or other sedate action , have no time to give to the leadership of agitations which require them to quit work , and destroy industries , and attack the social order upon which they depend . The whole case , you may remember , was embodied thousands of years ago in a parable , which Jotham , standing on the top of Mount Gerizim , spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a time to anoint a king over them ; and they said unto the olive-tree , ' Reign thou over us . ' " But the olive-tree said unto them , ' Should I leave my fatness wherewith by me they honor God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ? ' " And the trees said to the fig-tree , ' Come thou and reign over us . ' " But the fig-tree said unto them , ' Should I forsake my sweetness and my good fruit , and go to be promoted over the trees ? ' " Then said the trees unto the vine , ' Come thou and reign over us . ' " And the vine said unto them , ' Should I leave my wine , which cheereth God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ? ' " Then said the trees unto the bramble , ' Come thou and reign over us . ' " And the bramble said to the trees , ' If in truth ye anoint me king over you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if not , let fire come out of the bramble , and devour the cedars of Lebanon . ' " In our day a conflagration of the cedars of Lebanon has been the only result of the kingship of the bramble . In the opinion of many , our universal education is one of the chief causes of the discontent . This might be true and not be an argument against education , for a certain amount of discontent is essential to self-development and if , as we believe , the development of the best powers of every human being is a good in itself , education ought not to be held responsible for the evils attending a transitional period . Yet we can not ignore the danger , in the present stage , of an education that is necessarily superficial , that engenders conceit of knowledge and power , rather than real knowledge and power , and that breeds in two-thirds of those who have it a distaste for useful labor . We believe in education ; but there must be something wrong in an education that sets so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , above all , does not furnish them with any protection against the wildest illusions . There is something wanting in the education that only half educates people . Whether there is the relation of cause and effect between the two I do not pretend to say , but universal and superficial education in this country has been accompanied with the most extraordinary delusions and the evolution of the wildest theories . It is only necessary to refer , by way of illustration , to the greenback illusion , and to the whole group of spiritualistic disturbances and psychological epidemics . It sometimes seems as if half the American people were losing the power to apply logical processes to the ordinary affairs of life . In studying the discontent in this country which takes the form of a labor movement , one is at first struck by its illogical aspects . So far as it is an organized attempt to better the condition of men by association of interests it is consistent . But it seems strange that the doctrine of individualism should so speedily have an outcome in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is voluntary , than that which it protested against . The revolt from authority , the assertion of the right of private judgment , has been pushed forward into a socialism which destroys individual liberty of action , or to a state of anarchy in which the weak would have no protection . I do not imagine that the leaders who preach socialism , who live by agitation and not by labor , really desire to overturn the social order and bring chaos . If social chaos came , their occupation would be gone , for if all men were reduced to a level , they would be compelled to scratch about with the rest for a living . They live by agitation , and they are confident that government will be strong enough to hold things together , so that they can continue agitation . The strange thing is that their followers who live by labor and expect to live by it , and believe in the doctrine of individualism , and love liberty of action , should be willing to surrender their discretion to an arbitrary committee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all property were handed over to the State , which should undertake to regulate every man 's time , occupation , wages , and so on . The central committee or authority , or whatever it might be called , would be an extraordinary despotism , tempered only by the idea that it could be overturned every twenty-four hours . But what security would there be for any calculations in life in a state of things in expectation of a revolution any moment ? Compared with the freedom of action in such a government as ours , any form of communism is an iniquitous and meddlesome despotism . In a less degree an association to which a man surrenders the right to say when , where , and for how much he shall work , is a despotism , and when it goes further and attempts to put a pressure on all men outside of the association , so that they are free neither to work nor to hire the workmen they choose , it is an extraordinary tyranny . It almost puts in the shade Mexican or Russian personal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shall discharge a certain workman because and only because he is not a member of the union . The company refuses . Then a distant committee orders a strike on that road , which throws business far and wide into confusion , and is the cause of heavy loss to tens of thousands who have no interest in any association of capital or labor , many of whom are ruined by this violence . Some of the results of this surrender of personal liberty are as illegal as illogical . The boycott is a conspiracy to injure another person , and as such indictable at common law . A strike , if a conspiracy only to raise wages or to reduce hours of labor , may not be indictable , if its object can not be shown to be the injury of another , though that may be incidentally its effect . But in its incidents , such as violence , intimidation , and in some cases injury to the public welfare , it often becomes an indictable offense . The law of conspiracy is the most ill-defined branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boycott and the strike that they both introduce an insupportable element of tyranny , of dictation , of interference , into private life . If they could be maintained , society would be at the mercy of an irresponsible and even secret tribunal . The strike is illogical . Take the recent experience in this country . We have had a long season of depression , in which many earned very little and labor sought employment in vain . In the latter part of winter the prospect brightened , business revived , orders for goods poured in to all the factories in the country , and everybody believed that we were on the eve of a very prosperous season . This was the time taken to order strikes , and they were enforced in perhaps a majority of cases against the wishes of those who obeyed the order , and who complained of no immediate grievance . What men chiefly wanted was the opportunity to work . The result has been to throw us all back into the condition of stagnation and depression . Many people are ruined , an immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of course the greatest sufferers are the workingmen themselves . The methods of violence suggested by the communists and anarchists are not remedial . Real difficulties exist , but these do not reach them . The fact is that people in any relations incur mutual obligations , and the world can not go on without a recognition of duties as well as rights . We all agree that every man has a right to work for whom he pleases , and to quit the work if it does not or the wages do not suit him . On the other hand , a man has a right to hire whom he pleases , pay such wages as he thinks he can afford , and discharge men who do not suit him . But when men come together in the relation of employer and employed , other considerations arise . A man has capital which , instead of loaning at interest or locking up in real estate or bonds , he puts into a factory . In other words , he unlocks it for the benefit partly of men who want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making more than he could by lending his money . Perhaps he will be disappointed , for a common experience is the loss of capital thus invested . He hires workmen at certain wages . On the strength of this arrangement , he accepts orders and makes contracts for the delivery of goods . He may make money one year and lose the next . It is better for the workman that he should prosper , for the fund of capital accumulated is that upon which they depend to give them wages in a dull time . But some day when he is in a corner with orders , and his rivals are competing for the market , and labor is scarce , his men strike on him . Conversely , take the workman settled down to work in the mill , at the best wages attainable at the time . He has a house and family . He has given pledges to society . His employer has incurred certain duties in regard to him by the very nature of their relations . Suppose the workman and his family can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The employer is morally bound to increase the wages if he can . But if , instead of sympathizing with the situation of his workman , he forms a combination with all the mills of his sort , and reduces wages merely to increase his gains , he is guilty of an act as worthy of indictment as the strike . I do not see why a conspiracy against labor is not as illegal as a conspiracy against capital . The truth is , the possession of power by men or associations makes them selfish and generally cruel . Few employers consider anything but the arithmetic of supply and demand in fixing wages , and workingmen who have the power , tend to act as selfishly as the male printers used to act in striking in an establishment which dared to give employment to women typesetters . It is of course sentimental to say it , but I do not expect we shall ever get on with less friction than we have now , until men recognize their duties as well as their rights in their relations with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present discontent , and the often illogical expression of it , I am far from saying anything against legitimate associations for securing justice and fair play . Disassociated labor has generally been powerless against accumulated capital . Of course , organized labor , getting power will use its power ( as power is always used ) unjustly and tyrannically . It will make mistakes , it will often injure itself while inflicting general damage . But with all its injustice , with all its surrender of personal liberty , it seeks to call the attention of the world to certain hideous wrongs , to which the world is likely to continue selfishly indifferent unless rudely shaken out of its sense of security . Some of the objects proposed by these associations are chimerical , but the agitation will doubtless go on until another element is introduced into work and wages than mere supply and demand . I believe that some time it will be impossible that a woman shall be forced to make shirts at six cents apiece , with the gaunt figures of starvation or a life of shame waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a street-car in a large city . He received a dollar and sixty cents a day . He went on to his platform at eight in the morning , and left it at twelve at night , sixteen hours of continuous labor every day in the week . He had no rest for meals , only snatched what he could eat as he drove along , or at intervals of five or eight minutes at the end of routes . He had no Sunday , no holiday in the year . Between twelve o'clock at night and eight the next morning he must wash and clean his car . Thus his hours of sleep were abridged . He was obliged to keep an eye on the passengers to see that they put their fares in the box , to be always , responsible for them , that they got on and off without accident , to watch that the rules were enforced , and that collisions and common street dangers were avoided . This mental and physical strain for sixteen consecutive hours , with scant sleep , so demoralized him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire a substitute and go away to sleep . This is treating a human being with less consideration than the horses receive . He is powerless against the great corporation ; if he complains , his place is instantly filled ; the public does not care . Now what I want to say about this case , and that of the woman who makes a shirt for six cents ( and these are only types of disregard of human souls and bodies that we are all familiar with ) , is that if society remains indifferent it must expect that organizations will attempt to right them , and the like wrongs , by ways violent and destructive of the innocent and guilty alike . It is human nature , it is the lesson of history , that real wrongs , unredressed , grow into preposterous demands . Men are much like nature in action ; a little disturbance of atmospheric equilibrium becomes a cyclone , a slight break in the levee ' a crevasse with immense destructive power . In considering the growth of discontent , and of a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be noted that while wages in nearly all trades are high , the service rendered deteriorates , less conscience is put into the work , less care to give a fair day 's work for a fair day 's wages , and that pride in good work is vanishing . This may be in the nature of retaliation for the indifference to humanity taught by a certain school of political economists , but it is , nevertheless , one of the most alarming features of these times . How to cultivate the sympathy of the employers with the employed as men , and how to interest the employed in their work beyond the mere wages they receive , is the double problem . As the intention of this paper was not to suggest remedies , but only to review some of the causes of discontent , I will only say , as to this double problem , that I see no remedy so long as the popular notion prevails that the greatest good of life is to make money rapidly , and while it is denied that all men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The employed must recognize the necessity of an accumulated fund of capital , and on the other hand the employer must be as anxious to have about him a contented , prosperous community , as to heap up money beyond any reasonable use for it . The demand seems to be reasonable that the employer in a prosperous year ought to share with the workmen the profits beyond a limit that capital , risk , enterprise , and superior skill can legitimately claim ; and that on the other hand the workmen should stand by the employer in hard times . Discontent , then , arises from absurd notions of equality , from natural conditions of inequality , from false notions of education , and from the very patent fact , in this age , that men have been educated into wants much more rapidly than social conditions have been adjusted , or perhaps ever can be adjusted , to satisfy those wants . Beyond all the actual hardship and suffering , there is an immense mental discontent which has to be reckoned with . This leads me to what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of discontent which seems to me altogether the most serious , altogether the most difficult to deal with . We may arrive at some conception of it , if we consider what it is that the well-to-do , the prosperous , the rich , the educated and cultivated portions of society , most value just now . If , to take an illustration which is sufficiently remote to give us the necessary perspective , if the political economists , the manufacturers , the traders and aristocracy of England had had chiefly in mind the development of the laboring people of England into a fine type of men and women , full of health and physical vigor , with minds capable of expansion and enjoyment , the creation of decent , happy , and contented homes , would they have reared the industrial fabric we now see there ? If they had not put the accumulation of wealth above the good of individual humanity , would they have turned England into a grimy and smoky workshop , commanding the markets of the world by cheap labor , condemning the mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded conditions of life in towns , while the land is more and more set apart for the parks and pleasure grounds of the rich ? The policy pursued has made England the richest of countries , a land of the highest refinement and luxury for the upper classes , and of the most misery for the great mass of common people . On this point we have but to read the testimony of English writers themselves . It is not necessary to suppose that the political economists were inhuman . They no doubt believed that if England attained this commanding position , the accumulated wealth would raise all classes into better conditions . Their mistake is that of all peoples who have made money their first object . Looked at merely on the material side , you would think that what a philanthropic statesman would desire , who wished a vigorous , prosperous nation , would be a strong and virile population , thrifty and industrious , and not mere slaves of mines and mills , degenerating in their children , year by year , physically and morally . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , not man , that makes a state . In the United States , under totally different conditions , and under an economic theory that , whatever its defects on paper , has nevertheless insisted more upon the worth of the individual man , we have had , all the same , a distinctly material development . When foreign critics have commented upon this , upon our superficiality , our commonplaceness , what they are pleased to call the weary level of our mediocrity , upon the raging unrest and race for fortune , and upon the tremendous pace of American life , we have said that this is incident to a new country and the necessity of controlling physical conditions , and of fitting our heterogeneous population to their environment . It is hardly to be expected , we have said , until , we have the leisure that comes from easy circumstances and accumulated wealth , that we should show the graces of the highest civilization , in intellectual pursuits . Much of this criticism is ignorant , and to say the best of it , ungracious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appliances for education , in the field of science , in vast charities , and missionary enterprises , and what we have to show in the diffused refinements of life . We are already wealthy ; we have greater resources and higher credit than any other nation ; we have more wealth than any save one ; we have vast accumulations of fortune , in private hands and in enormous corporations . There exists already , what could not be said to exist a quarter of a century ago , a class who have leisure . Now what is the object in life of this great , growing class that has money and leisure , what does it chiefly care for ? In your experience of society , what is it that it pursues and desires ? Is it things of the mind or things of the senses ? What is it that interests women , men of fortune , club-men , merchants , and professional men whose incomes give them leisure to follow their inclinations , the young men who have inherited money ? Is it political duties , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our relations that shall lighten and relieve the wrongs and misery everywhere apparent ; is the interest in intellectual pursuits and art ( except in a dilettante way dictated for a season by fashion ) in books , in the wide range of mental pleasures which make men superior to the accidents of fortune ? Or is the interest of this class , for the most part , with some noble exceptions , rather in things grossly material , in what is called pleasure ? To come to somewhat vulgar details , is not the growing desire for equipages , for epicurean entertainments , for display , either refined or ostentatious , rivalry in profusion and expense , new methods for killing time , for every imaginable luxury , which is enjoyed partly because it pleases the senses , and partly because it satisfies an ignoble craving for class distinction ? I am not referring to these things as a moralist at all , but simply in their relation to popular discontent . The astonishing growth of luxury and the habit of sensual indulgence are seen everywhere in this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the fashion and wealth of the whole country meet there for display and indulgence ,  --  New York , which rivals London and outdoes Paris in sumptuousness . There congregate more than elsewhere idlers , men and women of leisure who have nothing to do except to observe or to act in the spectacle of Vanity Fair . Aside from the display of luxury in the shops , in the streets , in private houses , one is impressed by the number of idle young men and women of fashion . It is impossible that a workingman who stands upon a metropolitan street corner and observes this Bacchanalian revel and prodigality of expense , should not be embittered by a sense of the inequality of the conditions of life . But this is not the most mischievous effect of the spectacle . It is the example of what these people care for . With all their wealth and opportunities , it seems to him that these select people have no higher object than the pleasures of the senses , and he is taught daily by reiterated example that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees the value the intelligent and the well-to-do set upon material things , and their small regard for intellectual things and the pleasures of the mind , why should he not most passionately desire those things which his more fortunate neighbors put foremost ? It is not the sight of a Peter Cooper and his wealth that discontents him , nor the intellectual pursuits of the scholar who uses the leisure his fortune gives him for the higher pleasures of the mind . But when society daily dins upon his senses the lesson that not manhood and high thinking and a contented spirit are the most desirable things , whether one is rich or poor , is he to be blamed for having a wrong notion of what will or should satisfy him ? What the well-to-do , the prosperous , are seen to value most in life will be the things most desired by the less fortunate in accumulation . It is not so much the accumulation of money that is mischievous in this country , for the most stupid can see that fortunes are constantly shifting hands , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opportunity that money brings . Another observation , which makes men discontented with very slow accumulation , is that apparently , in the public estimation it does not make much difference whether a man acquires wealth justly or unjustly . If he only secures enough , he is a power , he has social position , he grasps the high honors and places in the state . The fact is that the toleration of men who secure wealth by well known dishonest and sharp practices is a chief cause of the demoralization of the public conscience . However the lines social and political may be drawn , we have to keep in mind that nothing in one class can be foreign to any other , and that practically one philosophy underlies all the movements of an age . If our philosophy is material , resulting in selfish ethics , all our energies will have a materialistic tendency . It is not to be wondered at , therefore , that , in a time when making money is the chief object , if it is not reckoned the chief good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , to that which can be immediately serviceable in some profitable occupation of life , to the neglect of those studies which are only of use in training the intellect and cultivating and broadening the higher intelligence . To this purely material and utilitarian idea of life , the higher colleges and universities everywhere are urged to conform themselves . Thus is the utilitarian spirit eating away the foundations of a higher intellectual life , applying to everything a material measure . In proportion as scholars yield to it , they are lowering the standard of what is most to be desired in human life , acting in perfect concert with that spirit which exalts money making as the chief good , which makes science itself the slave of the avaricious and greedy , and fills all the world with discontented and ignoble longing . We do not need to be told that if we neglect pure science for the pursuit of applied science only , applied science will speedily be degraded and unfruitful ; and it is just as true that if we pursue knowledge only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , knowledge will lose the power it has of satisfying the higher needs of the human soul . If we are seen to put only a money value on the higher education , why should not the workingman , who regards it only as a distinction of class or privilege , estimate it by what he can see of its practical results in making men richer , or bringing him more pleasure of the senses ? The world is ruled by ideas , by abstract thought . Society , literature , art , politics , in any given age are what the prevailing system of philosophy makes them . We recognize this clearly in studying any past period . We see , for instance , how all the currents of human life changed upon the adoption of the inductive method ; no science , no literature , no art , practical or fine , no person , inquiring scholar , day laborer , trader , sailor , fine lady or humblest housekeeper , escaped the influence . Even though the prevailing ethics may teach that every man 's highest duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy and destiny in this cold-blooded philosophy . No social or political movement stands by itself . If we inquire , we shall find one preponderating cause underlying every movement of the age . If the utilitarian spirit is abroad , it accounts for the devotion to the production of wealth , and to the consequent separation of classes and the discontent , and it accounts also for the demand that all education shall be immediately useful . I was talking the other day with a lady who was doubting what sort of an education to give her daughter , a young girl of exceedingly fine mental capacity . If she pursued a classical course , she would , at the age of twenty-one , know very little of the sciences . And I said , why not make her an intellectual woman ? At twenty-one , with a trained mind , all knowledges are at one 's feet . If anything can correct the evils of devotion to money , it seems to me that it is the production of intellectual men and women , who will find other satisfactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor sees what it is that is really most to be valued , its discontent will be of a nobler kind .
