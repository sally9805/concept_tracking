 |p593  THRICE in the course of the three centuries of its existence the town of Santa Clara del Cerro Verde had bloomed into prosperity ; and thrice had it withered dismally , and thereafter fallen into decay . First of all , its bloom was Heavenly . This was when the Brothers of Saint Francis ? to whose Rule the blessed Santa Clara herself was vowed ? founded there a mission station for the cure of Indian souls : planting their little church and convent close beside the great spring which gushed unfailingly front the mountain-side and at once created and preserved the abundant verdure whence came the mountain 's name . And they chose this place partly because of the abundance and the sweetness of the waters ; but most because the spring was the abode of a malignant spirit ? much worshiped by the heathen of those parts ? which needs must be conquered and cast out utterly before the pure Faith Christian could pervade that land . In that good fight God gave to his servants the victory . Prodigious ? miraculous they called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Brothers won over the savages of those wild regions ; so prodigious that the fame of their glorious achievement was noised abroad through all the length and breadth of New Spain . And then there bloomed prosperity of another sort ? an earthly prosperity which presently triumphed over and crushed utterly the Heavenly ? when the vastly rich mine , named also in honor of Santa Clara , was opened in the Cerro Verde high above the gushing spring . For a hundred years the stream of silver flowed forth constantly from the cavernous depths wherein the Indians toiled . In those days the chief concern of Spanish taskmasters was to get as much work as possible out of Indian bodies ; and scant was the care that then was given to the well-being of Indian souls . Then it was that the great Church of Santa Clara was builded , and beside it the greater convent ? replacing the little church and the little convent which had been reared by willing , humble hands to God 's glory when the good Brother ? first had won there the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their successors . dwelling luxuriously in their new fine home and ministering pleasantly in their beautiful church , called these edifices thank-offerings for God 's goodness : which euphemism no doubt gave cause to the devil for many a comfortable chuckle when he made his frequent visits to the @#  |p594  town of Santa Clara del Cerro Verde and beheld there how well his work was going on . Thanks to the plentiful supply of water from the great spring , mining was an easy matter ? until the spring itself made mining impossible . At first , and for a long while , the workings were far above the spring ; but by the end of a century the main shaft was down to the spring 's level , and the fight with the water fairly had begun . Through nearly the whole of another century that fight continued ; but the water gained always , and long before the mine actually was abandoned the output had become the veriest trifle : some beggarly ounces a day only , as the galleries one after another , before the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore . Through this dismal time of slow decadence the town of Santa Clara lost year by year from its store of riches , and came at last to utter poverty . For a while the Brothers paid back in alms to the needy a part of the harvest which they had garnered during the years of fatness past and gone ; and then they also were as poor in fact as they had been always under the vow of their Order , which forbade them not merely the possession of money but even to touch money with their hands . The great houses in the town stood empty , the little hut of adobe on its outskirts melted away into the earth again : of all those who had toiled and bustled there not ten score remained . And among the Indians , to whom the wreck of the mine brought release from cruel labor in its depths , was happiness . These , holding fast to their ancient faith , believed firmly that their god dwelling in the spring had helped them to a good deliverance ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in opening the mine again would pay his life to their water-god in forfeit for his victory . II . For a long , long while the blight rested upon Santa Clara : even until after the Revolution that changed the Vice-Kingdom of New Spain into the Republic of Mexico . And then arose a new prosperity ? when an English Company was formed to clear the mine by pumping and so to reach the great treasure that it still contained . This period of revival , though brilliant while it lasted , was painfully short . Nothing whatever was taken out of the mine ? not even the water ; but a great deal was taken out of the pockets of the English shareholders . While this yield continued , Santa Clara enjoyed flush times . The houses were full once more , money was plentiful , there were dances every night . there were bull-fighting and cock-fighting to one 's heart 's content on Sundays , and there was a genial abundance of gambling and drunkenness all the time . The convent had its share of the good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good part of the heretic money , being paid in wages to the faithful , found its way to the sacerdotal coffers which so long had been bare ; and by judicious monte-playing ? in which game , as the Brothers conducted it , there was but a small element of chance ? many individual sacerdotal pockets were well lined . After all , though , this revival of prosperity was but a flash in the pan . The huge pump ? brought from England at a cost that would have made it worth its weight in pure silver had it been lucky enough to reach the mine ? never was set agoing . A half of the work only was accomplished when a revolution broke out , and a stop was put for a while upon all communication between the coast and the interior . The Company 's pack-train , bringing up coin and the remainder of the machinery , was captured almost within sight of Tampico . Nobody ever knew whether the captors were Government troops or Revolutionists ; nor did it make any practical difference . The essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , and that the machinery ? apparently in a mere spirit of playfulness ? was tipped into the Panuco River . A little later , another party ? these avowedly were Revolutionists ? came up to the mine and looted the Company 's storehouse and drove off the Company 's horses and mules . Had these several misadventures occurred earlier in the period of English occupancy they might have been tided over . Unfortunately , they came toward the end of the third year , when the English share-  |p595  holders had their backs well up because two extra assessments already had been levied and not one of the promised twentyfive per cent . dividends had been paid . They were in no mood to listen to their chairman 's statement of fresh misfortunes which made a fresh call on capital necessary if work were to go on . Instead of agreeing to the proposed assessment , they arose in their wrath and appointed an investigating committee charged with the duty of sending a mining expert to Mexico to look over the situation on the ground . The expert went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . When he arrived at Vera Cruz another revolution was in full blast , and he was warned that to attempt to go up from the coast to the capital was much the same thing as signing his own death-warrant . Being an Englishman with a duty to perform , he naturally went ahead . Somewhere near the Puente Nacional he was captured by Revolutionists ; in company with these , was captured by troops of the so-called Government and came close to being shot as a Revolutionist along with them ; was set free , after a couple of hideous months in a Mexican prison , with orders to return to the coast at once and leave the country ; was caught on his way down by one set of robbers , who took away what few valuables the soldiers had left him , and by another set who stripped him and were for killing him because only his clothes were left to steal ; and so came again to Vera Cruz in his shirt and drawers . When he got back at last to England , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Times , " he was not able to make a report of any especial value upon the property which he had been sent out to investigate ? inasmuch as at no time in the course of his exhilarating travels had he been within four hundred miles of it . However , his inability to make a report was not a matter of much consequence one way or the other . Six weeks before his return to England . the company in whose interest he had made his lively journey had definitely collapsed . And so , for the second time , Santa Clara del Cerro Verde saw plenty depart from it , and poverty come in plenty 's place . Once more it became desolate . Even in the convent only a dozen or so of the Brothers remained : old men who clung to the abode that for years had sheltered them , and a few young men to whom the vow of their Order was real . In the end , these Brothers were rewarded for their faithfulness . When the Laws of the Reform closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Convent of Santa Clara was suffered to abide unclosed . Doubtless this concession was less the result of clemency than of indifference . The building was without value ; and little was to be feared in the way of sedition from a few old men ? the youngest well on toward sixty ? living far aside from the world 's interests and activities in a ruined mountain town . In truth , a more utterly ruined town than this then was ? its houses almost all abandoned , its few inhabitants bitterly poor , its great mine water-logged ? scarcely could have been found in the whole world . And yet , out of the slough of misery into which they had fallen , the fortunes of Santa Clara del Cerro Verde were destined once more to rise . When the New York and Cerro Verde Mining and Reduction Company ( Limited ) took hold of the Santa Clara property the most brilliant possession of that largely hopeful corporation was its prospectus . To say that the author of this prospectus was Maj. William Brashar is to say a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compositions ; and on this particular prospectus , as he himself frankly put it , he had " slung himself . " He went well back for a start , and presented the ancient history of the mine in parallel columns of Spanish and English and in a fashion that was fetching to a high degree ; skilfully using this bilingual arrangement in order to get in the romantic touches which would have been out of place in a paper supposed to have been composed ( as it actually had been ) in the plain Saxon tongue . Having a lively imagination , and being well up in Mexican mining history , the Major made a very pretty story ? telling how the devoted Franciscans had founded the mission of Santa Clara and how nobly  |p596  they had carried on their self-sacrificing labors among the savages ; how the vein of silver had been discovered by a shepherd searching for a lost sheep high up on the mountain-side ; how the mine instantly had begun to yield enormously , and how the shepherd ( who , by the way , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and built the still existing magnificent Church of Santa Clara as a thank-offering ; and how the enormous yield of silver went on uninterruptedly for more than a hundred years . And then , getting away from Spanish and from his own unacknowledged quotation marks . the Major became soberly and severely practical . With a fine frankness he expressed doubts as to the accuracy of the Spanish account that he had quoted , and with an especially excellent ingenuousness advanced the opinion that the statements therein given of the output of the mine should be reduced by at least onethird . " But even with this conservative underestimate , " the Major wrote , " it would he perceived that the property unquestionably was one of the richest ever developed in Mexico " ? and as he had taken the simple precaution to make his first set of figures big enough to stand the reduction suggested in his second set , this assertion on the face of it could not be assailed . Having thus established an effective point of departure , the Major came down at a single leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first quarter of the nineteenth ? and there handled with a masterly skill the episode of the English Company that was formed to work the mine in the year 1823 ; that never did work it ; and that went to bits in the year 1827 with a net loss of more than seventy thousand pounds . This material was not the most promising stuff in the world to put into it prospectus , but the Major managed to count with it handsomely . From the prospectus put out by the English Company when it was floated ? in its own way a fairly good specimen of long-bow literature ? he quoted figures in regard to the mine which were far in excess of his own . Thence he proceeded to show that an absolute confidence in the value of the property had been manifested by a cash sub- scription of upward of seventy thousand pounds to be applied to its development : and went on to point out this was done with a light but firm touch , and with a neat allusion to the well-known conservative financial methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeding the - rate of twenty-five per centum per annum " indicated clearly the valuation of the property even at that period ( the conditions being now entirely changed by the advent of the railroad ) when the cost of transportation was almost prohibitory and exorbitant prices had to be paid for fuel . In conclusion , he stated with a severe brevity that the unfortunate collapse of the enterprise was due to the revolutionary disorders of the times ; and then dilated at a considerable length upon the existing peace and prosperity iii Mexico under the sway of a government at once able , hones. and firm . Thus did the Major , by the judicious handling of the very unsatisfactory facts at his disposal , cast over the gloom of a most thoroughgoing financial disaster the glamour of an almost complete theoretical success . With the shady past thus advantageously disposed of , the Major 's treatment of the luminous present and of the brilliant future left nothing to be desired . But there was no bluster about his method , and each of his assuring assertions was either true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared with absolute accuracy , there was nothing the way of exploiting the Santa Clara mine , of resuming the operations which had made it famous in the sixteenth century , but water All the difficulties encountered by the English Company ? bad government , high cost of transportation , lack of fuel ? had been removed . Mexico now was as well governed as any country in the world . The construction of a railway made it possible to lay down machinery and coal within twenty miles of the mine . Almost the whole of the wagonhaul was across a level plain , leaving only a few miles of water-grade road to build up the canon leading to the mine . A few months , possibly a year ? it was best to be on the safe side and say a year ? would be required in which to set up the pump and clear the mine of water . This preliminary work being completed , active mining @#  |p597  operations and the payment of dividends would begin . But there was another phase of the enterprise , the Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the treatment of the tailings left from the work which had been carried on in the sixteenth century . Analysis of these tailings , the samples being taken from the surface of the heap , had shown an average value of ten dollars the ton . It was thought probable ( but this was only a probability ) that the refuse from the earlier workings ? when very crude methods of extraction were employed ? would assay as high as twenty-five dollars the ton . A close estimate of the quantity of tailings had been made by a competent engineer , and the result arrived at was between two hundred and twenty thousand and two hundred and twenty-five thousand tons . Taking the lower of these estimate , and taking also the lower estimate of value , it was evident that the Company was in a position to clean up ore to the value of four millions of dollars before the mine was even opened ; and this work would be carried on as soon as the stamps were set up , and would be continued until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . After that , possibly , the treatment of the tailings might be carried on at odd times . Making a conservative estimate of the cost of machinery , of transportation , of labor and of miscellaneous expenses , it would therefore be perceived , the Major stated ? with a triumphant logic that was irrefutable , since it was the inevitable sequence to his own premises ? that the net profit arising from this merely incidental asset very nearly would cover all preliminary expenses , including the purchase and installation of their entire plant . In conclusion , the Major explained that of the capital stock , which had been fixed at five hundred thousand dollars ? for prudential reasons the capitalization had been kept at a low figure ? one-fifth was retained by the owners of the property and twofifths had been subscribed by persons intimately associated with the enterprise from its inception . The remaining two-fifths were offered to the public strictly at par . Iu order to place this stock , he declared with dignity . there was no need to discount it . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the ore in the heap of tailings alone representing , at the lowest estimate , four times the value of the capitalization ? it self-evidently was worth its face value . Therefore it would be placed only at par . And as a parting shot he earnestly advised prospective purchasers , in their own interest , not to be tempted to sell out when the stock rose , as it almost certainly would rise shortly , to a considerable premium . This inconsiderate course would bring an immediate small profit , but in the long run it would entail a large loss . What made Major Brashar 's services as a prospectus-writer sought after was his judicious habit of literal truthfulness in every particular that could be checked off easily , combined with his discretion in drawing from the pure fount of his imagination only such statements as could not easily be disproved . In the effort above outlined he had excelled himself ; but even more in the quantity of truth that he had left out than in the quality of truth that he had put in . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleft in the mountains several hundred feet deep , out of which they would have to be hoisted or else carried for two miles along a road yet to be made , and that their value rested upon the unsupported assertion of the Mexican vendors of the property ; had he stated that the - water in the mine was fed constantly from a spring which in the rainy season poured forth a devastating torrent ; and , above all , had he stated that on the stock subscribed for " by persons intimately associated with the enterprise from its inception " not a dollar had been paid ? well , had he put these several facts into his prospectus the chances are that he might not immediately have unloaded upon a confiding public the offered two hundred thousand dollars ' worth of shares . As he omitted them , and as he made a strong bid for popular confidence by offering his shares only at par , the successful floating of the Company at once was assured . The two thousand shares offered in the prospectus were placed in a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground floor , benevolently permitted  |p598  an eager public to purchase rather more than half of their own holdings ? and even would have surrendered the whole of them , had not a general break in the market suddenly stopped the demand . This operation , the share certificates having cost their vendors only what it cost to print them , was superior to the transmutation of metals . Indeed , it was so excellent a return upon a strictly vacuous investment that most of those who had profited by it , being satisfied , closed out their holdings of New York and Cerro Verde on a falling market and betook themselves to fresh woods of a speculative nature and to mining pastures new . But the Major himself hung on . He was of a sanguine temperament , and he believed that he saw his way to winning another rubber before he definitely abandoned the game . IV . It was an axiom with Major Brashar that in the lexicon of youthful mining enterprises ? whether the same were or were not reserved by fate for a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own statement of this spirited concept was less elegant than the foregoing , but it was not less strong . " It makes me tired , " he said , to be in with a lot of chumps who all the time are getting up on their ears and howling that the whole damn business is going to everlasting smash . That kind of a crowd would smash anything if they had the chance they 'd bust the bottom out from under the pyramids of Egypt . No , I want the men I work with , and the men that I start to working for me , to believe that we 're dead sure bound to come out on top -- same as I always do myself . Give me a crowd like that , and I 'd back the outfit to build a pontoon railroad across the Atlantic Ocean ? which is a thing that 'll be done , some day , mark my words . All it needs is money and brains and backbone and the nerve to hold on . And for choice I 'll always take my men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about some other thing he did some time and wondering whether he had n't better do this thing that same way . And because he 's not hidebound he hits out fresh at whatever he tackles , and he takes chances , and he hustles instead of sitting around giving himself good advice ? and so he gets there , nine times out of every ten . " Holding fast to these energetic principles , it was only natural , therefore , that Major Brashar picked out a young man to be Superintendent of the Santa Clara mine . He had had his eye on this particular young man for a year or two ; and because he had perceived his value he had been saving him until he could play him , as he put it , for all he was worth . When the Major first fell in with him , in Tucson , Laurence Boldwin was working about as hopeless a mine as ever was operated even in Arizona . It had opened fairly well , but at fifty feet down the paystreak began to pinch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a microscope . Even the Mexican miners wanted to quit work in disgust . Any ordinary man would have called off the gangs and sent his resignation East by telegraph . But Boldwin , not being an ordinary man , hung on . He had a notion that the vein had thinned just above an ore-chamber : and he wanted to give that ore-chamber a chance . When the pay-streak pinched out altogether , he received written orders from the President of the Company to abandon the mine . Instead of obeying his orders , he went down to Tucson ? it was then that the Major met him ? and telegraphed for conditional leave to sink another ten feet at his own cost . His terms were that if lie did not make a strike he would stand the extra loss himself : and that if he did make a strike all expenses should be charged off and then he and the Company would divide . The President telegraphed back , tersely : " Sink to hell , on your own terms . " Boldwin did not go that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore-body that cleaned up pure silver to the value of fortythree thousand dollars . He had to fight with the Company , of course , for his half . But he had his written orders to stop work , and his telegram and the President 's answer were on file . His case was so good that even the Company 's solicitor advised a settlement . Then the Company wanted to make him Vice-President as well as Superintendent ? which was only a handsome  |p600  way of offering to pay him two salaries ? provided he would join in putting into the development of the mine all the money that had just come out of it . He answered positively that the mine now really was played out and that he would not have anything more to do with it . When he delivered this ultimatum there was some breezy talk for a while in the President 's office ; but the upshot of it was that he got a certified check for his share of I he profits ? rather more than nineteen thousand dollars ? and his resignation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went ahead in its scheme of continued development ; and with such rapidity that inside of a year it had sunk all of its cash , and a good deal more than all of its credit , in a dry-rock hole that did not yield a dollar . Then the whole concern smashed . It was when Major Brashar heard the result of this venture , the plucky beginning of which had impressed him strongly , that he marked down Boldwin for a useful man . " He 's got sand , " was the Major 's mental commentary . " When I 've got a job on hand that sand 's wanted for , he 'll do . " having made his stake , Boldwin decided to go East for a while and enjoy himself . Ile had not been East for two years and he felt that he fairly was entitled , under the circumstances , to a holiday . F o ra man not yet turned of twenty-six , who had started in life with no capital but his profession , the situation was exhilarating Three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made and his future would be secure . To safeguard this future , he put his money into solid securities only ; keeping out a couple of thousand or so to pay for his proposed good time . It is possible that some young men coming East flush after two years in Arizona would have distributed red paint over the city of New York with a liberal hand . But Boldwin 's tendencies were not toward decoration of that pronounced sort and he took his enjoyment quietly . He settled down into snug lodgings , and made his quarters less like a camp and more like it home by laying in it good stock of hooks and by being a hit extravagant in the matter of prints and water-colors . He went to the few plays that were worth seeing ; did not miss a single opera ; subscribed to the Philharmonic ; saw all that there was to see in the way of pictures ? and gave zest to this by no means irrational scheme of amusement by grinding through a course of metallurgy at the Columbia School of Mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequented an exotic little restaurant , known as the Casa Napoleon , where that language normally was spoken ; and it was there that he fell in again with Major Brashar -- who congratulated him heartily on his good fortune , and was as cordial as he well could be . For the time for using this " sandy " man had come ; and the Major . who was something of a fatalist , hailed his opportune appearance as a good omen . They had frequent dinners together , at all of which the Major talked about his Santa Clara venture freely ; and was especially careful ? nicely estimating the means best suited to his ends ? to be frankly confidential in regard to the difficult engineering work that had to be done : the building of the road through the canon , the recovery of the tailings from the bottom of the ravine , and , above all , the doubtful issue of the struggle between any pump whatever and the Cerro Verde spring . " It 'll be tough work , damn tough work , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find a man who 's u the brains and the nerve to do it ? and whoever he is , he 'll make his everlasting reputation as an engineer . Just let one of those water-logged Mexican mines get wrung out and started , and the business will set in with a rush . Everybody 'll go at it at once , and they 'll all be after the man who showed how the thing could be done . He can strike for the fanciest prices ? and get ' em . And he can keep at it until he 's made any sized pile that he thinks he wants . " It was with much complacency that the Major observed the effect which talk of this sort had upon Bold win ? the flush that came to his cheeks as he listened , and the eager look that came into his eyes . Once he asked ? with an affectation of extreme carelessness ? if the Company had any particular man in view fur the job ; and @#  |p601  the Major 's easy , " Well , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no hurry , and we 're just looking around , " did not seem wholly to satisfy him . But that he asked the question entirely satisfied the Major . " He 's all right now , " this gentleman observed to himself , in the shady retirement of his inner consciousness . " I can have him when I want him ? and he 's the kind I want . His dander 'll get up when he ketches on to the all-fired size of his contract , and he 'll make the fur fly . lle 's not likely to pull the thing through ? nobody is . But he 's the hustling kind that do n't tucker out easy and he 'll think he 's going to ; and that 'll make him sure ' o send up reports that 'll keep things booming ? until the time comes for knocking the bottom out of the boom . " V. Probably Boldwin would have pressed more vigorously his claim to being the identical person for whom Major Brashar was looking had not a stronger interest just then engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who not only realized his ( somewhat hazy ) conception of what a wife should be , hut supplemented it so pleasingly in so many different directions that he was disposed to regard her as quite too good to be true . And she , for her part ? though he was far from guessing it ? found a wonderful charm in this resolute young fellow : elate with triumph after his first victorious encounter with Fortune , and thrilling with a joyous confidence in his own ability to accomplish anything to which mortal man might set his hand . And the charm grew stronger when she perceived that with his strength was also tenderness ; and that , for all his airy assurance of being able to conquer everything else , he was most becomingly humble in his hope of conquering her love . There was a thrilling pleasure , she found , in having this daredevil of a curly-headed , blue-eyed young giant so obviously afraid of her ? and at the same time so obviously ready to defy lions and tigers , and extreme dangers generally , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good will . Under conditions so favorable to its progress , this particular case of true love ran both smoothly and rapidly . It had its beginning in November , when he chanced to meet her at a reception ? and was startled by finding her grown up into a young woman and quite different from the little girl whom he had not seen for seven years . It had its crisis in March ? when he made a statement of his wishes that would have been wholly unintelligible to her had she been compelled to extract his meaning from his words . At a later date ? it was during their month of honeymooning in the Catskills ? Laurence expressed surprise that she had received what might have been a confused , and certainly should have been a rather confusing , declaration with such calmness that she was able to give him an immediate decisive reply . To which crude observation Helen replied with a fine air of superior wisdom : ' You foolish boy ! As though those honest blue eyes of yours had not told me everything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September that they were married , and the autumn month that they passed in the Catskills was a season spent beyond the borders of real life in the region of the ideal . Together they found Arcady ; and only now and then , when his thoughts turned to the opening that there was for somebody in the Santa Clara venture , did Laurence remember that there was such a thing as a working world . When these thoughts came they were unsettling , and he tried to stifle them ; but for the life of him he could not help wondering at times who would be the lucky man . It was a good thing , he decided with much firmness , that the offer had not come to him . The mere thought of leaving Helen made him wretched ; and had he gone to Mexico it would have been downright cruelty to take her along . The opening was a brilliant one , certainly ; but he was glad that his chance for it ? if ever he had had a chance for it ? was past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would fall to thinking how he would have met and mastered the several difficulties of the situation , and then of the honor that would have come to him and of the fortune that he would have made ? and would pull himself up short in the midst of regretting keenly that the case was closed . And then , one  |p602  morning , came a letter from Major Brashar formally offering him the position of Superintendent of the Santa Clara mine . It was near the end of the month that the letter came . while they pleasantly were planning a jaunt northward by way of the Lakes and the Saint Lawrence to Quebec and Montreal . Having read it , he laughed a little ? but not very easily ? while he told Helen of the offer that it contained . " The Major 's a good deal of a scamp . " he went on , and his record is shady ; but this time he seems to be playing squarely and to have got hold of a good thing . I heard some talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who have put money into it . They said that there certainly was an enormous fortune in the mine , and all they needed was a live man who would get it out for them . It looks as if they and the Major had concluded that I 'm that sort of a man . The Major 's shady , but there 's not much about mining that he do n't know ; and the rest of the lot did n't seem to be especially fools . either . It 's something of a compliment to have such an outfit ask me to take hold of such a job . " " And will you ? " Laurence was silent for a moment , and then answered slowly : No. it wo n't do . It 's all very well for them to offer me eight thousand a year and expenses ? that 's rousing big pay . you know ? and a block of the stock besides . It shows they really want me when they make an offer like that ? that they want me bad . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going off to leave you . I would n't close with them if they 'd offer me the whole mine . " " Leave me ? Why , of course you wo n't . What nonsense you are talking , Laurie . I 'm going along ! " " By Jove ! Do you really mean it ? What a brick you are , Nell ! " Laurence broke out enthusiastically . And then his enthusiasm suddenly left him , and in a very different tone he continued : " No , no , Kelly ? I tell you it wo n't do . You might be able to stand Utah , or even Montana ; but down in Mexico you never could get along at all . You 'd be utterly wretched . child ; and I 'd be in a fever of worry about you the , whole time . It 's a big stake , of course . Offers like that do n't grow on trees . Eight thousand a year and expenses , and a block of stock that will be worth anywhere from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine to going ? and I shall get it to going , you know ? is a pretty big thing . And I 've always wanted the chance to tackle one of those old water-logged Mexican mines . anyway ? with plenty of capital back of me , and full swing to run things in my own way . Getting one of those mines started up and paying again would be a splendid card for me . The country 's full of them , and if I started up one --  " But this is all rubbish ! Just wait for five minutes while I write to Major Brashar that he and his mine may go to Jericho ? and then we 'll get at the maps and timetables and settle this Canadian expedition out of hand . " " Laurence ! It is only one month and four days since you promised to love . honor and obey me ? what you really said . I know , was cherish , but it meant obey ? all my life long . I do n't suppose you 'll quite live up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to begin to break your word . My orders , now , are positive . Sit down instantly at that table and write to your Major that you accept his offer and are ready to leave for Mexico immediately . and that taking me with you will be a part of your expenses ? because you could no more go without me than you could go without your legs or arms . " Laurence half turned toward the table . There could be no mistaking the direction in which his desires tended . As he checked himself he said : " But I 'm so afraid that you 'll be miserable . You see " Not another word ! " Helen interrupted with a commanding wave of her hand . " You have your orders , sir ? act upon them ! Perhaps , though , you had better leave out about the Company paying my expenses . Yes , leave that out . Write to the Major a dignified letter of acceptance . But let him see that you appreciate the compliment that they have paid you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they think you are . Tell hi that you 'll be in New York to-morrow morning ? I 'll begin to pack this minute . and we 'll go down by the night train --   |p603  and that you 'll be ready . if necessary , to leave New York to-morrow evening on your way to the mine . " Oh , Laurie , what fun this is ! I 've always wanted to be ordered to make a very long journey in a very great hurry ; and I ' ye always wanted to go to Mexico ; and I 've always -- well , not always , but it seems like always , do n't it ? ? wanted to go flying off to the ends of the earth with you ! It 's like having a whole lot of delightful dreams all coming true at once . You dear , dear boy ? how lovely it is that you have got such a place , and what a good time we are going to have ! And , of course , we wo n't stay in Mexico forever . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , very likely ? and everybody is talking about your splendid success as an engineer , we 'll come away in a blaze of glory . And then we 'll travel everywhere , absolutely everywhere ; and we 'll buy all the best books and pictures and hear all the best music in the world . How good and how dear of you it is to give me all this happiness ! Not go , indeed ! How-can you -- - " Well , even if I am ' solid pluck ' and also an angel ' ? do n't you think a solidly plucky angel is rather a funny notion , Laurie ? ? you need n't try to squeeze all the breath out of my body . And you 've absolutely ruined my hair ! " And then Laurence wrote his acceptance of Major Rrashar 's offer , and informed that gentleman that he would meet him to talk things over on the ensuing morning in New York , @# Their departure for Mexico , while less precipitate than Helen had hoped for , was sufficiently hasty to realize her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week they were under way ; and within a fortnight she was established temporarily under a matronly American wing at Zacatecas , while Laurence organized his staff and then went on to Santa Clara to begin work there and to make ready for her some sort of a home . As it was necessary that the members of his force should speak Spanish . he had deferred getting it together until his arrival in Mexico ; and he justly considered that he was lucky in finding in Zacatecas the three men whom he needed ? an assistant engineer , a bookkeeper and a storekeeper ? all ready to his hand . The engineer , Harstairs , who gladly threw over his railroad work for this better-paid job , was a pleasant young Englishman , well up in his profession and also well-bred , to whom Laurence took kindly at sight . Kelton , the storekeeper , who had been doing mining work in the country for twenty years , was an American ; a trustworthy man , but of melancholy humor and with a prodigious faculty for holding his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German whose personality did not count for much one way or the other ; but he had a perfect knowledge of Spanish and a working command of English , and his recommendations were of the best . Laurence felt quite reasonably elated by the ease with which he had got together so good an outfit ; but he was not at all elated by the opinions upon the Santa Clara property which were presented to him freely by mining men . It was conceded that the working over of the tailings ? if some economical way of getting them to the stamps could be devised ? might prove fairly profitable , but the visionary estimate that made this refuse worth twenty dollars a ton was laughed to scorn . As to the draining and working of the mine , it was declared flatly to be impossible . The most hopeful opinion was that even if the mine could be cleared by steady pumping throughout the entire dry season , it certainly would fill up again as soon as the rains began . No pump that ever was put together , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verde spring in the season of rains . Boldwin 's enthusiasm was a little cooled by the discouraging consensus of opinion upon his undertaking ; but , on the other hand , his fighting spirit was aroused . He had taken this big contract , he reflected , precisely because it was a big contract ? and quite as much for the sake of glory as for the sake of cash . That it should get bigger on his hands was not a matter to complain about , but rather the contrary . Exactly in proportion to the size of the difficulties which he mastered would be the size of his success . And what did these  |p604  old-fogy Mexican miners know about modern mining methods , anyway ? He 'd show them what could be done with American machinery , and also what could be done by an American engineer : In a word , figuratively speaking , his back bristled and he went at the situation horns down . But as he walked his horse at the head of his little party up the six miles of trail through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the difficulties touched upon by his Zacatecas friends ? that of making a wagon-road up to the mine ? had not been greatly overestimated . This was the first piece of work that he had to attend to . The base of his supplies , including fuel , being the nearby railway , a wagon-road was a necessity ; as it had not been in the time of the English occupation , sixty years earlier , when the only available fuel had been wood and when , the coast being the supplybase. the machinery had been sent from England in sections small enough to be packed in on muleback . The building of this road , he admitted to himself , would be a fairly tough piece of work ; but still it would be entirely practicable . He had a good eye for location , and so had Harstairs . As they rode along they noted the lay of the land and located the road roughly . By bridging the canon at one point , and by building a pretty stiff amount of retaining wall , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious rock-cutting . As they rounded the last turn in the canon and ascended a little crest , whence the trail dipped again downward to a broad plateau , the prospect that opened before them filled Boldwin with delight and astonishment . At their feet lay a park-like valley of such green loveliness as he had not seen elsewhere in Mexico , and in its midst was a town so considerable as to prove that Major'Brashar had not drawn upon his imagination for his facts in regard to the vast yield of the mine in ancient times . Many of the houses were so large that they fairly were entitled to be called palaces ; and above them all towered the great church , surmounted by two squat bell-towers and by a glittering dome of glazed tiles . But the chief charm of this delectable valley lay in its abundant lush verdure , that everywhere made it glad . In the long-past season of prosperity channels had been cut through which the plentiful water had been distributed lavishly , and these still served in great part the purpose for which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , and behind the larger houses , were shady gardens in which flowers were growing by mere instinct of their sweet natures amidst fruittrees all gone wild ; along the streets were lines of shade-trees beside the water-channels ; the little Plaza Major was a veritable bower . And beyond the town , rising high above it , was the great Cerro Verde : clothed in a delicious green downward . from the level of the spring . As he looked down upon all this green loveliness , after his ride of fourteen miles across a sun-scorched , cactus-covered plain and his six-mile scramble up the bare canon , it seemed to Laurence as though he had come upon the Earthly Paradise . His spirits rose with a bound . Of one good thing he had there full assurance : whatever might be the difficulties before him , at least the home that he and Helen were to live in while his work went on would be as beautiful as Mexico had to give . VII . In spite of his spirits , the desolateness of the forsaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . What had been the houses of adobe were mere clay-heaps ; and while the stone houses , many of them with beautifully carved facades , remained perfect so far as their walls were concerned , their woodwork was rotten and fragmentary and here and there a roof had fallen in . With a grim satire . which had in it also a touch of pathos , the lower windows of these broken dwellings were protected by iron gratings heavily but elegantly wrought . The only sign of human life that they saw as they rode onward to the Plaza was a bent old man standing in the doorless doorway of what had been a very stately mansion is its day . As they passed him he gazed at them wonderingly , but did not speak . Evidently his astonishment at the sight of strangers was too Jeep for words .  |p606  Farther on they found a few houses in which were inhabitants ? ragged sad creatures who came forth and clustered around them begging piteously ? and when they halted their horses on the Plaza and looked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surrounding the Plaza were the noblest buildings of the town . On two of its sides were palace-like dwellings . stately still . On the third side was the Casa Municipal , once the home of the town government ; and adjoining it was another massive structure that still was called the Caja Real ? though the years of a long lifetime had vanished since within that bare coffer any of the King 's treasure had been stored . Rising high on the fourth side of the Plaza was the rich facade of the church , a marvel of curiously involved churrigueresque stonework in the midst of which was posed the stone figure of the blessed Santa Clara above the high arched door : and beside the church was the long , low facade of the convent , also wrought richly , overtopped by a soft fringe of branches springing from tall trees growing in the garden beyond . Drawn forth by the rare sound of horses ' feet . and by the babble of begging voices , two Brothers came out from the church and stood together , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the slanting sunlight before the black shadow of the open doorway . The cowls of their blue habits had fallen back , showing the scant snow- white hair surrounding their tonsures . Each carried a staff , and as they looked down in a slow maze of wonder at the sight before them they leaned on these supports with the broken and weary air of old , old men . The house which Boldwin and his party turned to enter after their momentary halt ? that was to be their headquarters , as it had been of their English predecessors sixty years back ? was the largest and the finest in the town . Originally it had been the home of the richest man in Santa Clara ; and he had built it , a century and a half earlier , in the time of the mine 's richest yield . It stood facing the church across the Plaza ? a huge square structure of two stories , inclosing a great central court in which was a beautifully carved stone fountain and from which a carved stone stairway led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides and gave access to ' its many enormous rooms . And in its rear ? reached from the court by an arched passage , and from the upper floor by another stone-carved stairway ? was a far-extending garden , once laid out with an elegant formality , that had acquired a new , fresh beauty by becoming through neglect a gentle wilderness . Having been very solidly built to start with , and having been put in thorough order by its English occupants , the house was not anywhere seriously out of repair : and Laurence came upon one delightful suite of rooms ? less coldly vast in size than any of the others , and commanding a lovely view westward of the green flank of the Cerro ? that he instantly decided should be their home . From the fact that some pieces of English furniture still remained there ? a stiff . square table . a stiff sofa matched by six stiff chairs , a footstool and a little work-table ? he inferred that these rooms had been occupied by the English Superintendent ; and from the footstool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : and he fell to wondering if they also were young and just married when they came there ? and what had been their fortunes after the Company that sent them there had gone to bits . There was so much of melancholy in these thoughts , and they made the apartment so ghostly , that he was glad to hurry out of it ; and to betake himself to the general inspection of the property that would fix his attention upon practical matters , and so would crowd these disheartening reflections upon the ill luck of his predecessor from his mind . His round of the lower rooms of the house , though also a little ghostly , gave highly satisfactory results . They had been arranged by the English outfit for precisely the purposes to which he should put them and needed only a general cleaning to be ready for use . Even the desks remained in the room that had been the Company 's office , and a yellow calendar for the year 1827 still was hanging upon the wall . The old Mexican who piloted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well turned of seventy , remembered the English very well ; though at the time of their departure he had been only a monkey of a boy . They were caballeros , every one of them , this old Benito said . The Senor Superintendente once had given him a dollar , and his wife  - -  who was fair and beautiful as an angel  - -  had given him delicious little cakes many times . His mother , he added , had been their cook ; and his father had been honored with the charge of the two splendid English horses on which they took their daily rides ? until the Revolutionists came up to Santa Clara and carried off these horses , along with everything else of value on which they could lay their hands . But to Boldwin 's eager questioning as to what had become of the Englishman and his wife Benito could give no satisfactory reply . He knew only that one morning they and all the others , mounted on scrubby Mexican ponies , had ridden away ? the beautiful lady looking very sorrowful , and the tall Senor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddam ! " to everybody , because his fine English horses were gone . And so these specters , so unexpectedly conjured up from the mists of the old man 's memory , appeared only for a moment and then hopelessly were lost . The afternoon was waning when Boldwin had finished his inspection of the building , but there still remained an hour or so of daylight ; and this he devoted , taking Benito with him , to a survey of the situation immediately around the mine . The shaft was a half-mile up the slope of the Cerro , and midway between it and the town was the spring . At the spring he halted ; and as he perceived the astonishing volume of its discharge he realized more than ever that the contract which lie had taken was a very big one indeed ? and got but cold comfort from Benito 's observation that , the rains being well over , it was not nearly at full flow . With what struck him as a wholly misplaced enthusiasm , the old man descanted upon the magnificent outrush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overwhelming force of the torrent which then poured forth ? making a presentment of the case so disheartening that he was glad of the diversion when , dropping his voice a little , Benito went on to tell of the oldtime Indian belief that the spring was the home of a spirit which never would stiffer it to be conquered save at the price of its conqueror 's life . " Perhaps it is only a foolish fancy , Senor , " Benito added ; but doubtfully . " I had it from my father , who was half of the Indian blood . He believed it . and so did my mother ; and I remember how happy they were because the good Englishman did not succeed in what he came here for , and so got safe away . " And the old man spoke so seriously that Bold - win good-naturedly maintained his own seriousness , and gravely answered that it was most fortunate that so dangerous an issue between the powers of the flesh and of the spirit had not been joined . But as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , he reflected , this superstition was only the formulation by simple minds of the conviction that the spring was too strong for living man to conquer it ; and , now that he had seen it , he had an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps this might be true . Presently , as they went on upward , they passed a section of iron pipe lying beside the path propped on two stones ? a mere rust-eaten shell that had broken at its middle with its own weight . There it had been left , doubtless , one evening sixty years before . On the following morning its bearers were to have returned and carried it on upward to the mouth of the shaft . But that evening was the last of the life of the English Company . In the morning work was not resumed . Boldwin had expected , of course , to find things in the disorder that would result from a sudden stop ; but this sharp proof of how very sudden the stop had been gave him a curious shock of pained surprise . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set him to thinking ? about the English engineer who had come to do , and who had n't done , the very work that he himself had undertaken . No doubt that other man , when he came with his wife and settled down there , felt entirely confident that he would succeed . The rusted pipe , left for the night on the mountain-side and never picked up again , showed how completely and how suddenly he had failed ,  |p608  The disorderly mass of rusted machinery that he found lying at the mouth of the shaft did not weigh upon Boldwin 's mind nearly so heavily as the solitary outpost of ruin that he had first encountered . The state of affairs at the shaft was what he had expected to find there , and he was prepared to meet it practically . On the whole , the situation was better than he had hoped for . The incomplete pump , some pieces of which were in place while other pieces were lying on the ground , of course was worthless . Every part of it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections which the Revolutionists ( if they were Revolutionists ) playfully had tumbled into the bed of the Punuco made no difference so far as its availability was concerned . But the squared stones set for its foundation could be used again , the walls of the roofless pump-house still were sound , and the space leveled on solid rock for the old arrastras would serve admirably for the stamps ? all of which was so much clear gain . The sun had set behind the mountain when Boldwin , having finished preliminary investigations , came out from the pumphouse through the doorway which opened close upon the mouth of the shaft . In that uncertain light the shadow of the building fell heavily ; so heavily that the unguarded opening seemed to be only a patch of shadow a little more dark ? and he drew a quick breath as he thought of what would follow upon the misstep so easily made . Advancing , he bent over the edge and tried to peer downward ; but the blackness was dense , impenetrable . " Guard yourself , Senior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred varas to the water ; and beneath the water it is a hundred varas more . " Moved by a sudden impulse , Boldwin picked up a heavy fragment of stone , a half-hundredweight , and heaved it into the opening . As it whirred through the dead black air downward there was no sound for a long while save a low murmurous rustling . Then came a dull crash followed by a prolonged muffled rattle , as the stone struck against some projection and thereafter during its descent bounded from side to side of the shaft . And at @# last , so softly as scarcely to be audible . there came up the hiss of a splash ? that died away in faintest sibilant whispers until all was still . As Boldwin turned away abruptly a shiver ran through him ? one of those curious sudden tremors for which we account by the saying that strangers are walking on our graves . He was as destitute of nerves , ordinarily , as a man well could be ; but on that particular day he unquestionably was nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excitement incident to taking possession of the ruinous kingdom that he had been sent to raise again to prosperity . Whatever the cause of his nervousness may have been , he certainly could not shake it off . Indeed . as he walked down the mountain-side in the twilight , it took a firmer hold upon him ; and presently developed in his mind an utterly absurd fancy that for the moment was not in the least absurd to him but was very horrible and very real . In some odd way it seemed to him that he himself was the stone which he had cast into the mouth of the shaft to fall six hundred feet through air and to sink through water half as far again ; that he himself had vanished into the blackness : had struck against the projecting rock . and thence downward , mangled , bleeding , had spun back and forth between the jagged walls ? and so , at last , had fallen into the water with that soft hissing splash whereof the echo seemed still to be whispering in his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more : for he seemed to feel the sharp reviving chill of the water as he plunged deep into it , and then its loathsome foulness as he rose again and struggled on its slimy surface ; to hear his own hopeless cries for help whilst he held fast for a time to a rough outjut from the rocky wall ; to feel a numbing coldness stealing over his body , and breeding in his soul the more searching coldness of despair ; to hear the gasp that he gave as his hold at last relaxed , and the gurgle in which that gasp ended as the slime and scum closed over him ? and then to feel himself slowly sinking , sinking , sinking , down through three hundred feet of water to the very bottom of the Santa Clara mine .
