Argument : Strongheart , an Indian student at Columbia , is in love with the sister of his friend and classmate , the captain of the football team , and is anxious to distinguish himself in his last football game , but a member of the team has given the signals to their opponents . Suspicion of having betrayed Columbia is cast on Strongheart , and the captain not only takes him out of the game , but forbids him , as a member of an inferior race , to pay court to his sister . Will Strongheart be vindicated , and will he win the girl ? The preparation of a college room for the reception of ladies at five o'clock tea is an edifying sight . Shortly before the guests are expected the fellows roll up their sleeves and go at the job as if they were clearing a ship for action . A great litter of books , paper , and miscellaneous junk disappears rapidly before the onslaught . Much of it is kicked into a closet or under a couch . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One privileged to look on has a good opportunity for observing student types and for picking up interesting facts in the lives of the inmates . We should know of our own knowledge , undoubtedly , that Frank Nelson is a senior and the captain of the Columbia football team , and that his roommate , Dick Livingston , is a junior and the best half-back in America , but unless we heard it mentioned we might not know that their inseparable friend Strongheart , the son of an Indian chief , saved Frank 's life three years ago out West . The last and most important football game of the season is to be played soon , on Thanksgiving Day , and little else is talked of . Some of the students have staked a good deal of money on the game . Dick Livingston , in fact , has put up three thousand dollars , not because he could afford it , but because he had already lost that amount gambling when he had broken training and has had recourse to this desperate expedient to escape disgrace and expulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and death to him . Another member of the football team , Thorne , who is a special student , persuaded Dick that he could recoupe his losses by betting on the game , and undertook to place the money for him . Thorne is a thoroughly vicious fellow . Not only has he no feeling of loyalty to Columbia , but he would stoop to any means to ruin Dick as his rival for the affections of Frank 's sister , Dorothy . Shortly before the preparations for the tea have reached an acute stage Thorne finds himself alone in Frank 's and Dick 's room . He takes advantage of the opportunity to filch a list of the football team 's signals which are in Dick 's handwriting . In addition to Thorne 's interest in ruining Dick , he has also wagered so much money on Columbia 's opponents that a Columbia victory would mean ruin to himself . By sending the signals to the opposing team , however , he is so confident that he can secure Columbia 's defeat that he arranges to borrow an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages of supplies , and Dick follows with a load of cups and saucers . The condition of the coffee pot comes under Frank 's suspicion and , unable to put his hands on a spare towel , he takes a clean shirt of Dick 's , explaining the necessity of his action afterward as he returns from an inner room , doing the polishing . Billy Saunders arrives . He is a big man and has a dachshund tied with blue and white ribbons on a leash . Frank goes to a desk for a list of football signals to give him , and hands him one that Thorne substituted for the copy in Dick 's handwriting . Nobody knows how long the tea should be boiled . And Taylor only got two pounds , which is only a sixth of a pound apiece for twelve persons , obviously a very scant allowance . It is already after five o'clock when Strongheart arrives . The fellows are doing a war dance around when Dick reports that the girls are coming . They start rushing about the room , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Billy snatches a pair of trousers from a couch and throws them through a doorway . The champagne empties and poker chips are sequestered , and at the last instant Billy snatches down a number of brightly colored ladies ' stockings from a curtain pole just before the entrance of Mrs. Nelson , Dorothy Nelson , Molly Livingston , and three or four other girls . Dick is soon talking to Dorothy about the game . DOROTHY We 're going to be in the front row of the centre section , but I suppose you wo n't be able to see us. p. 3 DICK No , but we 'll know you 're there , and it 'll make us play harder . It means a good deal to a fellow to have the right girl watching the game . DOROTHY And will the " right girl " be there , Dick ? DICK Yes . She 'll be sitting in the front row of the centre section . You know who it is Dorothy . I want to win for you . DOROTHY Why , Dick , how serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , but sometimes the big things of life get mixed up in a game , so that if you lose , you lose everything . DOROTHY You 're getting morbid , Dick . It 's no disgrace to lose.Most of the others are in higher spirits . Molly is appointed a coach , the men give her a cheer and sing the Faculty Song : In Heaven above where all is love , The Faculty wo n't be there. But down below , where all is woe , The Faculty will be there . Singing , C-O-L-U-M-B-I-A , C-O-L-U-M-B-I-A , C-O-L-U-M-B-I-A , Ray , ray , ray for old Columbia , Cheer , now , boys , she 's out of sight ; Ere the sun has sunk to rest in the cradle of the WestIn the clouds will proudly float the Blue and White ! At the end of song dog is heard howling dismally . Dorothy has heard that Strongheart will be in condition to play in the coming game , and tells Strongheart that Frank says it means they will win . She wants him to win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DOROTHY Well , for me , too , if you wish . STRONGHEART Then I will play as I never played before for Columbia , and for you . It will be my last game . DOROTHY Your last game ? STRONGHEART Yes . I have received another letter from my people . They are waiting for me to come back to them . DOROTHY But you 're not going yet ? STRONGHEART No , not yet . But my college life will soon be over , and then I wish to do for them all the things we have planned out together . Miss Nelson , you do not realize what you have been to me during this past year . DOROTHY sitting in chair R. of desk . Have I really then been of any help to you ? STRONGHEART You have given me more than help , for you showed me my duty to my people . You made me know that the son of a chief must fit himself to govern wisely . DOROTHY I did want to help a little . It is so seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals . And your position gives you a great opportunity . STRONGHEART It is you who showed me that . You told me of the advantages civilization would bring to my people . That when we had learned your ways and obeyed your laws you would call us brothers . From that day my one thought , my one ambition has been that your words might come true . Your people and mine dwelling together in peace . It is for that I am working , and you showed me the way . p. 5 DOROTHY You give me credit I do not deserve . You have worked alone  --  rises  --  and I want you to know , Strongheart , that for what you have done I admire and respect you . STRONGHEART much moved , but impassive . Miss Nelson . what you think of my work means very much to me , you have made me very happy.Investigation is made to see whether Billy 's dog , Siegfried , shut in the next room , has committed suicide upon hearing his master sing , but it appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings off a guitar . Strongheart thinks that Billy , having given the dog such a name , should not blame him for having a taste for music . BILLY crossing to upper end of couch . Now will you answer my question ? MOLLY What question ? BILLY pointing to L. 3 . The one I asked you in there . MOLLY Well , if you really want me to believe that I 'm the only girl you ever cared anything about , you 've got to do something to prove it . BILLY sits . Yes , but gee whiz , a fellow ca n't do anything heroic nowadays without getting pinched . Now , if you and I 'd only lived about ' steen hundred years ago . p. 6 MOLLY Yes , and what would you have done , brave Sir Billy ? BILLY perfectly simply . Oh , the usual stunts . I 'd have browsed around on a nickel-plated plug until I got up against some gazabo that thought his lady fair was the whole cheese . Then I 'd tell him he had bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty fine line of ladies fair myself . Then I 'd put him out of business just to show him that my lady fair was the main squeeze . MOLLY Say , Mr. Saunders , you 're awfully romantic , are n't you ? BILLY Yes , I guess I am , now . But before I met you I was several chips shy on romance . Say , I know what I can do . Rises , backs to C.If you want me to , I 'll try and kill the other centre for you next Thursday . MOLLY rising and crossing to him . Oh , no , do n't kill him on my account . Rises and crosses . I 'll tell you what you can do . Give me something that means a great deal to you . Something you 've sworn you 'd never part with . BILLY pulls out his watch and offers it . Some girl 's picture or something . During this speech BILLY feels his scarfpin and ring . BILLY Why , I never was much of a lady 's man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only thing I have n't got the right to give away . You see no girl ever thought enough of me to give me anything of her own . He has had his hands in his pockets during this speech . Now pulls out his right hand with the stockings in it and wipes his forehead . Sees what he has and quickly passes them behind his back to L. pocket . Then takes out signals from inside pocket . I suppose these signals might do , because if any one knows that I let them go out of my hands , well , it would be down and out for mine . p. 7 MOLLY delighted . Oh , then I 'll hold you in my power , wo n't I ? Strongheart has noticed that Dick seems troubled , and when they are alone he asks him what the matter is . Dick tells him that he has contracted debts that he has no means of paying . He has come to care a good deal for a girl lately and on that account has been keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach that he was trained too fine , Dick had a few drinks . Then somehow he got into Thorne 's room where a crowd were playing poker . He was just drunk enough not to know what he was doing , but not enough to show it . When he got through he had lost three thousand dollars . Then Thorne persuaded him to borrow that much more from him and back Columbia in the hope of winning it all back again . STRONGHEART So you are six thousand short . DICK Yes . And more than that depends on the game . STRONGHEART More ? DICK Yes , if we lose I must leave college and will have no right to speak to  --  Hesitates . STRONGHEART To whom , Dick ? DICK I wo n't name her now , not even to you . But it 's the girl I  --   --  STRONGHEART The girl , Dick ? p. 8 DICK Yes . I 'd be disgraced in her eyes . STRONGHEART Why did not you tell me of this before ? DICK You have n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point . There is some combination here I do not quite see through . There must be something in it for Thorne . DICK Thorne ? STRONGHEART Yes . Thorne saw you were not yourself , and then won your money . Thorne lent you more . Thorne got you to bet . I do not like the looks of it . DICK But what has he against me ? STRONGHEART I do not know . But I will find out . Rises and takes DICK by the arms . Look here , old man , you are the only hope we have got in Thursday 's game . Now you think football , talk football , eat football , and dream football , and I will just take a hand in this other business myself . DICK No , it 's a bad mess , Strongheart . You 'd better keep out of it . Students are heard singing " Amici . " STRONGHEART pointing L. 3 . Dick , do you hear what they are singing in here ? " Friends until death . " That is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you ? p. 9 DICK very firmly . Yes . STRONGHEART Then fight for " her , " Dick , and whatever comes we will face it together.The quarters of the Columbia team at the Polo Grounds is a large , dingy , whitewashed room with rows of lockers against the walls , benches and a supply of water bottles , sponges , buckets , towels , blankets , and sweaters lying about . The room is deserted , for the game is going on outside . The crowd can be heard singing a Columbia football song and then giving a yell.Nash , one of the team , is brought in disabled and protesting obstinately against leaving the game . Prolonged cheers mark the conclusions of the first half of the game during which neither side has scored.Frank , Dick , Thorne , Billy , and Strongheart come in , followed by fifteen or more men of the team and substitutes , and also rubbers . The men who have been playing are plastered with mud . The rubbers sponge off their faces , and the trainers look them over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and strides toward the men with a look of the deepest scorn and contempt . " Athletes , my eye ! " says he . " Do you think you can make athletes out of a bunch of cigarette smoking cock-tail drinking idiots ? " BUCKLEY Well , you 're a pretty fine lot of football men , you are . You ought to be out somewhere playing ping pong . Do you men realize that the eyes of the University are on you ? That if you lose this game you 're a disgraced team without a single damn chance to redeem yourselves ? I never saw a team play such a silly game way up in the air , high as hell all the time . Ross , come over here . You play tackle next half . Ross crosses to lower end of bench L.Thorne , you 've got to keep low . You missed your tackle twice . Now if you do that again , you come off this team . Three times they got through you , and the second time the whole damn line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whip it up . Get down that field and be waiting for the ball and when the man catches it kill him , down hard in his tracks . Frank  --  FRANK crosses down to him  --  keep closer on defence , keep your eye on that ball and fight for every drop there is in you . FRANK goes back up stage . BUCKLEY turns to team . For Heaven help this aggregation if you lose . Livingston , do n't get penalized : you 've cost the team twenty yards to-day . And you backs , do n't get fooled ; if a play do n't smell good to you , keep out of it till you see where the ball 's going . Saunders , fight , fight  --  you 're a good centre but you 're too pacific . Do n't be so damned polite . Get into the other man and kill him . Get mad , damn it all , get mad . O  --  O  --  O  --  I do n't seem to be able to talk a spirit of fight into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're playing football , so fight for it every inch of the game . If you do we can pull it through . No one scored last half , so they think they can win . But they ca n't if you 'll only show you 're true blue and smash it in . You men have been relying too much on Strongheart and Dick , but they ca n't play the whole game by themselves . Break up their interference and kill the ends . Why , you have n't put a single end out of business to-day . Now when you go out on that field you win this game . It 's going to be hard as hell but you can do it . And remember that you 're representing your University , and you 've got to win this game if it kills the whole damn team ! That 's all . p. 10 He turns from men who begin to talk in low tones among themselves , objecting to being roasted so unmercifully when they have put up a very stiff game , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , comes to the door and asks for the captain . Frank goes to meet him . FARLEY Yes , Nelson . I tried to see you before the first half , but could not get at you . I came on rather a disagreeable errand , so I 'd better come right to the point . FRANK , BUCKLEY , and FARLEY stand together during this scene extreme R.There 's a man somewhere in Columbia football affairs that ought to be kicked out . FRANK What do you mean ? FARLEY I mean that a complete list of your signals came to me by mail yesterday . FRANK Why , it 's impossible . What motive could make one of our men betray his team ? I ca n't believe it . FARLEY Well , I 've heard from a reliable source that some Columbia man has been backing our team heavily . I suppose it was the same man who sent us the signals , and thought you might like to know about it . FRANK Then you knew our signals during the first half ? FARLEY Hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Not one of my team has seen this list except myself . Takes it out of pocket . We 'll try to win this game without any help from Columbia . I give you my word of honor that I myself have not read this list . p. 11 FRANK I beg your pardon , Farley , I was too quick . Your word is quite sufficient . Extends his hand , FARLEY takes it . FARLEY Well , I wo n't keep you any longer . I 've only done what I thought was the square thing in bringing this back . Hands FRANK the envelope . Now , it 's up to you . I 'll see you later . He goes out in a dead silence . As soon as he is off Frank turns to team , mad . FRANK Boys , some member of this squad is no Columbia man , and has got to be kicked off this team before next half . Holds up list . Our signals have been sent to Farley . ALL THE MEN rising . What ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not open the list . He hands it to Strongheart . Upon seeing the writing Strongheart starts and puts the list behind him . He suggests waiting till after the game , but Thorne thrusts himself forward and insists upon airing the affair at once . He says that it concerns the whole team and that the whole team should deal with it . Dick supports him , declaring that a man who would do such a thing deserves no consideration . THORNE If you do n't it will look as if you had reasons for concealing it . p. 12 STRONGHEART What do you mean , Thorne ? THORNE It will look as if the writing were your own . STRONGHEART Thorne ! Makes a move toward THORNE , DICK holds him . THORNE Show me the list and if I 'm wrong I 'll apologize . I 've got nothing against you personally , but I want to see the man who wrote that kicked off the team . BILLY down L.. Boys , you know Strongheart . If he 's got a reason for not showing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . I say we leave it until then . The extra men should be divided into several squads of two or three men . Each squad with different lines . All the Men No ! no . Show it to us now . STRONGHEART to DICK . You do not doubt me , Dick ? DICK Old man , if the signals had been in my writing , would you have doubted me ? STRONGHEART firmly . No , Dick , I would not . FRANK to STRONG . I do n't doubt you either , old man , but we must make some explanation to the team . Come , out with it . p. 13 STRONGHEART I have no explanation to offer . To team . But , boys , I give you my word of honor  --   --  THORNE It is your honor that is in question . STRONGHEART I shall not answer for it to you , Thorne . FRANK Thorne , the team has elected officers to manage its affairs , and we do n't care for your help . THORNE Then , why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian come here out of a wigwam and run things to suit himself . All of the men demand to see the list . Frank tells them to meet at his house the next day to discuss it . The men are willing to agree to this if Strongheart shows the list to some one man who can identify it afterward . Strongheart shows it to Billy , who recognizes Dick 's writing and thinks that the list is the one which he gave to Molly Livingston . Meanwhile Frank and Buckley have decided that Strongheart must be taken out of the game as the men believe that he has sold them out . During the second half Strongheart watches the game from the window and describes the plays to Nash , who is extended on a bench . First the Columbia team are driven back . Thorne misses a tackle . Finally Columbia holds on her fifteen-yard line . A trick play is tried and Dick Livingston goes through the line and down the field . He is tackled at the goal line , but Billy drags him over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drown the racket outside with a mighty yell led by the coach . There is a dance in the evening after the game at the Nelsons ' home to celebrate the victory . When Molly gets a chance to speak to Dorothy privately in the library she assures her that any one who is half feminine could see that Strongheart has been head over heels in love with her for a year . DOROTHY Molly , if I ask you a question , will you be serious . p. 14 MOLLY As serious as I can be . DOROTHY Then , tell me , if he were in love with you , and asked you to marry him , what would you do ? MOLLY Am I supposed to be in love with him ? DOROTHY Perhaps . MOLLY Well , if I were in love with him , and he proposed to me , I 'd say yes before he 'd finished asking me . DOROTHY But , his race . Molly rising and stepping back . Dorothy Nelson , do you mean to tell me that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any difference ? DOROTHY But , what would mother and Frank say ? MOLLY Oh , they might be a little startled at first , but they 'd soon get used to it . Crossing to chair . Why , do you love him , Dorothy ? DOROTHY rising . Oh , I do n't believe it 's love , it 's just fascination , and yet if it were love , I  --   --  Turns to MOLLY . Oh , Molly , it 's terrible to be afraid of love . MOLLY Dorothy ! DOROTHY This has been growing on me for a year . I 've fought it and fought it , but I ca n't put it away . Crosses to R.I 'm afraid of it , Molly , I 'm afraid . Turns to MOLLY . Oh , it ca n't be love if I have that feeling . And yet , there 's something about him that makes all the others seem small . A great purpose , and absolute truth in his eyes . Crosses to MOLLY . Oh , Molly , what am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy , when he speaks to you , never mind reasons , just say to him whatever your heart tells you to say . DOROTHY kissing her . Thank you . They go out to dance , and Billy comes in with Dick . Billy says there has been a mix-up , but that he can not speak plainly as Dick is her brother . Billy starts off again to find Strongheart . Dick has made up his mind to propose to Dorothy that evening and is assured of Frank 's approval and hearty support . Strongheart sits out a dance with Dorothy and asks her to sit in front of the fire so that the firelight will fall upon her face as it did once long ago . DOROTHY That night of our first camp ? STRONGHEART Yes . DOROTHY How frightened I was at the cry of the mountain lion . STRONGHEART It did not show in your face , and your hand was as steady as my own . Crossing above her . There now , you look as you did then . The night that began my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had no walls then to keep the moonlight out , and no lamps to drown the firelight . DOROTHY We do not have such nights here . p. 16 STRONGHEART You have them , but you do not use them . See ? Crosses to button above fireplace and touches it . All the lights but table lamp go out . Is not this better ? DOROTHY Yes . Leaning toward fire . Now , I can see the figures we traced that night in the fire . STRONGHEART Do you remember what they were pictures of ? DOROTHY nods her head . You were telling me the love stories of your people , and showing me each scene in the embers . And I was telling you how different it is with us in the East . STRONGHEART But we decided that , after all , love is love , whether it be in the East or in the West . Kneels in front of fire . DOROTHY But since then surely you have shown the pictures in the fire to some one else . STRONGHEART I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show them to another . DOROTHY Somehow , whenever I am tired of the noise and rush of all this , I think of those great , silent mountains , smiling up at the sun , or showing to the dark , gray clouds a face as stern and grim as their own , but always peaceful . p. 17 STRONGHEART You do not belong shut between four walls . You have the spirit of the forest . The voice of the stream tells the same story to you as to me . You understand the message the wind bears when it comes fresh and cool from the snows above . DOROTHY Then I want to forget the nothings that form our life here and go out there  --  alone . STRONGHEART Not alone . There is always one in whose company the sunshine is brighter , the wind softer , and the peace greater ?

DOROTHY Your love ? STRONGHEART And now I tell you of it , because it is you I love . I have waited for two years to tell you . From the moment you came into my life I knew that your love was the only thing in the world worth having . I am ambitious , I wish to raise my people , but even that seems small compared with the giant love you have awakened . DOROTHY You love me ? STRONGHEART The thought of you has guided me and has been my strength . And now I speak your tongue , I think your thoughts , and I love you with a love as great as my mountains and as pure as the air about them . Give me the right to tell you more of that love . p. 18 DOROTHY You love me ? STRONGHEART If I am not what you would have me , let me go on working . Only tell me that it is for you . DOROTHY Strongheart , I  --   --  Rises and crosses to C.I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . STRONGHEART crossing to her . I will wait . You must be sure , for on your answer hangs the happiness of my life , and , I hope , of yours . DOROTHY turning to him . Come for your answer to-morrow . Billy and Molly are the next to take advantage of the tete-a-tete corner . BILLY You know I told you if you lost those signals , it would be down and out for mine ? MOLLY putting her hand to bodice where signals are . If I lost the signals ? BILLY Yes , I say " lost " because it 's the kindest word to use . MOLLY rising . Mr. Saunders , I do n't understand a word you 're saying , but I gather from your tone that you mean it to be rude . BILLY No , I 'm trying to put it gently , that is all . p. 19 MOLLY Put what gently ? BILLY You might have known you 'd have been found out . MOLLY crossing to chair in front of fire , sits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll tell me what you 're talking about . BILLY Well , it 's just this . You sent those signals I gave you to Farley . MOLLY rising , amazed , facing him . What ? BILLY There 's only one thing can make a woman act that way , and that 's  --  you know . Crosses to C.Why did n't you do the square thing by me and tell me he was it ? MOLLY going up toward R. 3 . I have nothing to say to you , Mr. Saunders . BILLY Then you might as well know the rest . MOLLY stops and turns to him . One of the team is going to be disgraced to-morrow on your account . MOLLY crossing down . Why should he , if I am the criminal ? BILLY Because a man would rather be knocked out himself than give away a woman . p. 20 MOLLY coming to him  --  starting to cry . Why did you give them to me if you could n't trust me ? BILLY backing away . I did trust you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excusing myself , but you have queered an innocent man 's life , and you 've knocked out my faith in womanhood all right . Good-bye . MOLLY taking a step after him . What are you going to do ? BILLY turning to her . There 's nothing to be done . Strongheart has made me promise to keep my face shut . Oh , it 's only another poor fool added to the list of the men who have trusted women . He leaves her abruptly . She starts after him with hands outstretched and then sinks in a chair and begins to cry . Strongheart finds her sobbing and draws out the story of her trouble . She is afraid that Billy is going to be disgraced for having given her the signals , but she has not lost them at all . She gives them to Strongheart . He can assure her that no disgrace will come to Billy , or to any innocent man , and wants to send Billy to her . She declares that she will never speak to him again . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Dick 's room and had a chance to exchange the list of signals that Dick wrote for another , and in order to get a sample of Thorne 's handwriting he has Billy dictate a telegram to Thorne , his own hand being disabled . Armed with this document , Strongheart confronts Thorne . He shows him first the list of signals that he got from Molly and asks if they are not in his handwriting . Thorne starts slightly upon seeing the list , but denies flatly that he wrote it . STRONGHEART Do not lie to me , Thorne , it will not help you now . p. 21 THORNE indifferently . Oh , you seem to think it is in my writing . Crosses to R. C.Well , it 's really of very little importance to me what you think . STRONGHEART It may become of more importance when I give these two papers to the meeting to-morrow ? THORNE sharply , turning . What two papers ? STRONGHEART This list of signals and this telegram which three people saw you write , and which contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and half . The words are identical with those in the list , and prove the two papers to have been written by the same hand . Thorne , you sent Dick 's list to Farley , and I can prove it . THORNE turns , throws his cigar in fire , and makes a start for STRONG . STRONG stops him with his voice . So , I tell you now , that to-morrow afternoon I shall show the team that you are a blackguard . THORNE crossing to him . Look here , you 're interfering too much in my affairs . If you give me away I 'll show Frank and Dick how you have betrayed their confidence . STRONGHEART In what way ? THORNE By making love to Frank 's sister . p. 22 STRONGHEART We will not use a lady 's name in this discussion . THORNE Well , whether we use her name or not , you know I 'm right . I 've watched you . STRONGHEART Well ? THORNE If you clear Dick 's name to-morrow , you help your rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't make me believe you did n't know that . STRONGHEART If Dick is the man she loves , she will choose him . THORNE But if you are the man she loves , they will prevent you marrying her . STRONGHEART Why ? THORNE Because you are an Indian ! STRONGHEART moves a step to the L. , thinking this remark absurd . If those boys knew you 'd made love to her , they 'd kick you out of this house . STRONGHEART facing THORNE . You lie ! THORNE You think they are your friends ? Points to window . Stand behind that curtain and see what they will do when I tell them . STRONGHEART going to him . Thorne , you are a coward . p. 23 THORNE It is you who are afraid , because you know in your heart that what I say is true . STRONGHEART We shall see . Strongheart calls Frank and Dick . He tells them that he has been charged with betraying Frank 's confidence by loving his sister , but that he has loved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs of Frank 's people . If she will accept his love he will ask Frank 's consent . DICK You have dared to make love to her ? STRONGHEART Why should I not ? DICK Because you are an Indian . THORNE You see ? FRANK Strongheart , you are one of the finest men I know , but you are not one of us . STRONGHEART Neither is a European , yet you would give your sister to one of them . FRANK It is not the same thing . STRONGHEART No , I have a greater claim . I am the American . I speak your tongue , I obey your law , I have lived with you , slept with you , eaten from the same dish , and yet I am not one of you . DICK You are not one of us in race ! We trusted you with our women , but when you spoke your love you betrayed that trust . You  --   --  p. 24 FRANK Wait , Dick . Not so fast . STRONGHEART No , let him speak . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , there was no question of race . I have the same education as you , the same customs , the same feelings . DICK Still , you are an Indian !

FRANK Strongheart ! DICK Dorothy ! STRONGHEART I will come for my answer to-morrow . It is an embarrassing moment for Billy the next afternoon when he meets Molly in the Nelsons ' library . He begs her pardon humbly , stating his conviction that he is an ass . She tells him it is not an easy thing to forgive being called a traitor to your team . He is well aware of that , and assures her that if any other chap had said as much to her he , Billy , would have done a two step on that chap 's solar plexus . MOLLY not turning to him . But why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent those signals ? BILLY Maybe it was because I have n't been thinking of any one except you for months . Why , things got so bad that I used to have nightmares and dream about you . MOLLY moves a step to the R. , laughing quietly . Do n't laugh , I really mean it . And unless you forgive me now , I 'll do something desperate . MOLLY slowly . Well , if you 're really very sorry , I suppose I 'll have to forgive you this time . p. 28 BILLY You will ? Extends his hand . MOLLY Yes ! Turns to him quickly and takes his hand and gives it a strong shake , causing him to make a grimace of pain . Oh , I forgot your arm . I 'm afraid I hurt you .

As they embrace Dick enters . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a low scream and runs out . Billy looks after her and then turns and sees Dick . He gives a start of surprise and tries to cover his confusion with talk . Dick is too old a chum to be put off with inconsequential chatter , so Billy says " it 's all fixed . " A further question making him realize that he has not asked Molly to be his wife , he goes after her on the run . The team now assemble to face the disagreeable task of trying to find out who sent the signals to their opponents . THORNE Then , first , we must know in whose handwriting the list was . p. 29 TAYLOR Strongheart 's . ONE OF THE MEN The Indian 's . DICK No , boys . Frank has the list and the writing 's mine .

Strongheart counsels them to let the culprit go , as he can never show his face in college again . The men step back and Thorne goes out slowly . When the men have left Dick begs Strongheart 's pardon for what he said the night before . Yet he will not take it all back . Something stronger than either of them has come between them ; they can not be friends . In telling Billy of Dick 's words , Strongheart says the knife of prejudice has cut the ties of friendship .
