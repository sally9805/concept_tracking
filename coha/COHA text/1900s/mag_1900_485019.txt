RESTORATION OF AN OPPOSITION . The question of reorganizing the Democratic party is now under discussion in the press and otherwise , and is naturally exciting much interest in both political parties , and perhaps even more among Independents . The Eve-zing Post published on Thursday an importalit interview With ex-Secretary Carlisle on this subject , which is entitled to great weight , both from its contents and from the authority of the speaker . Mr. Carlisle , having held the highest offices in the gift of his party short of the Presidency , and having definitively retired from politics , can always command public attention for anything he may say . It is his opinion that whether the party is to be reorganized or not depends almost wholly on the Southern membership . They gave all the electoral votes that Mr. Bryan received except those of four small Rocky Mountain States which have large silver-mining interests . Yet the South itself has no such interests . Her interests are those which she holds in common with the North . They embrace , says Mr. Carlisle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservation of law and order , and the independence and authority of the judiciary " Reorganization , in his opinion , means the return of the party to these principles . The rest will follow naturally , and it makes no difference whether the conservative movement begins in the South or in the North In this he is quite right . There is one reason , however , for its beginning in the South , apart from the fact that the South furnishes all but a mere fraction of the Democratic party 's electoral votes . It is that the South contains nearly all the party leaders who have not been either ruled out for irregularity , or lost sight of by long exclusion from office . In the former category are those who opposed Mr. Bryan in one or both of the campaigns in which he was the party 's nominee . In the latter is a long list of able men in the North who have been gradually forgotten through retirement from public life , either enforced or voluntary . The South has plenty of men who are qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are now Congressmen , or Governors of States , or leading journalists , or otherwise in the forefront of political life , and who have sufficient following to give them confidence in taking any step that commends itself to their judgment . It is an instructive coincidence that a triumphant Conservative party in England should be deploring the weakness of its Liberal opponents , at the very moa ment that a victorious Republican party in the United States is hoping that the Democrats will somehow pull themselves together and constitute an effective op position party . At first sight this seems too altruistically good to be true . The object of parties being to win political power , one would think that the feebleness of an antagonist would be a cause of rejoicing instead of dismay . The weaker and more divided your rivals , the easier and more secure your accession to power . , Why should the Tories urge the Liberals to take up Rosebery , or some other hopeful leader , and make a better fight of it ? Do they want to be beaten next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to rid itself of the fatal burden of Bryanism . Why so , if Bryanism spells defeat ? Why not resort to every trick in order to induce the Democrats to make Bryan their perpetual candidate , and so go to perpetual-disaster ? We may be sure that it is not political unselfishness which dictates this attitude in either England or this country . It is , rather , enlightened selfishness that leads the party in power to desire a strong party in Opposition . We will not stop now to consider the patriotic-motive . On broad grounds of the good of the nation it is , of course , a misfortune , under a system of party government , when one party becomes so imbecile or dangerous that it can not seriously be thought of as an alternative to the other . We do not doubt that many Republicans put the matter in this large way , but more of them face the question on sheer partisan grounds . They see , somewhat vaguely perhaps , yet with a sure and sound instinct , that it is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the field ; and so , purely as good Republicans , they would like to see the Democrats in better fighting trim . The real reason they may never state to themselves clearly ; but a little reflection will show why it is that it is well for the party in power , as it is for the country at large , to have a strong Opposition Parties , like men , have to distrust their own virtue . Party nature , like human nature , is prone to do evil . It needs to keep itself under restraint . Confronting pleasant vices , it needs to have before its gaze their sure penalties Now an alert and vigorous opposition party is like law and policeman and prison to warn the party in power of the certain end of the political transgressor . Remove all fear of punishment , and the impetus of partisan feeling , the plotting of bosses , the ravaging of the spoilsman and the corruptionist , will have fearfully free swing . The party will soon cease to be astonished at its own moderation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and landmarks will be swept away , and an acceleration of folly will mark the course and policy of the leaders . The thing will go on until even the evil Opposition appears the lesser evil . This it is which thoughtful Republicans fear for their own party unless it is sobered and made cautious by the revival of a respectable and trustworthy Democracy . There is more in it than this . The practical ongoing , as well as the life and morality of a party , depends very much on the vigor and intelligence of the Opposition . If a Ministry , if a party-caucus , knows that it has a " fine brute majority " to apply to the passage of any given measure , and that the opposing party is too spiritless to make a good fight , and too much distrusted to gain the confidence of the country , no matter what it may do , the natural result is to make legislation shiftless and ill-considered . Bills are too little studied before they are introduced ; are too languidly debated ; flounder on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn in confusion an the tardy discovery that they are big with mischief to the party . We had vivid illustrations of this evil in the last Congress . The Shipping-Subsidy Bill , the Philippine resolutions , the Nicaragua Canal Bill , were all loosely drawn , badly defended , radically amended , finally buffeted about , and either recalled entirely or left hanging between heaven and earth . Their failure was the failure , in so far , of the Republican party  --  a proof of its ineptitude in public business . It is safe to say that no such slipshod and humiliating attempts to legislate would have been made had the Republican leaders been confronted by an able and eager and united Democracy . Congressman Catchings of Mississippi has clearly and sensibly indicated the lines along which the Democratic party must move if it is to bring about a restoration of an American Opposition . The fads and freaks with which the Party has been burdened for seven years past must be flung overboard , he says , and Democrats found who are able and willing to step forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of republican government . The real battles of the next few years will certainly be fought in connection with these questions , and the sooner the Democracy finds men competent to lead it there , the sooner will it be ready to discharge the historical function of an opposition party , and , ultimately , to assume power , after having deserved and won it . THE NEW GOLD STANDARD ACT . The President of the Chamber of Commerce performed an agreeable duty last , week when he presented to Mr. H. H. Hanna of Indianapolis a medal expressing the appreciation which the chief commercial body of this city feels for his services in behalf of true financial principles and legislation . Mr. Hanna 's work has been described so often in our columns that a recurrence to it would be superfluous . It may be interesting , however , to note the great change that has come over the country since the Indianapolis movement took its start in November , 1896 The Presidential campaign of that year had just ended . The Republican party had been brought with fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified and diluted with the hope of international bimetallism . It had won its victory on that issue , but the popular majority was not large , being a trifle more than 600,000 votes in a total of nearly 14,000,000 . The Republican politicians were strongly inclined to " let well alone " ? that is , to do nothing to secure the substantial fruits of victory ty new legislation . A concession was made to the defeated silverites by sending another futile commission to En-rape to talk up bimetallism , but in political circles no steps were thought of to strengthen the gold standard , although that had been the real issue of the campaign . At this point the Indianapolis Convention put a spur in the side of Congress , and compelled the politicians to do their duty , or rather a part of their duty , for they have not done the whole of it yet . The contrast between the recent Presidential campaign and that of 1896 lies in the fact that , whereas it was extremely difficult to make the Republicans face the gold standard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else in the latter . In bringing about this change of tone and temper the Indianapolis movement was largely instrumental , and Mr. H. II . Hanna is properly recognized as its head by our leading commercial organization . We have adverted in former articles to the need of further legislation to complete the work so happily begun , and it is fitting that Mr. Hanna should ' take the lead in this also , and that he should receive the encouragement of the Chamber of Commerce in so doing . Although all the money issued or coined by the United States is at par with gold , we are still , like France and Germany , on the " limping standard . " We have a vast circulation of silver certificates and silver dollars which otherwise . Germany has lately taken a step to clear off the haze from her financial horizon by calling in the outstanding thalers which are full legal tender , and turning them into subsidiary coins of limited legal tender ? a process which will extend over ten years . At the end of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gold standard as surely and safely as England is . Her banks can now tender silver to their customers when they ask for gold , as the Bank of France can and does occasionally . When this last measure is carried into effect the only full legal-tender money in Germany will be gold , or Government notes redeemable in gold . Our own situation can not be mended in that way , because the silver currency is too large in amount to be utilized in the form of subsidiary coin . It is , or will be , when all the Treasury bullion is coined , nearly $600,000,000 . This " fiat silver " ought to be protected just as surely as the Government 's fiat paper is protected  --  that is , by redeemability in gold . The law of March 14 , 1900 , commands the Secretary of the Treasury to keep the silver dollars at par with gold , but does not give him the means to execute the command . Secretary Gage thinks that there is an in- direct and roundabout method by which gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of need , but another Secretary might not construe the law in the same way . It may be argued with considerable force , also , in opposition to Secretary Gage , that since Congress rejected a clause which provided for direct redeemability of the silver dollar , it could not have intended to provide for this indirectly . However that may be , there is a doubt still threatening a large part of our currency , quite need= lessly , too , since the country is rich enough to make the necessary provision for every contingency , and since a single line of amendment to the present law would accomplish the end in view . A very few words which were embraced in the bill that passed the House , but were subsequently dropped by the Conference Committee , would remove every doubt , would take us off the limping standard , and make the gold standard as secure in our statutes as it is in those of England . If the thought flits through the mind of any Republican politician that it will lie possible to snatch another vic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be dismissed at once . The Democratic party can not make the same blunder a third time Time will pass its sponge over that political issue before people begin to think of 1904 , or even of the control of Congress two years hence . The end which should be aimed at now is to put the standard of value quite out of sight as a subject of dispute , so that people shall not think of it hereafter any more than they think of the air they breathe . A Washington dispatch says that the President will insert in his coming message a recommendation that the Gold Standard Act of March 14 , 1900 , be amended in such a manner as to cure any shortcomings that may exist in it . The particular defect to be cured is that we have just pointed out . MARK TWAIN , AMERICAN CITIZEN . Since the return of Mr. Clemens to his native land , he has been giving his countrymen some very valuable instruction in civics . Bettering the univer sity extension lecturer in that kind , he has supplemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small overcharge by a cabman , and securing suspension of the offender 's license , was a lessen in public duty which Americans need to take to heart above all men . " Grumthe , but pay ; pay and avoid a row ; submit and keep out of the newspapers " ? these are the maxims upon which the lords of all creation act when confronted with cheating tradesmen , extortionate hackmen , thieving officials . Mark Twain has shown us a more excellent way , greatly to find quarrel in a straw when private honor or public decency is at stake . He really struck at the root " - Of our chief city abuses . If citizens of New York had pluck enough to fight Croker and Platt instead of submitting to blackmail , we should he much nearer getting rid of our pair of bosses . All this has been pretty generally commented upon in the newspapers ; but what they have not directed attention to is Mark Twain 's bold utterance as respects the larger matters of our national policy . No sooner had he landed than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An old-fashioned American , he did not conceal his disgust for the tawdry and borrowed robes in which his country had suddenly taken to flaunting . His testimony was the more valuable - on this point , in that he was one of the Americans who have been living abroad during the transition of their nation from swaddling bands to purple mantle and crown , and who are reported to be delighted beyond words at the new and true grandeur of the United States . But Mr. Clemens , with his fatal eye for folly and humbug , has seen the thing as the vulgar hypocrisy it is . He had enjoyed the European perspective , but he had not lost his American keenness of vision , and he was not afraid to say what he saw . He even refused to fall down and worship Roosevelt  --  actually made fun of that solemn man ! A dear old lady in New England was lamenting , the other day , the departure of her country from the traditions in which she had been reared . This seizure of the Philippines , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn and slaughter ? " it all seems very strange to me , " she said plaintively , but then added piously , " Well , I suppose the Lord wants us to do good in that way now . " Mr. Twain , however , suspects that the devil had more to do with it . As a matter of fact , it is always Satan who takes man or nation up into a high mountain to promise all the kingdoms of the world and the glary of them on the simple and easy condition of devil-worship . Mr. Clemens has also spoken brave and true words about the duty of this country to China , Using his privilege of humorous exaggeration  --  quantquam ridentem &were; verum  --  he has expressed his sympathy with the Boxers , and his hope that they will succeed in driving out the foreigners who are invading their land . " In America I am a Boxer , " he said , " and why should I not he if I lived in China ? " There is really no answer to this . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest without at once renouncing the principles on which his country was built . Mark Twain , for his part . will not be caught " kneelin ' with the rest . " His Americanism is too deeply bred in the bone , has been too long and consistently maintained by him in all quarters of the globe , to be flung aside now as if it were an old coat . Mark Twain , American citizen , remains what he was , a homely and vigorous republican , let who will trick themselves out in the gauds and paste jewels of Imperialism . There is the more reason to be grateful to him for what he has said about all these matters with so much courage and so much point , in the very fact that he is a man of letters . Ordinarily literary men are as timid as hares in all public concerns Huxley spoke of the immense risk which a writer ran in taking an unpopular position , and thought it greater than that of a man of science . Any one can see how natural it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who flatter a People to the top of its bent . Popular support being the vital breath of literature as at present conducted , a literary man is always to be looked for at the shrine of the God of Things as They Are . He has to find the poetry and the rhetoric in praise of a nation 's action when it is bitten by the military mad dog , just as college presidents and bishops have to find the moral and religious justifications for it . The reason is the same in all cases  --  the people hold the purse-strings , and will not loosen them to buy books , endow chairs , or build cathedrals unless solicited thereto by ye , rsonce gratte . Like M. Jourdain , the public has its discernment in its purse ; has poor taste , but pays well ; and the man of letters , who " has to live , " knows where his suit must be paid . But Mr. Clemens has asserted an honorable dis tinction for himself in refusing to join the writers who pet and humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his assured position to speak words of truth and soberness to his fellow-countrymen , placing the obligations of the citizen above the amiabilities of the man of letters . This puts him as much morally above the mob of literary time-servers as his writings place him artistically.
