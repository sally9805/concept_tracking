txt WOMAN SUFFRAGE . I was very much surprised , on visiting the Polo Grounds for the first time this season , to find that , in spite of the increased seating capacity of the grounds , the means of egress , instead of being increased . have been very much diminished . It was always difficult enough to get out of the grounds after the game was over , but now the difficulties have been Intensified . , The most serious aspect of the situation is the possibility of fire or of some accident causing e. stampede . The loss of life from such an event would be appalling . The grounds are so fenced and wired in that escape would be impossible , except for the very few who. were seated near the entrance , and the rest would perish In a veritable death trap . What Is the matter with the Building Inspectors who Allowed the alterations to be made in the Polo Grounds without paying attention to the exits ?               @ @ @ @ @ @
