 | THE lumbering industry is so intimately connected with all of the various industrial pursuits of modern life that it holds a most important position in the economic policy of the country . For many years the timber supply of the world has been drawn on at a rate which bids fair to exhaust it within a hundred years . This condition has caused serious apprehension in the minds of those men whose attention is given to the problems of the future . The Agricultural Department has recently established a Bureau of Forestry , with a view to the creation of forest reserves in various portions of the country , and to the problem of restocking the exhausted forest lands . The man who ceases to live on the interest of his capital and encroaches upon it , gradually reducing it year by year without adding to it , is considered by sound-minded people as a fool and a spendthrift . Such is the policy with which we have treated our forests . Year after year we have cut far more timber than could be replaced , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destitute of forests at the close of the present century . France , Germany , Belgium , and England are all obliged to import more than half of the wood used in their confines . Austria-Hungary , Russia , and the United States and Canada are the only countries which to-day export any appreciable amount of lumber . In the United States the heart of the lumber belt has moved westward . At the beginning of the last century almost the entire wood supply came from the then untouched forests of the Penobscot River region of Maine . As the woodsmen cut deep into the heart of the wood the industry was forced to find other fields from which . to draw its supply . and the virgin forests of the South and of the States bordering on the Great Lakes were cut - into . Although these regions are by no means depleted to-day , the Pacific Coast is rapidly becoming the heart of the lumber trade . And what wonder , for in the three States of California , Oregon , and Washington there is at least one-third of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In figures , it amounts to more than 600,000,000,000 feet of uncut wood .  | The forest reserves and national parks set apart by the United States Government within the limits of these three States aggregate an area of 32,428 square miles , or more than 22 per cent . of the total wooded area of the States . In the State of Oregon alone , where a careful examination has been made , the national census officials have estimated the standing timber on these reservations at 55 , .000,000,000 feet , or onefourth of the State 's total supply . Thus it is in this territory that there is stocked the future lumber supply of the country . The more characteristic species of trees in this section are the redwood , which abounds in upper California , the yellow and sugar pines of the Sierra slope , and the fir trees of Oregon and Washington . In addition to these species . there are smaller tracts of larch , oak , hemlock , and other trees . The Pacific Coast has had many factors to aid it in the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important of these is the climate . In the lumbering regions of California , Oregon , and Washington there is hardly more than a week 's snow falling each winter . This leaves the loggers free to work the whole year round , and what snow does fall acts as a hamper on the business . The sheltered situation of the lumber tracts of the Northwest . cut up by the Sierra slope , keeps the temperature high throughout the winter . The development of the lumber industry in the Northwest reminds one of the transition of the dry goods trade in the cities from the innumerable small stores to that great and thoroughly American idea , the modern department store . The small logger was for many years the most important factor in this section of the country . He was the pioneer . It took but little capital to secure small tracts of timbered land adjacent to the river or the coast , and to clear them of their standing timber . In many cases the lands were acquired under the Homestead laws of the United States , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small outlay , the small logger was enabled to put his timber into market at a cost which enabled him to realize a large profit on his investment . In the financial panic of 1893 , a great number of these small operators were wiped out , leaving the field clear for the larger concerns , which now control it . TIMBER-CUTTING ON A LARGE SCALE . To-day operations are carried on upon an entirely different basis from that followed by the pioneers . The business is conducted on a Titanic scale , and the companies which are engaged in the lumber business are capitalized into the mil- lions , and think nothing of building miles of private railways in order to transport their cut timber to the nearest route to market . The passing of the small operators who survived the panic of 1893 was due not to the competition on the part of the larger firms , but to the fact that all the small tracts of forest contiguous to river and coast have been worked out , and that the timber now lies inland , in large tracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority of the small loggers have gone in with the big companies , either as managers or as stockholders . As an example of the stupendous scale of organization on which the business is now conducted I may cite the instance of one firm , which controls 1,000,000 acres of heavily timbered ground . Yet another concern has an operative capacity of 500,000 feet of logs each working day in the year . The equipment necessary to carry on this business consists of 80 miles of railroad , 10 locomotives , 20 logging or " donkey " engines , a large number of railway trucks , and employs about 400 men and 80 horses . The immensity of the trade is further shown by the following comparisons : If a building were erected which would cover the Pacific Forest Reserve , which covers an area of over 212 square miles , its roof could be shingled with the  |p3119  annual output of the shingle mills of the State of Washington alone . Again , if the year 's lumber product of that State were loaded on railway cars and placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 1,500 miles in length , or more than the distance from Seattle to Denver . The markets for which this output is manufactured are scattered all over the world . Australia , Hawaii , China , Japan , England , Germany . and , of course , our own country share in the trade . The shipbuilding plants of America turn to the Northwest for the sturdy fir masts and spars . The ' Navy Department 's specifications for war vessels recommend the use of fir for all wood purposes , except the decorative finish of cabin interiors , owing to the fir 's great strength and durability . The wooden standards from which float , the flags at Windsor Castle . and at the palace of the Emperor of Japan , are both made rom Douglass fir , shipped from the Pacific Coast . Emperor Wilhelm 's speedy yacht , the J1etear , at whose christening Miss Roosevelt presided with her tactful grace , with Prince Henry of Prussia as a witness , is fitted with Puget Sound fir masts and spars . There were shipped to England spars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the construction of King Edward 's speedy racing yacht , built on the banks of the Thames . One of the illustrations shows a bark laden with lumber . bound for Honolulu . MODERN METHODS OF HANDLING LOGS . In the early days logging was done almost exclusively by long teams of oxen and horses . Skid roads were built , over which the logs were dragged by teams of four to a dozen oxen . The logs were fastened together by means of large steel hooks . dogs . " the lumbermen called them , ? driven into either side of the log near its end . From these dogs heavy steel chains were stretched from log to log until a continuous chain of logs was formed . The art of driving the oxen was one held in high repute , and a firstclass teamster could command any reasonable wage . These methods were in vogue in the days when the tim her lay near to the water . Now that the forests have been cleared away within a radius of from 20 to 30 miles of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard gauge railways to drag the logs to the water , when they are made up into big booms , and floated downstream to the mills . It is necessary even now , in some places , to use animals to drag the logs from the forests to the railways . Oxen have been entirely supplanted by the more intelligent Clyde and Percheron horses . Even these will eventually be done away with by the use of heavy stationary or " donkey " engines , now in use by many of the camps . These handle the logs by means of steel wire cables wound on the drums of the engines , which have an operative radius of from 500 to 3,000 feet . All land within such  | a radius is called a yard . When a yard has been worked out , the heavy chains which anchor the engine in place are loosened , and the end of the cable is fastened to a distant stump or tree and the steam turned on . The winding of the cable on the drum hauls the heavy engine over the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated again and again . A logging crew consists of a foreman , an engineer , two fellers , two sawyers , a skid-maker , ten laborers , two under-cutters. two barkers , two swampers , two Luckers , three hook-tenders , two cable and signal men , two teamsters , one skidgreaser , one cook and cook 's helper , or a total of thirty-five men . A crew of this size will cut 45,000 board-measure feet of logs a day during the entire year . The discipline necessary for the carrying on of this work is as rigid as that of a military system . To each man is allotted his duties , and he must be at work constantly and be ever alert . The feller is the first to reach the tree . He chooses the place where the tree is to fall , and cuts notches on each side of the tree to hold the ends of the springboards on which the fellers stand at their work . These may be seen in one of the illustrations . A kerf is then chopped in the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the tree is intended to take when it falls . The width of this kerf is governed by the diameter of the tree , in order to act as a true fulcrum in guiding the fall . With a long , narrow blade the fellers set to work on the side of the tree opposite to the kerf . When it has been sawed not quite half through , the chopping is commenced on the other side . When the tree has been sawed nearly to the middle on . both sides steel wedges are driven in the kerf , and by driving these in with their axes the fellers control the tree with such accuracy that they are able to drop it within a foot or two of the exact location they wish . This is frequently necessary in order to prevent the shattering of a trunk . or to land it in an accessible place to be attached to the donkey engine . The sawyers , each working single , and armed with a long stiff-bladed saw , filed to a razor-like sharpness , come after the fellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which the trees are to be cut , and the sawyers set to work . So true do the saws cut the wood that they go through the thick trunk as evenly as though held in place by guides , though this is never the case . When the sawyers have completed their work , the swampers follow them and clear away the underbrush and obstructions from around the fallen tree , so that the logs may be dragged out . The barkers come next : so thick and strong is the bark of the Douglass fir that it is next to impossible to drag the log when lying on such a rough surface . The bark varies from 6 to 8 inches in thickTHE LUMBER INDUSTRY OF THE PACIFIC COAST . 321  | ness . From that side of the log which the law of gravitation will make the underside the barkers clear away the bark , so that it may run smoothly on the ground . The last man to handle the log is the hook-tender , who fastens his tackle to it . Then it starts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The manufacturing of lumber and shingles employs far more men than the actual logging . Sawmills were first put into operation in the Northwest more than fifty years ago , and to-day the industry is on a basis where the most improved methods of manufacture are in use . Without exception , the saw and shingle mills are built either on the side of the water or on foundations of piles built in deep water . This is a necessity , as the logs . after leaving the railways . are made into immense booms and floated down the rivers to the coast . There they are hauled from the water and fed into the vast lumberconsuming machinery of the mills , to be turned out in the form of a finished product . Almost all the great cities on the North Pacific Coast owe their prosperity , if not their foundation , to the lumber industry . In the redwood  | trade San Francisco and Eureka . Cal. , are the principal ports . t the former city the greatest amount of business is done , and the great mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo and shipping trade . In Oregon , Portland is the lumber metropolis , and produces an annual output of about ; ; u11 0011 ) ) feet of lumber . In Washington , Tacoma , Seattle , Fort Balkely , Ballard , Whatcom , and Everett are the leading cities . The latter city is a wonderful example of the growth of a muncipality whose entire prosperity depends on the lumber trade . In a little more than ten years the city has grown from nothing to a large population and to the distinction of being the largest producer of lumber and shingles on Puget Sound . This is due to the fact that it is in the very heart of the richest timber belt of the country , and that it is the most natural outlet for the production of the lumber district of Washington . It is on the Snohomish River , a stream whose surface is continually covered with immense booms of logs floated down from points high on the stream . That the lumber industry of the Pacific States , great as it is , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ census reports , which show that the cut of those States in 1900 was only 9.5 per cent . of the country 's total lumber product ? less than the output of the single State of Wisconsin . SOCIAL LIFE OF THE LOGGING CAMPS . The life of the men engaged in the actual felling of the trees is a hard and exacting one , yet   it has its compensations , and there is a certain rough , crude poetry and romance about the lives of these men . The constant companionship with the great trees , and the keen appreciation of the strength and power of nature at its best , cornLine to create a character as broad and as hearty as the great fir trees , whose bases measure 50 and 60 feet in circumference . Over three-fourths of the loggers are of Scandinavian birth or extraction , and the balance is made up from French-Canadians and native Americans . In the higher branches of the work , which require more than ordinary executive ability and intelligence , to say nothing of the skill of gauging the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of these men , ? the " bosses ' ' of the lumber camps , ? have been burn in the Northwest , and have followed lumbering from the time when , as boys of fifteen and sixteen . they were employed in greasing skids or in the other light work of the camp . Others have been drawn from the fastfailing lumber regions of Maine , and from the , camps of the northern Mississippi Valley . The working life of a lumberman lasts from twenty to thirty-five years . In the latter case the man has started as a boy of fifteen at skidgreasing . The common logger , as a rule , starts in to work at about twenty . Unless disabled by accident , for disease is so rare as to be almost wholly unknown , the men work at their trade until they are fifty or fifty-five years old . Even then they are still hale , active men , and fit for steady employment in less strenuous occupations . Labor unions have existed for some years . yet strikes are almost unknown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who have themselves worked as laborers at some time in their lives . These bosses know the nature of the men under them , and regulate conditions with a fairness both to employer and employed . The scale of wage varies from two to four dollars a day , the average rate being two dollars and a quarter . This , of course , is in addition to food and lodging . Thus the logger of the Northwestern camps earns a much higher rate of wage , everything considered , than does any laboring man in any other portion of the country . He is. indeed , far better off financially and physically than nine-tenths of the clerks who spend their lives in the confining atmospheres of stores and offices . CEDAR STUMP .
