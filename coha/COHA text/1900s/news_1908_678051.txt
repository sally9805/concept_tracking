txt The Independence Party held its first State Convention in Carnegie Hall last night . Four delegates-at-large were selected and a platform adopted which makes It plain that in the National campaign to be conducted by Mr. Hearst 's organization there will be no fusion with the older parties . Delegates-at-large will go to the Nee tional Convention uninstructed . They are : aLIAM R. HEARST of New York . ? HENRY A. POWELL of Kings . REUBEN ROBIE LYON of Steuben . Dr. C. H. AUDL of Erie . These alternates at large were selected : Patrick H. Murray of Albany , Morris Bloch of Ulster , Frank H. Stevens of Nassau , and Oliver Brouwer of Montgomery . Arthur Brisbane of New York and Alfred .7 . Boulton of Kings were chosen electors at large , and there was also selected a full list of electors from the Congressional districts in the State . By the time the convention was called to order  --  an hour behind schedule time ? Carnegie Hall was completely filled . The first mention of the name of Mr. Hearst in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temporary Chairmanship of the convention , provoked a demonstration that reminded one somewhat of the enthusiasm that prevailed in the two campaigns in which the Independence League leader has already been a factor . The platform follows in part : The Platform . We , independent citizens of the State of New York , are sending delegates to a National convention of the Independence Party , with instructions to nominate , absolutely independent of all other political parties , candidates for President and Vice President of the United States . Our aim is just government , not more government . Individual liberty and business prosperity are alike jeopardized by . unnecessary governmental interference , which invariably results in favoritism , special privilege , inequality , and business uncertainty . Equality of opportunity ; the largest measure of individual liberty consistent with equal rights ; effective control over enterprises which are distinctly public in their nature ; the overthrow of the rule of special interests and the restoration of government by the majority , exercised for the benefit of the whole community , these are the purposes to which the Independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of principles - promulgated at the National Conference of the Independence Party in Chicago on Washington 's Birthday , 1008 . The delegates were slow in getting around to Carnegie Hall . So was the audience . At 8 o'clock , when the convention was scheduled to begin , there was only a small scattering of delegates in the orchestra space of the hall . The boxes and balconies set aside for spectators were an empty void . In the meantime , Bayne 's Sixty-ninth Regiment Band entertained the crowd with patriotic music . The only effort at decoration was a large American flag festooned on the wall at the background of the rostrum . The Convention Opens . It was 9:05 when the convention was called to order . Henry A. Powell of Brooklyn , who was elected Temporary Chairman , said that the convention would become famous in history , not , perhaps , on account of what it would do , but because ft was the first convention of the Independence League as a National party . " Some day , " he said , " this party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olderi parties at the conventions they will hold , - will not be able to present any principles that will ring as true as those we have already presented to the people . " After the convention machinery had been set going it moved smoothly . There was n't a jar . Everything had been settled for the , delegates . Ordinarily contests are referred to a Committee on Credentials and Contested Seats , which is part- or the temporary organization of a convention . In this case the State Committee , at a meeting held prior to the convention itself , ' had settled all contests . Consequently there was little to do , and a recess of fifteen minutes was needed to allow the regular committees to do work , which at nearly all conventions occupies hours . ? John Temple Graves Speaks . The convention took a recess to allow this work to be done at 9:30 . In the interval , in response to calls from the delegates , John Temple Graves , Mr. Hearst 's chief editorial writer , made a speech . " Our platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is a bugle call . It is a declaration of American liberty , sent to the American people . There is not a straddling note in it . It is not a successmon of platitudes . It is straight and sincere in its every decleration , and was framed by men who ? are ready to go out and do all in their power to carry those principles into effect . " There is not a destructive principle in it . It is a constructive document . Conservative or radical can stand on it and can indorse it with his voice and vote as long as he has the people 's welfare at heart " We have a leader who in a single year has lived more true Democracy and more honest Republicanism than all the leaders of the Democratic and Republican Party I have preached in a decade . " The earnestness that marked the speeches and heartiness of the applause was in striking contrast with the spirit that pervaded the Republican and Democratic Conventions that have gone before . There was tremendous applause when Mr. Graves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the trusts had received his inspiration from Mr. Hearst . Mr. Hearst arrived at 10 o'clock , just before permanent organization was effected . He received a riotoes welcome . He was made permanent Chairman of the convention . Mr. Hearst 's Speech. , In accepting the Chairmanship , Mr. Hearst said in part : " It has been difficult to ? prevent fusion while  --  the Independence League was composed of disconnected organizations in different States , largely influenced by local conditions . Indeed , the National Independence Party was founded not only to give this movement unity et organza= tion , unity of purpose , and unity of action , but to conapel recognition of the fact that the League is not a trading club to be used for the benefit of politicians , but a great party to be devoted to the best interests of the whole people . " Fusion ls , merely a. political adaptation of the Japanese custom of committing marl-kart on the doorstep of your enemy . Every fusion means a loss in strength , in standing , . or at least hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FUSION FORBIDDEN BY HEARST 'S PARTY // Tensible morally it is unwise politically . Every time we fuse with the Democrats we lead some of our ex-Democrats back into the ditch of Democracy and drive some of our ex-Republicans back into the slough of Republicanism . The same thing happens when we fuse with the Republicans . And after fusion it takes at least a year 's experience of Republican robbery or Democratic depravity to bring our lost sheep back into the fold . " Mr. Hearst 's admission that fusion had been a mistake evoked immediate and emphatic response from the audience . When he referred to it as " hart-kari on your enemy 's doorstep " the assent became riotous . A reference to Senator McCarren made by Mr. Hearst was met with hisses and groans . Mr. Hearst was applauded when he concluded , but there was nothing like the ovations of his earlier campaigns . Platform Put Through . The platform was then read by Mr. Shearn , and adopted in a jiffy . A resolution commending Attorney General Jackson for bringing the reoount proceedings to trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and made this interesting announcement : " I beg to announce that Delegate Max Allen has lost a pocketbook containing a large number of checks drawn to his name . The pocketbook is in the posession of one of the Secretaries of the convention . I may say that Mr. Allen is to be congratulated that he selected an Independence League Convention and not one of the other parties to lose his pocketbook at . " After the platform had been adopted , there was a long and tedious wait for the report of the Committee on Nominations and Delegates . The delay was caused by the desire of the representatives from Kings County on the committee to have Henry A. Powell , leader of the Independence League in Brooklyn , made a delegate at large in the place of Alfred T. P.oulton , who was on the original slate . Many of the delegates and nearly all the spectators had left when the committee finally came in . The convention then quickly adjourned .               @ @ @ @ @ @
