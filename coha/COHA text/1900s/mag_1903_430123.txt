 | JUST about the time this article will appear , Greater New York will be holding a local election on what has come to be a national question : good government . No doubt there will be other ? ? issues . " At this writing ( September 15th ) the candidates were not named nor the platforms written , but the regular politicians hate the main issue . and they have a pretty trick of confusing the honest mind and splitting the honest vote by raising " local issues " which would settle themselves under prolonged honest government . So , too , there will probable be some talk about the effect this election might have upon the next presidential election ; another clever fraud which seldom fails to work to the advantage of rings and grafters , and to the humiliation and despair of good citizenship . We have nothing to do with these deceptions . They may count  | in New York . they may determine the result , but let them . They are common moves in the corruptionist 's game and , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole qualification for an honest voter ; intelligence has to play a part , too , and a little intelligence would defeat all such tricks . Anyhow , they can not disturb us . I am writing too far ahead , and my readers , for the most part , will be reading too far away to know or care anything about them . We can grasp firmly the essential issues involved and then watch with equanimity the returns for the answer , plain yes or no , which New York will give to the only questions that concern us all : Do we Americans really want good government ? Do we know it when we see it ? Are we capable of that sustained good citizenship which alone can make democracy a success ; Or . to save our pride , one other : Is the New York way the right road to permanent reform For New York has a good government , or , to be more precise , it has a good administration . It is not a question there of turning the rascals out and putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in , and this election is to decide whether they are to be kept in , which is a very different matter . Any people is capable of rising in wrath to overthrow had rulers . Philadelphia has done that in its day . New York has done it several times . With fresh and present outrages to avenge , particular villains to punish , and the mob sense of common anger to excite , it is an emotional gratification to go out with the crowd and ? ? smash something . " This is nothing but revolt , and even monarchies have uprisings to the credit of their subjects . But revolt is not reform , and one revolutionary administration is not good government . That we free Americans are capable of such assertions of our sovereign power , we have proven ; our lynchers are demonstrating it every day . That we can go forth singly also , and , without passion , with nothing but mild approval and dull duty to impel us , vote intelligently to sustain a fairly good municipal government , remains to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to show ; New York , the leading exponent of the great American anti-bad government movement for good government . According to this , the standard course of municipal reform , the politicians are permitted to organize a party on national lines , take over the government , corrupt and deceive the people and run things for the private profit of the boss and his ring , till the corruption becomes rampant and a scandal . Then the reformers combine the opposition : the corrupt and unsatisfied minority , the disgruntled groups of the majority . the reform organizations : they nominate a mixed ticket , headed by a good business man " for mayor , make a hot campaign " against the government with " Stop thief ' ' for the cry , and make a clean sweep . ' Usually , this effects only the disciplining of the reckless grafters and the improvement of the graft system of corrupt government . The good mayor turns out to he weak or foolish or not so good . " The politicians " come it over him , " as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " revolt in Philadelphia , or the people become disgusted as they did with Mayor Strong , who was carried into office by the anti-Tammany rebellion in New York after the Lexow exposures . Philadelphia gave up after its disappointment , and that is what most cities do , The repeated failures of revolutionary reform to accomplish more than the strengthening of the machine has so discredited this method that wide-awake reformers in several cities ? Pittsburg , Cincinnati , Cleveland , Detroit , Minneapolis , and others ? are following the lead of Chicago . The Chicago plan does not depend for success upon any one man or any one year 's work , nor upon excitement or any sort of had government . The reformers there have no ward organizations , no machine at all ; their appeal is solely to the intelligence of the voter and their power rests upon that . This is democratic and political , not bourgeois and business reform . and it is interesting to note that whereas reformers elsewhere are forever seeking to concentrate all the powers in the mayor , those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving his powers to the aldermen who directly represent the people . and who change year by year . The Chicago way is but one way , however , and a new one , and it must be remembered that this plan has not yet produced a good administration . New  | York has that . Chicago , after seven years ' steady work , has a body of aldermen honest enough and competent to defend the city 's interests against boodle capital , but that is about all ; it has a wretched administration . New York has stuck to the old way . Provincial and self-centered , it hardly knows there is any other . - Chicago laughs and other cities wonder , but never mind , New York , by persistence , has at last achieved a good administration . Will the New Yorkers continue it ? That is the question . What Chicago has , it has secure . It 's independent citizenship is trained to vote every time and to vote for uninteresting good aldermen . New York has an independent vote of i oo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taught to vote only once in a long while , only when excited by picturesque leadership and sensational exposures , only against . New York has been so far an anti-bad government , anti-Tammany , not a good government town . Can it vote , without Tammany in to incite it , for a good mayor ? I think this election , which will answer this question , should decide other cities how to go about reform . The administration of Mayor Seth Low may not have been perfect , not in the best European sense : not expert , not coordinated , certainly not wise . Nevertheless , for an American city , it has been not only honest but able , undeniably one of the best in the whole country . Some of the departments have been dishonest ; others have been so inefficient that they made the whole administration ridiculous . But what of that ? Corruption also is clumsy and makes absurd mistakes when it is new and untrained . The " oaths " and ceremonies and much of the boodling of the St. Louis ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , and New York 's own Tweed regime was no joke , " only because it was so general , and so expensive ? to New York . It took time to perfect the " Philadelphia plan " of misgovernment , and it took time to educate Croker and develop his Tammany Hall . It will take time to evolve masters of the ( in America ) unstudied art of municipal government ? time and demand . So far there has been no market for municipal experts in this country . All we are clamoring for to-day in our meek , weak-hearted way , is that mean , rudimentary virtue miscalled " common honesty . " Do we really want it ? Certainly Mayor Low is pecuniarily honest . He is more ; he is conscientious and experienced and personally efficient . Bred to business , he rose above it , adding to the training he acquired in the conduct of an international commercial house , two terms as Mayor of Brooklyn , and to that again a very effective administration , as president , of the business of Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affairs of New York ; he has said himself that he devoted eight months to its finances : and he mastered this department and is admitted to he the master in detail  | of every department which has engaged his attention . In other words , Mr. Low has learned the business of New York ; he is just about competent now to become the mayor of a great city . Is there a demand for Mr. Low ? No . When I made my inquiries ? before the lying had begun ? the Fusion leaders of the anti-Tammany forces , who nominated Mr. Low , said they might renominate him ; ' ? who else was there ? " they asked . And they thought he " might " be reelected . The alternative was Richard Croker or Charles F. Murphy , his man , for no matter who Tammany 's candidate for mayor was , if Tammany won , Tammany 's boss would rule . The personal issue was plain enough . Yet was there no assurance for Mr. Low . Why ? There are many forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one ? the man 's personality . It is not very engaging . Mr. Low has many respectable qualities , but these never are amiable . " Did you ever see his smile ? " said a politician who was trying to account for his instinctive dislike for the Mayor . I had ; there is no laughter back of it , no humor , and no sense thereof . The appealing human element is lacking all through . His good abilities are self-sufficient ; his dignity is smug ; his courtesy seems not kind , his self-reliance is called obstinacy because , though he listens , he seems not to care ; though he understands , he shows no sympathy , and when he decides , his reasoning is private . His most useful virtues ? probity , intelligence , and conscientiousness ? in action are often an irritation ; they are so contented . Mr. Low is the bourgeois reformer type . Even where he compromises , he gets no credit ; his concessions make the impression of surrenders . A politician can say " no " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying , ' yes . " Cold and impersonal , he cools even his heads of departments . Loyal public service they give , because his taste is for men who would do their duty for their own sake , not for his , and that excellent service the city has had . But members of Mr. Low 's administration helped me to characterize him ; they could not help it . Mr. Low 's is not a lovable character . But what of that ? Why should his colleagues love him ? Why should anybody like him ? Why should he seek to charm , win affection , and make friends ? He was elected to attend to the business of his office and to appoint subordinates who should attend to the business of their offices , not to make " political strength " and win elections . William Travers Jerome , the picturesque District Attorney , whose sincerity and intellectual honesty made sure the election of Mr. Low two years ago , detests him as a bourgeois , but the mayoralty is held in New York to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New York theory that municipal government is business , not politics , and that a business man who would manage the city as he would a business corporation , would solve for us all our troubles . Chicago reformers think we have  | got to solve our own problems ; that government is political business ; that men brought up in politics and experienced in public office will make the best administrators . They have refused to turn from their politician mayor , Carter H. Harrison , for the most ideal business candidate . and I have heard them say that when Chicago was ripe for a better mayor , they would prefer a candidate chosen from among their well-tried aldermen . Again . I say . however . that this is only one way , and New York has another , and this other is the standard American way . But again I say , also , that the New York way is on trial , for New York has what the whole country has been looking for in all municipal crises ? the non-political ruler . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose . emphasize the point . They make it impossible for him to be a politician even if he should wish to be . As for his selfishness , his lack of tact . his coldness ? these are of no consequence . He has done his duty all the better for them . Admit that he is uninteresting : what does that matter ? He has served the city . Will the city not vote for him because it does not like the way he smiles ? Absurd as it sounds , that is what all I have heard against Low amounts to . But to reduce the situation to a further absurdity , let us eliminate altogether the personality of Mr. Low . Let us suppose he has no smile , no courtesy , no dignity , no efficiency , no personality at all : suppose he were an It and had not given New York a good administration , but had only honestly tried . What then ? Tammany Hall ? That is the alternative . The Tammany politicians see it just as clear as that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say " it is a Tammany year , " " Tammany 's turn . " They say it and they believe it . They study the people , and they know it is all a matter of citizenship ; they admit that they can not win unless a goodly part of the independent vote goes to them : and still they say they can beat Mr. Low or any other man the anti-Tammany forces may nominate . So we are safe in eliminating Mr. Low and reducing the issue to plain Tammany . Tammany is bad government ; not inefficient , but dishonest ; not a party , not a delusion and a snare , hardly known by its party name ? Democracy ; having little standing in the national councils of the party and caring little for influence outside of the city . Tammany is Tammany , the embodiment of corruption . All the world knows and all the world may know what it is and what it is after . For hypocrisy is not a Tammanv vice . Tammany is for Tammanv , and the Tammanv men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . other rogues talk about the tariff and imperialism . Tammany is honestly dishonest . Time and time again , in private and in public . the leaders , big and little . have said they are out for themselves and their own ; not for the public , but for me and my friends " ; not for New York , but for Tammany . Richard Croker said under oath once that he worked for his own pockets all the time . and Tom Grady , the Tammany orator , has brought his crowds to their feet cheering sentiments as primitive , stated with candor as brutal . The man from Mars would say that such an organization , so self-confessed. could not be very dangerous to an intelligent people . Foreigners marvel at it and at us. and even Americans ? Pennsylvanians. for example ? can not understand why we New Yorkers regard Tammanv as so formidable . I think I can explain it . Tammany is corruption with consent it is bad government founded on the suffrages of the people . The Philadelphia machine is more powerful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require the votes of the people . The Philadelphians do not vote for their machines ; their machines vote for them . Tammany used to stuff the ballot boxes and intimidate voters ; today there is practically none of that . Tammany rules , when it rules , by right of the votes of the people of New York . Tammany corruption is democratic corruption . That of the Philadelphia ring is rooted in special interests . Tammany , too , is allied with vested interests " ? but Tammany labors under disadvantages not known in Philadelphia . The Philadelphia ring is of the same party that rules the State and the nation , and the local ring forms a Jiving chain with the state and national rings . Tammany is a purely local concern . With a majority only in old New York , it has not only to buy what it wants from the Republican majority in the State , but must trade to get the whole city . Big business everywhere is the chief source of politico.  | corruption , and it is one source in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York have no plants there . Offices there are , and head offices , of many trusts and railways , for example , but that is all . There are but two railway terminals in the city , and but three railways use them . These have to do more with Albany than New York . So with Wall Street . Philadelphia 's stock exchange deals largely in Pennsylvania securities , New York 's in those of the whole United States . There is a small Wall Street group that specializes in local corporations , and they are active and give Tammany a Wall Street connection , but the biggest and the majority of our financial leaders , bribers though they may be in other cities and even in New York State , are independent of Tammany Hall and can be honest citizens at home . From this class , indeed , New York can and often does draw some of its reformers . Not so Philadelphia . That bourgeois opposition which has persisted for thirty years in the fight against Tammany corruption , was squelched in Philadelphia after its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railways and other business interests , was able to reach it . A large part of his power is negative ; there is no opposition . Tammany 's power is positive . Tammany can not reach all the largest interests and its hold is upon the people . Tammany 's democratic corruption rests upon the corruption of the people , the plain people , and there lies its great significance ; its grafting system is one in which more individuals share than any I have studied . The people themselves get very little they come cheap , but they are interested . Divided into districts , the organization subdivides them into precincts or neighborhoods , and their sovereign power , in the form of votes , is bought up by kindness and petty privileges . They are forced to a surrender , when necessary , by intimidation , but the leader and his captains have their hold because they take care of their own . They speak pleasant words , smile friendly smiles , notice the baby , give picnics up the River or the Sound , or a slap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's expense , but they have also news-stands , peddling privileges , railroad and other business places to dispense ; they permit violations of the law , and , if a man has broken the law without permission , see him through the court . Though a blow in the face is as readily given as a shake of the hand , Tammany kindness is real kindness , and will go far , remember long , and take infinite . trouble for a friend . The power that is gathered up thus cheaply , like garbage , in the districts is concentrated in the district leader who in turn passes it on through a general committee to the boss . This is a form of living government , extra-legal , but very actual , and , though the beginnings of it are purely democratic , it develops at each stage into an autocracy . In Philadelphia the boss appoints a district leader and gives him power . Tammany has done that in two or three notable instances , but never without causing a bitter fight which lasts often for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In New York , Croker has failed signally to maintain vicebosses whom he appointed . The boss of Tammany Hall is a growth , and just as Croker grew , so has Charles F. Murphy grown up to Croker 's place . Again , whereas in Philadelphia the boss and his ring handle and keep almost all of the graft , leaving little to the district leaders , in New York the district leaders share handsomely in the spoils . There is more to share in New York . It is impossible to estimate the amount of it , not only for me , but for anybody . No Tammany man knows it all . Police friends of mine say that the Tammany leaders never knew how rich police corruption was till the Lexow committee exposed it , and that the politicians who had been content with small presents , contributions , and influence , " did not butt in " for their share till they saw by the testimony of frightened police grafters that the department was worth from four to five millions a year . The items are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a friend once that in one year the police graft was " something over $3,000,000 . " Afterward the syndicate which divided the graft under Devery took in for thirty- six months $400,000 a month from gambling and poolrooms alone . Saloon bribers , disorderly house blackmail , policy , etc. , etc. , bring this total up to amazing proportions . Yet this was but one department . and a department that was overlooked by Tammany for years . The annual budget of the city is about $100,000,000 , and though the  | power that comes of the expenditure of that amount is enormous and the opportunities for rake-offs infinite , this sum is not one-half of the resources of Tammany when it is in power . Her resources are the resources of the city as a business , as a political , as a social power . If Tammany could be incorporated and all its earnings , both legitimate and illegitimate , gathered up and paid over in dividends , the stockholders would get more than the New York Central bond and stock holders , more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power equal to that of the United States Steel Company . Tammany , when in control of New York , takes out of the city unbelievable millions of dollars a year . No wonder the leaders are all rich ; no wonder so many more Tammany men are rich than are the leaders in any other town ; no wonder Tammany is liberal in its division of the graft . Croker took the best and the safest of it , and he accepted shares in others . He was " in on the Wall Street end , " and the Tammany clique of financiers have knocked down and bought up at low prices Manhattan Railway stock by threats of the city 's power over the road ; they have been let in on Metropolitan deals and on the Third Avenue Railroad grab ; the Ice Trust is a Tammany trust ; they have banks and trust companies , and through the New York Realty Company are forcing alliances with such financial groups as that of the Standard Oil Company . Croker shared in these deals and businesses . He sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Tammany campaign fund , of which he was treasurer , and he had the judges take from the regular real estate exchange all the enormous real estate business that passed through the courts , and give it to an exchange connected with the real estate business of his firm , Peter F. Meyer &; Co . This alone would maintain a ducal estate in England . But his real estate business was greater than that . It had extraordinary legal facilities , the free advertising of abuse , the prestige of political privilege , all of which brought in trade ; and it had advance information and followed with profitable deals , great public improvements . Though Croker said he worked for his own pockets all the time , and did take the best of the graft , he was not " hoggish . " One of the richest graft in the city is in the Department of Buildings . 100,000,000 a year goes into building operations in New York . All of this , from out-houses to skyscrapers , is subject to very precise laws and regulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department has the enforcement of these ; it passes upon all construction , private and public , at all stages from plan-making to actual completion ; and can cause not only ? unavoidable delay " but can wink at most profitable violations . Architects and builders had to stand in with the department . They called on the right man and they settled on a scale which was not fixed , but which generally was on the basis of the department 's estimate of a fair half of the value of the saving in time or bad material . This brought in at least a banker 's percentage on one hundred millions a year . Croker , so far as I can make out , took none of this : it was let out to other leaders and was their own graft . District Attorney William Travers Jerome has looked into the Dock Department , and he knows things which he yet may prove . This is an important investigation for two reasons . It is very large graft and the new Tammany leader , Charlie Murphy , had it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should want to know about the management of its docks , since , just as other cities have their corrupt dealings with railways and their terminals , so New York 's great terminal business is with steamships and docks . These docks should pay the city handsomely . Mr. Murphy says they should n't ; he is wise , as Croker was before he became old and garrulous , and , as Tammany men put it , " keeps his mouth shut , " but he did say that the docks should not be run for revenue to the city but for their own improvement . The Dock Board has exclusive and private and secret control of the expenditure of $to , 000,000 a year . No wonder Murphy chose it . It is impossible to follow all New York graft from its source to its final destination . It is impossible to follow here the course of that which is well known to New Yorkers . There are public works for Tammany contractors . There are private works for Tammany contractors , and corporations and individuals find it expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a  | very good system of grafting on public works ; I mean that it is " good " from the criminal point of view ? and so it has for the furnishing of supplies . Low bids and short deliveries , generally speaking ( and that is the only way 1 can speak here ) , is the method . But the Tammany system , as a whole , is weak . Tammany men as grafters have a confidence in their methods and system , which , in the light of such perfection as that of Philadelphia , is amusing , and the average New Yorker takes in " the organization " a queer sort of pride , which is ignorant and provincial . Tammany is ' way behind the times . It is growing ; it has improved . In Tweed 's day the politicians stole from the city treasury , divided the money on the steps of the City Hall , and , not only the leaders , big and little , but heelers and outsiders ; not only Tweed , but ward carpenters robbed the city ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on the divvy . " New York , not Tammany alone , was corrupt . When the exposure came , and Tweed asked his famous question , " What are you going to do about it ? " the ring mayor , A. Oakey Hall , asked another as significant . It was reported that suit was to be brought against the ring to recover stolen funds . " Who is going to sue ? " said Mayor Hall , who could not think of anybody of importance sufficiently without sin to throw the first stone . Stealing was stopped and grafting was made more business-like , but still it was too general , and the boodling for the Broadway street railway franchise prompted a still closer grip on the business . The organization since then has been gradually concentrating the control of graft . Croker did not proceed so far along the line as the Philadelphia ring has , as the police scandals showed . After the Lexow exposures , Tammany took over that graft , but still let it go practically by districts , and the police captains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devery became Chief and the police graft was so concentrated that the division was reduced to fourteen parts . Again , later , it was reduced to a syndicate of four or five men , with a dribble of miscellaneous graft for the police . In Philadelphia the police have nothing to do with the police graft ; a policeman may collect it , but he acts for a politician , who in turn passes it up to a small ring . That STEFFENS 91 is the drift in New York . Under Devery the police officers got comparatively little , and the rank and file themselves were blackmailed for transfers and promotions , for remittances of fines , and in a dozen other petty ways . Philadelphia is the end toward which New York under Tammany is driving as fast as the lower intelligence and higher conceit of its leaders will let it . In Philadelphia one very small ring gets everything , dividing the whole as it pleases , and not all those in the inner ring are politicians . Trusting few individuals , they are safe from exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise as politicians . When , as in New York , the number of grafters is large , this delicate business is in some hands that are rapacious . The police grafters , for example , in Devery 's day , were not content with the amounts collected from the big vices . They cultivated minor vices , like policy , to such an extent that the Policy King was caught and sent to prison , and Devery 's wardman , Glennon , was pushed into so tight a hole that there was danger that District Attorney Jerome would get past Glennon to Devery and the syndicate . The murder of a witness the night he was in the Tenderloin police station served to save the day . But , worst of all , Tammany , the friend of the people , " permitted the organization of a band of so-called Cadets , who made a business , under the protection of the police , of ruining the daughters of the tenements and even of catching and imprisoning in disorderly houses the wives of poor men . This horrid traffic never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vicious women were planted " in tenement houses and ( I know this personally ) the children of decent parents counted the customers , witnessed their transactions with these creatures , and , as a father told with shame and tears , reported totals at the family table . Tammany leaders are usually the natural leaders of the people in these districts , and they are originally good-natured , kindly men . No one has a more sincere liking than I for some of those common but generous fellows ; their charity is real , at first . But they sell out their own people . They do give them coal and help them in their private troubles , but , as they grow rich and powerful , the kindness goes out of the charity and they not only collect at their saloons or in rents ? cash for their  | " goodness " ; they not only ruin fathers and sons and cause the troubles they relieve ; they sacrifice the children in the schools ; let the Health Department neglect the tenements , and , worst of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor . This is not only bad ; it is bad politics it has defeated Tammany . Woe to New York when Tammany learns better . Honest fools talk of the reform of Tammany Hall . It is an old hope , this , and twice it has been disappointed , but it is not vain . That is the real danger ahead . The reform of a corrupt ring means , as I have said before , the reform of its system of grafting and a wise consideration of certain features of good government . Croker turned his " best chief of police , " William S. Devery , out of Tammany Hall , and , slow and old as he was . Croker learned what clean streets were from Col. Waring , and gave them . Now there is a new boss , a young man , Charles F. Murphy , and unknown to New Yorkers . He looks dense , but he acts with force , decision , and skill . The new mayor will be his man . He may divide with Croker and leave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Charlie Murphy will rule Tammany and , if Tammany is elected , New York also . Lewis Nixon is urging Murphy publicly , as I write , to declare against the police scandals and all the worst practices of Tammany . Lewis Nixon is an honest man , but he was one of the men Croker tried to appoint leader of Tammany Hall . And when he resigned Mr. Nixon said that he found that a man could could not keep that leadership and his self-respect . Yet Mr. Nixon is a type of the man who thinks Tammany would be fit to rule New York if the organization would " reform . " As a New Yorker , I fear Murphy will prove sagacious enough to do just that : stop the scandals , put all the graft in the hands of a few tried and true men , and give the city what it would call good government . Murphy says he will nominate for mayor a man so " good " that his goodness will astonish New York . I do n't fear a bad Tammany mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For I have been to Philadelphia . Philadelphia had a had ring mayor , a man who promoted the graft and caused scandal after scandal . The leaders there , the wisest political grafters in this country , learned a great lesson from that . As one of them said to me : The American people do n't mind grafting , but they hate scandals . They do n't kick so much on a jiggered public contract for a boulevard , but they want the boulevard and no fuss and no dust . We want to give them that . We want to give them what they really want , a quiet Sabbath , safe streets . orderly nights , and homes secure . They let us have the police graft . But this mayor was a hog . You see , he had but one term and he could get a share only on what was made in his term . He not only took a hog 's share off what was coming , but he wanted everything to come in his term . So I 'm down on grafting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good politics to have honest men in office . I mean men that are personally honest . " So they got John Weaver for Mayor , and honest John Weaver is checking corruption , restoring order , and doing a great many good things , which it is " good politics " to do . For he is satisfying the people , soothing their ruffled pride , and reconciling them to machine rule . I have letters from friends of mine there , honest men , who wish me to bear witness to the goodness of Mayor Weaver . I do . And I believe that if the Philadelphia machine leaders are as careful with Mayor Weaver as they have been and let him continue to give to the end as good government as he has given so far , the Philadelphia plan " of graft will last and Philadelphia will never again be a free American city . Philadelphia and New York began about the same time , some thirty years ago , to reform their city governments . Philadelphia got " good government " ? what the Philadelphians call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a scandal to the nation and a disgrace to democracy . New York has gone on fighting , advancing and retreating , for thirty years till now it has achieved the beginnings . under Mayor Low , of a government for the people . Do the New Yorkers know it ? Do they care ? They are Americans , mixed and typical do we Americans really want good government ? Or , as I said at starting , have they worked for thirty years along the wrong road ? crowded with unhappy American cities ? the road to Philadelphia and des-pair ?
