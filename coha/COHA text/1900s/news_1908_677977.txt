" I merely want to say , " he remarked . " that some time ago I tried to strengthen the banking laws . I had especial reference to conditions in Chicago . The Walsh bank , to which I directed my principal attention , had failed through unlawful and unrighteous methods of management , and Walsh is now under sentence . In connection with this I wanted to know something of the methods of the Chicago Clearing House . " At that time I was blocked . This man , Forgan , President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clearing House .

" he said , " would you stand up in front of the bread Line in New York City , where thousands of men every night are trying to get stale bread , and say : ' Gentlemen , the panto Is over ' ? Is that what you mean ? " " No. " replied Mr. Chantey . " I would n't go to New York at all , because I am very much . afraid of that place . " " You do n't have to go there , " said Mr. Willett .
