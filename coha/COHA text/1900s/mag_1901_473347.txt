THE gift horse , which it was once thought not quite civil to look in the mouth , has been having its teeth rather unsparingly examined of late , so far as it has taken the shape of free public libraries . In fact , a general largess , of more than royal , of more than imperial munificence , to the Scotch universities from the same lavish hand which has scattered its peculiar benefactions broadcast over our own land , was critically studied by the authorities before a grateful acceptance closed the incident . The acceptance was not indecently delayed , however , and the gratitude was of much more apparent reality than the misgiving , so that we might well believe the Scotch universities had never the serious question which seems to have beset some American thinkers respecting our gift horse , or horses , at a somewhat later stage of events . They may have been inure used to gift horses in Scotland ; at any rate , they know how more gracefully to manage them , and they at least do not continue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stable . To he sure , the Scotch beneficiaries were not pledged to such terms relating to the care and keep of the gift horses as the American communities , which , in the process of time , may find them eating their heads off . I Apart from all questions of politeness , there were some things suggested by the eminent gentlemen who have recently spoken their minds on the surplusage of free libraries among us well worthy the consideration of the friend of books . One of them went so far as to ask whether we were not in danger of reading too much and thinking too little ; and he alleged the existence of such overwhelming facilities for reading in his own city as seemed to imply the submergence of thinking . Not only does a public library , with its local branches , freely offer five hundred thousand volumes to his fellow-citizens , but a subCI11. ? No . S16. - 61scription enterprise , with a system of delivery-carts , leaves books for a trifling sum at people 's doors , like milk ; and literature is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing , it must be owned , has its grotesque side , and it may have its immoral , its dangerous side . The President of Johns Hopkins University thought the present excess of reading something in the nature of a craze , a vice ; and people may he really eating literature as they eat opium , and may be as effectively drugged to stupidity with the one as with the other ; but the parallel need not be pushed so far as this to be deplorable , with any one who loves books for their refining and edifying companionship . Whether the victims of the craze , the vice , would be thinking if they were not reading is another matter , and demands reflection . In the light of reflection it is not very certain what thinking is . It is a process so very obscure that many of us are apt to think we are thinking when we are merely musing , or , to phrase it more modernly , mooning . The mind often supposes itself to be " orbing about " interests of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as Charles Lamb said be liked to let his mind do ; or was it Leigh Hunt ? The art of thinking is not likely to go far unless it goes hand in hand with the art of talking , which has more and more fallen into disuse since the mania for reading seized the world ; and it seems to us it is this which we can profitably study anew . The trouble with people now reading the sort of books which no one ought to read is that they would not be thinking , unless they were talking , when they were not reading . These weaker brethren and sisters read because they do not like to think by themselves ? that is , to muse , or moon , or net their minds bobulate in a vacuum . But hardly any one dislikes talking , which with such people is really the only way to thinking ; and if they were encouraged to cultivate the habit of talking , they would be in a fairer way to stop reading than if they tried to cultivate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his honesty in both hands , he would probably be able to confess that the influence of any powerful story on his mind was stupefying . What must be the narcotic effect of a feeble story only those now devouring weak stories by the hundred thousand can say . It is not perhaps so had as that of morphine ; but it may be something like that of cocaine , and far worse than that of cigarettes . In this sense the habit of reading inferior fiction ( for out of a hundred readers ninety-nine read nothing else ) is certainly a vice , without the picturesqueness of a craze . Yet if its victims propose to leave it off , to close the greatest selling book of the year , the week , the day , and take to talk , there are distinct difficulties in their way to reform . What shall they talk about , and eventually think about ? Until very lately , until the popular novels began to be so tremendously popular , people who were averse to thinking before they spoke , or liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new play was an easy and inviting theme , especially with young people who sought the joy of each other 's presence in the pretence of caring to know whether one or the other had seen it . But it is said that now they have changed all that , and people not only read the greatest selling books , but when they talk they talk about them instead of the plays . It is said that they often read them in the fear of being found out not to have read them , and are ashamed to be ignorant of what it is , in most eases , an intellectual dishonor to know . The case is hard to imagine , but with a strenuous effort it may be imagined , and after one has succeeded one may realize the vicious circle in which the victims of the reading habit revolve , with little or no hope of escape . If they leave off reading for the purpose of talking , as a preliminary to thinking , they have nothing to talk of except the books they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over they must begin reading again in order to he able to talk of something . In earlier times people used to talk largely of religion , and in times not quite so early , of politics ; but these were always probably the topics of the elder rather than the younger people , whose reform we have primarily in mind ; for if the vice of reading is to be cured , we must strike at its roots in the tender mind of youth . They no longer talk of plays , and they may not talk of books , for the reasons given . It remains for them , then , to talk of themselves ; and this they will naturally do if they are of the ages and sexes which satisfy their interest in one another under the mask of autobiography . But autobiography can be carried so far as to become itself a vice , or if not quite that , a bore ; and the sole refuge from autobiography , in the hard conditions we are fancying , is gossip . Gossip must really have formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antiquity , who are supposed to have been talking philosophy and art when they were not discussing the affairs of state . They could nut have been readers iu anything like the modern measure ; their education was not merely literary ; their enlightenment was accomplished by many intellectual means neglected in our bookridden civilization ; and so was that of the medival Italians . The Southern races were always fond of talking ? that is , of thinking ; and they cultivated the cheerful habit of it , rather than the churlish and unsocial vice of reading . This was probably fostered by the life of the cloister , to which in the Dark Ages it was mainly confined ; and it would naturally impart itself to the whole life of the North , shut up to the long nights of the long winter . But wherever the sun can get fairly at the heart , it unseals the fountains of talk , and the gay stream babbles in its beam . It has been the belief , possibly the superstition , of the Easy Chair that in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northerners , because they talk more and are therefore the true heirs of the oldest civilizations . They have their defects , which it . is net to the point here to specify ; but they have not our foible of over-reading . They talk more easily , and ( we venture the opinion ) they think more originally . Do they talk gossip ? Very likely ; and very likely the free peoples of antiquity and the medieval Italians talked gossip . If you will go into an Italian cafe , even of the present day , and outstay the hush which follows the coming of a stranger , you will overhear gossip , as you may on the veranda of a Southern house . The gossip is in neither ease necessarily offensive or mischievous . It is often the dexterous analysis of human character , the proper study of mankind , and even of womankind , in which the connoisseur of his species finds the highest delight , if not instruction . Good fiction is only an exquisite distillation of human facts , which biography and history more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by remoteness of time and place . There is no reason why the gossip which people must fall back upon in default of other interests when they reform their vicious habit of reading should not be depersonalized to the effect of all that is charming and edifying in those forms of literature . It is perfectly feasible for the gossiper to refine upon the earlier methods , to reject crude incident and ( - heap inference , and devote himself or herself to the more psychological moments in the experience , or the reputed experience , of his or her neighbors . It may be urged that every the most intimate fact of life is now exploited in the newspapers , and that the modern extension of journalism includes things formerly left to private comment ; but it is precisely here that we wish to distinguish , and entreat the reformed reader , in turning to talk as a means of thought , to save himself by the conscientious avoidance of those things which the press makes its indiscriminate prey . In fact he must do so if he would not lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would be almost as bad as reading books . We do not wish to imply that reading the newspapers is altogether deleterious , and we do not understand that President Gilman regards free libraries as an unmixed evil . Probably he would strike a balance between the Caliph Omar and Mr. Carnegie , or would regard anera of Omarism as little less disastrous than what he calls an era of Carnegie-ism . But in this we necessarily speak without his authority , and for ourselves we can only urge a point against free libraries which we think can be fairly made . It seems to us that there is small use or sense in purveying gratis all the new books , as the libraries appear to do , without apparent criticism , or with worse than none . The best criticism , the criticism of time , they quite reject . But why might not the libraries beneficially make it a rule not to supply any hook less than a year old ? Time would sift the vast mass of literature so that only the finer and more precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the authors and publishers whose industry is most injured by the libraries . These buy a few copies of a good book , which by very reason of its goodness must have a scanty sale , and still further restrict its meagre profits by offering it free to those who , if they love it , might make a struggle to get together money enough to buy it . In our generous indignation at the present wrong we arc not sure but the free library is standing between such booklovers and the plain duty of owning the books they love . A hook bought is a " book honestly come by , " as Mr. Lowell said in speaking of the books we used to steal ; and why should the author and publisher have their slender chance of living by a good book lessened through the pernicious bounty of the free li-brary ? The free libraries can not hurt the overwhelmingly popular books ; the mania for these is so groat that no library can supply the demand ; but it can easily supply the demand for a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in offering only the popular rubbish to its readers , and the standard literature which has passed out of copyright . A book which is by way of being standard , or classic , may well be excluded , at least till people of taste have had time to consider whether they can not afford to buy it and put it on their shelves , with their own book-plate in it . But if it is hastily thrust , an unsolicited alms , into a man 's hand , he will read it , but he will think twice before he buys it ; and we have been warned how difficult it is for the habitual reader to think even once . If we must be specific as to the new books which the free libraries should delay at least a year in supplying , so that the reader shall be obliged to buy them for himself , we should say , first of all , travel and biography , or their synthesis , history . Poetry is a good sort of literature to buy , especially good poetry . Essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , receive from the press , and now and then a volume of literary criticism , should be bought rather than begged or borrowed . The higher order of fiction ought to be withheld from the free libraries , in order that the reader call enjoy it with due selfrespect . But the lower order of fiction , the variety that sells by the half-million , may be unsparingly lavished by the free libraries . Dictionaries , directories , catalogues , metaphysics , theology , government reports , and political speeches may be free as air ; for , as it is so hard to read them , the reader may be driven to talking or thinking in sheer desperation . If he is a devourer of the greatest selling books of the year , he may as well continue to read , for upon no condition , probably , could he think . IV The objection to the gift horses urged by the eminent divine who spoke against them in a baccalaureate sermon is rather more sentimental than President Gilman 's . The notion of the president , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be that in our habitual reliance upon gift horses we shall lose the use of our legs . But Dr. Grant feels it unseemly that we should accept a gift horse upon the condition that it shall bear the name of the giver so boldly inscribed upon its barrel that the wayfaring man can not err therein ; or , in less metaphorical terms , that the giver 's name shall figure upon each free library founded by him . The objection is not merely sentimenta , or at least it may be supported by the argument that with a Hall of Fame already provided for housing the memories of eminent citizens intending immortality , it is superfluous to carve the nameof one upon a public building , even though he may have given the building . What is a Hall of Fame for ? With the decentralization of the Hall of Fame , as the Easy Chair imagined it Last month , and its indefinite reproduction at the State capitals and county-seats , a measure of celebrity must result which should satisfy the ambition of the most avid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewed as to what he meant by his sermon , is reported to have said that he believed free libraries should be founded at the public expense out of the taxes paid by all the citizens . He believed , if we may trust the interviewer , that " the men in overalls " who read the books in the Boston Public Library take a just pride in the fact that it was built partly out of their overalls pockets ; and there is a great deal of probability in this . For mulch the same reason the authors and publishers whose books are supplied gratis to people who might otherwise buy them may fitly share the just pride of the men in overalls ; when their books are excluded from the Boston Public Library by the Comic Committee on Selections , they may rejoice upon selfish grounds . It should not be forgotten , however , that the great giver of gift horses has provided for some sneh pride in the overalls men , whose representatives so freely accept his bounty . This is conditioned upon their agreeing to furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give feed with the gift horse ; he does not , in fact , so much give the gift horse as give its stable : the rest must he supplied by its recipients , and there have not been wanting published estimates to show that eventually a public library is a public debt . That is ungracious , but if a gift horse , or his stable , comes coupled with conditions , it is not so ungracious as if he , or it , came with none . Dr. Grant apparently disables the giver 's taste ; but about tastes there can be no profitable disputing . The question is whether free public libraries do more good or harm , and this brings us back to President Gilman and his thesis that we perhaps read too much and think too little . It might very well be , though here the fact intrudes that those who do not read seem not to think much either . Lowell fancied that " the talk was meatier " in the days before men 's eyes were " blinded poring over miserable books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the meatier talk as far as to the time when they could not read at all . We are to decide how much and what we shall read rather than abjure reading altogether . The worthlessness of most of the books that most people are now reading is no proof of the supposition that there are not as many good books as ever . Of good old books there are more than ever , for the century lately closed was richer in good literature , upon the whole , than any other century , or almost all the other centuries . The freelibrary reader could not go wrong if he went to the nineteenth century classics , and he would come from them not wholly disabled from thinking . The same might be hoped for him if among recent books lie trusted himself to such as were in great demand after a single year . There are , in fact , books now actually in press , or issuing from it , which he might read with profit as well as pleasure , though these are comparatively few ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free libraries will leave him to become their proud and happy possessor before he reads them . V There can be , after all , few finer de-lights in life than the companionship of a great mind at its best , and this is what one gets in a good book . One may give one 's self unreservedly up to it , and always be the better for it . Among the joys of life it is one of the very few which you shall not come from " high sorrowful and cloyed , " but al-ways strengthened and refreshed . We would therefore have it as pure and full as possible , and secure from all slight and haste . Slight and haste are almost the necessary conditions of reading a book taken out of a library , whether bond or free . You can not lie down and rise up with it , sipping it slowly before you sleep , or sweetly when you wake ; or lull yourself with it after noon or after midnight . You can not keep it for those moments of golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect temper for its enjoyment . You can not richly linger over it and delay , and return again and yet again to the feast ; but you must poorly make it a surfeit , and gorge yourself upon it within a given time , under penalty of a fine . You must do that or you must slight it ; and was not it superficial reading , rather than reading absolute , which President Gilman meant to accuse of mischief 1 The free libraries tempt us to read too much , and oblige us to read too hastily ; and herein the harm lies . We are in danger through them of spoiling our literary digestion , and of becoming a nation of mental dyspeptics . Our excessive reading may be a vice , or a mania ; it is certainly a disease . The way to health is through the ownership of the books we read , and books are now so cheap that hardly any one who really loves them need deny himself the fine rapture of feeling them his . A book borrowed , whether from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must think about returning it , under penalty of money or remorse . But a book bought is a liberation of the soul from all sordid anxieties concerning it , and an enlargement of mind such as a borrowed book can never be . If you borrow books you are in danger of borrowing more than you can read ; but you are never in danger of buying more books than you can read , unless you buy them for show , in which case you can not really own them ; for there is this peculiarity in the ownership of books , that the purchase is not completed till you have read them . Then , when you have them in your heart and your head , you may put them on your shelf , secure that whatever misfortune befalls you , your property in them can not be wholly alienated .
