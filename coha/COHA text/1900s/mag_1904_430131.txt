NO one knows the charm of being at home in Venice , who has not lived there ; who has not spent many a lazy hour in a Venetian garden , in a Venetian gondola , or at a Venetian balcony , looking down over canal or lagoon , musing on the hundred nothings which make one happy , when one lives in dear , old , sunny Venice . The quaint discomforts or the Venetian home are to its attractions as the rose leaf to the feather pillow of the princess in the ancient fairy tale , and you are really overexacting if yon do mind them . Life in your palazzetto on the water is so lazy , so simple , so restful . For you do not run your Venetian home on the rush-and-go principle of an ocean liner or a New York household . You simply float along with the broad tide of the lagoon , and take your time for everything . If you miss a steam tug , that most convenient Venetian substitute for the inland trolley ' car , you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come around in due time . If you are late , never mind : people will wait for you . Nobody is ever in a hurry at Venice . Here one finds the triumph of the dolce far niente . The only individuals who disgrace the beauty of the place by their boisterous or indecorous hurry are the tourists . The modern Venetian accomplishes just as much as any other citizen , but he doei n't think it good form to rush and hustle , and the poorer the people are , the more they do enjoy their share of sun and calm and rest . The men who wait for a seafaring job and sit in rows on the stone benches ; the children who after school time lie sprawling on the cool , shady steps of a bridge and lean over the wall to chase the nibbling crabs below the waterline ; the girls who  | saunter along , in rows of four or five , their charming figures half concealed in the folds of the black long-fringed shawls , their magnificent hair shining in the sun ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious hair of Italy ) the crowds who loll on the benches in the sun , who sip coffee or ices under the area des of the great Piazza : the crowds of society and the crowds of the commoners alike , contribute to the grand scenery and emphasize the feeling of rest , abandon and indolence which make life in Venice a thing of beauty and a joy forever . Yes , a joy ; for , as a brilliant artist writer has put it , " in this selfish , materialistic . money-getting age it is a joy to live , if only for a day , where a song is more prized than a sol ( lo ; where the poorest pauper laughingly shares his scanty crust ; where to be kind to a child is a habit , to be neglectful of old age a shame : in a city the relics of whose past are the lessons of our future ; whose every canvas , stone and bronze bear witness to a grandeur , luxury and taste that took a thousand years of energy to perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy . " Your Venetian home will he the joy of your life if you only will do as the Venetians do , and be satisfied that it is not a department store , and needs not be run that way . You do not employ a crowd of retainers in Venice to in. sure the amount of service and comfort which would entail greater numbers , I am safe to say , everywhere else in the world . The simple gondola will answer for horses and carriages and automobiles , and your gondoliere , when off duty on board , will prove as good a butler as any , besides being as satisfactory a messenger boy , table servant , managing purchaser or general delivery man as a whole host of similar individuals under other skies . If you are an artist , there is an ever available model for you , for he is generally remarkable for good looks . The extreme adaptability of the Venetian qondoliere makes him an invaluable help and a blessing within the limits of even moderate incomes . For let me tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Venetian home on less than  | half the cost of a New York home , with half the worry and three times the fun . by only indulging its little whims , by surrendering to its agreeable requirements , by admitting its pleasant indiosynerasies . Probably , it is not lighted by gas or electricity , but then , the sun is so bright and the moon shines so clear ! Possibly , it is not heated by steam radiators ; but then , when does the thermometer ever sink below zero ? Certainly , it will not boast of an elevator , and the chances are one to a hundred that it has electric bell appliances . But it has a back door on the have a garden with masses of tangled roses and sweetscented eaprifolium and cascades of wistaria . It . has a front door on the sunniest and shadiest , the merriest and loveliest , the most entertaining and picturesque of waterways , a Venetian canal . You may watch the maid going through the street door to the great fisheries and the markets below Rialto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marble balustrade of your little terrace , and superintend the purchases which she makes much as the steamship passenger on the piers at Naples makes his . Only . in Venice , in place of your Neapolitan anchored liner you have your steady Venetian home , and the floating shop is piled high with jars of fresh spring water from inland , baskets of crabs , fish of every description from the sea of Chioggia and the cliffs of Dalmatia ; or the ripe , luscious fruit . whose reflection tinges the dark green waters of the canal with streaks of purple , splashes of pink and arabesques of gold . You may , according to your pleasure  | and the location of the house , raise the street door to the dignity of front and consign the canal door to the duties of hack door , with the result that through two open gates does the subtle charm of Venice enter both your home and your heart . But , let me repeat : when in Venice , do as the Venetians do . You could n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expect to be able to walk miles for exercise or lead the strenuous life : to not look for breakfast food when coffee and milk are the thing ; do not pine for doughnuts where the tradition of centuries has consecrated that daintiest of biscuit morsels , the bairobi ; do not plan to picnic off shady lawns with aerated water , brown bread or mince pie . This wo n't do , for it is not in the Venetian spirit . Inform your maid and your gondolier ( ' of your desire to have an outdoor meal , and let them manage it . You will probably wake up with a drowsy feeling of comfort and happiness , after an hour 's rhythmical splashing of oars , way out toward the giardini or the Lido , under a sunlit sky , on a sunlit expanse of water , the awning of the gondola affording a cool oasis of shade ; the gondola moored to a water shrine or beacon . Zuane , or Anzolo , or whatever his name may be , is spreading before you the Venetian meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , sweet wine from the hills of Vicenza , luscious fruit which the p e o t a from Mestre landed that very morning at your canal door ; baicoli , and , if you like it , iced coffee . You may after- ward wander at leisure through the lagoon and the tiny islands , returning to the city when the Piazza San Marco begins to light up with the glare of the electric lamps and the glimmer of crystal and the sparkle of dazzling jewelry and glassware in the show windows ; and the crowds parade all around , while the government band plays , and fill the open air ea ff e with their politan , and yet how exclusively Venetian it is ! Perhaps , out there in the harbor , some illuminated yacht is lying at anchor , well known to the fashionable world through a princely or imperial banner , or the monogram and colors of an American sportsman , and the party from the ship comes across in smart clothes and hundreds of little chairs and tables , the facade of the cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold and opals against the pale sky . Truly , Venice is delightful , not only for its historical associations and the treasures of the past , but also for the charm of its modern life . How brilliant , how gay , how broadly cosmo- gay spirits , and parades with the rest , up and down the asphalt pavements , watching the sights and enjoying the sounds : perhaps the latest P and 0 has just come in from Calcutta or Bombay , and a stray easterner or two , an occasional Armenian or Turk , adds a note of color to the general harmony . And you may perhaps catch a glimpse of Don Carlos , the pretender to the throne of Spain , with his huge dog , or of the princess of Montenegro , or the queen of Greece , or some Austrian archduchess , strolling leisurely about and enjoying themselves as freely and as thoroughly as any . Life is charmingly simple and unostentatious here . But you have a chance to see the underlying sumptuousness and refinement when some society leader , bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestral palace and welcomes you at the top of stairs once trodden by senators and doges , the very stairs , perchance , that Desdemona might have ascended in her days . Only , instead of the rulers and warriors of old , a prince of Savoy may be the guest of honor , and there stand in brilliant groups , with clinking sabers and shining epaulets , the jaunty Italian officers , army and navy , vying with each other in splendor of appearance and smartness of attire . And the sight when you reach or leave some fashionable entertainment ! A crowd of gondolas push past each other and completely fill the whole available water space , until you wonder why they do not crush each other and how they do manage to float unscathed while one gondoliers after another brings up his slender craft alongside the great marble steps so snugly and so closely that you step out of your gondola with greater ease and grace than you possibly could out of your carriage . The doors of palace or theater stand open and flood with light a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting and passing , each heralded by a tiny red or yellow lantern on the prow , and occasionally by the sharp shrill tones of the gondoliers . Of course you may walk to the theater ( never to a private entertainment ) and amuse yourself by picking out your way at night through the most puzzling intricacy of little alleys and byways and bridges that ever confronted the cleverest topographist . For , being a city of canals , and not renouncing in the least the additional convenience of ordinary streets , Venice must be also a city of bridges . In fact , Venice is just as emphatically a bridge city as it is a water city . It is also a pigeon city , for the sake of beauty and tradition ; and a cat city . for the comforts of everyday life , pussy naturally amounting to the numbers and dignity of a public convenience where rats and moles are plentiful . By the way , gentle reader , do n't tell the accurate and particular housekeeper how common it is , on stepping out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water , from the steps of your Venetian home , and to see the disappointed face of pussy wearing a look of puzzled inquiry . You were quite right , pussy ; it was n't frogs ; it was some nasty , mean rat .  |
