txt CHAPTER VII THE CONTOUR MAP *50 . CONSTRUCTION OF A CONTOUR MAP PART I. ? The region selected should have steep and gentle slopes in proximity . Materials needed : drawing pads , ruler , compass , protractor , and some kind of a level . Two things must be decided on before mapping : the scale and the contour interval . The scale indicates the distance on your map that will represent a given distance of your area . If the area is small , a scale of 20 feet to the inch is convenient . This is expressed by the fraction A-4 . The contour interval will vary with the heights to be represented , but an interval of 5 feet is convenient , since that is about the average distance from the eye to the ground . It is well to measure a straight line on some level portion as a base line , SIB , Figure 8 . From this base line points can be determined in two ways . If the point is near and easily reached , as points C and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B , the distance measured , and the points determined on a map by a protractor and ruler . For instance , if C is south , 6o // west 20 ? and 15 feet distant from B , it is located by drawing on the map an indefinite line from B at the proper angle , and then laying off the distance according to the scale adopted . If there is a more distant point which is not con veniently reached , its angles at A and B can be found by the protractor , and these plotted on the map until their sides meet and the point D is located . Various mem-hers of the class can get distances and directions from trees , etc . A and B and these other points can be plotted later if desirable . When several points have been located , e.g. trees , rocks , etc. , the work of locating the contours can be begun . At the lowest place in your area , say , point X , let some one stand at X and level to different places on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pieces of paper ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) . The leveling can be done with an instrument or by looking across the water in a tumbler . The points 1 , 1 , 1 , all lie on a plane about 5 feet above X , and these points can be located as described above . Many of them can be put in with // sufficient accuracy by sketching . When enough have been located , connect them , and you have your first con-tour line . A second can be made in like manner , by standing at one of the points 1 and repeating the process , locating points 2 , 2 , etc .

How far is // it from Mud Creek north along the Lockport-Millersport road to the 600-foot line ? To the 620-foot line ? To the 640-foot line ? Make a profile along the road from Millersport to the 640-foot line . ( Starting at Millersport , measure to the 580-foot line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Draw a line this long on your cross-section paper . Measure the distance to the same contour line across the Figure creek . Let each vertical square on your paper represent 20 feet . We can not tell the depth of the creek between the contours , except that it is not 20 feet . Why ? From this line measure to the next 580-foot line at Mud Creek . Here , again , we do not know the depth of Mud Creek below this line , so we are at liberty to put it at any depth below one square as we think best . ( See Figure 9 . ) From the contour north of Mud Creek to the 600-foot line is 2 inches and one square higher . From this point to the 640-foot line is 11 6 inches and a square higher . The profile will be as shown in Figure 9. ) // You will note that the vertical scale is different from the horizontal scale . Which is the larger ? What fraction expresses the horizontal scale ?

Where is the stream water clearest , in places of swift or slow current ? Why ? Is there any gravel ? If so , of what material ? Is it angular or round ?

Are the valley sides perpendicular , nearly perpendicu70 MANUAL OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY lar , or sloping ? If sloping , is the slope uniform ? What is the average slope of the valley sides ? ( Hold a clinometer so its base coincides with the sky line of the valley slope , and read the inclination . A common protractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made on the inside of your notebook cover , Figure 11 . A button or half of a bullet will make a good weight . ) Is the slope at the bottom as steep as at the top ? Why ? Are there marked changes in the slope ? If so , are they due to a difference in rock ? Are the two valley slopes equally steep in the straight reaches ? In the meanders of the valley ? Are there cliffs ? If so , to what are they due : to differences in the rock or to stream work at the base ? If the former , make a sketch of the rock arrangement ; if the latter , explain in full .

Give all possible reasons for your answer . Do the slopes of the valley sides change as you go up ? How ? Why ? Make cross sections of the valley in its lower and upper portions . Select a short valley , level up the valley as described in Exercise 50 , and , from your data , plot a longitudinal profile of the valley . Is the curve as a whole concave or convex to the sky ? Where is it steepest ? Where least steep ? Why ? Are there any sudden changes in the curve causing rapids or waterfalls ? If so , explain the cause . Does the tributary stream enter the main stream at grade ? Can it erode below the level of the main stream ( its local base level ) ?

Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve steeper in the vicinity of B than in the vicinity of A ? Why ? These type curves require a homogeneous material . If your region is composed of materials of different degrees of resistance , the curves will be complicated , but can usually be recognized . Note the hills and valleys along the route of your field trip . Where , near the top or near the bottom of the hills , are weathering curves prominent ? Corrasion curves ?

Measure the distance up the valley side to the next contour line , transfer the distance to your coordinate paper and you have , say , point 2 . In like manner get points 3 , 4 , and 5 , as in Exercise 50 , Part II . Connecting these points , you have a profile of one side of the valley . When the other side is completed , the two profiles give the valley cross section . ) Which part of the valley has longest been subjected to weathering ? What relation has this fact to the width of the valley in various parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower and in its upper part . ( Use cross-section paper , allowing each small square to represent one or more contour intervals . // If the relief is great a small square may represent several contour intervals so as to avoid too much exaggeration of altitude . The horizontal scale of your section is true , but your vertical section is exaggerated . How much is it exaggerated ? In such work the exaggeration should be the least possible and yet bring out the essential details . The student must develop his judgment as to the exaggeration of the vertical scale . ) In which portion of the valley , the upper or the lower , are the slopes the steepest ? Account fully for this . How long is the valley ? How far is it in a straight line from its mouth to its head ? What is the altitude at or near its head ? At or near its mouth ? What is the average slope per mile ?
