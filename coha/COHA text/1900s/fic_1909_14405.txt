April . SCENE .  --  MARK EMBURY 'S study ; a low raftered , ungainly room ; a casement window at back C. open , with vines trained round the outside ; at R. 1st E. a door with a brass disc and a small catch to indicate a spring lock ; the furniture is plain to severity ; two or three straight-backed wooden chairs , writing-table up R.C. ; rough cabinet at L. ; small wooden bench at L. ; rough shelves with scientific books ; a draughtsman 's table upper L. with carpenter 's tools ; some stuffed animals and birds on shelves ; maps and charcoal drawings on walls ; globular charts , etc. , on writing table ; an oblong kitchen-table with drawer at R. end down near C. ; table has on it implements for chemical experiments , etc. ; also a small spirit lamp , burning ; table is placed at a slight angle in the direction of the door ; the floor is bare . At rise of curtain PETER is tidying the room with the aid of a mop ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up , but continues to sweep towards the bench ; the knock is repeated impatiently ; PETER leans the mop against bench , crosses slowly to R. , releases the catch and opens door ; MRS . DEBORAH , a portly dame , appears on the threshold ; she wears cap and a black apron . MRS . DEBORAH ( impatiently ) Peter , I vow you are worse than a scullery wench when it comes to wasting my precious time . I want that mop . ( she takes a step forward ) p. 3 PETER ( waving her back ) Bide there , and I 'll bring it to you . ( fetches it . ) This be sacred ground up here , and housekeepers is forbidden to trespass . ( bows ironically ) MRS . DEBORAH ( snatching the mop ) Drat your impudence . One 'd suppose I was a kitchen wench instead of being a reduced gentlewoman with a line of forbears . PETER That 's the point . You be a gentlewoman , not a gentleman , and Mr. Embury can not abide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said that a burnt child dreads the fire , Mrs. Deborah , and I 've heard it put about that some years ago a lady of fashion  --  MRS . DEBORAH Tut , man , it 's beneath a woman of my family to listen to idle gossip . ( quickly ) Would she be light or dark , think you ? ( PETER shakes his head and turns to C. ) I warrant she was one of your gay fly-by-nights . Philosophers always take to that kind , just to balance their wisdom , and keep them fools same as the rest of mankind . PETER Not so loud , Mrs. D. ; the master 's gone but to the garden gate with his nephew , Captain Lovell. ( he spies a small object on the floor ; he picks it up , goes to the window and examines it ) p. 4 MRS . DEBORAH ( following him by R. of table R. ) What is it you 've found , Peter ? It looks like a woman 's miniature . ( edges nearer to get a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who could have dropped it , think you ? PETER Nay , Mrs. Deborah , If I were to tell you what I think , why , then you 'd be as wise as I. ( looks out ) Quick ! Mr. Embury 's coming back with Captain Lovell . No , ' tai n't the Captain who 's with him now , but Mr. Goodlake. ( hustles her to door ) MRS . DEBORAH ( going out ) I 'll not break my neck , not I , for all the men in Christendom . ( exit ) PETER looks at the locket , hesitates ; then , hearing voices outside , puts it in his pocket . MARK EMBURY ( outside ) Careful , neighbour , the steps are shallow . Enter MARK EMBURY , followed by ROGER GOODLAKE ; EMBURY is plainly dressed , almost to asceticism ; his hair , which is somewhat long , is without powder and tied with a ribbon ; he is about forty-two years old , and has a grave but kindly manner ; GOODLAKE is about fifty-five ; he is fashionably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , and carries himself in a vigorous and sprightly fashion ; he speaks emphatically and in a loud voice ; EMBURY crosses behind table to chair L. of table . p. 5 ROGER GOODLAKE ( panting for breath ) A devilish staircase , Embury , and better than the family Bible for discovering a man 's real age . ( looks round the room ) Strike me if it is n't the old hayloft , you 've turned into a study ! What 's the meaning o n't ? MARK EMBURY ' T is merely a device to ensure a stricter privacy . My work has suffered much from interruption of late . PETER brings a tobacco jar from cabinet upper L. , then pipes ; he places them beside GOODLAKE , who proceeds to fill pipe ; PETER retires up R. to table ; GOODLAKE sits on chair R. of table R. ROGER GOODLAKE Gad ! I remember . Joanna has told me something concerning the arrival of a housekeeper . ( laughs ) Mark Embury , the hermit , with a female flunkey in his retinue . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you yet . But what has set the ball a rolling ? MARK EMBURY All in good time , Roger . ( turns and goes up C. ) Get you below , Peter . You may leave the door open . The draught will scatter the fumes of Friend Goodlake 's ungodly weed . ( exit PETER R. carrying off pail and duster ) ROGER GOODLAKE ( laying pipe aside ) I 'm not much in the humour for It to-day . In truth I 'm vexed  --  sorely  --  damnably vexed ! About a lost miniature . A portrait of Joanna . The handsomest woman in Europe , though she is my wife . I could have taken oath I left it in my cabinet when I set out on my journey six weeks ago . ( EMBURY sits in chair L. of table C ) p. 6 MARK EMBURY I trust you find your lady in flourishing health . ROGER GOODLAKE ( enthusiastically ) Fresh as a newly opened rose , and uncommon pleased at my return , I wager ' t is not every truant spouse who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not every one who deserves it . ROGER GOODLAKE True , though I 'll take no credit . When a man possesses a pink  --  a pearl  --  a paragon  --  ( pauses irresolutely ) I could sometimes wish Joanna were a little less vivacious , though it is not unnatural in one of her years . ( lights pipe again ) MARK EMBURY Do not lay on Nature the faults of Society , friend Roger . If women are in general feeble in body and in mind , it is the fault of our modern education ; we encourage a vicious indolence , which we call delicacy . We teach them useless arts . We breed them to insincerity , and then we wonder at their fickleness and duplicity . ( rises and goes up C. ) ROGER GOODLAKE Ah , I 'd forgotten , I was putting a spur to your hobbyhorse . You are for training the youngsters like savages in a hut . MARK EMBURY ( coming down C again ) I 'd have them instructed in simplicity , and Nature is the only dame who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ) I had a relative who put the scheme into practice , with but poor result . MARK EMBURY He started too late , maybe . ROGER GOODLAKE Ye Gods ! The child was but three weeks old . MARK EMBURY Much too late . He should have begun with the mother . To make great men , one must first perfect a women . ( going up C. ) ROGER GOODLAKE ( boisterously ) God ' Of all your mighty theories , ' t is the best yet . MARK EMBURY ( at back of table R. ) Suppose I told you it was my design to put it to the proof ? ROGER GOODLAKE ( laying down his pipe in astonishment ) Mr. Embury , I should say you had gone mad  --  stark , staring mad . MARK EMBURY ( laying a hand on GOODLAKE 'S shoulder ) Nay , dear friend , I am sound enough , and being sound it is my duty to perpetuate my race . If I can perform that duty scientifically , I satisfy a rational curiosity , the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOODLAKE So you 'd marry for an experiment , eh ? p. 8 MARK EMBURY All men marry for an experiment , friend , though they have n't all my altruistic excuse . ROGER GOODLAKE Whate'er the excuse , ' t is a venture that 's hedged with disappointment . MARK EMBURY Because passion is allowed to replace judgment . ROGER GOODLAKE True , but damme if I can see where you are better equipped for the game than the rest of us . MARK EMBURY ( smiling ) One who has already passed through the measles will , it is popularly believed , be thereafter impervious to the disease . My love days are passed , old friend ; ergo , ( smiles ) I am ripe for marriage . ROGER GOODLAKE ( laughing ) And the required attributes of the future Mrs. Embury ? MARK EMBURY She must have a taste for the sciences ; be chaste , but not prudish ; simple as a mountain maid ; fearless as the Spartan wives  --  in short , with all the virtues of her sex , and none of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to find the creature ? MARK EMBURY It is a discovery that I have long despaired of , and so , as I have intimated , it is my intention to begin with the raw material . But the thing 's as good as done . ( takes a letter from the table at back ) Through my attorney I 've made application to the directors of the Foundling Hospital . Here is their reply . ( hands letter to GOODLAKE , and sits on chair L. of table ) p. 9 ROGER GOODLAKE ( reading ) " Dear Sir ,  --  The high moral probity of your philanthropic client is too widely known to admit of a doubt as to his honourably discharging his avowed intentions . On his agreeing to the conditions herein imposed we will send , in charge of our Matron and the Beadle , several girls , from among whom he may choose a ward . " ( laying paper on the table ) What are the conditions ? MARK EMBURY ( reading from another sheet ) " Should the said Mark Embury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , he must bequeath to her an adequate allowance . Secondly , a nurse , governess , or female custodian of respectable antecedents must be engaged to reside in the house , to preserve the social amenities . " ROGER GOODLAKE That then explains the Housekeeper . MARK EMBURY ( nodding ) A lady of a prodigious pedigree . ( resumes reading ) " Thirdly , the girl must be apprenticed to a married man , residing in the vicinity , who will give bonds for the fulfilment of conditions one and two . " ROGER GOODLAKE And where in all Hampstead are you going to find this accomplice to your cracked-brained scheme ? p. 10 MARK EMBURY ( rising ) He is already found . ROGER GOODLAKE H 'm  --  I warrant he 's not respectable . MARK EMBURY ( going behind table R. ) His name is the synonym for all the virtues . ROGER GOODLAKE The devil it is ! MARK EMBURY His language is apt to trip when he is heated , but he is a most worthy gentleman and they call him Roger Goodlake. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a burst of passion ) But damme ! I wo n't do it . MARK EMBURY ( L. of table , smiling ) You 've done it . Your name has been accepted , and it is your proud privilege to assist in the selection of my  --  of our  --  ward . ( looks at his watch and comes down L. ) The samples will be arriving shortly . ROGER GOODLAKE By Gad , Mr. Embury , this is a pretty advantage to take of a man in his absence . It 's  --  it 's  --  monstrous ! ( his passion gradually subsides into a chuckle ) Monstrous absurd . ( sits ) Oh Lord ! Training up a child on Philosophic pap , or every Gentleman his own Wife-raiser. ( laughs ) I trust you 'll deck her in becoming loin clothes . Ha-ha-ha ! p. 11 MARK EMBURY Nay , do not scoff , Roger , for never was a man more earnest , or more hopeful than I. ROGER GOODLAKE But it 's your stupendous audacity , thinking to remould a bit of human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the twig is bent the tree is formed . ROGER GOODLAKE Bending the twig will never make a willow of a poplar . Is it your plan to inform the girl as to your ultimate intention ? MARK EMBURY No . That had best remain a secret for the present . ( goes down L.C. to seat L. ) ROGER GOODLAKE Then I 'll not tell Joanna . ( rising and crossing toC . ) Lord ! That reminds me I 'm intrusted with a commission . It concerns your nephew , Captain Lovell . Joanna , whose maternal instinct is surprising in one of her years , has , it seems , had her sympathies aroused on behalf of your scapeprace . EMBURY goes to bookcase for book , then sits at L. MARK EMBURY How comes Mrs. Goodlake to be acquainted with my nephew 's supposed injuries ? ROGER GOODLAKE She has it from her cousin , Sir Harry Trimblestone , that Lovell is being plaguily ill-used by you , in consequence of some scrape the youngster has fallen into , and her tender heart is for pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I regret having to deny aught to a lady  --  and your wife , but Captain Lovell received my ultimatum in this room , scarce half an hour ago . ROGER GOODLAKE By your look there is more behind the fence . What 's he been after ? ( smiles ) Is it a woman , think you ? MARK EMBURY ( rising gravely ) . I fancy there is generally a woman , friend Roger . ROGER GOODLAKE ( chuckking ) Lord , you 're right . But how ' t would shock Joanna . I wonder who is the baggage ? PETER appearing at door . PETER Mistress Goodlake ( GOODLAKE turns to PETER ) dasires to know whether she may venture to intrude . MARK EMBURY Beg her to come up . PETER withdraws . EMBURY paces up and down . He is down L. asJOANNA enters . ROGER GOODLAKE ( proudly ) Mark you , Embury , she can not bear me out of her sight for ten minutes . ( quickly ) Perhaps she has found the miniature . ( goes excitedly through door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T is a devil of staircase for beauty 's feet to climb . Take my hand  --  so . ( he leads JOANNA in ; she is about twenty-eight , fashionably dressed , and with an air ot supreme vanity . GOODLAKE kisses her hand. ) p. 13 JOANNA GOODLAKE ( in front of door , pettishly ) There , there , Mr. Goodlake . You all but stepped on my gown . ( curtseys to EMBURY ) So polite of you to allow me to come up . ( looks round ) And what a sweet , romantic place . ( EMBURY bows coldly . JOANNA goes C. ) ROGER GOODLAKE ( R. impatiently ) You 're brought news of the miniature , Joanna ? JOANNA GOODLAKE ( petulantly ) The miniature ! Will you never have done harping on that miniature . It has probably been cast on the heath with the carpet shaking . What think you , Mr. Embury ? Is it not poor taste in him to regret so much the portrait when he still has the original ? MARK EMBURY ' T is not uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all proportion to its worth . ( down L. ) Will you be seated ? JOANNA GOODLAKE ( sneeringly ) You are vastly polite , sir . ( sits R. of abl ) It seems as if Mr. Goodlake had been gone an age , so desolate have I been in his absence . ROGER GOODLAKE ( at her R. teasingly ) What of the trips to Ranelagh , that Harry let on to ? p. 14 JOANNA GOODLAKE Fie , Mr. Goodlake . Your credulity is amazing . protest I scarce left the house . ROGER GOODLAKE By the way , I have mentioned to Mr. Embury your concern for his black sheep of a nephew . ( EMBURY sits at L. ) JOANNA GOODLAKE ( shocked ) My concern ! Mr. Goodlake , you do not word it very circumspectly . If I seek to intercede . Lord knows ' t is in a motherly sense . ( sighs ) You 'll not be too severe on him , Mr. Embury . ' T is all the fault of his creditors . ( quickly , in answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me . MARK EMBURY I think you implied just now that your cousin 's word was not reliable . JOANNA GOODLAKE Not where we poor women are concerned perhaps . But Captain Lovell is quite another matter . Since he has incurred your displeasure , it most wrings my heart to see  --  ( EMBURY turns quickly ) I mean  --  to hear of his dejection . MARK EMBURY He has an opportunity to change into an Irish regiment , and so wean himself from the allurements of his present surroundings . JOANNA GOODLAKE ( with concern ) But ' t would be a pity for him to desert so bracing a climate as Harapstead . Moreover the Dublin society is quite notorious for its immorality . Surely you will not cast so impetuous a youth  --  for so does Harry describe him  --  in the way of temptation . p. 15 ROGER GOODLAKE Hark to her , Embury. ( laughs ) I swear she 'd mother all the young rascals from hare to the dockyard . Come , what do you say ? ( crosses to C. ) MARK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place my nephew as far from temptation as it be possible . Mrs. DEBORAH appears in the doorway . MRS . DEBORAH The foundlings are arrived , sir . MARK EMBURY Conduct them here . MRS . DEBORAH retires ; EMBURY places book in case and comes down L. ; foundlings heard tramping off R. ROGER GOODLAKE ( going to JOANNA and raising her up ) Here is balm for your maternal soul , Joanna . Neighbour Embury is taking a girl from the Foundling to train and educate . JOANNA GOODLAKE ( with in difference ) A girl ! I have no monstrous liking for girls . ( goes up C. by L. of table R. ) GOODLAKE goes to EMBURY 'S R. Enter MRS . DEBORAH ! she goes up to JOANNA C. BEADLE ( heard off ) Now then , get into line . Girls heard marking time . Enter MATRON of the Hospital followed by the BEADLE , a pompous little man , and a string of the girls , ranging from eleven to sixteen years of age . p. 16 BEADLE Ready to stop  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexions and are all dressed in the Foundling uniform ; some have closely cropped heads ; the tallest have their hair tightly plaited excepting LITTLE BRITAIN , who comes last but one ; her hair is in curls tied back ; the MATRON arranges the girls in an oblique line , then turns each girl to face , finishing up with number ten , occasionally prodding one with her umbrella ; this over , the BEADLE waves the MATRON aside and steps into the foreground ; LITTLE BRITAIN , who is stationed last but one R. , continually twitches her shoulders . BEADLE Now , then ( to girls ) Now when I say three , show your manners , co-incidentally . One  --  two  --  ( one girl makes an abrupt curtsey ) Look at that . There be a pretty piece for a object of charity . ( MATRON shakes her umbrella at the offender ) Once more . One  --  two  --  three ! ( they all bob together , except last at right end , who is rubbing her eyes with the corner of her apron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRITAIN nudges her neighbour , who furtively slaps her in return , then bobs ) Well , what are you so subsequential for ? 10TH GIRL Please , I 've got something in my eye . p. 17 BEADLE Then you 've no business to have things in your eye . This ai n't a half holiday . ( LITTLE BRITAIN jerks her shoulders ) Number nine , stop wriggling . ( MATRON shakes her umbrella warningly . BEADLE turns ) Which gentleman is the guardian presumptive ? ( EMBURY bows ) Then , sir , the inquisitorial may proceed . ( goes down R. ) For their healths and constitutions there 's Mrs. Witchet. ( the MATRON curtseys ) For minds and morals , here is me . MARK EMBURY ( steps to C. then turns . To GOODLAKE ) Go you for ward . Roger , and question the maids . ROGER GOODLAKE Nay , go you . It is your funeral , not mine . MARK EMBURY ( nervously ) I  --  I  --  fear I scarce know how to put them at their case . ROGER GOODLAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. ( goes to tenth girl at R. and chucks her under the chin ) Damme , but you 're a prodigious fine wench . JOANNA GOODLAKE ( peremptorily ) Mr. Goodlake ! ROGER GOODLAKE Coming , Joanna , my love . ( he goes up to window. ) p. 18 MARK EMBURY ( timidly going to 1st GIRL ) What is your name , child ? GIRL ( with a bob ) Bevis Marks . MARK EMBURY ( nervously ) Ah , yes , yes . ( moves to number tow ) And yours ? 2ND GIRL ( bobbing ) Stepney Green . ( He passes along the row in some dismay . As his eye catches each GIRL she bobs a curtsey , and calls out her name. ) 3RD GIRL Clare Market . 4TH GIRL Highbury Barn . 5TH GIRL Charing Cross . 6TH GIRL Ivy Lane . 7TH GIRL Great Turnstile . 8TH GIRL Leicester Fields . 9TH GIRL Little Britain . 10TH GIRL Amen Corner . MARK EMBURY ( Down R. in astonishment ) Heavens ! And who gave you those names ? ALL G. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Godfathers and Godmothers in my baptism , wherein I was made  --  BEADLE exclaims violently " Ush ! ' Ush ! ' Ush ! " and pounds with his stick to invoke silence . They cease . GOODLAKE comes down by L. of BEADLE . p. 19 BEADLE ( to EMBURY ) ' T is our Hospital 's custom to call them after the localizations they come from . ROGER GOODLAKE ( L. ) Hang me , if it is n't monstrous ingenious . Come , Embury , . choose your district . ( lowers his voice . ) Number Five suggests an equable climate . MATRON A trifle weak in the chest , sir . Whereas Leicester Fields is  --  ( points to 8th GIRL . ) BEADLE ( waving MATRON aside and crossing to L.C. ) A healthy tartar . Take my advice , sir do n't have a red-headed one . Now if you want an uncommon fine waif you ca n't do better than Stepney Green . ( moves over to table R. and points to No. 2 . ) ROGER GOODLAKE I swear her countenance would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid next the end there appears straight and sound of limb . ( points to LITTLE BRITAIN ) MATRON ( shaking her head ) Aye , she ' s sound enough . MARK EMBURY ' T is an engaging face , suggesting many possibilities . p. 20 BEADLE A mask for her deviltries . ( LITTLE BRITAIN turns her profile ) MARK EMBURY Her hair is longer than the others . MATRON She 'll ne'er stand still to have it cropped . MARK EMBURY Bid her come hither . ( BEADLE advances to C. ) BEADLE Little Britain ! Ready to step forward  --  Step ! ( he goes down R. ; she comes twitching her shoulder . ) MARK EMBURY How old are you , Little Britain ? ( she mutely glances at BEADLE ) BEADLE Sixteen , Sir . MARK EMBURY You are tall for your age . Do you think you would like to live here , and be my ward ? ( she looks at the BEADLE ) BEADLE I warrant she 'd like it well enough . MARK EMBURY ( to LITTLE BRITAIN ) Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEADLE ) He likes doing it . ( she twitches her shoulder . ROGER GOODLAKE She seems troubled with St. Vitus ' dance . ' T is a malady not uncommon in the young . p. 21 MARK EMBURY Tell us , have you long been afflicted with these twitchings ? ( she shakes her head ) Do you know aught of the cause ? PEGGY Yes . There 's a pin sticking in my back . EMBURY turns to GOODLAKE who laughs boisterously ; MATRON places her umbrella against table , goes to LITTLE B. and removes pin . MARK EMBURY She appears to be a straightforward and simple girl , so if she be willing , we may regard the matter as settled . ( crosses to R. C. GOODLAKE follows ; BEADLE R. produces a document which he hands to EMBURY , who glances over it with GOODLAKE ) MATRON ( to LITTLE BRITAIN ) Hark ye , child , to your vast good fortune . ( LITTLE BRITAIN puts her apron to her eyes ) There , there , you 've naught to fret at . Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be troubled with you no more ( draws her aside ) I 've got somewhere a bright new sixpence . ( feels in her pocket ) Ah , here ' tis. ( gives it ) Remember always to be humble to your betters and comb your hair straight at the parting . Now give me a kiss , ( embraces her ) And promise never to forget that you had the honour to be brought up a foundling . ( she turns to the girls whom she arranges in line ready for departure with faces turned towards the L. ) p. 22 MARK EMBURY Go you , Roger , with the Beadle and seal the contract . ( GOODLAKE and BEADLE go to the door ) MATRON Mr. Nole , we 're waiting for the word . BEADLE ( turning ) Ready to march . March ! ( exeunt BEADLE and GOODLAKE . The MATRON marshals the girls round by L. of table ; they bob a curtsey to EMBURY as they pass ; LITTLE BRITAIN follows them to door and embraces each one who goes out , except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then suddenly repenting she embraces her . Exeunt girls and MATRON ; LITTLE B. follows to door R. MARK EMBURY ( when the girls are all off ) Come here , Little Britain . ( she approaches and he gazes at her seriously ) I 've a mind to call you Peggy . May I ? ( she nods ) ' T is a name I much admire . Think you as Guardian and ward we shall suit ? PEGGY ( curtseying ) Yes , sir , I think you 'll  --  you 'll do . MARK EMBURY ( smiling ) I promise to earn your esteem if effort can secure it . ( turns to C. ) p. 23 PEGGY ( impulsively seizing his hand ) And you wo n't cut off my hair ? MARK EMBURY Nay , I think not . ( withdraws his hand ) You are nervous , Peggy . We must practise repose . ( leads her to bench ) A few passages of Homer repeated in a measured  --  but I fancy you are not acquainted with Homer . PEGGY Homer ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling ) They are not altogether dissimilar in their conclusions . So you know the tables ? PEGGY Up to five times twelve . MARK EMBURY Then repeat them slowly till I return . Mrs. Deborah . ( MRS . D. comes down a step ) This is my ward . I commend her to your good care , Mrs. Goodlake. ( goes to door ) I 'll not be long , Peggy . ( exit ; MRS . D. comes down with JOANNA from behind table ) MRS . DEBORAH ( looking at LITTLE B. from R. of table ) A sad sight , ma'am . JOANNA GOODLAKE ( down C. staring at her ) It puts one in the vapours to look at the hapless creature . p. 24 MRS . DEBORAH She has a sweet face . JOANNA GOODLAKE That 'll be no passport to her keeper 's favour . I warrant he 'll make her do penance for every dimple . The Ogre ! ( LITTLE B. begins to cry ) MRS . DEBORAH See , ma'am , you 've affrighted her . ( going to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till you 're hurt , and come what may , Mrs. Deborah will be your friend , so give a Kiss ( kisses her ) JOANNA GOODLAKE ( coming down and thrusting MRS . D. aside ) Mercy , but my commiseration for one is like to make me forget there la another who stands in even greater need of consolation . ( sighs and produces little looking-glass and powder-box from her pocket ) I pray you , girl , hold this , that I may take a glimpse at my rueful countenance . ( LITTLE B. take glass and gazes admiringly at JOANNA as she settles her skirts and powders her face ) I declare I 'm a fright . ( sighs ) Such are the ravages of grief  --  especially a grief we ca n't discourse on . Lower , girl , lower that I may see my waist . ' T is proclaimed by one who knows the smallest in the world . ( LITTLE B. lowers the glass , still gazing at JOANNA ) The child is lost in admiration of my gown . ( puts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t is a brief acquaintance she 'll have with silk and satin . ( laughs ) Sackcloth gives better service , and the wearer 's attention is not distracted from the sciences . ( laughs ) Good-bye , child . I look to you , Mrs. Deborah , to loosen the bars sometimes and let the prisoner visit me , for her relaxation . ( exit through door ;  --  outside ) Mercy ! These stairs . During this scene MRS . D. takes letters from table R. to table upper R. , then goes to table down R. and arranges it ; she then follows JOANNA off and pulls the door after her ; it closes with snap ; PEGGY , as she is now to be called , looks round the room and realising her loneliness begins to cry ; she checks herself presently as she remembers her task . p. 25 PEGGY ( mechanically ) Twice one are two  --  twice two are four  --  twice three are si  --  ( her attention wanders to the appointments of the room , and she looks round with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not open , sinks on the floor and covers her face with her apron ) A head is seen outside the casement window and CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL , clinging to a vine , peeps in , then he raises himself to the sill , throws his leg over and cautiously enters ; he is a handsome fellow of about 23 or 25 , clad in regimentals ; not perceiving PEGGY he begins hunting about the floor ; while he is half under the table , PEGGY utters another faint cry for help ; he puts his head out and starts . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Hillo , there ! ( PEGGY removes her apron and stares return ) Hillo , Missy , who the devil are you ? PEGGY ( rising and bobbing a curtsey ) I am Mr. Embury 's ward . I 've just been adopted . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( rising and laughing ) Just been adopted . No wonder you cried for help . PEGGY It was because the door would n't open . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Scared by a spring lock , eh ? ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm puzzled to divine how a man with no creditors came to think o n't . Reassure yourself , Missy . Uncle Admirable means you no harm . He is gentleness personified to all save one . ( bows ) Yours to command is most uncommon deep in his black books just now . p. 26 PEGGY ( looking at window ) Did you come through there , air ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Yes . ( laughs ) What are you looking for  --  my wings ? We latter-day spirits have no need of pinions to fly from a dun 's persistence , or to our own undoing , ( looks about the floor ) I suppose you have n't seen anything here-abouts of a locket with a portrait on the front . PEGGY ( shaking her head and kneeling on the floor ) Let me look . You 'll spoil your beautiful clothes . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( laughing ) ' Pon my soul , you 're a diverting little piece . So you admire my trappings , eh ? PEGGY ( gravely ) They are very handsome , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sword ) Madam , ' t is clear you have a discerning eye . Permit me to salute you . ( salutes with hand ) PEGGY ( approaches him ) Could you open that door ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I warrant I could , though I scarce perceive the immediate necessity , unless you are still afraid . p. 27 PEGGY I am not afraid now  --  while you are here . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Then you 'd best invite me to remain . Come , ask me to sit . ( she looks up timidly , then suddenly bursts out with her forgotten task ) PEGGY Twice one are two  --  twice two are four  --  twice  --  CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Whoa ! Halt ! What new game is this ! PEGGY It is my task , sir . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL A fig for your task . ( crosses to R. , then turns to her and slowly backs her towards bench L. ) And by the way , my name is not sir , but George  --  George Lovell . What is yours , pretty one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Peggy . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Then sit down , Peggy , and let us talk . ( she sits on bench L. , and he sits on chair R.C. ; he smiles ; she smiles ) So you 're not afraid of me ? PEGGY Not a bit  --  George . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Yet I 've been told I 'm a dangerous fellow , and within the hour too . PEGGY Do you always enter at the window when you visit Mr. Embury ? p. 28 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( laughing ) Nay , I mostly prefer the door , but I came in to seek for something that has escaped my pocket . The friend who gave it me will be much concerned if I do not bear it on my journey . PEGGY You are bound on a journey ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( nodding ) My pulse has been a little feverish of late , and I am ordered a change of climate . ( springing up impatiently ) Gad ! But I do n't take kindly to the medicine . PEGGY Then what causes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the foremost of all causes , Peggy . I 've been running with a petticoat . PEGGY With a long petticoat ? ( he nods ; she looks at her own ankle skirts ) It is hard to run with a long petticoat . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL It is harder not to , sweetheart . ( going towards her ) If you promise not to tell , I 'll describe her to you . Blue eyes with dark lashes , and arched brows . Bewitching hands and feet , and the daintiest waist ever imprisoned by brocade . PEGGY Is her name Joanna ? p. 29 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL What ! You 've seen her ? ( she nods ; he goes down R. C. ) She 's been here to beard the lion as she promised . With little result , I 'll be bound . PEGGY Is she sorry you have to go away ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Sorry ! ( comes back to C. ) I promise you she 'll weep her eyes out . PEGGY And the old gentleman , will he weep his eyes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce guarantee that . Old gentlemen have but little sympathy with the object of their wives ' sisterly regard . PEGGY You are her brother then ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( nodding ) By adoption . But I 'd ask you not to make gossip of the fact . Since you are to live here you 'll see much of sweet Joanna . Sweet sister Joanna . ( goes up to window and PEGGY crosses to R. C. ) Her house lies yonder . ( points and kisses his hand towards it . ) PEGGY ( R.C. ) It must be beautiful to have a brother . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( coming down L. ) It is , coz , it is. p. 30 PEGGY I wish I had a brother . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL H 'm  --  you may have some day . PEGGY Is Mr. Embury any  --  anybody 's brother ! CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( shaking his head ) He 'd like to have been once , but she jilted him . PEGGY ( trying to pronounce the word ) Jilted ! CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Yes , jilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and womankind . PEGGY ( anxiously ) Will you come back when the fever is cured  --  George ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Perhaps . PEGGY How long will it take ! CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( down L. ) My sentence calls for two years , confound his heartlessness . PEGGY ( crossing close to him ) Could n't you get cured without going away ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( looking at her amusedly ) Maybe I could pretty one . ( he motions her to sit ; she sits R. end of bench ; he sits L. end . ) But poor people can not do as they will . p. 31 PEGGY Are you poor ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Fairly out at elbows , except we reckon by debts . PEGGY You should pay your debts . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL With what , sweet Peggy ? I swear you are a condiment for the most jaded appetite . PEGGY You mean you have no money . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL The oracle has spoken . PEGGY I will lend you some . ( rises and goes to C. and produces her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parting gift , but I 've never had so large a piece , and should not know how to spend it . Why do you not take it ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I scarce think it would go far enough to satisfy all my creditors and ' t is unwise to create a jealously. ( she looks disappointed and sits in chair R. of table ) I thank you for the offer pretty coz. ( goes to table and sits on it ) I 've a notion that given the opportunity we 'd have been good friends . You remind me of a song I sometimes chant to the harpsichord . It runs thus , Peggy .

( there is a noise on the stair ; PEGGY goes to door R. ) ' Sh ! I must be gone Uncle Admirable would not favour this mode of entrance to his study . ( she motions him to open the door ; he goes to it ) Wait , I 'll first raise the catch . It goes stiffly , and one must employ a knack . ( he quietly moves the catch on the door , then runs to the window , climbs out , and putting his finger to his lips , disappears ; she sits demurely on the bench and commences her tables ; a step is heard outside ) Enter EMBURY . PEGGY rises . MARK EMBURY Ah , Peggy . ' T was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you manage to loosen the catch ? ( she goes to L.C. ) ' T is somewhat hard . ( pause ) How did you accomplish it ? PEGGY I employed a knack . ( she curtseys ) MARK EMBURY Do not curtsey thus , child . The manners of society have no place in our curriculum . ( PETER appears at the door ) What is it , Peter ? PETER ( coming forward ) I 've been waiting till you should be alone , master . ( produces miniature ) I found this on the floor here . p. 33 MARK EMBURY ( taking it ) Here  --  when ? PETER Just after you and Captain Lovell went out . MARK EMBURY ( frowning ) Ah . By-the-by , I want a word with Captain Lovell . You 'll likely find him over at the Barracks .

No matter , we 'll do better by and by . Be a good girl , Peggy , and I will show you how to draw a circle and an equilaterial triangle . PEGGY ( quietly ) That will be nice . MARK EMBURY If there 's aught that excites your curiosity , I beg you 'll satisfy yourself by judicious questions . p. 34 PEGGY What is jilted ? ( a pause ) MARK EMBURY Jilted ? PEGGY Yes , jilted . What does it mean ?

( PETER appears at door ) PETER Captain Lovell , master . MARK EMBURY Bid him come up .

CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( R. anxiously ) My friends have weakened your decisions ? MARK EMBURY ( Sits R. of table ) Nay , though they seemed vastly anxious to defeat your expedition . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL My friends , sir , would naturally be solicitous for my good name . To run away from one 's creditors is to mislead them in regard to one 's ultimate intentions . MARK EMBURY You may depart with a light conscience , for ' tla my design to pay these creditors . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Your generosity shall never be forgotten , uncle But these harpies paid , the necessity for my departure I removed . MARK EMBURY Nay , there are other  --  more serious dangers ( rises and turns to table at back for writing materials which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miniature and put it in his pocket ; EMBURY sight ) My resolution is unchanged , I 'd have you ponder well what you do with the next two years .

That little ornament you just now picked up . You may take it across to neighbour Goodlake , with my compliments , and say that either he , or his lady must have dropped it during his recent visit .

And now to lay our plans for your education . ( enthusiastically ) We 're going to substitute science for embroidery  --  the anvil for the harpsichord  --  the birds shall school us in song and the ants in architecture . p. 37 PEGGY ( with a lingering look towards the door ) And will you  --  will you  --  teach me how to write ? MARK EMBURY ( going to R. of table ) Aye , you shall do all that becomes a maid . Trained in sweet simplicity , unable to deceive . PEGGY Deceive  --  that 's jilted , is n't it ? I 'll try not to jilt you very often . But please let us  --  let us to the writing . MARK EMBURY ( choosing a pen ) The writing !

Nigh on twelve o'clock , ( rises and folds her work ; figure passes the window and a knock is heard at the door ) See who 's at the door , Molly . ( goes to press and places workbasket on it ) MOLLY opens door and KIT BARNIGER enters ; he is a quaint little , deferential , old-fashioned man , between 40 and 50 ; he carries a green baize bag , and a paper bag ; his attitudes are suggestive of a minuet ; Mrs. D. turns ) p. 39 MRS . DEBORAH By all that 's welcome , ' t is Kit Barniger , blown down from London , just as I am dying for news of the fashions . ( KIT lays his hat , green bag , and paper bag on the table , then gravely kisses MRS . D. 's extended hand ; she sees the green bag ) I declare you 've brought your fiddle .

( he hands her the green bag , and she places it in press and takes out a white apron , which she puts on ) Mr. Embury is all against the assemblies , and his neighbour , Mr. Goodlake , is up in arms about them . ( returns to C. ) But you 've not told me what is the latest style in petticoats .

( lays pad on table as MOLLY enters with flour barrel , board , and materials for the pastry , and then exits ) Sit you down , Kit . I 'd die of shame should Mr. Embury come in , and catch you with your toes outpointed so . KIT BARNIGER ( meekly obeying ) I fancy I observed Mr. Embury working in the garden . MRS . DEBORAH Aye , he 's trying to grow foreign plants according to a theory . KIT BARNIGER And his ward , Miss Peggy . MRS .

MARK EMBURY ( R. ) To be sure , and no better credentials could he bring , except he were but once removed . MRS . DEBORAH Thank you kindly , sir .

MARK EMBURY Much , if report speaks truly . He has lately taken an interest in our horticulture , and has sent Peggy some shamrocks from Ireland . ( thoughtfully ) This I take to be a promising sign . ROGER GOODLAKE H 'm  --  uncommon promising . And the maid ? MARK EMBURY ( innocently ) Is likewise deeply interested in the science . She has even sent specimens in return . ( rubs his hands ) Ah , I 'm progressing , Roger , I 'm progressing . ROGER GOODLAKE Ah , you 're progressing fast enough .

ROGER GOODLAKE H 'm  --  ' t was thus you reasoned when you adopted the young wench . MARK EMBURY ( R. ) And was I not justified ? Tell me , old Killjoy , where else will you fihd a maid who sets no store by ornamental dress ? Who has never seen her own reflection , save perhaps in a meadow pool ? Who  --  who is  --  ROGER GOODLAKE ( sarcastically ) " Fearless as the Spartan wives . " MARK EMBURY ( uneasily ) I 'll own I can not make her wholly contemptuous of danger .

She 's a woman , and thus predestined to mischief . The one safeguard is matrimony , and so you 'd do well to make her acquainted with your project . MARK EMBURY ( nervously ) She 's young yet . ROGER GOODLAKE That 's a fault she 'll overcome without your help . Dod 's man ? Now 's the time for you to act . MARK EMBURY And what if I 've begun already . ( GooDLAKE looks up ; EMBURY laughs ) Your curiosity makes me half a mind to keep you guessing . Nay , I 'll tell you . I 've bought the old South Cottage , on the other side of the hill .

Her cousin , Sir Harry Trimblestone , comes on a visit . ( goes up ) I 'll tell my man to bring over the basket of yellow turnips .

You are so much engaged , you could ne'er have had the time to find it out for yourself . You are not displeased , I hope .

PEGGY ( timidly ) ' T is something I heard a long time ago . MARK EMBURY Wo n't you sing it for me , with the words ? PEGGY I will try , if I may sing it while my back is turned . MARK EMBURY Yes , yes ( she sings shyly in a low voice verse of song sung by LOVELL in Act 1st .

Two learned people in a house , had like to make it rather dull , I 'm thinking .

PEGGY ( springing down ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her down ) I am bound for the ball at Belsize to-night in a mask , and Mrs. Goodlake 's second best Buttercup Satin . Ha , ha ! Just think of it . MRS . DEBORAH ( aghast ) You 're bound for Bedlam , I 'm thinking . What sort of madness is this ? PEGGY ( capering about , excitedly ) The sort that makes one want to peep at the gay sights . To laugh  --  to dance  --  to dress in a long train just once  --  and then to come back home and be good for ever  --  ever after . MRS . DEBORAH And think you I 'll be a party to any such  --  PEGGY clapping her hands over MRS . D. 's mouth ) Without doubt . ( forces her into chair , then kneels , keeping her mouth covered ) First , you 'll order Kit to take charge of me . Then , when Mr. Embury 's gone to be , and you 've helped me to dress , you 'll see me safe out by the side door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are fairly dying for a sight of me in Mrs. Goodlake 's Buttercup Satin . p. 58 MRS .

( proudly ) Why , there 's no such face and figure in all England . ( relenting ) And if I thought you 'd  --  you 'd  --  not be recognised . PEGGY ( flinging her arms about her and swinging her round ) I wo n't be recognised , I promise you . I must needs dress up my hair . MRS . DEBORAH ( L. suddenly ) The hair pad would help your disguise . ( goes to the table for it ) And put her Goodlake ladyship fairly out of countenance . ( produces it ) See , one pins it on , then the hair is powdered and stretched across . PEGGY ( clasping her hands ) Is n't it divine ? ( puts pad on chair near press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper steps . Ah ! Kit shall show me. ( she runs to lower door R. and shouts ) Kit ! Kit ! Come here at once . Enter KIT . p. 59 KIT BARNIGER Is the house a-fire ? PEGGY No , ' t is I who am a-fire , and I 've a mind to burn myself out , so no cold water . MRS . DEBORAH She is for going to the ball . PEGGY ( to KIT ) By Mrs. Deborah 's orders , and you 're to take me , but I must see I know how to move my feet to the latest tune . So do you play . ( she fetches the fiddle and thrusts it in his hands ) Quick , quick , dear Kit . Just fancy you are my partner , and I am your  --  your  --  lady-love . KIT BARNIGER Very well , Miss Peggy . Now , right over there , please . ( she goes extreme L. ) Right foot forward . Bend low . He strikes a chord , then makes an elaborate bow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gavotte time , not too slowly , dancing and calling out directions . This dance occupies in all about 32 bars of music . PEGGY gets rapidly into the spirit of the dance , and MRS . D. stands applauding . At the height of the scene the door is pushed open , and CAPTAIN LOVELL accompanied by SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE stands on the threshold . SIR HARRY is a dandy of about 35 . LOVELL looks a little older , but handsomer and more commanding than in Act I. p. 60 SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE ( R.C. , applauding ) Bravo ! Bravo ! PEGGY gives a loud exclamation , the music stops , and all turn in dismay . MRS . DEBORAH ( down L. apologetically ) My cousin Kit has a taste for music , gentlemen , and is for diverting himself and us once in a way . But I beg you 'll not inform on us . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( coming down c . ) We are dumb as oysters , Mrs. Deborah . ( she curtseys , then crosses , and taking KIT 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOVELL ( approaches PEGGY deferentially ) I ask your pardon for our intrusion . PEGGY ( L. coldy ) Oh , it does not matter , seeing you wo n't tell . TRIMBLESTONE has wandered down R. and is ogling PEGGY . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Since my uncle is not here , we 'll take our leave . SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE Hang it all , not till I 've been introduced . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( giving him an angry glance ) Permit me to prsent Sir Harry Trimblestone . My uncle 's ward , Miss Britain . p. 61 SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE ' Pon honour , I 'm charmed . We 're a pair of bunglers to have cut short that pretty fandango . Let 's have the old fellow out and start again . ( crosses to C. towards PEGGY ) Spun me , if I do n't join in the fling . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( swinging him back to R. ) Harry , stop it ! ( to PEGGY ) The rocking of the coach has shifted the few brains my friend started with . SIR HARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Beauty 's eyes . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( C. sternly ) Harry , stop it ! SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE ( nudging LOVELL ) Want to play the game alone , eh , Georgy ? Better let us cut for it . Well , I 'll give you the deal , but hark ye , play fair , and no cheating for the odd trick . ( bowing to PEGGY ) Au revoir , Miss Britain . ( she curtseys , TRIMBELSTONE goes up to door ) Oh , but you 're a sly dog , Georgy , a sly dog . ( exit ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Forgive me that I suffered that nincompoop to enter . That you would be the first to give me welcome , was a pleasure I 'd not counted on . p. 62 PEGGY ( smiling ) Faith , my memory must be very bad , for I do not remember having welcomed you at all . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Then ' t is not too late to repair the omission . ( smiles ) PEGGY ( archly ) True . And how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( makes a sweeping curtsey , and affects the tone of a fashionable lady ) I protest , Captain Lovell , that the sight of you is monstrous pleasing . Or like this ? ( takes the extended hand ) Oh , I can not say it if you look so serious . What is the matter ? Are you trying to recall my features ? I ca n't have changed so much . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( admiringly ) No  --  and yet , ' t is wonderful . ( turns ) PEGGY I 'm glad you think me improved ( goes to him ) You do , do n't you ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Improved ? Amazingly improved . ( approaching her ) PEGGY ( backing to table ) Do you still sing and play on the harpsichord ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( nodding ) When I find an inspiring listener . p. 63 PEGGY Ah , you remind me , I 've a letter for you . ' T was left in my charge . Shall I fetch it ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Nay , I warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( following him ) But I promised to give it to you . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( turning ) I 'd rather you gave me something else . One of those purple hyacinths , for instance . ( points to her bodice ) PEGGY ( shaking her head ) I 've given half away already . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL To a man ? PEGGY ( seriously ) To the best man in the whole world . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Did you keep the shamrocks ? PEGGY ( as if trying to remember ) Shamrocks ? ( carelessly ) Oh , yours . Of what use is it to keep withered blossoms when one may gather fresh ? ( takes advantage of his turn to dart to press and seize the green book . He turns abruptly , and she continues with embarrassment ) You had better let me give you the letter . It might contain a message from  --  er  --  from your lady love . ( she goes to the press and stands on a chair ) p. 64 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL It might if she existed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sister Joanna  --  sweet sister Joanna , has told me all about it . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( in alarm ) Joanna has told you ! PEGGY About your friend , your lady love . Yes . ( she gets the letter from the shelf ) Take your letter , Captain Lovell. ( jumps down from chair ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( taking it reluctantly ) Why do you call me Captain Lovell ? ' T was George two years ago . PEGGY Yes , but I 've improved since then . " Amazingly Improved . " ( enter PETER at back . He carries a large square basket . He is about to cross to R. ) What is it , Peter ! ( she lays the book down ) PETER A basket sent over from Mr. Goodlake 's . ' Twill likely be the yellow turnips . PEGGY Leave it here , so I may attend to it . ( PETER places basket down and goes out at back . Until he is off she stands with her finger on her lips , smiling mysteriously at LOVELL , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastenings , and peeps within , then springs to her feet , and claps her hands ) It is ! It is ! It is ! p. 65 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( in perplexity ) Is what ? PEGGY You swear you 'll not tell my guardian ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( solemnly ) I swear . PEGGY It is a prodigious secret , and very wicked . I am going to the Masquerade Ball to-night , and Mrs. Goodlake has lent me a gown . See ! ( she opens the basket and pulls out a yellow satin gown , a mask , and a jewel box , and a pair of *atin shoes ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL You 'll not go unattended ? PEGGY To be sure not . ( proudly ) I have an escort . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( starting ) An escort ! How dare the fellow presume ? PEGGY But ' t was no fault of Kit 's . I insisted , and Mrs. Deborah would trust me with none other . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( slightly mollified ) Oh , it 's Kit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object if I played deputy . PEGGY What ? Are you then going to the ball ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL If you are . p. 66 PEGGY ( coldly ) You forget . Your lady love might object , I 'll go with Kit , I thank you . And meanwhile I 'll leave you alone to read your letter . ( she gathers up all the finery in her arms , then after curtseying , she goes off upper R. ; she returns immediately and seizes the green book which she had forgotten . She places it on the bundle in her arms and again goes off ; LOVELL glances carelessly at the letter in his hand , then he opens it . He is standing now by the empty basket ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Nay , I 'll not read it , but send it whence it came . ( crushes the letter , tosses it into the basket and shuts the lid , then kicks basket over to R. ) That shall be my answer . Enter EMBURY at back . MARK EMBURY ( warmly ) Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. , going forward ) Your humble servant , sir , ( starts on looking at EMBURY ) I swear I 'm under a spell , or the pendulum has been swinging backward . Everyone I meet seems to have been touched by a magic wand . MARK EMBURY ( innocently ) Strange , yet I fancy I 've remarked it myself . ' T is probably the salubrity of the climate  --  or the water . Our water is uncommon pure . We face the north , but that is corrected in my new abode . p. 67 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL So you 're shifting quarters , sir . MARK EMBURY ( goes to chair R. of table nervously ) Yes , the truth is , I 'm contemplating a change in my mode of life . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Indeed ? MARK EMBURY ' T is a man 's duty to marry , George ; he owes that much to  --  to  --  CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL To his offspring . True , sir , I take yours to be a sudden resolution . MARK EMBURY On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worthy Mrs. Deborah , it was but the first move in a well considered plan . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL So the lady is already an inmate of your hous ? ( EMBURY nods ) Is she aware of your intentions ! MARK EMBURY Not yet . Though I venture to hope she will not be averse to them . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I give you joy , uncle . And from the little I 've seen of your future wife , I take the liberty of pronouncing it a most sensible choice . MARK EMBURY There is some disparity in the matter of years . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( cherrily ) She 'll be the better qualified to do her part . p. 68 MARK EMBURY ( placing a hand on LOVELL 'S shoulder ) And now we must to your affairs . This new venture will not disturb our compact . You were to receive a settlement on your return . If  --  if  --  Tell me , George , can you with a clear conscience , claim the reward ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( earnestly ) I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , we 'll to the study . I 'd have the benefit of your judgement in the matter of wall papers . ( takes his arm and goes up c . ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( smiling ) Wall papers ! Had you not best consult the lady who is destined to gaze on them , sir ? MARK EMBURY No . I 'd take her by surprise when all is finshed . ' T is hard to choose a flower or colour for one who loves them all . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Yet she 'll surely have a preference . Think . MARK EMBURY To be sure . It is the purple hyaci*th. ( he unconsciously touches those in his coat ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( starting ) The purple hyacinth ! p. 69 MARK EMBURY Yes . She wears them in her bodice . ( LOVELL averts his head , overcome by his discovery ) Come , let us search the patterns . ( LOVELL remains stupefied ; EMBURY opens the door ) What is it , lad ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Nothing , sir , except I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden . MARK EMBURY Alone ? ( laughs ) Faith , ' t is as if we changed places . Mark Embury , the flighty youth , with stern George Lovell for his uncle . ( Goes out . LOVELL gives a glance at the door R. then with a heavy sigh , strides to back and exits ) ( PEGGY now peeps from the door upper R. then enters ; she has put on the satin gown ; it is too large , and she excitedly tries to adjust it to her figure . She carries the mask and jewel box , after placing them on table , she fetches the looking-glass from press , and hair paa from chair , returns to the table , places the looking-glass again** the small flour barrel , which is still on table . She then kneels , pins the hair pad on , and stretches her curls across it ) PEGGY ( surveying herself ) ' T is elegant , but where can I procure the powder ? ( she sighs , rises , and catches sight of the flour barrel ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which she daubs her hair ; Next she tries the mask , then removes it ) Now for the ornaments . ( opens the jewel box ) I warrant she will have jewels  --  his lady love . I would I could outshine her . ( takes out a pair of carrings ) Earrings ! How beautiful ! If only I could wear them . I wonder if it is so hard to make holes in one 's ears . ( she runs to MRS . DEBORAH 'S workbasket , which is in press ; she finds a long needle , then returns to the mirror , where after one or two feints she plunges the needle into her ear , and immediately gives vent to a loud shriek . ( Enter LOVELL quickly at back . She turns and faces him defiantly. ) p. 70 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I thought I heard a cry . PEGGY Yes . I met with an accident . I stuck a needle in my ear . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Go and remove that gown , I beg of you . PEGGY ( petulantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it is to fit . ( archly ) Think you it becomes me ? ( crosses to R. trailing and surveying her train ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( L. ) Uncommonly well , yet you must not go to the Masquerade in it . PEGGY ( R. ) In what then ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL In nothing . ( quickly ) I mean you must not go at all . PEGGY ( conquettishly ) Unless I go with you . Is that it ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I  --  I  --  can not . I dare not take you now . PEGGY ( astonished ) Indeed ? Yet ' t was only a short time since you seemed so anxious . Perhaps it is that you 've had news since then . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Yes . I have had  --  news  --  since then . p. 71 PEGGY What news ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ' T is not for me to tell you . PEGGY Yet it is on this account you dissuade me from the ball . ( he gravely nods ) Then maybe I fathom it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would claim your whole attention . Was that the message in the letter ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( perplexed ) The letter ? ( suddenly remembering ) Oh , I know not what was in the letter . I did not read it . PEGGY ( quietly ) Then you are not going to marry her ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Her ? PEGGY The lady Mrs. Goodlake did refer to . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( smiling ) No . There is a most decided obstacle . ( aside ) Thank God ! PEGGY But you will marry somebody  --  some day ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Oh yes . If Fate decrees it . But I warrant you it will be no love match , now . PEGGY What for will you marry then ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( recklessly ) Who knows ? For money  --  position  --  to please my uncle , may be . ( laughs bitterly ) Yes , that 's it , it shall be for money , Peggy  --  for money , and my uncle may choose the bride . p. 72 PEGGY In the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I must forego it , and so must you . PEGGY ( hotly ) And if I refuse ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Then I must try and forget that you have made me your secret confidant . PEGGY You will tell my guardian ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL You know that I will never do so . PEGGY ( lightly ) Then I shall go . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Then I must go with you to see you come to no mischief . PEGGY What ! You 'd make a duty of it . Nay , I 'm not inclined to have your sacrifice . ( laughs , half hysterically ) I warrant you . I 'll not go begging for a partner . ( storming ) How dare you think I ever meant to let you take me ? ( playfully ) You must have a fine conceit of yourself . ( Begins to cry ) You may go  --  or stay as you please , but I vow I 'll not speak to you the whole night , and so you may be free to enjoy your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be there , and so shall I , mark you . ( stamps her foot , still crying ) So shall I. ( The back door opens , and EMBURY centers . PEGGY has her back turned , but hearing the door open , she quickly goes off upper R. ; and as EMBURY comes down he is in time to catch a full view of the yellow silk train , as it escapes through the door . His brow contracts , and he looks as LOVELL as if for an explanation . There is a pause . EMBURY carries in his hand small rolls of wall paper ) p. 73 MARK EMBURY I Thought you went to walk in the garden . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I returned . MARK EMBURY ( with a motion towards the door R. ) You dismiss your visitors rather unceremoniously . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( quietly ) I have had no visitors , sir . MARK EMBURY When neighbours come to wait upon my household  --  or myself , they are not ashamed to go out by the chief door . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARK EMBURY Neither my ward nor my housekeeper are wont to drag a couple of yards of silken train behind them . ( angrily ) I protest , sir , against having my house used for candlestine meetings . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL And I deny having used it for such a purpose . MARK EMBURY Then the lady who had so evident a wish to remain undiscovered , was  --  CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I can not tell you , uncle . MARK EMBURY Your answer is sufficient . That this intimacy remains unbroken is vile enough . ( raises his voice ) But that you should have given me the lie just now  --  should have sought to trick and cheat me , that I might replenish your resources , is  --  p. 74 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( emphatically ) Hold , sir ! Enter GOODLAKE at back . ROGER GOODLAKE Hallo ! Who is it that 's training his lungs for the post of town crier ? Gad , is it you , Lovell ? Then I 've missed the coach and Harry too . ( to EMBURY ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have but this moment left my study , but Captain Lovell may be able to tell you . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I have not seen her . ( EMBURY stares at him with contempt . Enter MRS . DEBORAH lower R. with table cloth , which she places in press ) ROGER GOODLAKE Have you seen aught of my wife , Mrs. Deborah ? MRS . DEBORAH Aye , she was here a short while since . She left by the side door and went across the yard . ( exit R. ) ROGER GOODLAKE Got tired of waiting for me , I 'll be sworn . Come back home with me , Lovell , and break the back of her spleen . MARK EMBURY ' T is impossible . Captain Lovell is suddenly recalled to town . He leaves here on the moment . p. 75 ROGER GOODLAKE ( in surprise ) Eh , what 's that ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( proudly ) It is as my uncle has said . I leave this house on the moment . I bid you good day , Mr. Goodlake. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( goes out abruptly ; GOODLAKE raises his eyebrows and whistles ) ROGER GOODLAKE What 's up , man ? Has he been poaching on your preserves ? Strike me , if I have n't expected it all along . ( EMBURY gives him a silencing look , and he quickly changes the subject ) Well , did you get the turnips ? ( turns and sees basket ) Yes , and damme , if they have n't sent ' em in my best travelling hamper . ( crosses to R. ) Here , help me unload . ( pulls basket towards him and slightly raises the lid ) Why , ' t is unloaded already . Then I 'll bear it back . MARK EMBURY Let Peter carry it . ROGER GOODLAKE Nay , if a man would have no tricks played on his property , he 'd best keep his eye o n't . As for you , Mark Embury , you take my advice . Marry the baggage , and so put her out of harm 's way . ( goes up to door ) Remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid schemes of Mice and Men gang aft agley. " ( exit . EMBURY closes door after GOODLAKE , then goes down thoughtfully to table , and unrolls his patterns of wall paper ) p. 76 MARK EMBURY Poor Roger ! ( enter PEGGY B. She has resumed her ordinary attire ) Ah , Peggy ! I am glad you are come in. ( looks at her tenderly ) Do you know why ? ( unrolls paper and places it on the table ) PEGGY It is because you are alone . Of late you have not cared so much to be alone . MARK EMBURY You 've noticed that , have you ? ' T is strange how a man may change , Peggy . Aye , even a Philosopher . PEGGY Are you a Philosopher , guardian ? MARK EMBURY I 've held myself to be such . ( timidly ) But there are times when I am crossed by  --  by doubt . PEGGY ( reflectively ) I 've noticed the doubts too . MARK EMBURY ( smiling ) You have grown to be aminute observer . PEGGY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising ) And you love me ? ( eagerly ) PEGGY Indeed I do . MARK EMBURY ( fervently ) God bless you , pretty one . ( places his hand on her head ) p. 77 PEGGY ( beginning to cry ) Oh , please do n't . MARK EMBURY ( startled ) Why not ? Why not , Peggy ! PEGGY ( crying ) I do n't deserve it . I am so  --  so monstrous wicked . MARK EMBURY ( relieved ) Dear , dear , dear . Is that all ? So you are monstrous wicked , are you ? ( smiles and places a chair , which he takes from writing-table at back ) Perhaps your morals will grow stronger , if they 're allowed to sit . ( she sits ) PEGGY ( suddenly ) I promise you I shall be quite good tomorrow , and ever  --  ever afterwards . MARK EMBURY ( in mock seriousness ) Then I do n't know but what Satan is entitled to to-day . ( he takes chair from large table and sits near PEGGY ) You remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you . PEGGY I fancy I have since divined it . You planned to surprise me , did you not ? MARK EMBURY If you are not surprised , then will my task be easier . Have you ever dreamed , child ? ( she nods ) So have I. Some time ago I dreamed an all absorbing dream . It involved the training of a girl to my idea of perfect womanhood . In working out my plan I may have strayed somewhat from the letter of my intention , but the spirit I preserved . ( touches her hand carelessly ) Yes , the spirit is preserved , for the maid is all  --  all  --  ( with a little sigh ) well , all I wish her . Still my design is incomplete , till the maid becomes a wife . ( softly ) So you see it rests with her to waken me , or bid me dream on  --  happily on , for ever . ( rises ) I had not intended to tell you my dream story so soon , but it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you should have a more absolute protection than that of a mere guardian . ( goes down L. C. ) p. 78 PEGGY ( thoughtfully ) And is that why you sent for him to come here ? MARK EMBURY ( turning ) Sent for whom ? PEGGY ( in a low voice ) Captain George . MARK EMBURY Not precisely . Though ' t is true that , believing him worthy , I just now confided something of my plans to him . PEGGY ( starting up ) You told him what you had in mind ! ( EMBURY nods  --  she droops her head ) And the news shocked  --  disappointed him , did it not ? MARK EMBURY On the contrary , he seemed well pleased . PEGGY ( looking up ) You mean that he agreed ! ( her eyes flash ) Ah ! You offered him money  --  money ! MARK EMBURY I promised him a settlement . PEGGY And for that he pretended he was willing  --  ( aside ) to marry me . MARK EMBURY I scarce see the importance of his opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your willingness . The delicacy of my position renders it impossible I should plead with , or urge you , for a sense of gratitude might impel you to that which would render you miserable . And so , pretty one , if you say yes , your heart must echo your tongue , else you will make me wretched also . Look at me , child . See how I hang on your reply . p. 79 PEGGY ( bewildered ) Am I then to give it to you ? MARK EMBURY Surely . To whom else ? PEGGY ( shaking her head ) Then it is  --  is  --  No ! ( his face falls ) I 'll form no part of his plan to get money . Tell him that I do not love him . ( EMBURY looks startled ) Nay , that I hate him  --  hate him . ( bursts into tears , then turns on a sudden impulse ) But do n't  --  do n't  --  let him believe it . Oh , you understand . ( throws herself in a fit of hysterical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  I  --  understand . ( to himself ) " The best laid schemes of Mice and Men . " ( he stands calmly gazing into space , and stroking her hair gently , as the curtain falls ) @x ( dropping the girls ' arms ) Nay , my charmers , I never take more than one partner at a time . I 'll to the cardroom and cut , to see which of you , diamonds or spades , has first choice of me . Group at sofa laugh and chat ; SIR HARRY exits upper L. and is greeted with shouts from within : " Ha ! Here 's Harry ! He 'll change the luck . " " Throw him out . " " No , no , " etc . The two girls glance disdainfully after SIR HARRY ; one says " The idea  --  but who cares ? " the other says " Not I. " An old Beau now enters at back ; he approaches them and says , " Ladies , can you tell me  --  ; " they seize him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll tell you , " the other " Better , we 'll show you ; " they run him off to ballroom ; group follows and stands in entrance . Enter at back KIT BARNIGER with his fiddle ; he is accompanied by PEGGY in the yellow satin gown and powdered hair ; she carries her mask . p. 81 KIT BARNIGER ( going down R. ) Come along , Miss Peggy . PEGGY ( L. , excitedly ) Oh , ' t is the divinest place under heaven , Kit . Though I had not thought there were quite so many people in the world . You must find me a partner . KIT BARNIGER ( perplexed ) A partner ? PEGGY To be sure , and right quickly . And hark ye : he must engage to pay me most marked attention ; so go and procure me a pleasing young man , no  --  old man  --  no , young man  --  ( turns ) which , think you , is the more dependable when it comes to making spurious love ? ( music starts a gavotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they are equally proficient there . ( group exits to ballroom ) PEGGY ( going to back and looking off R. ) Look at the millions of lights . And hear the music . Oh , Kit , it is more diverting even than church . ( he moves down R. , she follows closely ) You are not going yet ! ( he halts ) It is n't that I 'm frightened . ( tremblingly ) But I  --  I  --  like not to be left alone ( she draws him down C. ) Two more enter from back and exit to ballroom . p. 82 KIT BARNIGER No , no , but the dance is on , and I am much belated . ( he begins mechanically to move to the music ) Oh , dearie me ! Wait ! I 'll find you a seat near the musicians , where you may sit and watch . PEGGY ( tossing her head ) Faith ! I 'm not come to ball to sit in a corner and watch ; so hurry and capture me a partner . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. , overhearing ) Spun me , but that were an easy task . ( starts ) As I live , ' t is the little Britain ! ( bows and comes between them ) PEGGY ( suddenly ) Why , you 'll do splendidly . SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE Do ? I 'll wager I 'm done for already . Shall I have the honour of the next gavotte , most lovely Peggy ? PEGGY In truth you shall . ( crosses to R. ) You may go , Kit , Sir Harry will take care of me till you return . ( aside to KIT ) If I take fright at him , I 'll scream out . ( exit KIT , R. ; turns ) You are surprised to see me here ? SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE ( L. ) A meeting with Hebe herself had not more staggered me. p. 83 PEGGY ( R. , shaking her head ) I am not acquainted with Hebe , but your cousin , Mistress Goodlake , is she not here ! SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE Joanna ! Lord , I wager not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper place . Why , then are you here yourself ? SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE There 's a difference , my pretty one . Hang me , if I do n't believe you stole away on the chance of meeting me . PEGGY ( laughing and backing ) Think you that ? Then you are even a sillier man than I first conceived you . I believe I came because one who had no right to my obedience ventured to forbid it . SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE Was it Mr. Embury ? PEGGY ( loftily ) No . Had he forbidden me , I should not have come . And that is why I took care he should know nothing about it . ( two girls and a man cross at back from R. to L. , pausing an instant at the opening ; LOVELL appears at the back , he stands looking among the promenaders ; PEGGY turns and sees him , she then turns to SIR HARRY and runs on in a loud voice ) You flatter me , Sir Harry .

SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE ( C. ) It is , and curse you for a meddler . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL It seems I 've just come in time  --  in time to relieve you . Miss Britain will be my charge for the rest of the evening . ( crosses to C. ) SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE ( L. ) You ride a high horse , sir . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( significantly ) I ride nothing I 'm not master of . SIR HARRY TRIMBLESTONE ( smiling ) Except your temper , eh  --  Georgy ? I 'll return anon  --  and claim from Miss Britain the fulfilment of her promise  --  ( bows )  --  till our gavotte . ( exit to cardroom ; there is an embarrassed pause , then LOVELL turns to PEGGY very authoritatively ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( L. ) You will put on your mask . PEGGY ( R. ) I will , when it so pleases me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had gone to London . p. 85 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Pardon me , but you knew to the contrary . Your obstinate determination to come here  --  PEGGY Compels you to postpone your departure . ( he bows ) You are quite sure you are come here to look at me ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( brusquely ) Not to look at you , but to look after you ! PEGGY ( sarcastically ) I 'm profoundly grateful , but as I do not need your protection , you are excused  --  you are excused. ( she waves him away , he remains perfectly still , she moves towards ballroom , he follows her ; she halts abruptly ) Where would you go ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( folding his arms ) Where you go . PEGGY ( petulantly ) Then I go nowhere . I shall stay here . ( crosses to R. ; he bows ) Perhaps you 'd not object should I sit down ? ( he crosses behind her , takes the chair and places it with a jerk at her back ; then he fetches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pause ; business ) What did you say ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( R. ) I said nothing . p. 86 PEGGY ( L. ) ' T is a good plan when one knows not how to talk divertingly. ( pause ) It is an uncommon fine evening . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Is that my first lesson in the art of conversation ? PEGGY ( after another pause ) Why did you leave our house so abruptly to-day ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL My uncle gave me no invitation to remain . PEGGY But there was a dispute , was there not ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL He told you so much , eh ? PEGGY No ; he did not mention you . ( pauses and blushes ) Save once . And then , he wandered from the house ; nor have I seen him since . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Then how  --  PEGGY Before you left I heard angry voices , and the words " trick " and " cheat " reached my ears . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Do you know in what manner I cheated him ! PEGGY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Yes ; it was about a woman . PEGGY ( pauses ) The woman you are in love with ? p. 87 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Yes ; the quarrel was concerning the woman I am in love with . PEGGY Is she here to-night ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Yes . PEGGY Why do n't you seek her ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I have sought her already . PEGGY And can not find her . ( rises ) That is why you came to me . I pray you go and send Sir Harry Trimblestone back to me . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( rising ) I 'll do nothing of the kind . Harry is no fit companion for you . ( swings his chair back to its original position ) PEGGY ( laughing ) On that I do n't agree . I think him most bewitching . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( angrily ) Such an avowal should shame a girl who is all but betrothed . PEGGY ( raising her eyebrows ) All but betrothed ! CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL You must be aware that my uncle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hopes of  --  p. 88 PEGGY Oh yes , but I scarce favour the notion of having a husband chosen for me. ( crosses to R. ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( L. with a glance of hopeful expectation ) @x ( sobs ) In my regret there is some excuse , for to me he is a relative , or he will be to-morrow , and it is quite proper to grieve about a relative . MARK EMBURY ( heard outside ) Yes , yes , trim the hedge down . MRS . DEBORAH ( listening ) ' Sh ! Enter EMBURY from R. MARK EMBURY ( coming down ) And I was not here to greet you after all . Let me make amends . ( extends his hands ) Welcome . child , welcome to your new home . ( she timidly places her hands in his ) MRS . DEBORAH Everything is in readiness , sir Would you like that I should show Miss Peggy through the house before I go ? MARK EMBURY No , I thank you . MRS . DEBORAH Then I 'd best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of keys hung on a white ribbon ) I 've taken the liberty to string them on a white ribbon , and now I 'll be getting back . There 's much to do . ( curtseys and goes off R. ) p. 90 PEGGY Am I not then to go through the  --  through our house to-day ? MARK EMBURY ( nervously ) Yes , yes , child . But I have a fancy for you to see it first , accompanied by no one but  --  but your future husband . PEGGY Then shall we go now ? MARK EMBURY ( absent-mindedly ) Nay , not now . ( looks up ) There is plenty of time , dear one . ( cheerily ) And you have n't seen half the garden yet . I hope you like it Peggy . PEGGY Indeed , I like it very much , guardian . ( he looks at her with a quiet sadness ) I ask your pardon I remembered you desired me to call you by your first name , and try as I may , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try again ; believe me , I will . MARK EMBURY Nay , child , I do not wish you to do anything that costs an effort . And I am not sure but the word " guardian " has a gentle and more appropriate sound . PEGGY ( at extreme R. of bench ) ' T is difficult to break one 's habit , is it not ? MARK EMBURY Most difficult , and many things that seem easy at the start grow perplexing as one advances . Do you remember last night I spoke of a little talk we were to have ? ( she nods ; he sits beside her on bench ) By sleeping on the subject , I thought to tackle it more readily , but I could not sleep . And at sunrise I arose and went out in the meadows , and what , think you , was the subject of my meditation ? Come here , child . ( she sits nearer to him ) Peggy , I have been wondering if , in planning out your future , I have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right for your happiness . p. 91 PEGGY You have always acted for my happiness , dear guardian . MARK EMBURY ( shaking his head ) That is what I have told myself . ( smiles sadly ) But I 've lately been troubled with doubts as to my own veracity . PEGGY But all that has been pleasant in my life I owe to you . MARK EMBURY ( taking her hand ) Nay , dear heart , you owe me nothing . The happiness you have already bestowed on me is a dower that will last me all my life . ( PEGGY cries a little ) And remember this  --  always remember this . No relation that you might bear to me could enhance the tenderness in which I already hold you . ( rises ) And now we 'll say no more about these things , except that what must , will be , and what is , is right . PEGGY Then what you have planned for me , that must be right also . Do you fear that as a wife I shall disappoint you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife you will not disappoint me . And what I have planned is right , quite right . ( changes his tone ) But tell me of your new gown and bonnets  --  and fur-belows . Have they all been fashioned to your liking ? ( sits again ) p. 92 PEGGY Yes , and to yours , I hope . MARK EMBURY I warrant Mrs. Deborah has not forgot the rice and the old shoes . Such sacred functions will scarce brook neglect . PEGGY She fears only an insufficient audience . MARK EMBURY ' T is true our supply of guests is dwindling down . ( pauses ) Do you know that George Lovell proposes to leave us ? PEGGY ( quietly ) Yes . MARK EMBURY And that he proposes to go at once  --  to-day ? PEGGY Yes . MARK EMBURY It is my wish that he should stay . PEGGY Stay for  --  for our wedding . MARK EMBURY Yes . For our  --  stay for the wedding . PEGGY Have you asked him to remain ? MARK EMBURY No  --  I want you to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . MARK EMBURY Have you the courage to persuade him for his good , when the advice may cause you a little temporary pain ? p. 93 PEGGY ( quietly ) Yes . MARK EMBURY Then you shall ask him to give up his roving design . I would have him settle down at home . ( pauses ) I would have him  --  marry . PEGGY ( quickly , off her guard ) Marry ! ( half rises ) MARK EMBURY ( gently preventing her ) I have told you it is for his own good . Will you do it ? PEGGY Think you my words will carry so much weight ? MARK EMBURY If you speak them with conviction . ( takes a letter from his pocket. You may give him this . It will confirm what you may say , ( rises ) He 'll likely be here anon . In the meantime we 'll explore the garden . ' T is a rare old garden . ( leads her to R. ) But I am forgetting your keys . ( he hangs ribbon on her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the doors , and I promise you there is not a blue chamber in all the castle . Come , pretty one , let us to the garden . ( he takes her hand and they go off R. ; presently LOVELL enters down the centre path ; he looks about the garden ; PETER enters from the upper side of the house ) p. 94 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL So that is the new house , eh ? Is my uncle within ? PETER ( coming down a little ) No , Captain , he 'll be somewhere about the grounds , though . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I think his message bade me wait in the garden . PETER Yes , Captain . In the garden , near the arbour . This is the garden , ( points ) that be the arbour , and there be you . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL If you see my uncle , say that I am come . PETER Yes , Captain . ( goes off upper R. ) LOVELL walks impatiently to and fro ; presently he espies the black wrap , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he sees the green book on bench , he takes it up , turns the leaves and finds the withered shamrocks , he gives a look of pleased surprise , he half turns so that his back is towards R. Enter PEGGY ; she still has the keys on her arm , she gets nearly to the middle of the stage before she sees LOVELL , then she stops timidly , and turns as if to go back ; he turns and closes the book . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL I did not know that you  --  that I should meet you here . PEGGY ( with embarrassment ) No , I  --  I went to see the garden , but I remembered that I had left my book , and hurried back . ( holds out her hand ) I want my book . p. 95 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( indicating the book he holds ) This ? PEGGY Yes . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( with a slight frown and a constraint in his voice ) You did keep the shamrocks . PEGGY Yes , but I am not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may have them back ? PEGGY No . It was my intention to bury them , but in all the way along I found no likely spot . ( extends her hand again for the book ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( giving it , bitterly ) Such weeds sometimes have a knack of taking root , and springing up afresh . PEGGY Not when they are quite dead . ( opens book ) See , there 's severed leaves and broken stems . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( moving slightly away ) I 've a notion my uncle must have sent for me to admire the outside of his dwelling , since he did not ask me in . Perhaps you will repair his omission . PEGGY ( shaking her head ) I must n't . I do not like to . I 've not been in myself as yet . Mr. Embury has a fancy regarding my first inspection . ( looks back ) And he 's not here . But I know why he sent for you . ( timidly ) He wishes you to change your mind about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimated as much already , and already I 've declined . PEGGY But he thought were I to ask you  --  CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL Ask me what ? PEGGY ( nervously ) To stay at home  --  to settle down somewhere near  --  near  --  here . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( frowning ) And you  --  you would propose that ? ( advances to her ) PEGGY He assured me ' t would be for your good , and he always speaks the truth . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL My good , forsooth. ( goes up C. and laughs harshly ) It seems Mr. Embury has a passion for shaping other people 's destinies . Is there any more to his message ? ( turns ) PEGGY Yes . ( tremulously and lowering her eyes ) He would have you  --  have you marry . ( sits on bench ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( startled ) Upon my life ! ( stands off and looks at her ) And I once thought you had a heart . p. 97 PEGGY ( half crying ) Ca n't you see it is my task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so you would have me marry ? ( she nods slowly ) You urge me to it from a sense of duty . Ha  --  ha  --  ha ! ' T is a droll spectacle . You , my mentor and adviser . PEGGY ( spiritedly ) Indeed , I see nothing odd in that . You forget I am your aunt  --  or I shall be by to-morrow . ( rises ) CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( backs to L. C. , sarcastically ) Ten thousand pardons . I had forgotten the respect due to your venerable position . PEGGY ' T is not kind in you to ridicule me . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( angrily ) And pray , have you shown any regard for my sensibilities ? But continue , I beg . Your errand is n't finished . PEGGY I 've nothing more to say . CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL And am I not to learn the description or name of the lady my uncle has so generously provided for me . PEGGY He did not tell me . But he gave me a letter . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pocket ) p. 98 CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL ( waving it aside ) Read it , I pray you . ( she shakes her head ; he takes it , breaks the seal , spreads it open , then hands it back ) As my aunt it is one of your duties . ( she takes it , glances timidly at the page , reads the first few lines , then suddenly gives a little hysterical scream , drops the letter , looks round wildly , then runs off upper R. ; LOVELL turns in astonishment , then picks up letter ; reading ) " The affection that my dear girl entertains for you has long been known to me , but it is only of late since I have watched you in her company , that I have known this attachment was mutual . In the endeavour to secure my own happiness , I have tried to put my discovery behind me , but I can no longer cheat myself  --  nor you . Take with my dear one the little home she brings you , and if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in planning it , then my life 's experiment can not be counted a failure . Let no thought of me cloud your happiness . I am neither a martvr nor a hero . Bachelorhood has many charms to one of my temperament , and old habits are hard to break . " ( LOVELL looks dazed , then turns excitedly ) Where is she ? ( he goes up to R. , hurries off and returns immediately , leading PEGGY ; she has been crying ) You should not run away from me , because you are mine now  --  all mine . He has given you to me  --  to keep for ever . He means it . You must read it all by-and-bye , and then you 'll say with me , God bless him ! Come , look me in the eyes , and say you love me . Remember , ' t is for my good . p. 99 PEGGY ( looking up timidly ) Need I say it ? Saying is so hard , but  --  ( she pauses , and then gently puts her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she draws back timidly ) Would you like me to show you the house ? CAPTAIN GEORGE LOVELL May you ? PEGGY Yes , I may now . See , here are the keys . I 'm told the furniture is beautiful , and there 's a  --  ( with a pleased smile and lowered voice ) There is a harpsichord. ( he takes her hand , and together they enter the house ) Enter EMBURY from R. ; he walks slowly , with hands linked behind him ; as he reaches the house the harpsichord is heard playing the old melody , " My love is like a red , red rose " ; he halts a moment and then listens , while the two voices take up the refrain and finish the verse to the harpsichord accompaniment ; then he proceeds on his way , and goes slowly up the centre path ; when he comes to the little wicket gate , he passes it and closes it behind him , turns and facing the audience , he fastens the latch , gives one more glance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight ; the singing is still heard within as the curtain falls .
