IT was just such a morning ten years ago when they took the river road for Pangbourne : there was a remarkable amount of blue sky and yet no sun , a way the English weather has of accommodating itself to the color-loving American guest and its master , the more sombrely inclined Briton , Albeit there are many such days in summer , the middle-aged couple felt in their middle-aged bones that all signs were auspicious , and that this tin-wedding trip , from the fleecy cloud arrangement of the heavens to the bounding of their middle-aged hearts , would be a repetition of their first bashful attempt at journeying together . The couple in no ways looked upon themselves as middle-aged . Her hair was only " prematurely " gray , and what the vulgar might call " bald " was kindly admitted by his friends to be but the necessary expansion of a high foreheadNror , . CIVIL ? No. 707. - 92 to make room for higher thoughts . Once upon a time , when they were twenty-five ? or thereabouts , ? the , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreeable age ; a decade earlier it had seemed much older , and earlier yet , thirty-five was , it goes without saying , quite synonymous for senility . There was nothing in the attitude , at least , of this gay pair in middle life suggestive to the outsider that they had reached the stage when birthdays are not things to bruit about ? no , not even with the balm of gifts ensuing . Occasionally they were heard to assert , with a touch of defiance , that a woman was as old as she looked , a man as he felt , and this trite boast evidently gave them new confidence in the possibility of being what they wished , and they would go about sternly keeping very young and very prankish . It was at Pangbourne that the first blow fell . The hour preceding had been one of recollections and recognitions . Heads were wagged over the rows of stiff brick houses that were filling the valley of the Thames , hut , even so , one stile was discoverable where they had rested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one tiny garden where they could pick an armful for twopence . In excitement he dug her affectionately in the ribs , and for just an instant she remembered that in other days he had leaned over from his machine to hers and pressed her hand . But in other days they were pedalling on their way . To-day he kept his hands on the steering-wheel of a motor ear . If this difference had not occurred to the owners of the car , so gently had been their graduation from two wheels to four , the landlord of the " Swan " took in the situation at a glance . BangY went the taproom door , there was a scurry of skirts , and a becapped maid opened up the parlor and beckoned in the lordlyguests . This was a mournful proceeding ; for , since it is forbidden in America , there is no greater joy to her womankind than to sip a cup o ' kindness in the bar of pub or inn , unquestioned ? more , unnoticed ? one of the privileges of a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured perch , glass encased , in the parlor , as an intimation that there are as many good fish in the Thames as ever were made out of papier-mache ; also the date of the catching of that fish , and the announcement that tackle could be rented . The middle-aged couple laughed , for once the perch had hung in the common room , and , seeing it , they had fished an idle blissful day . Not till sundown did they discover the sophistication of the fry they sought- , every one of which knows well the difference between the tea-time crumbs of a rich punt 's table and the hooked worm . The bees-Toed maid was politely interested when the couple told her they had been there ten years before . She was but a little girl then , she said ( this , tight lipped , they refused to entertain ) , but she hoped the lady and the gentleman noticed the great , changes . The couple across the best mahogany sighed at this , looked longingly into the ' cheerful taproom , and replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their powers of observation , she went on to boast of the new American porch on the Thames side ; some day the master would run it all around the inn ? it would be fine for ten , as so ninny " trippers " on bicycles came there Sundays . Now the word " tripper " should not have frightened the tin bridegroom into diving hastily for change and driving on with his tin bride . Ten years ago these two were trippers also . Yet so inconsistent were the creatures that they would have their low estate of other days remain , as indeed an ideal should , in farperspective , even while they stretched greedily for all the joy of it . It is possible that there was more joy in the retrospect than in the actual occurrence , but the couple did not know this , and the gratifying of a ten-year-old wish is surely more satisfying than to supply hurriedly a momentary want . At Streatley , for instance , they motored straight to the inn on the river without discussion , for ten years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing the cost of a river hotel , they could only look at it wistfully from the bridge , conjecture what the proud ones were . eating , then trundle their wheels through the village until a Cyclists ' Rest. , quite full of trippers , came to view . And so this day , as they sat at the best table overlooking the water , they asked that the extra covers be not removed , and while there were two visible guests , four portions were devoured ; " for we are very hungry , " said the middle-aged couple to the astonished butler ; " we have been waiting ten long years to eat this luncheon . " A. little girl by the river 's edge was feeding the swans . From the bridge they had seen just such a child once before . Of course she was not the same little girl ; the maid at Pangbourne had taught them that ; but she brought back the memory of the first shy jesting as to their own probable family , and whether they would or they would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naturally , would be the first boy ( one could see they did not intend to stint themselves on children , whatever other luxuries must be denied ) , andafterwards would come a Peter and a Jane to save the family honor ; but not the first-born boy and girl they were to be the children of romance . A few years passed , and the jesting ceased , for there was no humor in the Douglas and the Dulcinea who were not . Then passed a few more years , and the deep-felt loss for what had never been ceased to be a poignant grief , and they laughed again over their family , while in some subtle , unadmitted way she became to him the Dulcinea , he to her was the small boy Douglas . On the way to Oxford they missed several landmarks , or came upon them suddenly as though the objects had run down the road to welcome their return ; but when the spires of Oxford shot into view a full four hours earlier than they had once before , the couple realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance , and that the horizon was the only bit of scenery a motor car could not devour in its mad haste . If this tin honeymoon is ever touched upon by the two most vitally concerned , they will slur over Oxford , the reason being that beyond a cup of tea in the yard of the " Golden Cross " they never left their engine . Once upon a time they lazed in the meadow , and looked with half-closed eyes from the young green of the grass to the the outside of the walls only would be his . Then , immediately conscience-stricken , smiled at the bride entirely , reproving himself that he could waver for a moment in the perfect wisdom of his choice . To-day , as she nicely discriminated between the tools in the motor chest , he felt himself all-wise . With gleaming eyes they hung over the exquisite adjustment of the tremblers , and , conquering the difficulty , drove on to Broadway ? classics , culture , Cupid , crowded out of their exultant mechanical hearts . The hills are immutable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same place beyond the vale of Evesham , as though refuting the charge that times of a stylish inn . Then there was a fourth pile of small change for the tips . If we do the thing at all , we ought to do it well , " the bridegroom had commented , and the bride nodded acquiescently . Night comes to Broadway gently . The after-dinner stroller lifts his chest and sniffs the sir with a proprietary manner ; for are not many of these great ones who have lived here of his own country ? and admitting the appealing beauty of the scene , he is content that they have become expatriates , since his own Broadway offers so little to the artist , save a market for his wares . Contrary to all expectations , the middle-aged couple slept that night in Stratford . Having traversed the street once in the twilight , once in the moonlight , while still twittering of the joy of it , the welcome simplicity , there came a call to arms from the open courtyard gate . It was but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a silent cry , but the possibilities of darting through the white lanes once more before they slept laid hold upon this couple who talked of simple living . Within the hour they were in Stratford , somewhat ashamed , laughing a little craftily at that old-fashioned bridal party they had left ten years behind in Broadway . As the tin bridegroom said in Stratford , there is little profit in growing old unless one 's made of china or of some such stuff . In a measure it must placate one to increase in value with one 's years . This was as he paid dearly for sleeping in a sixteenth-century bedchamber , where the floor waved like a ship at sea , and the ancurtained , Leaden-paned windows admitted twentieth-century sunlight at 4 A.M. We of this generation indulge in these absurdities to feel we are nearer Shakespeare ; but beyond a night of some discomfort ? the beds of the poet 's time were not of roses ? we still find a something more than ages in the gap between the bard and us . Nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cottage of Ann Hathaway lessen the void for the middle-aged couple . They were impatient of the ever-knitting girl , who bade them " look up the fireplace , look out the window , look in the chest . " Once before they had looked obediently with the rest ; now they fled to the garden , and , comparing fearful notes , discovered that they were nearer Shakespeare , nearer Ann , when they brought to memory the yielding virtues of the two happy lovers . This was an evil state of mind . Ten years before it had been their deep regret that the perfect poet could not be embodied in a perfect man . Now they breathed more freely as they basked in the thought of a fellow creature 's peccadilloes . In a fit of penitence they clogged the footsteps of the guide at Warwick Castle ? a sop to the first bride and bridegroom who had found the fee too large for an hour 's wandering . Decorously they traversed eight of the show rooms , an integral part . of the mule body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unvarying unit - without detached thought when the curator starts them on their rounds . At the ninth door the tin bride and bridegroom were beard to groan , " If we were but poor again , " and so startled was the custodian by this departure from the unit that an exit was devised , and the unfortunate incident closed with the shutting of the door of Warwick Castle upon the rebellious pair . Two hours later , the strength of their convictions reinforced by food and drink at the " Warwick Arms , " as they sat among the ruins of Kenilworth the couple admitted stormily that they were individualists ? each for the other i f could be ? hut firstly each one for himself . The far view was beautiful to them for the stretching of their souls ; men and women interesting for the purpose of contrast with themselves ; the old red walls of Kenilworth , crying of Elizabeth and Leicester , meant less to them as a historical ruin than its present beauty of line and color and sullen power . The man having confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman sighed for penance . This sinning and confession should not be so pleasant , " Once we accepted these things for themselves alone , " she said , sadly . " And now we are not content unless we shape them to our own lives , " he completed . " Is it because we are growing old ? " inquired the tin bride , still perplexed . " It certainly is not , " replied the tin bridegroom , stoutly . " It is simply this : mice we viewed the world from the outside ? longingly , you will bear in mind , though half afraid ; now we 've climbed into the hollow of it and are looking out . " " I think I 'm still afraid ? of going on , " said the tin bride , after a long pause ; " could n't we go back ? " But this time the tin bridegroom did not grasp her meaning . " Go back ? " lie echoed . " Why ? The road is good . Let us go on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the end of the tin honeymoon .
