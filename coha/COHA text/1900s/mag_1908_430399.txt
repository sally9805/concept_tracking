 |p577  The purloining of a red-hot stove has long stood as the classic example of a monumentally brazen theft . Was not the East the scene of that particular bit of ingenious " lifting " ? But now , as a sample of daring larceny that can compete with the stove episode , mark the spectacle that the West can offer ? the Vest , which has its own way of doing the unusual on a gigantic scale . Down where an invisible line upon the level prairie divides the Panhandle of Texas from the territory of New Mexico , in broad daylight , and before the astonished eyes of all men , with a gradualness that has made the agony long drawn out , there has been a barefaced , and far from unsuccessful , attempt to get away with a whole town . It was another town that did it , an eighteenmonths-old baby municipality of the boom variety . The town it preyed upon was itself an infant , since it was formed only five years ago . And the unique contest is still being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , is Farwell , Texas ; on the other , in New Mexico , defiant , but dwindling , is Texico . Five years ago , where runs that invisible line , the prairie lay virgin and unoccupied save for a single track of the Santa Fe system and the roaming herds of the great " N I T " outfit . Then , one day , those flat miles , all old-rose where the sun shone upon the low broom-grass , showed a brown dot . This dot did not trespass upon the Texas side of the line , for those acres were private property . It appeared upon New Mexican soil . It was the lone , pine , shanty-roofed shack of a squatter . That shack did not stand alone for long . It became noised about that the new Belen cut-off would start from this point . At once many other buildings sprang up about the habitation of the squatter . The majority of @#  |p578  them had square , flat fronts and dignified hiproofs , and they ranged themselves , for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy street . What buildings were not in this street clustered behind the double line . Some of these were neat frame dwellings ; some were only shacks , like that original one ; and a very few were dugouts . But all ? main-street buildings and flanking houses ? were thoroughly far - Western in appearance . They were even more . For among them were some characteristic bordertown institutions . And this whole aggregation was Texico . As fast as the town went up men and women crowded in to fill it . The Belen cutoff became an actuality . Workmen were brought south from Kansas City , and north from Dallas and Fort Worth . At the heels of the workmen came that ubiquitous parasite , the saloon-man , and his inevitably attending crew . Next flocked the homeseekers . Soon the single wide , muddy street took on an air of permanence and prosperity . Standing on the railroad track , which was laid at right angles to it , and looking westward along the thoroughfare , a visitor could read the left-hand signs thus : gambling-hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livery . stable , saloon ; and on the right-hand side : livery-stable , ice-cream parlor , gambling-hell , saloon , cafe , bank , pool-hall , gambling-hell , saloon . The far end of the street opened out upon shimmering stretches of grassy tableland whose limit was the distant edge of the sky . From its near end , an early riser could look back across other stretches and see the very first tiny crescent displayed by the rising sun . Before very long the fame of little , new Texico grew , and tales of her gaiety spread ? even as far as Chicago ! People said , almost under their breath , that there was a real border town down in New Mexico , and that " good times " were back again ; that the chips clicked and the dance-halls resounded and the bars were noisy , even as in the " old days . " All of which drew more , and still more , people to Texico . But there was a skeleton at her uninterrupted feast of joy . There were men who held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a squatter , and could n't do anything else but squat ; and , what was even more deplorable , that each and every blessed building in Texico was squatting , without a solitary right to the land upon which it sat . When one inquired why to these startling contentions , the answer invariably was , " the unsurveyed strip . " The stories they tell of that " unsurveyed strip " vary with each teller . In the main , however , the stories agree that it was all the fault of the government surveyors . It is claimed that when a party of these gentlemen were traveling southward , to lay out the eastern part of New Mexico , they ran short of provisions at a point which is usually designated as " some miles up the track . " They found it necessary , therefore , to stop work and go aside for supplies . When they returned their second start was made , through some unexplained mistake , at a distance below where they had left off . In consequence of which , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of land of considerable dimensions . This is referred to as " the unsurveyed strip . " ( Alas , why should a town be so rashly foolish as to choose to establish itself upon a reputed no man 's land ! ) But wait ! There are men who claim that " the unsurveyed strip " is a myth . These men hold that titles are good in Texico , and they are willing to " chance it . " It ought not to be difficult to find out who is in the right . But nobody seems to have taken the trouble . Which makes it possible for the unconcerned to reflect that , after all , actions speak louder than words . For that myth , so called , has led to some queer doings in Texico , by the light of the big , white stars . At night , houses took to spooking about from lot to lot ! For instance , a man would proudly look about his own plot of ground before he went to bed , and rejoice at its generous width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his front door ; and he might think of keeping a cow in the near future , or perhaps some hens . Then , what an awakening in the morning ! Perhaps he would hear , close at hand , just outside his window , a strange yawn , or the crackling of a fire , or the frying of batter . He would spring out of bed , jerk aside his curtains ? and discover that , between dark and dawn , there had sneaked into his yard through a fallen fence panel another house , which had settled itself alongside of his with an exasperating air of finality . " Here you ! " he would call out to his unwelcome visitor . " What in the dickens do you mean by coming onto my land ? " A frowsy head would pop out of the new neighbor 's window . " Your land ? " would  |p579  come back the answer , with a sniff . " It ai n't your land . You know very well that this hull town is on the unsurveyed strip , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no right to a square inch of it . I 'll put my house where I dinged please . " He has , and there it stays , until he sees a more desirable spot . The next night some more houses would go trapesing about . Perhaps Jones felt that he 'd like to live near Smith , his wife 's cousin . Oyer he 'd go , residence and all , and bring up in Brown 's dooryard . And what if Brown had only just neatly planted that yard to cowpeas ? ? it " ai n't his to plant " ! There were periods when no moving went on . Calmness sat upon the spirit of the Texicans , and they declared stoutly that their land was their own . But some day , perhaps just after a new consignment of home-seekers had arrived , that calmness would be rudely interrupted . A doubting Thomas would tell what he believed to the newcomers . And , one fine night , some of these would take their temporary homes on sets of trucks and jerk them over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin more feverishly than ever before . During one of these " jumping " manias a half-dozen men carted their houses upon portions of the town 's streets ; and one impetuous gentleman transferred his belongings to , and took up his lodgings in ? the schoolhouse : But this was going a little too far . When the town saw the irate teacher and the tearful children brought up before a barred door it invited the new occupant to " come out . " And he came . But the midnight transferring of property had gotten to be a disease to which every home-seeker was prone . And no cure developed . Doubtless , to many who have never lived in the West , the cure that would first suggest itself is the gun . But on the Pacific side of the Mississippi the gun is not used nearly so often as writers of fiction , and playwrights in particular , would have us believe . For a firearm was never flourished in Texico to shoo anybody away from anywhere . If a man had " shot up " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the authorities , which at this day and date is an unsafe thing to do in the West . He is on that alleged " unsurveyed strip , " and can only ask himself , even as he gnashes his teeth and calls the other man names , " What am I going to do about it ? " The answer is , " Nothing . " By this time Texico was a very presentable town , as boom towns go . Its bank ranked as its most important commercial institution , for all that it was low of stature , of rough boards , and furnished with a store-like  |p580  square front . It was sandwiched in between a pool-hall and a resort that was partly oyster-house and partly fruit-stand . But its position was a misfortune , not a failing . For saloons were thick , and if it had taken to night-wandering it would not have been able to secure a reasonably prominent position unflanked by a saloon . Doubtless the Cosy Cottage Hotel ranked next . It was two stories high ( which lent it some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the railroad station . Also , it had two entrances . If a guest was to room down-stairs , he went in at the front door ; if he was to sleep on the second floor , he ascended by means of an outside stairway . Beds were twenty-five cents . Lastly , contrasting with that merry dozen or more of saloons , dance-halls , and gambling-hells , was one well-built church . Just across the track from Texico , so close that a child could have tossed a rubber ball upon them from the eastern end of the main street , lay the " X I T " lands of Texas . These lands , a little over five million acres in extent , were set aside by Texas in 1899 for the financing of the state Capitol at Austin . And upon a portion of them ( some eight @#  |p581  hundred acres , to be exact ) there appeared , one day , a great many pretty , white stakes , all set out in straight lines . Poor , unsuspecting , light-hearted Texico looked across . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired . And the answer came back , from a solitary building at the center of the stakes , " This is the site of Farwell . " Texico had a sense of humor ? then . And she haw-hawed ; in fact , she just " hollered. " @# But , pshaw ! she would n't be small . She was growing , and could afford to be kind and patronizing . So good-naturedly . but not without raillery , she welcomed the new town , and called it her " twin . " Fateful appellation ! For has it not been observed of twins that if one is lusty the other is apt to be puny and weak ? Of course Texico had an overwhelming advantage , but ? who could tell ? During those early days of Farwell her rollicking , border-town sister was fond of saying mournfully that the poor , weak , little thing was bound to " go under . " After which Texico forgot everything but her games , her luring dance-halls , and the delight in her cups . And so , gaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going on . track . Up went a second beside the first . Up went residence after residence , each more modern than its predecessor . Up went stables , a bank , two churches ( parsonages attached ! ) , stores of different kinds , blacksmith shops , a steam laundry , a drug-store , a building for an undertaking establishment , a photographer 's studio ? equipped to the last skylight ? a lumber-yard , and a large ice . light , and cold-storage plant . And they were all empty ! Farwell had cash behind her ? seemingly unlimited amounts of it . So she promptly began the erection of numerous buildings . Up went a fine brick block close to the railroad  |p582  Before long there were enough empty structures in Farwell to warrant its being called a town . And when citizens of Texico inquired , sometimes facetiously , who were going to occupy them , the younger of the twins replied with an invitation . " Come over on this side of the track , " said she . At this point , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the whole scheme , and they were forced to admit that only a " long " head could have devised it . Texico 's reputed lack of land titles had rendered her stealable ! It was now that the process of undermining began . There were people in Texico who had grown so practised in the art of moving that it would have required no effort for them to go a couple of blocks ; and the substantial portion of the border town would not have mourned at losing them . But when the exodus started , these were not the people who accepted the invitation . Alas , no ! The first man to leave Texico was the proprietor of one of its biggest stores ! And why not ? The little ramshackle , wooden affair on disputed land had been exchanged for a fine brick building with splendid counters and ample shelves , a generous floor-space , and plate-glass windows for displays . But this man was not content with a mere move . He established a fine millinery department under his new roof , with , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how invidiously the infant Farwell was beginning to fatten upon the strength of its twin ! After this the exodus took on added celerity . " Over here , " ran Farwell 's greeting , " are no saloons , no pool-rooms , no gamblinghells , no questionable characters . And to this land a genuine warranty deed can be given . " Men , women , and children hastened across to accept her substantial hospitality , and Texico began " to smile on the other side of its face , " and talk about " sheep . " Which made no appreciable difference . Even to firms that had not spooked , the idea of a change of base was not difficult to grasp . A Texico livery-stable keeper went over to Farwell and turned groceryman , then liveryman again . Next , the newer town swallowed up a druggist , a hardware dealer , and a drayman . The new bank ? a fine affair of gray concrete , plate glass , shiny wood , and electrical fixtures ? now secured a hanker ; and two large brick structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall-paper and paint-store came into being . Texico gasped at the magical summoning of all these Chicago-like advantages . And as Texico marveled , the town-site manager of Farwell presented to its amazed attention two new propositions . The first consisted of planfor a thirty-thousand-dollar hotel , to be Mission in style and electric-lighted throughout ( Woe to the Cosy Cottage ! ) Then he had a great Court House Square laid out close to the proposed hotel . About it were put growing trees and a fine , painted fence . Outside the fence , white hitching-posts were placed ? enough for all the farmers ' teams in three counties ! Some very noticeable inroads had been made , by now , in Texico . But she still had her dance-halls , her saloons , her pool-rooms. and her gambling-hells , so she was , even it dwindling , certainly not dull . At the head and front of the gambling interests was a man who owned half the saloons in the place . But , influential ahe was , he could not stem the exodus from Texico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strong force was militating against the place . It was Public Opinion . As far away as Clarendon , Texas , one could see the workings of it . A traveling man who was passing through that Panhandle town announced rather ostentatiously that he never spent the night in Texico . Farwell for hint . Now , I was started for Texico . But that righteous declaration set me thinking , and as I approached the twin cities I felt that I should seek shelter in Farwell . I did . The thirty-thousand-dollar hotel was not completed . I spent my first night , therefore , in a two-story affair the rooms of which were walled off with single boards placed upon end and hidden by fantastic wall-paper . The acoustic properties of this retreat were incomparable , and I felt constrained to admit that if the Texico hotels were any noisier I was indeed fortunate in having escaped them . For nobody but a worker in a boiler-factory could have slept longer than three hours in Number Eleven . Every word , every movement , every snore , reverberated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell began ringing wildly . I thought the hotel was on fire , and arose with alacrity . It was a mistake . From below , chaotic noises ascended ? dishes and pots rattled , heavy steps resounded up and down , the stairs creaked , voices chortled ,  |p583  and the new frame structure trembled as if it had the ague . At sunup , after making my toilet in half a lard-pail of warm water ( which I had expressly stipulated the evening previous ) , I asked for my bill . " Going outen town to-day ? " inquired the landlady . I hardly knew ? maybe , perhaps . " Well , if you do n't , you 're coming back tonight . " This was taken for granted . Now , getting recklessly brave , " No , I reckon I 'll sleep in Texico , " I said . At once a cold eye pinned me ; then the proprietress raised her brows , her face eloquent with suspicion , if not disgust . It was as plain as the smut on her pale cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleep in Texico. ! Her attitude made its impression , and as I went about that day I found myself shying again at the thought of sleeping in Texico.  |p584  So , as night came on , I weakened and , after all , stopped on the conservative side of the invisible line . But not all the cold stares and elevated brows in the Panhandle could have kept me from eating across the tracks . For there in Texico , in a rattletrap , disreputable-looking shack , was Harry 's Cafe ? of blessed memory ! Though far from Kansas City , yet , ah ! how , after many boom-town hotels and much boom-town grub , how good were " Harry 's " juicy steaks , lamb-chops , fresh oysters , and eggs in any style ? all flanked by " hot biscuit " and canary bath-tubs of fried potatoes . It was almost as if one had happened upon a Harvey " layout " ! But home-seekers do not select a town for its restaurants , and none of these people could reach the twin cities without hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naturally , they wished to settle upon land to which they could get a title . And they were of a kind that shied ? just a little ? at too much gaiety in a town . The moment Texico realized that she was getting a harmful reputation with the homeseekers , that this , as well as the " strip " story , was eating into her vitals , reform began to work . Its long , active arm raked an undesirable element ( that was not strong enough to defend itself ) away from the main street and into the distant Y formed by the railroad tracks . Then it jerked the dancehalls up by the roots . . Farwell only smiled , and its town-site manager , a young giant named Avery who is held to be a wizard in land deals , calmly set engineers to work on a water and sewerage system . Those two masterful strokes dealt by reform did not seem to help Texico noticeably . So reform , discouraged , took a recess . The saloons were thrifty , which lent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who wanted their families to live in Farwell would cross the tracks to patronize a bar . Injustice , that , since they were adding to the life of Texico 's worst institutions while they scorned her as a residence-place . They were enjoying themselves within her confines and then righteously shaking her dust from their boots . After hearing of Texico 's badness , how-  |p585  ever , the actual sight of it was disappointing . Her saloons , each with its cluster of hang-dog , half-hearted men , were as dreary as those of any other small town . And her gamblinghells were as untempting as her saloons . The buildings that held them were one story in height , rough , unpainted , and unfinished inside or out , and showed their rafters overhead , beneath the inevitable corrugated-iron roofing . Each " hell " had a round , rusty , forlorn-looking stove , some deal tables , benches , a few chairs , and a bar that did not glitter . Squatted on this furniture were a few meeklooking men , who were obviously bored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ! they were all transplanted farmers ' lads , trying to be " real Western , " and it was plain that they did not know how . If a woman visitor came to look in upon them , some of them ( lucked their heads sheepishly . Others , the very young ones , got up and straddled about . Who would not be a bad man ! It was just after the routing of the dancehalls that a third factor entered into the Texico-Farwell contest . This factor came in the shape of a half-dozen very clever and ingenious real-estate men , who had an inspiration . Real-estate inspirations are not uncommon these days in the Southwest , and they may happen to be of a legitimate nature , or they may not . But they are always shrewd . For example : A number of land-agents brought a car-load of home-seekers into the twin-city section , via Amarillo . Now , at Amarillo , when the train was stopped , it was approached by several loyal townsmen who talked to the travelers through the windows . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter . But the real-estate men had forestalled anything of the kind . The towns- , men found that the doors were locked ! It was these . same inspired real-estate men who hatched a unique plan whereby to secure settlers for the outskirts of a thriving place . When prospective buyers alighted from a train , a line of automobiles was drawn up at the station to receive them . Naturally they were delighted . Few of them had ever ridden in a horseless wagon before , unless it was in one " drawed by mules . " So they wipe their boots , take a seat , and then inquire about land . " Hope you got some , " they say , " clost to town . " " Sure , " answers the agent , taking the wheel . " Be there in a jiffy . It 's just ten minutes out . " The buyers lean back , cross their knees complacently , and chew at a toothpick as nonchalantly as is possible under the exciting circumstances . Gee ! Ca n't she go ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does go . Toot. ' toot. ' and they are at the end of Main Street . Toot ! toot ! and they are skimming by a fine stand of Milo maize . " Now , just look at that for growth ! " cries the real-estate man , turning on more power .  |p586  Toot ! toot ! The car turns , skoots north for another five minutes , and , " Here 's the property , gents ! " The home-seekers are pleased with their ride , with their release from a stuffy car , and with the agent ( for has he not told them the truth about the distance ? ? it is only ten minutes out ) . They look about , smoking the agent 's two-bit cigars . They see the land through the tender haze of their cigar smoke . They nod approval . They buy on the spot . Then , toot ! toot ! and they are back in town . Later on , driving a slow team over that same road , hauling lumber , or food and furniture , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . " The land is ten minutes out , if the automobile is run at a jortynaile-an-hour rate . Ah , " them real-estate fellers is slick ! " But to return to the inspiration of the halfdozen , which inspiration , by the way , was a legitimate one . These men had observed the strained relations existing between Farwell and Texico . So they said , " Let us boom another town close by , where titles are clear , and invite Texicans to come there . " These gentlemen went southwest along the railroad to a station called Clovis , and set out a whole grove of white stakes upon the gray mesquit-grass ; which grove bore instant fruit in the shape of attractive and comfortable houses . The rent of these houses was inconsiderable , so was their market price , ard very soon they were all occupied . Then Clovis caught the boom-fever . Brick stores began going up . Streets were laid out . Trees were planted . And , to add to the bright outlook , the Santa Fe system began the erection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the twins . across fields of alfalfa and Milo maize . From a rise of ground her new roofs may be seen shining in the sun . At Farwell , it is the Texas sun ; but across that line , in Texico and Clovis , it is the New Mexican sun that is shining , and over there ( if one may believe the Farwell wags ) it is quite " some hotter . " Arriving at Clovis , I found building progressing at a great rate . From the flat townsite hammers were sending up an ear-splitting iron chorus . I counted eleven permanent homes going up , and temporary houses by the dozens . I was riding down the main street when I saw one of these structures coming my way ! Well , " said I , " the residences of this town are cavorting about , too . But they are bold ! Over in Texico they spook about at night , but here they change their location in the daytime . Is there an ' unsurveyed strip ' here , too , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The explanation was simple , and had nothing to do with land titles . It seems that whenever a man wanted a temporary habitation he did not fare forth and secure a carpenter , and guide him to the plot of ground upon which the board-and-canvas shack was to stand . No , indeed ! Carpenters were far too scarce to be led about in such a time-@#  |p587  wasting way . The man , the lumber , and the canvas sought the carpenter . That gentleman constructed a pair of rude runners out of two heavy scantlings . Upon these he built the house . Then up came two mule teams , hitched to wagons , and the wagons were fastened to the runners of the house . Whereupon the house started for its particular lot , and the carpenter began on another . After seeing that one little habitation go trundling merrily along the street I would n't have been surprised to come upon some enterprising Westerner who was peddling houses : " Here 's a fine new shack ! Only forty dollars ! Stove-pipe hole all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down the prairie streets . ( Later on , returning to the twin cities , I met a barn ! ) Some of the temporary houses employ building-paper instead of canvas for a covering , which makes them a dead black . Across one of these shacks ? a funereal affair not more than eight by twelve ? ran this inviting sign : " Beds by the day or week ; 25C. per day ; $1.50 per week . " Another of these boom-town hotels was more pretentious , and rejoiced in the name Hotel de Camp . It was fully fifty feet long , and contained five bedrooms , divided off by upright boards . These boards were not set close together ; and , dressing of a morning , a guest felt easier when the blanket of his bed had been pinned across one wall and the gay-flowered quilt across the other . In rainy weather , of course , a visitor can have running water in his room . But ordinarily , morning ablutions are performed in public . In the front room , " where numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bench with a tin basin , a water-pail , a dipper , and a cake of laundry soap . " Step right up , ladies and gents , " says the genial manager , " and wash yourselves . " It developed that the boom at Clovis did not frighten Farwell . In fact , the huskier of the twin cities was inclined to sniff at any mention of the new rival . But what was Texico 's situation ? Clovis and Farwell each had an arm of that weaker of the twins , and were ready to jerk her limb from limb . " But , look here ! " she cried . " Do n't be too hasty . I 'm strong yet . I still have my gambling . " Alas ! that , too , was soon to be denied her , for , " After January first , " ran the word throughout the places where the chips rattled and the wheels spun , " no gambling . " Contrast what was happening in Farwell . The new Mission hotel was taking on its roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station ( to be built a hundred feet from the Texico station ) was assured ; and no longer could the facetiously inclined poke fun at that big , empty , post-rimmed square , for Farwell had received 130 votes out of the 229 cast in the county , and the court-house was a certainty . This , then , is how the whole thing was accomplished , and in an incredibly short space of time . But the future holds out a happy solution of the matter . If one rides aside to that hillock from which Clovis can be glimpsed , and looks back upon Texico and Farwell , it is seen that distance does a pretty thing : it appears to bring the two together . Above them rise three spires ; out of their scores of chimneys the smoke ascends ; circling them , and never separating them , are the green fields and the old-rose prairie on fire with sunlight . Is it not likely , then , that whenever Texico can boldly announce that she is titled and sound ? is it not likely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance only seems to do , bring about peace between the wrangling " twins , " and ? unite them ?
