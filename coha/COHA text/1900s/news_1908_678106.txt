txt Despite the ? Metal statement from the White House three days ago that the Republican platform , printed exclusively in THE NEW YORK TIMES that morning , was only a tentative draft which had been prepared for submission to the Committee on Resolutions of the convention , the convention this morning adopted that platform word for word and line for line , with only a few slight alterations in phraseology , and after all the hard fighting to change it the platform was adopted by a unanimous viva voce vote . Thus the Administration demonstrated again the power of its control of affairs here , and showed that its " tentative suggestion " could easily be made the will Of the convention . The great fight made by the " allies " against the adoption of the " tentative suggestion " resulted in the drafting of two planks and the elimination of one clause to which some importance had been attached . The redrawn planks were that on injunctions and court procedure , which was made stronger and clearer , so that it now has a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which declared for the establishment of a National Department of Health , which was weakened to a mere commendation of the efforts to obtain greater efficiency in National public health agencies . Changes Were Slight . The clause dropped was that at the end of the paragraph on trust regulation , ' where in specifying the amendments of the Sherman anti-trust law desired and recommended the tentative draft included those which " at the same time will not interfere with the operation of such associations among business men , farmers , and wage earners as result in a positive benefit to the public . " The drepping-of.this clause abandons the proposition to enact such an amendment of the Sherman law as would discrimina.te in favor of labor organizations , and is a victory for the allies . It is the only one they have scored in all their desperate and bitter fighting . It defeats the Administration plan to throw a sop to organized labor . The redrafting of the injunction plank may also be considered something of a victory for the allies in that the plank as adopted , includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uphold at all times the authority and integrity of all courts , State and Federal . But the new draft of the plank which covers the issuance of writs of injunction abandons the futile straddle of the tentative plank . and comes out squarely for a definite thing , using almost exactly the language which Secretary Taft has employed in several of his speeches on labor and capital . In this respect the injunction plank as adopted is much stronger and more honest than the tentative proposition which stood nowhere and faced both ways . ' Most Notable Change . The most important alteration of phraseology besides those already mentioned - e- as at the conclusion of the paragraph on railroads . The first draft read : Favor the enactment of such legislation as will prevent , by Federal restriction , the future overissue of stocks and bonds by inter-State carriers . " The plank as adopted reads : " We favor such National legislation and supervision as pill prE-vent the future overissue of stocks and bonds by inter-State carriers . " The ComnOttee en Resolutions swallowed cheerfully nearly all the heroics about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " exalted servant " and eliminated entirely the ref erence to his " political sovereignty . " that having been more than amply demonstrated in other ways since this convention began . So now the platform , instead of saying that their " most exalted servant has come to represent not only political I sovereignty alone , but the best elms , " Vic. , says their " most exalted servant represents the best aims , " Sc . The smallest alteration contained the hardest crack delivered at the Administration . It was a personal blow to President Roosevelt . This was simply the elimination of the word " model " from the reference to the Child Labor bill for the District of Columbia . In all his advocacy of that measure , and in every one of his public references to it , the ' President has spoken of it as a " model " for the States . and he has often ex'pressed the desire to have the different States accept it as a model and copy it in . their own legislation . But the Unfeeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , struck out ' the " model " and left the States to flounder along as best they can without the benefit of that guidance . , Five new planks , one clause , and one sentence were added . The clause goes Into the middle of the plank on resources land waterways , and " reaffirms the Re:publican policy of the free distribution of the available areas of the public domain to the landless settler . " The new sentence goes into two planks on insular affairs , and declares for granting immediate citizenship to natives of Porto Rico end for the naturalization of other inhabitants of that island . The New Planks . Two of the new planks refer to foreign Sfairs and declare for the protection Of American citizens abroad and commend the party 's efforts to build up foreign commerce . One declares for the creation of a Bureau of Mines and Mining . One favors the admission of New Mexico and ? Arizona as States , and , the fifth recommends the celebration of the centenary of Lincoln 's birthday ; With these few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that about courts and injunctions , are material , the platform adopted unanimously this morning is almost literally that printed In THE NEW YORK Tunes before the convention had been called to order for the first time and before there was any Committee on Resolutions , Immediately upon the opening of the session this morning Senator Hopkins , Chairman of the Resolutions Committee , presented his report , and read the platform in full , He raised a laugh right at the start by reeking how the Republican Party had " expended " the National domain , instead of " expanding " it , as the platform says , Hopkins has a good voice , but It was not strong enough to fill the great hall , and he was frequently interrupted by calls for more vigor in his tones . When the crowd found that they could not follow what he was saying they went to talking among themselves , and for the . most part the platform was read In the midst of such a tumult that only those in immediate proximity to the reader could distinguish what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " interests of the oil roads , " instead of the " Inter-State railroads , " a remark which if it had been heard would have awalecoed tho liveliest appreciation from a large part of the crowd , When the Committee on Resolutions concluded its labors at an early hour this morning , the word went around that there would be no minority report . The audience was surprised , therefore , when Senator Hopkins , on the conclusion of his reading , moved the previous qUestIon upon the report " and upon the minority report to be submitted by Mr. Cooper . " This was Representative Cooper of Wisconsin , one of the untamed and unterrified " La Follette radicals . " Cooper presented his report at Once , and It evoked a mixture of howls and " boos " from all over the hall , with wild shouts of approval from the Wisconsin delegation . The La Follette Demands . It declared for the La Follette idea of tariff revision , for physical valuation of railroads , for direct election of Senators , for publicity of campaign contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor cases , When Cooper began his speech in support of this platform a Pennsylvania delegate bobbed up with a demand to be Informed how many names were signed to the minority report . Hopkins cut in to announce that he would cover that in his part of the debate , but Cooper forestalled him by shouting : " I am the minority . I am the only man who signed the report , and I have no apology to make for it . " Cooper made a first-class La Follette argument for his platform , and was supported by two or three of the Wisconsin men in very brief talks . Then Hopkins went after the Wisconsin ideas with unsalted language . The gist of his denunciation was contained in his reference to the minority report , and the Cooper speech as the " Socialistic-Pernocratic utterances from ' Wisconsin . " The Wisconsin delegation demanded a roll call on the adoption of the Minority report , and South Dakota seconded the demand . Gov . Hanly of Indiana wanted a separate vote on the campaign fund publicity plank . South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Nebraska made a similar demand for the plank on the election of Senators . Sereno Payne wanted to lay the whole thing on the table . But Senator Lodge ruled that It was too late , the previous question having been ordered . Against Campaign Publicity . So the roll was called and one by one the Republican Convention went on record as solidly against campaign publicity , despite Secretary Taft 's letter to Senator I Burrows ; against the physical valuation of railroads and the direct election of Senators , and then against the remainder of the La Follette scheme . There were loud cries from all over the hall against having to go on record in this fashion , but Lodge ' ruled in favor of the demand at every Point and the roll was called . When WieI cousin was out of the way It took only a viva yore vote to adopt the whole plat , form unanimously , not even a single Wisconsin delegate shouting " Nol " The full text of the platform will be found on Page 4.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
