To-day 's session of the conference was barren . But for Baron Komura it would have ended the negotiations . M. Witte and Baron Rosen were ready to terminate the conference then and there , but Baron Komura asked for another sitting , and one will be held on Monday . At Monday 's session Japan will submit modified terms , but the understanding is that these terms merely involve a reduction of the amount of the indemnity . The Russians absolutely refuse SO PAY any of Japan 's expenses . The 100,000,000 rubles which they are Willing to concede represents Japan 's expenses in taking care of the Russian prisoners , or at least , - Rnesie is ready to allow this sum under that head . As the war has cost Japan some $900,000,000 , this payment coull not possibly be regarded as an indemnity . The Japanese apparently are not yet convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wish to try again . The Russians have always recor , ? - nieed the necessity of paying Japan for the care of the prisoners , to which , in fact , they are bound by The Hague Convention . Neither on this point nor on any other have they changed an iota , ' ycept in their willingness to cc le half of Sakhalin . Thy conference opened shortix after 3 o'clock to-day . The protocol of the lart previous meeting was pla'e:I upon the table for the signature of the envoys . After a few minutes ' general conversation the secretaries withdrew from the room , leaving M. Witte and Baron Rosen to discuss the situation with Baron Komura and Mr. Takahira . The envoys remained closeted together for one hour .

" deleted 6 lines Komura asked for another conference on Monday , and I consented , because I WA not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off negotiaWhen asked if it were true that he had informally told Baron Komura that Russia would concede half of Sakhalin and pay for the keep of the prisoners , M. Witte said he had not done so . From M. Witte 's conversation it was Understood that the conference would have terminated this afternoon had not Baron Komura applied for another meeting . This is regarded as showing plainly that the Japanese are anxious for peace , and this is the opinion of M. Witte . The Russian envoy admitted that he expected a further adjournment on Monday . No answer was given to-day to the proposition put forward by Baron Komura last Wednesday because there bad been no change in Russia 's attitude since then , and therefore no reply was needed . Since Wednesday President Roosevelt had been making strenuous efforts through Ambassador Meyer to induce the Czar to accept Japan 's terms without specifying the sum of money to be paid . The fact that the President had failed was made apparent by the Lamsdorff statement and other telegrams from St. Petersburg and by the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Russians here say they know that the Lamsdorff dispatch was genuine and that it was sent out for the purpose of showing that Russia was firm in regard to the indemnity question . M. Witte has been very much irritated during the last few days , not only by press telegrams from Russia , but more by the dispatches he is receiving from home . The chief Russian envoy has many enemies who are jealous of the Impression ' he has made on the American people , and it Is said they would do anything In their power to prevent M. Witte from returning home as the maker of a successful treaty . Among the most prominent of his pe-lifical foes Is Count Lamsdorff . M. Witte resented the statement of Count Lamsdorff as an attempt to take the matter out of his ( Witte 's ) hands . Hence the retraction of the Foreign Minister .

Japan wants money badly , and It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the best-informed Russian officials said to-night : " The outlook for peace is very black and almost hopeless . I do not think Japan will modify her conditions on Monday sufficiently for Russia to accept them . Although M. Witte may refuse them , there will have to be an adjournment for two days in order that he may communicate them to the Czar , " President Roosevelt is urging the Japanese to reduce their terms , and has also again communicated with the Czar , but I do not think that Emperor Nicholas will alter his views upon the indemnity question . If Baron Komura had not asked for another meeting we should have been packing our trunks to-night . " It is difficult to ascertain exactly what took place in the conference room during the hour of secret session today , but it is certain that M. Witte removed - any belief which Baron Komura may have had as to Russia 's willingness to pay indemnity to Japan . Today 's private conference was the longest since the meetings at the navy yard began .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
