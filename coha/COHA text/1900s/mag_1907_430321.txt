 |p477  THERE is nothing a woman appreciates more than a dainty , pretty negligee robe . In these robes she may indulge her fancies for delicate colors and elaborate trimmings . While it is true that some women spend small fortunes on these fascinating bits of feminine attire , it is quite possible for those of us with more limited means to have pretty and useful house dresses . The Empire negligee pictured in this illustration No. 19 G. H. , was of delicate crocus yellow crepe-de-chine , trimmed with a narrow edging of embroidered silk , and a darker shade of crocus yellow velvet ribbon . Many women prefer the combination of dressing sack and skirt ; therefore this gown was so designed that the skirt could be shortened to make a pretty matinee . Challis , flannel , cashmere , nuns veiling , flannelette or any soft , hanging material can be used with good effect , if something warm is desired . For summer nothing is prettier than flowered organdie or dotted Swiss . China silk will give better service for general wear than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the woman who travels can not afford to be without . It is so soft that it can be placed in a very small space , it does not easily wrinkle , and if a good quality is purchased , it will last for years . Either a dark blue or a black is a good color to select , as it is inconspicuous , which is an important consideration when the garment is intended to be used to go through the isles of sleeping cars , or hotel corridors . The graduation dress is most important to the majority of girls . However , it is quite necessary that to appear to the best advantage the gown be of a simple , girlish design , with no attempt at elaboration of trimming . It is also most desirable that the material be of unpretentious appearance , no matter how costly it may be . Silks , brocades or spangled laces are not in keeping ; a quantity of jewelry is quite out of the question . A plain gold chain at the neck , a bracelet and a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration Nos. 20 and 21 G. H. , is of white net , worn over a soft , liberty silk slip . The yoke at each side of the square front is of tucked net , edged with Valenciennes insertion . The collar and square front of the yoke are made entirely of the insertion , the strips being joined together by narrow bands of the material . The tucked waist and short sleeves give a graceful fullness to the girlish figure . The cuffs of the sleeves and the girdle are of the insertion , joined in the same way as that in the yoke . The full-length skirt is finished with tucks at the bottom . A dress of this sort is particularly useful , as it may be worn on other occasions over a colored silk slip , and give practically another gown . Any soft , white material may be substituted for the net , and will be quite as pretty if nicely made . Mull , batiste , India linen , Persian lawn , organdie , dotted Swiss , silk mull or nainsook of a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive . In place of the silk underslips , a fine quality of white wash material may be used . For those who find it difficult to properly arrange the tucks in the bottom of the skirt , the making is simplified by cutting the paper pattern off at the desired length of the skirt , being sure to allow for a hem . Then in place of the tucks , graduated widths of the bias bands are cut and folded double , the raw edge turned in the width of a seam and basted . These bands are stitched along the upper edge to the skirt . This gives exactly the same effect as the tucks , and is more easily arranged . For the spring bride who is choosing a dress that will be suitable to wear for other occasions than her wedding , nothing could be prettier than the design shown in illustration Nos. 22 and 23 G. H. The material employed in the original model was crepe-de-chine , of a pastel shade . The trimming bands on the skirt and waist were made by setting applique of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girdle was of satin velvet that matched the gown in color , and the edge of the jumper waist was piped with the same . The small , round buttons were covered with velvet . Although this dress is quite Frenchy in appearance , it is really very simple , and could be carried out in detail at home . Cream white liberty silk was the material of which the blouse was made . The yoke and collar were formed of Valenciennes insertion , and the full puffed sleeves were gathered into bands made by joining strips of insertion like that used in the yoke ,  |p478  and finished with a frill of edging that matched the insertion . If cotton of linen are to be employed to make the gown , the blouse should be of batiste , trimmed with the insertion . The bands on the skirt and waist may be either of the material stitched , or of ribbon . A China silk , silk mull , mm's-veiling , challis , pongee or Rajah in any of the new spring shades , would look well made after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or organdie is used , it should be tucked for the jumper waist before cutting it out . This will give it body , otherwise it would be too sleazy to look well in the plain waist . Women are planning now for all sorts of cool and convenient summer wraps . Some loose , light-weight , outside garment is a necessity , whether we travel or stay at home . It is most useful , as it may be made to serve a two-fold purpose ? that of keeping the light linen or cotton waist or dress free from dust , and again effectually to hide one that has become soiled from constant wear while traveling . The coat shown in this illustration , No. 24 G. H. , was of natural colored Rajah , trimmed with a darker shade of satin velvet . The buttons were covered with the material and finished with a metal rim . The lines of this garment are so exceedingly simple that anyone may make it . Any of the dyed pongees , Rajahs , silks or colored mohairs that are shown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Rajah and pongees are shown this season in both stripes and plaids , If these are used , the velvet or silk of which the collar is made should match in color the darkest shade of the strip or plaid . If these materials are considered of too heavy a weight for trimming , the collar and cuffs can be made of the same material as the coat , and trimmed with mohair or silk soutache braid . Linen is much used for this style of coat , and of course is less expensive than other suitable materials ; besides , it has the advantage of being able to stand a good tubbing when soiled , and will come from the laundry looking equal to new . A coat of golden brown linen made entirely of the material , the collar and cuffs edged with a flat , narrow , linen braid , and finished with brown bone buttons , would make both a useful and pretty garment for driving , automobiling or traveling . If a short skirt of the same material is made to be worn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had from it . To be well dressed on the street it is essential that one have a pretty walking costume . Much to the satisfaction of the majority of women the short skirt , that entirely clears the ground , is considered chic for this style of dress . A short , trig jacket that gives sufficient warmth , but in no way retards the free movement of the body , is worn with these skirts . The costume shown in this illustration Nos. 25 and 26 G. H. , was of tan , chiffon broadcloth . The arrangement of the plaiting on the skirt is new . The double box plait is so planned as to taper from the bottom up , giving the waist line the appearance of being much smaller than it really is . The jacket is very plain , the only trimming being the strippings , which on the model were a pretty shade of brown that matched the vest and collar , and the buttons were covered with the material of the dress . The inlaid collar was hand-embroidered in rich Persian colorings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency this season toward the use of sheer materials such as voile , and panama cloth , even for tailored suits . They have the advantage of being light in weight , while at the same time they are durable . It is necessary to have silk linings for the jacket and skirt . Economy , however , may be practised by choosing a color that will go nicely with some other skirt that one already has , thus making one drop-skirt do the service of two . Tan in all the different shades , both in plain and mixed goods , will be much worn through the spring and summer . This color in the materials such as we have spoken of , looks well over silks of a lighter shade of the same color . Both three-quarter and full-length sleeves are worn in the semitailored costumes . The collarless jacket is generally seen , although a few models show a tendency toward the high , military collar . A generous fullness and graceful lines are features of all misses ' costumes . In illustration Nos. 27 and 28 G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same material , are artistically combined . The original model was of olive green satin cloth , worn over a chiffon satin waist of the same color . The girdle was of satin . The skirt is composed of three circular flounces , each finished with a row of stitching . The jacket is of the bolero type , worn with collar and cuffs of hand embroidered , white linen . This costume would look well carried out in any material which has sufficient body to permit of its being made on these simple lines , devoid as it is of ruffles and frills . Wherever one goes one sees a bewitching  |p479  array of pretty colored frocks on young girls . Dead rose , apricot , castor , ivory , dahlia , almond green , mulberry , gray and tan are all included in the list of new spring shades . These colors are shown in all the silks and the woolen materials , and in many of the new cottons . A blue linen made after this model and stitched in white , or the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , narrow braid of white linen , would be both useful and pretty for a young girl . Worn with a white batiste blouse , it would make a suitable dress for traveling . Myrtle green is a pretty new shade in linen that would make up well . The colonial derby and other small hats for young girls such are shown in this illustration , are trimmed with coq feathers and stiff wings . These accessories are put on in all sorts of odd ways , and the graceful coq feathers are often so long that they touch the shoulder . The large picture hats intended for more dressy wear , are trimmed with flowers , foliage and ostrich plumes , and have large bunches of tulle and chiffon cleverly arranged under the brims . The hat for the young girl is selected , as is that for an older person , with consideration as to the gown it is to be worn with . The large bows of ribbon are still worn at the back of the head , and are particularly pretty and becoming with the present style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended for general wear than are light shades . Their somberness may always be relieved by some light trimming , and should this become soiled , it is much easier to renew it , than it would be to freshen up a whole dress . It is true that light materials may be worn for a short time and then dyed , but this is more or less of a risk , as they are bound to shrink , and may possibly come out too small to wear . Besides one can never be sure of the color unless the dye is black . The dress in this illustration , Nos. 29 and 30 G. H. , was of dark blue marquisette , made over a silk slip of the same shade . The waist has an applied yoke of cream white silk , ornamented with blue and white buttons . The square tab effect of the yoke is carried out on the cuff of the short sleeve . The chemisette may be made of white lace net over white silk , or of sheer white material tucked ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one chooses . If preferred a guimpe with long sleeves can be worn . Plaits , which are a marked feature of all the new spring models , are prettily arranged in both the skirt and waist . They are of the simplest variety , and in the skirt they are stitched to a considerable depth below the waist line , which holds them in place and gives a neat fit over the hips . Those of the waist are also stitched . A dress of this style would look well fashioned from colored linens , pongee , Rajahs , nun's-veiling , voile or challis . The applied yoke cuffs and belt would be pretty if braided with a narrow braid , matching in color the material of the dress . Plaid silk used for , oke , cuffs and belt would look well . Particularly suitable for a young girl would be a costume of this kind . The cut of the skirt provides ample width at the bottom , and the plaits in the waist give a pretty fullness so necessary to the undeveloped figure . A DRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resistant qualities of Plumbago Capensis . Both the white and the leaden-blue flowers and the apparently fragile plants and foliage surprised me week after week by their profusion , free growth and fresh appearance . Water was impossible for any but pot plants and hanging baskets . The plumbagoes were in a bed in the center of the lawn , fully exposed to the sun . Not a leaf wilted , nor a flower withered . The drought was unbroken for five weeks , and even then the rains were not continuous . From spring until late fall , the plumbagoes never ceased to bloom . Few things in nature are more truly lovely . The lantana is another heroic summer bedding plant ; years ago I ascertained that every variety of lantana will resist drought and bloom abundantly all summer . A curious fact is that lantanas and plumbagoes both will bloom under the shade of trees , on the gulf coast . The plants do not bloom so profusely as , in the sunshine , yet they bloom constantly in the shade . It may be that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unusually reliable bloomers during the heat of the hottest summers . They are special favorites for the sandy soil of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico . G.
