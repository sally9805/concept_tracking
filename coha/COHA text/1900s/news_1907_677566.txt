txt Mr. TiaZonon0 P. SHONTS , President of the **25;602;TOOLONG Company , writing in Harper 's Weekly on " The Problem of a Million Fares , " sympathizes frankly with the public . He has been in the crowds at the rush hours , he has seen everything that is to be seen at its best and at its worst . and is " compelled to admit that there is reason for the dissatisfaction of the people with the present transit system . " On one line alone , the Third Avenue elevated , one million more passengers every month are carried than the preceding one the Subway is daily haullag twice as many aS it was built to accommodate , and running at its full capacity . The crowded conditions of traffic have no parallel on the globe . To relieve them Mr. SI/ONTS makes seven suggestions : A seat for every passenger . An effort to enforce a **26;629;TOOLONG rule . A. trial of the pay-as-you-get-on plan , Two more tracks on the Second Avenue elevated road . The Addition of bide entrances to the Subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive use of boarding passengers , and others for those alighting . Such restrictions of street traffic where congettion is greatest as will allow the surface lines a reasonable ; although not exclusive , use of the tracks . Restrictions of street traffic for surface lines during the rush hours should be had . The surface cars will inevitably be . u8ed inCreasinglY by shart-haul passengers . With wider platforms and entrance and exit doors , the cars could be moved along faster , although , as Mr. Simiqrs intimates , the company may find it Impracticable to enforce the **27;657;TOOLONG rule . The pay-as-you-get-on plan , too , requires elucidation . Perhaps Mr. Snomrs thinks of establishing a surface-car ticket system , with ticket booths at frequent intervals along the line . Side entrances to the Subway cars would conduce greatly to speed in filling and emptying trains at congested points , and ' would sale time with the greatest margin of safety , that is , while the train It at a standstill . The project of four-tracking the Second Avenue elevated road is open to objection . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Avenue elevated road/is the only oil that is not being worked to its tulle capacity , because the people , for some reason or other  --  possibly to save a walk of a couple of blocks ? do not use this line as they might and ought to do . " He believes more tracks for an express service . which could be built in half the time I needed to construct an additional subway , would cure the evil . It would , but the cure Would be effected by the old method of adding permanently to the deformity of the patient . The city is content with nothing less than subways . The unsightly elevated structures are obsolescent , and they should become obsolete . While the new east and west side subways are building some plan should be devised to divert the overflow from the Third Avenue line to the two comparatively unused tracks on Second Avenue .
