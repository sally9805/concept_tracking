The United States is not free from oppression , as you undoubtedly know , if you have read of recent occurrences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrade him .

Dynasties have Callen , but China still remains . " The exclusion act which bars my countrymen from coming to your shores is as barbarous a measure as one could conceive of , and totally at variance with your ideals , and above all , your Christianity . What is Christianity if it does not Christianize ? I have been taught to believe that this is a Christian nation , and I hope it 's so , but the Christian clement in this country , In order to show China that it needs Christianity , must first of all he its exponent and live up to the principles of the great Master . " China has had all kinds of ' isms ' thrust upon it , but I have learned that Cliristianism.
