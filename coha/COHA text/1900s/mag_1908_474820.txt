THE Pittsburger can carry more figures of large denomination on his person without your suspecting their existence than any other citizen of the United States . He is a reservoir of decimals and statistics . He must have ample justification , however , before he turns the spigot , hut when he does there is a torrent no man can stem . If provoked and inclined to extend himself , in a five-minute talk he can fill you so full of miscellaneous industries ? natural gas , steel rails , tin plate , petroleum , steel pipes and sheet-metal , firebricks , tumblers , tableware , coke , pickles , and all that sort of thing ? that you will begin to feel like a combination delicatessen and hardware store . I have not begun to enumerate the different data I have collected on this subject , as I have no desire to make the reader feel small or to lose confidence in himself . As I have pointed out before , the Pittshurger , or the man who is under the influence of Pittsburg , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Pittsburger is that the latter talks of actual figures , while his more cultured brother is prone to drag lay figures into his conversation ? great uncles and aunts , whom he represents as being socially prominent , or hypothetical grandfathers who are dead and buried , and therefore inaccessible to the careful and cautious investigator . It is not easy to tell what may turn the conversation into the channel of hardware . Take a ease in point . Late one afternoon , after a tortuous climb across a rugged country that heaves in billows like the ocean , we emerged on one of those great hills encircling the city . Below us lay PittsP02 1LAIWEIt 'S ? MONTHLY MAGAZINE . burg , the huge , smoldering , roaring men-star , flecking the uniform gray of its background with white puffs of steam . Upon the ear fell muffled detonations , varied at times by the distant metallic shriek of steel or the rumbling groan of tons of red-hot metal , twisted and tortured into new shapes . A shimmering silver river , spanned by many bridges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in an exquisite distance of gray mist faintly flushed with an opalescent pink . where the forest of mammoth stacks is belching clouds of smoke and iron-ore dust , sending great banks of rose-colored smoke soaring , tumbling , and rolling upward in phantasmagoric shapes . A great veil of smoke stretches out for miles and moves majestically over the valley like a funeral pall that threatens to obscure everything . It is not unlike some vast , ghostly flood-tide coming in from the gray , invisible country beyond , beneath which the river , the factories and bridges , the city itself , are soon submerged . Through the shroud of smoke loom gigantic shadows of the mighty promontories ; a Song shaft of fine golden sunlight sifts across the valley where a galaxy of lights flicker and ( lie away like will-o ' - the- wisps in the envelopment of the night ; the pinnacles of the hills glow with an amber phosphorescence , and Pittsburg begins her night . " I wonder whether an artist can ever render the significance of this . " I ventured , after saturating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell you something about the significance of this place that ought to hold you for a while , " began Stone , the Pittsburg member of the party . I had no desire to interrupt him , and he proceeded . " Why , you wo n't believe what that signifies , " he continued , embracing the valley with a great sweep of his arm . " I wo n't len you that the pay-roll is three hundred and fifty millions in cold cash , for instance , because I have no desire to frighten yon . I might drag in the fact that three million five hundred thousand cars bring a hundred and thirteen million net tons in and out of Pittsburg district , and I might make you feel still more up in the air by adding that I 'm not including freight in transit when I mention these figures . I wo n't do it . It would n't be right . But what I will say casually is that if you add the harbor tonnage to this amount , it will make one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused for a moment and looked about to collect applause . He got it . Helping himself to a cough-drop secreted somewhere in his vest pocket , he Cleared his throat and proceeded : " Why , say ? right down on that river in a single day they shipped three hundred and ninety-three thousand three hundred and fifty tons . I guess that 's going some eh ? Why , in the valley where we 're looking they are consuming daily two hundred and fifty million feet of natural gas . " Ile had completely withered me , and I hung limp on the railing . A few pedestrians , attracted by the vigor of his declamation , had gathered at a respectful distance . Stone was bathed in perspiration , and paused to get his breath . Before he had time to recover himself a small , wiry man with a gimlet eye and a Prominent Adam 's apple had seized the helm and was piloting his own narrative with a good start and a fair road ahead of him . " Sense me , gentlemen ; T come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stump of e hand that possessed but two lingers . A look of encouragement was all that he desired . lie got it . " Why , gentlemen , fingers is going down there like bananas at a country fair . Half of the big concerns have their private ambulance and surgeon , and I have known times when the undertakers-and enhinct-makers were working with night shifts . When you see a man howling Clint coming your way in a diemlching department you have orders to grab him and hold on to him until the doctor gets him . " " Flow did yours go ? " I asked , indicating the stump with the two solitary fingers . " Down there in the slaughter-house . " He motioned to a well blown Pittsburg-factory which has earned this significant title . " A slip of the foot on the treadle when your hand 's below ? down she comes and off they go . " Tie was delightfully cheer -- ful about shedding a few fingers here or there , and I felt guilty when I let myself consider how miserly some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the department that day ? we were all suckers , good and green- and at the end of the day three of us had lost fingers . The record for one week in that department stands at twenty-one fingers . " He - then called upon the Deity to strike him dead if things were not as he represented them to be . He waited a moment to let us look at him ; nothing unusual happened , and be proceeded : " In Allegheny County alone the number of deaths from accident were two thousand six hundred and sixty . I call that getting busy . " He looked about him with an injured air for a dissenter , but nobody dared to contradict him . l le paused an instant to replenish his quid of tobacco , when the fishy-eyed individual who had gradually edged up to our group stepped in briskly with a " gentlemen , " and in a moment had the conversation well in hand . his face was an intelligent one , though dissipated . His collar was of celluloid ; his voice thick ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put him on a corner in a Now England prohibition town , start a two-knot breeze against him , and let an excise officer pass to the leeward , and he would immediately bustle about to look for contraband . He shook his cuffs down , and with his face flushed with enthusiasm , began : " I notice that you did not mention the enormous consumption of cork in Pittsburg . It runs into thousands of tons ; and when it comes to churches and benevolent institutions I regret that I have been too intimately connected with them to be able to speak freely . " " It 's a hard life we lead ? a hard life , " mused the first speaker , gazing at the mighty hills , whose lofty crests , with their little clusters of pygmy cottages clinging like barnacles to the barren rocks , towered high above the valley . " Ilost of us is parrot-toed from climbing home at night , " he sighed . " You are what ? " I gasped . " Parrot-toed . . . ai n't you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . It must be said , however , that the traveller who , in idling about this rolling country in quest of the picturesque , falls a prey to this ridiculous affliction is amply rewarded for his sacrifice . Once he becomes addicted to the habit of exploring Pittsburg , the towering hills above him have an irresistible fascination . The incomparable vista revealed from their crests ? the tiers upon tiers of tumbling hills ? sends him onward and upward tingling with a new sense of the picturesque , of space , and of limitless power and strength . The indescribable freshness of its motives , the infinite variety of its moods , the miragelike appearance of distant hilltops , suspended for a moment in the turquoise haze and dropping mysteriously from view , the tender distances , light and volatile as ether , revealing for a moment a band of glimmering silver spanned by weblike bridges , the masterful disposition of architecture with a landscape at times primeval in character , lend an exotic beauty to this restless background that furnishes the jaded traveller with what he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new thrill . Beneath its soot and grime he will discover in Pittsburg one of the most picturesque cities in America . Here he will find nothing stolen from Europe ? nothing derivative . It is the very quintessence of what one is in the habit of styling " American . " My two letters of introduction brought me in contact with a type peculiar to Pittsburg . T allude to the involuntary resident ? the victim of circumstances . The first was Jack Holloway , architect , originally from Boston , but recently from the Beaux-Arts , Paris . He listened patiently while I delivered my eulogy on Pittsburg- , " I admire your enthusiasm , " be began , coolly , in a somewhat patronizing manner . " But you do n't live here . My dear fellow , the only thought the people have here is to make money enough to get out . You can imagine how that sort of attitude gets on the nerves of a Bostonian like me . It 's too sordid for words . " " Why do n't you get out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that end in view . " he replied . gloomily . In the pause that followed I produced my letter to Archibald Downing . and asked . flolloway whether he knew him . " Downing is a capital fellow and a good example of the effect Pittsburg has on a man . It ruined him ? yes , absolutely . Able architect ? saved some money , and fell in with a man who was full . of convincing propositions natural gas and all that sort of thing . Persuaded Archibald ' to take a little flyer with his wad . Wanted to let him in on the ground floor . Did . Archibald is still there ? ca n't get out . " I was somewhat at sea , when he enlightened me . " Boring for gas is n't the pastime for a man who is in the habit of undermining . his health for the sum of thirty dollars a week . Archibald drilled a thousand feet and got nothing but hot air . Then his capital gave out . It changed his entire nature altered his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the idea of making enough money to clear out , and he has become fearfully peevish and intolerant . Tread gently when you meet hint " My letter to Downing brought me through a labyrinth of high buildings to an office on the top floor . In the corner of a large draughting-room sat a tall , thin , bony individual , who long , wiry neck formed a complete circuit with an immense drawing-board , on which he was marking with feverish energy . He undid his legs with some difficulty from the tall stool on which he was perched . and ad vanced with cordial greeting . I asked him how he liked the place . " You mean this room ? " he asked , in amazement . " No , I mean this ? " indicating with a wave of my arm the incomparable horizon of river , sky , and smoldering factories . " That ! " This somewhat . incredidously . I nodded . " Wait till yam live here , " he whispered , looking about him to make sure we were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it . We Easterners arc a totally different race and , if I say it myself , a superior race . Imagine a whole population desperately working with the sole idea . of making money ? That 's bad enough , but they are making money to ! let out . I tell you it is , disgusting , and makes a fellow feel so horribly restless lie has n't the heart to pin his favorite pictures on the wall . Everything is so transient , so ittssatreae . " Why do n't you pull out ? " I asked . sympathetically . " That 's why you see me here in this office after hours bending over this drawing-board . I am. saving up a little wad with that end in view ? this is in 2onfidenee , of course . " Have you met Holloway ? " lie suddenly asked . I replied that I had just left him . " You no doubt saw what Pittsburg did for hint He is a good example of the manner in which a man can degenerate in this town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people here . People go money-mad . . they ca n't talk about anything else . Why , it would make you sick to see the amount that is made in this town . Did it ever occur to you ! : hat Pittsburg is the second city in the United States in banking capital ? " It had not . Archibald fixed me with the glassy , anxious , and unnaturally brilliant eye of the man who has a message to deliver . I felt instinctively that he was about to scatter decimals and tried to retreat , but he had seized me by the buttonhole . " Pittsburg is at the head of American cities in earning capacity . Did this ever occur to you ? " T hung my head in silence and tried to shift away from him . but he closed in . " Did it ever occur to you that Chicago , with morn than five times Pittsburg 's population , averages less than sixty per cent , of Pittsburg 's bank earnings ? " Never before in my life had I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just left the sleeping-car . " Did it ever occur to you that Pitts-burg 's capitalization exceeds the combined capitalization of Buffalo , Cleveland , Toledo , Cincinnati . nod Detroit ? " I remember muttering something unintelligible . " Would you like me to put it in another way ? " he asked , with an indescribable gleam in his eye . " Go as far as you like , " I feebly answered . " Pittsburg 's capitalization exceeds that of Boston and Cleveland combined , or of St. Louis and Baltimore combined . " There was a triumphant ring to his voice as he coneluded . I reached nervously for my hat . " One moment 1 " he exclaimed , anticipating my intention . " Inching , " T began , with a dangerous gleam in m ' eye and my fingers twitching convulsively with a suppressed desire to seize him by the windpipe , " you are tiring yourself . You are a weak man and becoming feverish . Stop it , man , before you get typhoid or something horrible . " " Tut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied , with distressing geniality ? " knew it would interest you I do n't mind the exertion at all ? I like it . I was just going to say that the capitalized strength of Pittsburg 's banking institutions is one hundred and fifty million twenty-five thousand four hundred and sixteen dollars . Guess what that means . " " It 's your move . I pass , " I replied , limply , as my inert elbow picked up an inverted drawing-tack . " It means a sum greater than the co ? bined capital of Maryland , West Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Mississippi , Arkansas ! " It was said in one breath , and his face was purple . " It is eighteen millions greater than Chicago and Baltimore combined ! " he concluded , digging Inc in the pit of the stomach with a long , bony forefinger that left me for a moment paralyzed . " Eighteen millions ! " The temptation is very great for the writer who is handling Pittsburg to fill pages with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eonficknee and tell him how he struck a 200,000-pound blow by the mere touching of a button ; or to talk glibly of mill buildings a quarter of a mile long , or to casually refer to steel plants a mile in length . Once one gives way to this sort of thing he can fill pages with those charming little incidents ? word-pictures ? in which the author is seen standing alone in the foreground , clear-cut , with a high-light glistening on his forehead , thrillingly careless of his own safety , dodging the 180,000-pound ingots as they swing gracefully overhead , stepping lightly aside as one of the sixty-seven locomotives owned by the steel plant where he is at large rushes past into the night , only to bring up against a 190,000-pound fly-wheel which has stopped for repairs . I shall make a supreme sacrifice and deny myself the pleasure . The bare statement that the iron and steel production in Pittsburg is 6,593,117 tons annually , conveys little meaning to one who has not seen a steel plant at night in full operation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to describe the full glory of these thundering , flaming infernos is to feel the limitations of the language and to grope about for some new vehicle of expression . You leave with an overpowering sense of your utter insignificance , and sit speechless , gazing through your car window as titanic hills loom up in all their grandeur and race past in mighty pageant into the night , their sides and crests flaming with acres upon acres of coke furnaces , tingeing the vast rolling forms , slowly pacing across the glowing heavens with the golden splendor of sonic gigantic conflagration.
