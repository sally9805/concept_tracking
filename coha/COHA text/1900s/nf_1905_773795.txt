txt // language has the impersonal verb which will illustrate my meaning , for all such atmospheric phenomena such as rain , thunder , the light of day ; instead of it rains , it thunders , it shines , our ancestors said , he rains , he thunders , he shines , without , knowing who was this he , who for us is the third person masculine ; but , naturally for them , he meant t he ruiner , the thunderer , the lightener , or , in other words  --   --  the agent . Mythology , taken iii its entirety , is the outcome of myths which preceded it . If the original meaning of the ( , reek word Logos  --  as both word and thought ? has revealed to us a forgotten truth ; the original meaning of mythos is also indispensable for the study of mythology . This ( creek term means simply word as opposed to deed , and hardly differed at first from Logos . Afterwards , however , a distinction was made between myth , ? a fable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus a myth was at first a word . Almost all terms used in the first spontaneous stage of language had for their basis striking metaphors , whose signification may have been forgotten , and these terms having lost their original as well as poetical meaning , remained words only , current in familiar conversation . 1 give the following myths as they have come down to us . Budyniion is the son of Zeus and Kalyke , but he is also the son of . Ethlios , a king of Elis , who is himself called a son of Zeus ; fr , according to Greek customs , the reigning race of ' His derived its origin from the king of the gods . Endyrniou is one of the many names of the sun , but with special reference to the setting or dying sun ; it is derived from a verb which originally meant to dive into ; an expression such as " the sun dived " presupposes an earlier conception , that it dived into the sea . But the verb enduo is never used in classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the technical term for sunset . // Thus this myth of Endymion owes its origin to the use probably of enduo in some Greek dialect , though not the cnuiinonly received term for sunset . The original meaning of Endymion being once forgotten , what was told originally of the setting sun was now told of a name , which in order to have any meaning , had to be changed into a god or hero . This handsome prince or shepherd , according to the different versions of the tale , went to Karia , where on Mount Latmos he had strange adventures ; he slept in a cave to which the rays of the moon , Selene , penetrated , and in the ancient poetical and proverbial language of Elis it was said , " Selene loves and watches Endymion ; Selene embraces Endymion and kisses him into sleep . " The name Selene is so transparent that the word moon pierces through it ; we should have guessed that the moon was intended , even if tradition had only preserved her other name , Asterodia ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucina do not force us to acknowledge their fitness , they present to our imagination a totally different figure ( as they suggest opaqueness ) from Selene . Learned writers at times still put forward the explanation with regard to mythology that it " was a past which was never a present , " but this myth of Endymion was " present " with the people of Elis at the period of its narration . These and similar expressions were repeated long after their meaning had ceased to be understood ; and as the human mind is generally as anxious for a reason as ready to invent one , the poets added to this story several details , and reasons why Endymion sank into eternal sleep after a life of but one day ; and if allusions were made to these by a popular poet , it became a mythological fact , repeated and embellished by later poets . The construction of such a name as Eos does not differ materially from that of any other name , but as all roots // expressed at the first denote action , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of Eos in Sanscrit is Ushas , dawn , or " the bright one " from the root Vas , to shine ; thus Eos meant originally " he or she shines . " But who was " he " or " she " ? Thus the inevitable myth is evolved . For us the dawn is only the natural illumination of the sky , the brightness of the morning ; our ancestors received a lliffia.e It impression by the break of day . After having coined a word meaning " he or she shines , " that is the light , or Eos , the Greeks continued to portray each step of Eos as she preceded the appearance of the sun on the celestial vault ; " Eos is followed by the sun is loved by the sun " ; she is conceived as a bright and beautiful woman ; if she appeared veiled in clouds , she would be considered as a veiled bride ; thus the epithets : uul relationships showered on Eos become intelligible , she is the daughter of Hyperion , thus her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latin , super ; she is the sister of Helios and Selene , the sun and the moon . As soon as a name such as Eos was first enunciated and used in daily conversation , it grew and gathered new materials round itself ; all the names surrounding Eos in Greek and Aurora in Latin show us how inevitably what we call mythology springs up front the soil of language . Even such simple sentences as " Fos appears , disappears , or dies " are changed at once into myth , fable , and legend , and it soon becomes impossible to draw a line between what is simple language and what is myth . We do not unfortunately always possess the original form of each legend as it first passed from mouth to mouth in the towns and country ; thus our chief sources are the ancient chroniclers , who took mythology for history , and used only so mach of it as answered their purpose , and these accounts do not reach us at first hand . We find a legend in Greek mythology which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daphne flies l ) efore aheebus Apollo , her mother , the earth , moved by compassion , takes her to her bosom , and immediately a laurel appears and fills the abyss into which Daphne had vanished . The mythologists asked themselves what could be the meaning of this ; the more phlegmatic amongst them considered that it had no special meaning at all , but was simply to be looked upon as a fable ; why seek further for a hidden import ? Why ? Because people do not relate such stories concerning their gods and heroes without some good motive . In the legend of Endymion the Greek language supplies all that is needed to make it intelligible , but there are many instances of the difficulty , or even the impossibility of explaining certain Greek names by the help of Greek only ; since a name is not converted into a myth until its original meaning has become obscured in the language which gave it birth , though still perfectly comprehensible in another of the same family , it behoves the classical philologist to surrender all etymological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege it is to seek to discover the signification of a Greek word by confronting it with contemporary witnesses from the German , Celtic , or Sanscrit . In the Teutonic languages , for instance , day has several names which are derived from the root dah , to burn , to be hot ; and this same root has also given rise to the Greek name for dawn . In Sanscrit it is called Ahana , from ahan or dahan , the root of which is ah ; dah and dahan may have lost their initial d , or this letter may have been added to the root ah ; these gains and losses are met with frequently . The Sanscrit name Ahana , known before Greek and Sanscrit became separated , occurs but once in a hymn of ' the Rig-Veda ; in India this mythological germ withered away , and even the name Ahana would not have survived , but for this single verse which saved it from oblivion ; but , // it developed into a splendid growth in Greece , in the legend of Eos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ushas we read : " We have crossed the frontier of this darkness ; Ahana shining forth gives light , lighting up all the world , awakening mortals to walk about she received praise from every thinker . " Ahana rises froua the head of I ) yu , the forehead of the sky ; she shows herself in the east , she advances and awakens the sleepers . In Sanscrit btulh , means to wake and to know , but light iii Sanscrit has again a double naennin , and menus knowledge , much more frequently and ( list iuet ly t Iona light ; this explains how Ahana , in awakening mortals , eaaav s persons to know . The stories of I haphue and of Ahana are closely allied , and the one explains the other . As long as we remain ignorant of the fact that at first Daphne and Aurora were one , this myth is inexplicable ; but turn the name Ahana into Greek , and you have the Dawn in the features of a nymph loved by Apollo , and dying when the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it , may be asked , was Daphne supposed to have been changed into a laurel-tree ? The dawn was called daphne , the burning ; so was the laurel ? as wood that burns easily , and whose flame throws a bright light ? two different objects , but alike under one aspect , though two distinct acts . The root dap is found in daphne for laurel equally with Daphne , dawn , the synonymy of the two names producing the myth of Daphne . Although this legend first came to life on Greek soil , it would have been unintelligible without the help of the Veda , as the later Sanscrit supplied no key to it . The Sanscrit root Ah is also the germ of the name of Athena , the termination of the name corresponding to Ahana ; Athene is said to spring from the head of Zeus . This extraordinary birth , though post-Homeric , is no doubt of ancient date , since it repeats exactly the birth of Ahana. // The Hellenists maintain that the Greeks were unconscious that the word Athene meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally meant the surface or forehead of the sky . It is also true that when the people of Athens worshipped Athene as their tutelary deity , she became something very different from the Indian Ushas ; but if we notice carefully all the many and various ideas concerning this Greek goddess , we shall be led to the supposition that her cradle was no other than that of the dawn , namely , the east , the forehead of the sky , or Zeus . Neither in the Veda , nor in Homer , is there any mention of the mother of the dawn , although both mention her parents . It is a curious fact that in the mythology of Italy , Minerva , who was identical with Athene , should from the beginning have assumed a name apparently expressive of the intellectual rather than the physical character of the Dawn-goddess . Minerva or Menerva is clearly connected with mess , the Greek menos , the Sanscrit manas , mind ; mane in Latin is morning ; manare is specially used of the rising sun ; and mat'u , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dawn . The root man , which in all Aryan languages means thought , was at a very early time , like the Sanscrit budh , destined to express the revived consciousness of the whole of nature at the approach of the light of the morning . The equation Ahane = Athene is both phonetically and mythologically irreproachable , the correlative Minerva can also be explained mythologically . To reject the explanations of these myths which Comparative Philology furnishes , it would be necessary to prove that Ahana and Eos do not mean the dawn , that Athene does not correspond with Ahana , and that Helios is not the sun . ' Mythologists have sometimes failed to discover the IrUnitive character of certain myths , because they have not looked beyond the Greek etymology . The word // Erinnys , " hovering in the gloom , " corresponds exactly to the Sanscrit Saranyi = " break of day . " Poets sometimes speak of the Dawn as avenging the crimes committed in the dark ; the myth of Erinnys denotes this same idea . Instead of our lifeless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered , " the old proverbial and poetical saying amongst the ( , reeks and Ilindoos was , Erinnys  - -  Saranytl , " will bring misdeeds to light . " At first this phrase was free from all mythological taint , but it was afterwards transformed into a myth by the Greeks , as they were ignorant , of the true signification of the name of Erinnys . When the mythology of Greece fails to furnish an explanation of many of the Greek phrases , because it belongs to a later date than the classical period , the Veda may then he questioned , and will supply us with the information , by disclosing an ancient substratum of human thought , such as existed amongst the inhabitants of one of the most important regions of the world , India . It is with as notch pleasure as assurance that we repeat to those learned scholars , who decline to open their eyes in order to see , or see only what they consider should be there , the Brahmanic saying , " It is not the fault of the post that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seems astonishing that a people so richly endowed as the ( ; reeks should have found pleasure in romancing so constantly concerning the sun and the moon , the day and the eight , the dawn and the twilight ; but the custom of repeating these mythological phrases , which much resembled each other , dated from an epoch before the Greeks , when nothing more powerfully attracted and fascinated the imagination of man than the aspect of nature 's forces , especially the return of the sun , bringing with it each morning light and heat and life . Repeated thus incessantly these phrases became idiomatic , and were retold long after the thread connecting them with the simple facts of nature // was broken and lost to memory . At first some old grandmother would repeat them , partly understanding them in their true natural sense , and partly metaphorically ; the sons of the old people would repeat them with a partial understanding ; but the grandsons would relate them only for their peculiarities , or for the charm of their style and setting ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehension of their meaning . At a much later period when all these sayings , with no connection between them , had become traditional , the poets would embody them in verse , giving them their first form and permanence in a cycle of legends . They congratulated themselves on the treasure-trove , but marvelled that the Greeks should enclose these bald phrases of perpetual iteration in the casket of their literature . They might as well ask why the Greeks apparently sanctioned all the irregular verbs their language holds by retaining them in their grammar . Is it not a historical fact that can not be denied that the whole Aryan peoples , without exception , have conserved as the heritage of their common origin not only the names of their divinities , their legends , and their folk-lore , but also remains of their primitive language . Here is a noteworthy statement . Comparative Philology has proved that there is nothing really irregular in a language , and that what was formerly considered so in declensions and conjugations is the stratum on which the edifice of each language raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mythology , because it is itself only a sort of dialect or offshoot of language . Since the raison d'etre of myths , as such , is a forgetfulness of the original sense of the words , we can not hope to be able to explain all the mythological recitals ; no one has more clearly stated the difficulty , nor expressed it with greater modesty , than he who has laid the most lusting foundation of comparative mythology . Grimn108 THE ORIGIN OF THOUGHT AND SPEECH says : " I shall indeed interpret all that I can , but I can not interpret all that I should like . " i In examining these archives , which , if only on account of their antiquity , arc very superior to any other evidence for our purpose , we learn that identification differs from comparison . It is only possible to identify two or more divinities by seeing if ' one name applies equally to all , and by showing that this name denotes the essence of each ; this result , is obtained when , for instance , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Veda , and a god or hero of Hesiod , and discover that though their names may be phonetically dissimilar , yet that they have one source . Uranus , in the language of Hesiod , is used as a name for the sky ? " a firm place for the blessed gods " ; ; and the poet says that Uranus covers everything , and that when lie brings the night he is stretched out , everywhere embracing the earth . This sounds like a reproduction of the name of Varuna , which is derived from a root Var , to cover ( the Sanscrit term rarutra , overcoat , would prove this if need be ) . The name llrauiccs in the Greek apparently retains something of its primitive mueaning , which is not the case with the nauoe of Zeus and Apollo . Varuna and Uranus evidently both express the same mythological concept , that of the covering , enclosing sky ; this may even be one of the most ancient , discoveries of comparative mythology . In the same way we prove that Ushas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of the dawn , and that they can be traced back to a time before Greek and Sanscrit were separated . Thus , whilst one legend becomes differentiated from another by its own peculiar form and attributes , the name of its original prototype remains etymologically the same , though taking varying forms amongst the various peoples who use the legend ; it is in this immutable name that the continuity of ideas lies , which nothing MYTHS 111 ; ) obliterates , and which traverses the centuries , and connects the mythologies of countries as totally distinct as India , Greece , and Ireland . But we must remember that all that is taken for etymology is not always so ; the explanations which Homer gives of the names of the divinities only proves that at his time the original meaning had been forgotten . To us who now know the true principles of mythology , it is clear that it represents a prehistoric period of language , and the light it throws on the times that followed , has the same importance with regard to the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge of the earth . Sometimes we come upon difficulties of another kind when we seek to translate the language of the poets into our modern forms of thought and speech . In consequence of the absence of merely auxiliary words in mythological language , each word , whether noun or verb , had its full original power , it was heavy and unwieldy , it said more than it ought to say . Here is an example : Nyx ( night ) , the mother of Moros ( fate ) , of Ker ( destruction ) , of Thanatos ( death ) , of Hypnos ( sleep ) , and of the Onetiroi ( dreams ) , and these , ? her progeny , Night is said , by the poet , to have borne without a father . She has also other children : Momos ( blame ) , Oizys ( woe ) , the Hesperides , which are the evening stars , Nemesis ( vengeance ) , Apate ( fraud ) , Philotes ( lust ) , Geras ( old age ) , and Eris ( strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The stars are seen as the night approaches , " " we sleep , we dream , we die , " " we run into danger ( luring night , " " nightly revels lead to strife , angry discussions , and woe , " " many nights bring old age , and at last death , " " an evil deed concealed at first by the darkness of night will at last he revealed by the day , " " night herself will be revenged on the criminal " ; and we have translated the language of Ilesiod , a language to a great extent understood by the poople to whom it was addressed many hundreds of years // ago , and it is rnade comprehensible to us by the addition of some auxiliary words . This is hardly mythological language , but rather a poetical and proverbial kind of expression known to all poets whether modern or ancient , and frcclftcntly to be found in the language of common people when it becomes proverbial . " I n Greece the mortal element , inherent in all gods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heroes . Whatever was too human in the ancient legends told of %efts and Apollo was transferred to so-called half gods or heroes , who were represented as the sons or favourites of the gods . The two-fold character of Herakles as a god and as a Into is acknowledged even by Herodotus , and some of his epithets would have been sufficient to indicate his solar and originally divine character . But in order to make some of the legends told of the solar deity possible or cone.eiv:rlcle , it was necessary to represent Herakles as a more human being , and to make him rise to the seat of the icuncorinls only after he had endured toils and sufferings ineouip , ctible with the dignity of an Olympian god . " 1 The divinities of a second and third order , who were sometimes solicited for special favours , were perhaps placed in the same category as some provincial or local saints , who were considered more accessible and more pitiful in certain places , just as some physicians make a practice of curing those ills only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract divinities , representing certain virtues in the eyes of the people , which were highly esteemed and useful to possess ; each of these qualities which were conceived separately , and considered in the superlative degree , were from that time raised to the rank of a divine person , thus altars and temples were dedicated to Courage , Strength , and Piety ; Fame was likewise thus honoured . " Great Fame is never lost though scattered abroad , " said l:lesiod , " it is in itself a divinity . " ' Max Muller , Chips from a German Workshop , vol. i. p. 243 . MYTHS III The language of mythology was in use at a late period . History tells us that , the Greek town of Cyrene in Libya was founded about the thirty-seventh Olympiad , the ruling race came from Thessaly ; the foundation of the colony was due to the oracle of Apollo at Pytho . This simple historical fact has been thus rendered , from the habit of not recounting events as they happened . " The heroic maid Cyrene , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried off to Libya . " The question has been often asked , what can be the origin of the fables which are identical in character and form , whether we find them on Indian , Greek , Italian , Persian , Slavonic , Celtic , or Teutonic soil . Was there a period of temporary insanity , through which the human mind had to pass , and was it a madness identically the same in the south of India and in the north of Ireland ? The necessity of solving this problem became more imperative when collections of these ancient traditions were brought from countries which formerly were almost unknown to us ; incredible tales came from all parts , from amongst the Hottentots , the Patagonians , Zulus , Esquimaux , and Mongols ; in all cases we were able to recognise the fables with which we were already so well acquainted , from having seen them in Aryan literature . When Max Muller first published his essays on the Greek myths , the mythologists acknowleged generally that it was very natural he should devote so much time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories had been universally found in all parts of the globe , from the one pole to the other ; stories of men and women turned into trees , trees transformed into men , men behaving as animals , animals talking as if they were men , men swallowed by gods and brought up again whole , as were the children of Kronos ; in all places the same adventures were told of the sun and moon , also swallowed , but the swallower not known . The Greek myths ? so it was asserted by the // learned who did not care to abandon the old paths ? form only one page of that vast mythology created by the disordered imagination of nations in their infancy ; the epidemic was general , and it is useless to seek for a definite or peculiar meaning in such and such a local myth . Nevertheless , in presence of these striking likenesses , impartial and clear-sighted science recognised that there must be something iu the human mind that of necessity tended to mythology , nay , that there must be some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth . That " something " Max Muller discovered to be language , in its natural pry gross from roots to words , tip to definite and special names . Aythology has now been acknowledged to be an inevitable phase in the growth of language and thought ; a form of expression which changes non-personal beings into personal , and all relationships into actions ; it is a - rental phenomenon so peculiar that it would be difficult to avoid the admission that it emanated from a distinct stratum : , it is metaphoric language and thought ; and it is the duty of the geologist of language to establish the authenticity of this epoch of organic life in humanity , which is contemporaneous with the most ancient forms of language . I I ' I I : , gel compares the discovery of the common origin of Greek and S:uiscrit to that of a new world , the same may be said with regard to the common origin of all the mythologies , for already the science of Comparative Mythology has risen to the same importance as Comparative Philology . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of personification , and produce myths which had no previous existence at the time when this denotation of sex did not yet exist , has been proved incorrect . But the following fact , which concerns language more than mythology , is not so evident at first sight , viz. , that however the various languages may differ externally , MYTHS l I and however they may lack gender , yet they have without , exception what is analogous to it , and takes its place ; this is a system of fundamental classification to which all equally submit , and which each language supplies ; the result is that at the foundation of thought common to all humanity , certain forms are found answering the purpose of gender . Each myth and each legend was at first the intelligible expression of an intelligible thought , and as the thought contained in each recital must evidently be the same wherever there were men to repeat it , the science of Comparative Mythology seeks to place its hand on the expression which best renders this one and the self-same thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of little or no avail for comparative purposes , because nothing is systematically arranged . Names are used in one hymn of the Rig-Veda as appellatives , in another as names of gods . There are as yet no genealogies , and no recorded marriages between gods and goddesses . As the conception of the poet varied , so varied the nature of these gods ; the myths are arranged with little order . Nowhere is the wide distance which separates the ancient poems of India from the most ancient literature of Greece more clearly felt than when we compare the growing myths of the Veda with the full-grown , or already decaying myths on which the poetry of Homer is founded . The Veda is the real theogony of the Aryan races , while that of Hesiod is a copy only of the original image . The Hindoo Rishis differed much amongst themselves in their representation of things ; some of them attributed the dispersion of clouds by a solar hero , to the will of some supreme or divine being ; others considered the combatants to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning and thunder , making the sky serene after the fight . These are the two distinct interpretations of the solar and atmospheric schools ; the dualism in nature , // which at a later period took the character of light and darkness , even of good and evil , was at the beginning the dualism of day and night , spring and winter , life and death , represented by the two great luminaries of the plcysical world . The characteristic traits of the moon which made the deepest impression on our ancestors were its increase , and afterwards its gradual diminution , until its total disappearance . The eclipses , though filling the minds of the people with sudden fear at first , ( lid not continue long to awaken dread or curiosity , as they were of rare occurrence and transitory ; the moon , it was thought , was swallowed and afterwards disgorged by some hostile power ; but the monthly increase and diminution required some other explanation . The 1lindoos , in seeking to discover the abode of the gods and of their own ancestors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , should the Fathers live if not in the vast vault and in the moon ? This was , ice fact , the belief of the whole Aryan race . But the subject is complicated , since in an earlier period of lunar mythology , we find in the Vedic Pantheon a divinity of the name of Soma , which certain poets identify with the plant of that name , whose intoxicating juice played an in-pertant part in the sacrifices ; . there is no doubt a great obscurity with regard to these two rival powers , to which the sane name had been given , and on which mythologists have found it difficult to enlighten us ; but quite recently exponents of the Rig-Veda have discovered that Soma originally meant the moon itself , thus the Rishis allow it to be apparent , in their hymns that there were at one time two Somas ? the plant and its juice , and at an earlier period the other Soma , known only to the old Brahmans , which was the moon . A belief held by the Hindoos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the cause of the diminution ; its increase was explained by the entrance into it of the souls of their ancestors ; the // gods swallowing these also as an integral portion of the moon . All these ideas were of slow development , and of successive growth ; no portion of mythology had a systematic elaboration . I will add as a curious scientific fact , that lately botanists have sought in vain in Northern India and in Persia for a plant whose qualities correspond to those of the Soma as described in the Vedic hymns ; they are more or less agreed that it must be akin to the Ephedra , but as this plant abounded in the whole country between Siberia and the Iberian Peninsula , there was no hope of discovering the locality of the Aryans by means of the habitat of the plant . It has been often asserted that these stories of men and things that have been swallowed must have come from countries formerly inhabited by cannibals ; learned writers , even Herbert Spencer ? to quote one instance ? consider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks , Romans and Germans could hardly have put forth similar stories of this kind had there been no foundation in fact . But the verbs to eat , to swallow , will admit of divers interpretations ; we say of a man that it was impossible for him to swallow such an insult , or that he has consumed his fortune ; and this mode of speech surprises no one ; where we speak of an eclipse , the inhabitants of the shores of the Baltic say that the moon or sun is in the act of being eaten ; in India instead of saying such an one has been flogged , it would be said , he has tasted the whip . A little reflection will convince us that if nations who had nothing in common but human nature , spoke of the night as covering , hiding , swallowing various beings , especially the sun and the day , it was not more unreasonable on their part than to say , as we do , that day and night follow each other , instead of expressing ourselves after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in saying that day and night are the successive effects of the rotation of the earth on its axis . Ilaviiig discovered that mythological phraseology was sometimes due to misconceptions of names , and that poetical fatit ; tsics had their share , philologists quoted an instance of the imagination being misled by a simple mistake ; that , of the name " Great Bear " being given to a certain group of ' stars . The S ; tuscrit root Ark signified to brighten , to praise , to glorify , to celebrate ; man praised , glorified , celebrated the sun , moon and stars ; for these purposes the word Ark was used . For all we know the substantive rik may really have conveyed all these meanings during the earliest period of the Aryan language ; hut if we look at the fully developed branches of ' that fiuuily of ' speech , we find that in this , its simplest form , rik has been divested of all meaning in the RigVeda except , one ; it only means a song of praise , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightens the countenance of the gods . The other words , however , which rii ' might have expressed were not entirely given up , but the root was rendered more definite ; thus arki and u , ? l ? i.s were formed , these no longer meant hymns of praise , but , light , ray . It is difficult to understand how ICi/xha. , in the sense of bright , has become the name of " the bear " ; might it not be on account of his brilliant tawny fur , or from his bright eyes ? No one knows . Certain it is that in Sanscrit bears were called Riksha . But the word ! i i/ ? nha , had also another meaning , as shown by a passage iii the Itig-Veda 1 , 24 , 10 . " These stars ( riksha ) fixed high above , which are seen by night ; whither did they go by day ? " The Commentator observed that the word riksha , is not used in the sense of stars in general , but that according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in later Sanscrit is called " the Seven ilishis , " or " the Seven Sages . " And thus it happened that when the dispersion took place , 1 // and the Aryans left their primitive home and settled in Europe , they ceased to use the plural form " Arktoi , " or many bears , and spoke of the group of seven stars as the Bear , the Great Bear , without knowing why these stars had originally received that name . It did not escape the notice even of the less erudite that the gods of Greece and Rome and of other Aryan nations had a close connection with the most striking phenomena of nature ; they also recognised the same origin amongst the divinities of the Semitic nations , as well as those of Egypt , Africa and America ; this could , of course , be accounted for by the presence of the same primitive stratum of human thought , resembling those deeper geological layers , which only show themselves in a partial and fragmentary manner . But none of these mythologists attached-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were told that they were nothing but names , it sounded almost like heresy to them , and they ignored the fact that one of the latest scientific discoveries was being submitted to them . Yet it is indubitable that the sun and the moon were in the places occupied by them at present before they were named ; but not till they were named was there a Savitar , a Helios , a Selene or a Mene . If then it is the name which makes the gods in mythology , in enabling us to distinguish one from another , it follows that we must call the Science of Language to our aid in order to solve the problem of mythology , since that alone discloses the causes which have despoiled the names of their primitive meaning , and that alone shows how the germs of decrepitude , inherent in language , affect both the phonetic portion and also the signification of words , since words naturally react on thought and mould it . ( ' llAPTER VIII BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING THE habit which I have contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , would , it might be thought , naturally cause me to - notice the dissimilarities between us and them rather than the likenesses ; this often Iuappens , but , not always . Our fathers , for instance , did not , know the thousandth part of our vocabulary , which is very copious ; this would seem to indicate that , our knowledge has considerably increased in the course of thirty or forty centuries . Words of deep import are Iianailiar to us ; who amongst us does not know and use such as these ? Law , Necessity , Liberty , Spirit , Matter , Conscience , Ik+lief , Nature , Providence , Revelation , Inspiration , the Soul , Religion , Infinite , Immortality , and many others , which are either of recent origin , or have become new because their meaning has changed ? Here the a I i ih're-nce between our fathers and ourselves springs into sight . But the points of resemblance are still more striking . Long before our present era , certain philosophers asserted that their world was full of gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our world ; His name is in every mouth , and our little children know it well . Moreover the complete identity between certain mental acts of our fathers and our own is easily recognised . Our fathers were satisfied not to enquire concerning the nature of their gods , they knew their names , and that sufficed . We too have become accustomed to hear God 's name repeated frequently , without always questioning ourselves as to its 118 // meaning , and in what way He has made the earth His habitation . To talk of what we do not grasp must be essentially human , since we find the practice in two social conditions , separated from each other by thousands of years . It is incredible to what a point we of the nineteenth century carry our lack of enquiry . If one day we were to count on our fingers the number of interesting subjects we had allowed to pass by us without any interrogations concerning them , fifty hands would not suffice us for the tale ; our ignorance would then become apparent . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before arriving at this much to be desired consummationve should have been carried away by many thoughts in no way bearing on the subject , and the one thought which would come prominently to the front and hinder us from passing our conduct in review would be , " I see no necessity to apply myself to them . " In fact , nothing is easier and nothing so reposeful to our mind as acquiescence in the popular opinion , which we allow to guide us in our estimation of words and phrases ; as so frequently happens with ourselves ( by " ourselves " I mean that very considerable portion of society which separates the working classes from the savants and philosophers ) . " All things are full of the gods , " was said by the heathen in former days ; and in fact divinities abounded ; this was not surprising . God has chosen to Himself a people and spread his name over the whole earth , and to make His will to be known , " as we say now . Thus we know that God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To consider words as ideas is not wise . Why do we not imitate the savages who when they hear an organ for the first time have a great desire to open it in order to see what is inside ; and we who are civilised play with much light-hearted readiness on the gigantic instrument , of language without seeking to know the value of the sounds // we draw from it ; and the names of beings and objects which should exercise the most powerful influence to which moral things can be subjected , are treated as mere sounds . I lave we asked ourselves the meaning of the word God ? Many must answer no to this question . This is not well , in spite of the tact , that those who have asked it in this fora ) have not always succeeded in obtaining an answer ; 110 one has 1 ? 01 ' 11ied a co1 ) ) plete ( ' umception of God , since neither sense nor reason is equal to the task . Plato , alt heug i nana ? ) ) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian thcoIogians , did not like to speak of ' /'hr ( ; oils , hurt replacing the plural by the singular used the word " I ) ivine , " but he did not explain what he under-stood by this word . Plato certainly mentions the Creator of t he I niverse , the Father of humanity , but ? " he does not tell His is maim. , for he knew it not ; he does not tell His colour , for he said it not ; he does not tell His size , for he touched it , not . " Xenophanes , who lived 300 years before Plato , said , " There is one God , the greatest amongst gods and men ; neither in form nor in thought like unto mortals . " 2 The Greek philosophers protested against all attempts to apply a name which should be adequate to the Supreme Being ; since all the words chosen failed to grasp His essence , and only designated certain sides and points of view , predicting of Him whatever was most beautiful in nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Jews , who had studied in the schools of Plato and Aristotle , spoke of God in the same abstract language , the same negative terms ; they said , " We can not call Him Light , since Light is His creation ; we can not call Him Spirit , since the Spirit is His breath ; nor Wisdom , since Wisdom emanates from Him ; nor Force , since Force is the manifestation of His Power . " // Thus instead of saying what God is , the philosophers , heathen as well as Christian , prefer to say what He is not . But in that case what idea could man form of a Being whom the wisest amongst them could not represent or describe ? Do we understand the nature of this Supreme Being better by using the name so well known of Providence ? Again no ; since we have introduced several meanings into this word which are inconsistent the one with the other . Amongst them there might well be some that are erroneous , which would thus lead us to rest our hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of words and obscuring our ideas , is partly owing to a fault committed by the ancients themselves . When our ancestors communed with their divinities , they did not ask themselves what the names they pronounced really meant ; in invoking aruna , Helios , Athene , Prithvi , and the others , they ere satisfied , at least for the time being , since names possess a strange cahning property ; this unquestioning acquiescence has been bequeathed to us . We are neither more enquiring , more exact , nor more pedantic than the greater part of our ancestors ; we speak of angels , for instance , without seeking to fathom their nature , much in the same way as we might mention lords and dukes without troubling ourselves to reflect that the one means " bread-giver " and the other " dux , " or one capable of being a leader of men . In speaking of the soul , the immortality of the soul , and of religion , we use words which have become common property , and it is not necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which are very real ; still we do not strive to understand what these things really are . Thus it happens that words whose meaning is unknown to us or escapes us , are generally those of which we make daily use ; we keep to the impression received of them in our childhood , or // accepted by current opinion , or with which sentiment invests them , but this is unsatisfactory ; we should feel ashamed of not possessing more accurate knowledge than this of geography or arithmetic . On the other hand , there are scientific terms which seem to us so technical that , we willingly abandon their use to experts , and yet their meaning can be readily and definitely grasped . What meaning , for instance , has the word infinite for us , even if ' taken iu its most simple acceptation ; this r , t/iaailr tuwards which our thoughts travel when we raise our eves to the skies ? Astronomers say to us , " Look at something greater than the greatest possible greatness , that , is the infinitely great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infinite greatness elude our imagination , we repeat t heals mechanically and only out of respect to the high scientific authority who guarantees the accuracy of the c ; dcnlaa.tions or the value of the appreciation . A small object , apparently of the size of a homeopathic globule , moves in space , it contains our continents and our oceans , this globule moves in company with other globules of the same mature . Astronomers speak to us of the millions of miles separating us from the sun , yet this distance dwindles down to nothing as compared with the nearest star , which , we are told , lies twenty millions of millions of miles from our earth . Another stupendous thought is that a ray of light , traverses space at the rate of 187,000 miles in a second , and yet it requires three years to reach us . But this is only a small matter . More than one thousand millions of such stars have been discovered by our telescopes , and there may be millions of millions of suns within our siderial system which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; even that siderial system need not be regarded as single within the universe , thousands of millions of similar // systems may be recognised in the galaxy or milky way . ' Now let us turn our eyes to the infinitely little . One drop of water taken from the ocean contains atoms so small that a grain of the finest dust would seem colossal by the side of them ; chemists are now able to ascertain the relative positions of atoms so minute that millions of ' them cau stand upon a needle 's point . All this we gather from science when ? working together with the telescope ? it investigates space ; and this may still be little compared to what we might see through glasses , which should magnify objects some millions of times more than our best instruments . The infinite in space has engaged the attention of many thinkers ; I will quote from two only , as this infinite , which they studied from different points of view , yet suggests thoughts somewhat alike . Kepler , the discoverer of the laws on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My highest wish is to find within the Gof%Jwhom I have found everywhere without . " Kant , the philosopher , to whom the Divine in nature and the Divine in man appeared as transcendent and beyond our cognisance , and who refused to listen to any theological argument tending to prove the existence of God , yet says , " Two things fill me with new and ever growing admiration and awe : the starry firmament above me , and the moral law within me ; neither of them is hidden in darkness , I see them both before me , and I connect them directly with the conscious-ness of my own existence . " 2 These are very abstract thoughts ; and it is pertinent to notice that the most solemn religious terms , and the most striking expressions of admiration , and poetical phrases of love , have their source in verbal roots , indicative of acts and conditions palpable to the senses . // But I am approaching too closely to matters of high import . I am drawn by the word Infinite . Aristotle said truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that other infinite , which is not the one intended by astronomers ; but for myself the infinite in nature cap-tivates me so powerfully that I find it difficult to touch earth again . Let us walk iu beaten paths ; let us endeavour to grasp the meaning of the more simple words learnt , mechanically at school , such as those denot-ing abstraction as well as nouns , and terms both general and particular ; and let us see to what phase of thought and speech these grammatical exercises will carry us . Each palpable object is known to us according as it affects our senses , that is to say , by its properties ; all iiup:ulpnble objects can not be known otherwise than by their quslities ; but nothing exists in nature , whether palpable or impalpable , that has only one property or one quality , each object has several ; an object as it exists in reality is concrete , and has a concrete name . If we wished to consider only one of its attributes , we should have to take that apart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively on that ; " we must drop that of which the attributes are attributes . " 1 We see white snow , white chalk , white milk , we have the sensation of the white colour ; but to take whiteness apart from the snow , the chalk , and the milk , is an operation which requires an instraanaent , a means , this we possess in a word , viz. , the word white . Without that word we should have the sensation of whiteness , but not the idea ; it is the word white , whilst separating the white colour from the snow , the chalk , and the milk , that gives us the abstract idea as well as the abstract term whiteness . This mental act is called abstraction : and it is by this process of abstraction // that we really arrive at the true knowledge of anything , apart from the sensation of it only . Here is another example of abstraction . Let us suppose that two persons are in one room , and that there are in the room two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us try to obliterate in our mind the persons , the windows , the doors , the tables and the chairs ; nothing now remains but the abstraction two . Now two , as such , apart from objects , does not exist in nature ; still it is a conception we can retain in our mind , and this abstract idea can be incorporated in the abstract word two . These two examples of abstraction tell us but little of what is meant by it ; and although they teach us little of the part abstraction plays in our mental life , they are correct from a logical point of view , and clearly demonstrate the impossibility of retaining a thought apart from the word expressing it , since evidently the representation of two and of whiteness could not have been made if the words had been lacking . The faculty of abstraction has no doubt taken time to develop in man , and the absence of abstract words and consequently of abstract ideas was complete in primitive man as it now is in our very young children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abstraction . One reason , amongst others , why we have no ground to think brutes have abstract general ideas is that they do not speak , that they have no use of the words without which it is impossible to carry out the operation which I have just described , and to cause a conception to arise from a sensation . When , in our early days , our parents gave us instruction on the three divisions of natural history , and explained to us of what they consisted , we did not suspect that a period of immense length had elapsed before man succeeded in thus skilfully classifying the vast mass of names in the // manner which struck us as so natural and inevitable . Many thousands of objects were before us , each one entitled to hear an expressive name ; and in proportion as our knowledge of things increased was science called upon to furnish new terms ; their name became legion and memory failed to retain them . It therefore became a necessity to classify the objects of a common nature under olue name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mineral , which relieved us from the burden of enumerating all the objects composing genus and species ; than in speaking of them to others we use the generic terns , which at the same time presents the image to our own minds . Thus when we wish to denote men having the same nationality as ourselves we employ the collective term compatriot ; in the same way the word furniture includes all that serves to furnish our rooms . Icy the help of this ingenious combination we relieve our memories of a mass of encumbering words , we economise our time and our powers , and simplify the machinery of our thoughts . This is evidently an advantage . But now a difficulty presents itself . When employing these general terms , such as vegetable , animal , the human race , we are speaking of things of which we are ignorant , and are therefore for us as if they had no existence . We can not have a complete knowledge of vegetables since that word comprehends all plants and trees on the earth ; neither of animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking reason but also man who is endowed with it . We are equally ignorant of the human race , since it is composed of ' all human creatures , past , present and to come . It is evident that we only know individual persons and things , such as this fir tree or that oak , this horse , this cow , Paul or James , and we know them because we are in a position to distinguish them by naming them , or indicating them . // How is it that philosophers of the mental calibre possessed by Locke , Hume and Berkeley ? whose minds follow so closely the progress of the perception of general ideas ? did not question how it was that terms which were applicable to these ideas could equally well be applied to particular things ? What was the origin of the word man that it could be as suitable for Paul or James as for many men , in fact the whole human race ? This is a fact about which philosophers do not appear to have troubled themselves , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of our primitive ancestors human knowledge was evolved gradually from what was confused and vague , before arriving at what was deemed settled and distinct . Man 's vocabulary was small , substantives were rare ; that which we now understand by garden , courtyard , field , habitation , was merged into one and the same conception , and would be expressed by one vocable , of which the modern equivalent is enclosure ; the word serpent designated all creatures that crawled , the word fruit implied all that could be eaten , the word mar/all who could think ; each name was a general term expressive of a general idea . We may remember that the Sanscrit word sar , to run , which was at first used for rivers in general , became a particular name ; a demonstrative element joined to the verb , changing it into sarit , run here , sufficed at once to turn it into an intelligible phrase , and the name of a particular river . In order to form the word man-u-s , man , the constructors of language combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary form man-u , with the suffix s , which gives the meaning think-here . This was at first not of general application , but as it could be repeated any number of times and referred each time to different persons , who could each be named thinker-here , it became a general term . We thus see that the name // manus was from the beginning something more than a mere conventional sign applied to a particular person as are all proper names . It was a predicative name , that is applicable to all possessing the same attributes , viz. , of being able to think , and capable of the same act , that of thinking . This discovery was followed by another not less unexpee.ted . When examining the oldest word for name , which iu Sanscrit is Haman , in ( creek onoma , in Latin nomen , we find that it dates from a time when the Sanscrit , ( , reek and Latin languages were all one ; consequently the English - name and the German Name are not as we supposed , words invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the separation of Teutonic idioms from their elder brothers . After setae further steps our contemporary philologists discovered the sources whence proceeded this Sanscrit ltd man ; it is firmed of the root net , originally and , to know , joined to a suffix which generally expresses an instrument , a means ; ndman is the representative of gndana.n , which we recognise in the Latin cognomen , the consonant ( / being dropped as in natus , son , which was formerly ! mn.atus . This word name had at first a much more extended meaning than that of a simple arbitrary sign applied " to what we call a thing . " The constructors of the word were aware of a fact of which consciousness was afterwards lost , and which the learned ignored during all the supervening centuries ? viz. , that all names , far from being mere conventional signs used to distinguish one thing from another , were meant to express what it was possible to know of a thing ; and that a name thus places us in a position really to be cognisant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framers of our language a truth only acquired by us after interminable researches , such as Hegel expresses when saying , " We think in words , " and which we find again in this somewhat // tautological expression " nominibus noscimus " tel nom , telle notion . " The fact that names , which are signs not of things , but of particular concepts , are all derived from general ideas , is one of the most fruitful discoveries of the science of language ; since it not only expresses the truth which has been stated below , that language and the capability of forming general ideas separate man from the animals , but also a second truth that these two phenomena are two sides of the same truth . This explains the reason why the science of language rejects equally the interjectional theory and the mimetic , but accepts the final elements of language , those roots which all contain concepts . The name man , which we all apply to ourselves , is a title of nobility to which none other can compare . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from md , to measure , this gave mds , moon , to the Sanscrit language . The word man contains in " itself the kernel of subtle thought ; if we connect the word with the celestial body that helps us to measure our time , we do noytherefore necessarily invest the moon with a living and thinking personality ; it is sufficient to consider that if our ancestors conceived of it as measuring the nights and days , they had in themselves the capabilities with which they invested the words they created . We must also notice that the creators of this name having connected it with the loftiest thing of which they could conceive ? thought ? did not stop there ; the sight of what was lowest ? the dust ? inspired them with another name , homo = earth-born ; this Latin word having the same source as humus = the soil . Our fathers also gave themselves a third name , which was brotos in Greek , mortalis in Latin , and marta ? the dying ? in Sanscrit ; they could hardly have applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time believed in other beings who did not die . t // And this strange fact has come to pass , that on our planet there existed in former days men ? simple mortals as they were ? who manipulated thought , incorporating it with language , the only domain in which it can exist ; then these marvellous men so entirely eclipsed themselves , and passed out of our ken , that their posterity do not recognise them under their molest garb of anonymity ; for their work though still living through thousands of centuries , is so unrecognised that men ask themselves , " Why is it not possible to think apart from words ? " Thus we acknowledge the profound wisdom of the conceptions of our ancestors ; but their understanding worked unequally , on certain points it was very advanced , but on others behln ( lhatlll . In following the march of human intellect in the past , we an struck by the slowness with which thought and speech co-operated . As long as our ancestors had no occasion to speak of the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did not possess the word ' oar to cover ; " the name of colour in Sanscrit is varna , clearly derived from this word ; and not till the art of painting , in its most primitive form , was discovered and named , could there have been a name for colour . " For some time they continued to view various objects differently coloured without distinguishing the tints ; it is well known that the distinction of colours is of late date ; onr ancestors gazed on the blue sky , or the green trees , as in a dream , without recognising blue or green , as long as they lacked words to define the two colours , and some time elapsed before they particularised the colours by giving each its proper title . We speak of the seven colours of the rainbow , because the intermediate tints elude us ; the ancients acted much in the same way , Xenophanes speaks of the rainbow as a cloud of purple , red , and yellow ; Aristotle also speaks of the tri-coloured rainbow , red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I:3I Democritus seems only to have mentioned black , white and yellow . ' Does this indicate that our senses have gradually become more acute and accurate ? No , no one has asserted that the sensitiveness of the organs of sense was less thousands of years ago than it is now ; the sensation has not changed , but " we see in this evolution of consciousness of colour how perception goes hand in hand with the evolu-tion of language , and how , by a very slow process , every definite concept is developed out of an infinitude of indistinct perceptions . " ' The names of colours have not been applied arbitrarily , any more than the names given to divinities . Blue , for instance , owes its origin to the visible results of violence , or of an accident ; the science of etymology shows us that the Old Norse words , bldr , bla , Blatt , which now mean blue , meant originally the livid colour of a bruise . Grimm J traces these words back to the Gothic bliggvan , to strike ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a bluish grey , from ccxdere , to cut . If the assertion that blue and green are rarely mentioned until a late date be correct , it would follow that they had been worked out of an infinity of colours before they took their place definitely as the colour of the sky and the colour of the trees and grass . As we trace etymology to its source , we see how man 's perception was confused at first . From the Sanscrit root ghar , which has many different meanings , such as to heat , to melt , to drip , to burn , to shine , come not only many words ? heat , oven , warmth , and brightness , but also the names of many bright colours , all varying between yellow , green , red , and white . But the most striking example is afforded by the Sanscrit word a1c-tu . Here we have the first instance of the uncertainty in the meaning of the names of colours which pervades all languages , and which // can be terminated at last by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a light tinge or ray of light. , and also a dark tinge , and night ; this same word in ( creek , calc. - tix , means a ray of light . Thus , whilst ideas are not definitely named , even the most simple , such as those of white and black , are not realised ; philosophers have long known this , but the learned in physical science seem only recently to have drawn attention to the fart , . Virehow was the first to make the fol-lowing assertion : " Uuly after their perceptions have become fixed by language , are the senses brought to a conscious possession and a real understanding of 1 them . " Surgeons have explained that the faculty of sight proeeeds from the movement of an unknown medium , which in the case of light has been called ether , this strikes the retina , and is conveyed to the brain by the optic nerve ; " but what relation there is between the eff'ert , namely , our sensation of red , and the cause , namely , the TiO0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither philosophy nor physical science has yet been able to explain . " 2 We are able to picture to ourselves the difficulties which assailed man in his efforts to express his impressions in primitive times , since we find ourselves at times struggling with the same difficulties , and there are occasions when we struggle in vain , we do not conquer the difficulty . Sensations which are subjective and personal are of all others the most difficult to define , since we lack words to express what is from its nature purely personal ; and yet we have frequently occasion to mention them , how can we best express ourselves ? As the required word does not seem forthcoming we have recourse to metaphor , and // almost unconsciously we use terms borrowed from external phenomena connected with the sense of hearing , of smelling , and of tasting , and which for the most part are acts or conditions in the domain of the sense of sight . Our old acquaintances the roots , whose meanings are to cut , to pinch , to bite , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having formed the base of the adjectives sharp , sweet , keen , burning , we use these to describe certain sensations . We do not know how better to particularise a physical pain than by comparing it to something that tears , cuts or stings . But if certain physical ills , certain colour perceptions , certain impressions of sharpness , sweetness and heat experienced when tasting various foods find metaphorical expression in external acts , there still remains a whole category of simple ideas for which no words can be found . There are certain sensations of taste which can not be expressed in words . Yesterday I ate a pear , to-day I have eaten a peach ; I am quite capable of distinguising the special flavour of each , but finding nothing in the world of facts with which to compare them , I am without words to apply to them , and it would be as impossible for me to convey an idea of the flavour to any one who had never eaten a pear or a peach as to make any person understand if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since all words that succeed in expressing our sensations are drawn from external phenomena , we are in a position to know the origin and historic past of these words . But I can not thus easily foresee even the near future of some of these words . The sound of the clarionet and that of the hautbois , the whistling of the wind , the whisper of the waves , the yellow of the straw and that of the lemon , the green of the emerald and the blue of the sky , all characterise objects belonging to the material world ; but if these words : clarionet and hautbois , vi nd and waves , straw and lemon , emerald and sky , which alune // enable us to define clearly to our minds certain sounds and certain colours were lacking in our vocabulary , I do not know how a musician could have composed a sym-phony , or all artist painted his picture , although the creation of both works of art proceeds equally from personal inspiration invisible to the eye . The tie that binds thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Plato believed that the origin of language was the imitation of the voices of nature ( an error which weighed heavily on humanity during the space of two thousand years ) , he also knew that , words are indispensable to man for the very forma-tion of thought . Abelard was more explicit on this point , he maid : Language is generated by the intellect , and generates intellect . " Ilobbes understood so well that language was meant first of all for ourselves , and after-wards otily for others , that he calls words , as meant for ourselves , mite , and distinguishes them from signa , the sauce words as used for the sake of communication , and he added : " If there were only one man in the world lie would require notrr.i The close connection between thought and speech can not be more clearly or concisely expressed . This discovery makes its way slowly in the world . because certain philosophers who have been rendered inuuobile by tradition , darken counsel by their specula-tions . Some of the Polynesians would seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language than these philosophers to whom I have made allusion ; they call thinking " speaking in the stomach , " which means of course to speak inaudibly , and it is this absolutely inarticulate speech which is so often mistaken for thought without words ; because the fact is ignored that notion and name are two words for one thing . " It is certain , " they say , " that a thought may be conceived in the mind , // but is formulated at a later period ; for instance , if ' yon t have to write a letter of no great importance , and which affects you little , take your pen , and before the idea appears to you completely clothed , your hand has passed over the paper , and you proceed to read your ideas in the words you see before you . " This is an illusion . We can no doubt distinguish the written word from the wordconcept , but the former could not exist without the latter . I defy our opponents to think of the most ordinary and familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying to themselves the word dog . They would explain that the remembrance only of a special dog , or of its bark would suffice to call up the image of the dog in their minds ; they do not see that the likeness of a dog , or the remembrance of its bark is equivalent to the word dog , and that they can not possibly become conscious to themselves of what they appear to be thinking , without having the word in reserve in some part of themselves , either " in 1 le stomach , " as some savages say , or , as is more gracefully expressed by the Italians , in petto . Descartes was a learned Christian , who pondered for some time over the questions whether the human mind could be certain of anything without being supernaturally enlightened ; he resolved to prove it ; and to this end he imagined that he , Descartes , was certain of nothing ? doubted of all ? even mathematical conclusions ; he then reflected on this position , and after a time the idea occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a doubt that he , Descartes , existed , and that consequently it was no longer possible to have doubts of his own identity . The portrait of this philosopher as depicted on the cover of his works , represents him reclining in a chair thinking ? thinking ? thinking ? and exclaiming , " Cogito erg ) ) sum . " Those persons amongst us who are not specially interest l l // in any system of philosophy are certainly in the majority ; all know that such systems exist , and that they are noted , but from the want of reflection , however little , some persons look upon theme as having sprung fully equipped , and in their present form , from the brains of their founders . But it would be incorrect , simply on the evidence of a frontispiece , to consider these philosophical prOCCSSes as thus instantaneous . The systems of philosophy , even those of small value , require niuclh time for their elaboration , and ripen slowly , and are never free from opposition . They establish close links het wren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie longer en earth . The philosophers of the Middle Ages consulted those of antiquity , the thinkers of to- ( lay strove to bu in agreement with those alike of the Middle Ages and of irlitigiiity , and there arise from this intere ( nnmunion of knowledge , groups of ideas of which scone : qv borrowed and sonic original , some true and some false ; these are dependent on the intellectual lucidity and vigour oI ? the latest , arrivals in the arena . Many problems are thus threshed out before our eyes . Not long ago three philosophers were iu dispute and Noire records the arguments ; the discussion turned on the question of priority of thought or speech . They agreed on the fundamental point , all three said there could be no reason without language , nor language without reason . But as they penetrated more deeply into the question , they perceived divergencies ; although the conception and the word be inseparable , yet there may be a moment of time ? infinitely little , doubtless ? between the arrival of ' tfae one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Schopenhauer conceptions were the first in the field , and their immediate duty consisted in creating words ; since the mind could not deal with ideas at will , could neither evoke them , grasp them , nor reject them , whilst no signs were attached to them . To this Geiger objected . How could ideas be produced // whilst no signs existed with which to represent them ? Words came first , and thought , rendered possible by the development of language , followed ; " language has created reason ; before language , man was without reason . " 1 Max Muller replied to both . How could there be a sign when there was nothing to represent ? Conceptions and words , inseparable from the beginning , were produced on the same day ; the day when man 's history begins ; before that what was a fugitive impression and a vocal sound void of sense , became a conception . Max Muller adds : " If Geiger had said that with every new word there is more reason , or that every progress of reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been right , for the growth of reason and language may be said to be coral-like , each shell is the product of life , and becomes in turn the support of new life . " 2 The most important results obtained during the Middle Ages on these subjects find their representations in this discussion carried on by the three learned contemporaries . Max Muller 's point of view is one which reconciles the two diverse opinions . Men still find themselves under the magic influence of the past after some thousands of years ; the first words which our ancestors used in the midst of their ordinary occupations have not ceased to appear in our daily con-versations , in our philosophical writings , and in the reports of scientific proceedings ; it is impossible to speak of our family or social relations , of our affections , our ordinary obligations , our most sacred duties , our observance of laws , without having recourse to words and expressions , which represent the acts of linking or tying , those early activities of our ancestors . The chemist speaks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet and the devout believer when giving free scope to their highest // aspirations do not find truer or loftier terms than links , chains , ties , for that which connects them with the Giver of all pure , sublime thoughts . As it is possible iu the present ( lay to speak of delving into : t question ( creaser ) and of rlr , eking our brains ( creuser ) when we puzzle over a conundrum ; of linking one idea to another ? ; ofpolrslour manners by the help of art and letters ; of seeking to so/'lerl , the heart of God by offerings ( as if lb were a mercenary Judge ) , of linking ourselves with others the better to accomplish a good work , of uniting in freeing ourselves from an undesirable opponent ; it follows that our ancestors as they emerged from their condition of nlnteness finlld it necessary to dig ( creuser ) cabins for themselves , to polish stones , to weave and 1 ) 1:tit , branches together , and to soften tough roots Mr their nourishuteot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how conies it , that these words , which have remained the same outwardly , have so completely changed their meaning as exactly to adapt themselves to modern usage ? We have been deceived by appearances . These words have not changed their meaning , but at first they were applied to tangible objects and visible acts , those which were the most necessary and the most usual in daily life at t li:tt. time ; and now these words are applied to intangible things , : old invisible acts , the most necessary and usual in our present nlcnt:d life . Nor is this which follows less curious . This adaptation of the old words to modern usages could only have been accomplished on one condition , that we should forget many things , and be utterly oblivious to the original destination of these words ; that we should put from before our eyes all images of caves , branches , stones and tough roots ; and this condition we have fulfilled absolutely ; the forgetfulness has been complete ; no one suspects the source of these expressions ; only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men are thoroughly aware that they are making use of the true primitive forms of the human language . A difficulty to be avoided still remains . It might be said that , as it is the result of concerted action undertaken from a community of interest , that these images have become fixed in the memory , and that if the ideas and representations exercised so potent a spell on us , that we were compelled to use the words which can be traced back to the first period of language , does it not follow that we absolutely resemble each other , and that consequently we must renounce the idea of attributing the least individuality to ourselves ? This is a great mistake . Each one of us gives to these representations of ideas that form towards which he is impelled by his own nature , his education , his environment . A man who has some knowledge of astronomy will look at the star-lit sky with quite another eye to that of the poet , who knows nothing of the subject but is struck with its inexpressible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of beauty which would quite escape one who admired it , but had never sought to draw it ; a clever architect with one glance at a newly-built house could assign it a place either with the failures or with those houses which were a 1 ) ccess , and this glance would sufficiently account for the murmured exclamation , " How gladly would I live in it 1 " ( IIAl ' ' l'l I IX A DECISIVE STEP Ih w is it that primitive morn , provided with five senses which bring hint into contact , with the material world only , has found it lsotisihle le conceive the existence of an invisihle world hulled with beings whom his eyes can not see , nor his hands touch , nor his ears hear ? Between the birth of human reason and the invention of writing a long period of time elapsed ; when the art of writing was followed by that of printing , man then printed all that he had thought and written , and at present we possess thousands of volumes which will inform us on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsenre I the hnmam mind . ' ho ) ? ver ould take the trouble to examine this mass of documents , and read those which furnish an approximate estimate of the mental activity of our primitive ancestors , will see that the human ego pursued science unconsciously long before scholars appeared , and applied the name of philosophers to themselves , because they had sought , patiently and with many discussions , through thousands of centuries , to find the best way of arriving at the truth . These ancestors of ours were of an enquiring turn of mind . The appearance of religion amongst men is at the same time the most natural and the most supernatural fact in the history of hunrutity . The greater number of philosophers have recognised that the tendency of the human mind to turn towards 140 // that which is outside the domain of the senses is as powerful in man as the desire of eating and drinking is in all living beings . The ancients acknowledged this to be a true sense , as irresistible as the rest of the operations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensus numinis ? the consciousness of the divine . The desire of understanding the secrets with which the Unknown was invested naturally led to the investigation of the influence which these secrets might exercise on the destinies of mankind . Amongst certain peoples this gave birth to the art of divination . To this they abandoned themselves in all sincerity , not doubting that omnipotent beings would always be ready to make their will known to mortals . The men of modern times have shown that they have the critical faculty more highly developed , and their investigations have dealt more with practical matters . In the eighteenth century , writers , historians and philosophers ? Voltaire amongst the number ? wishing to know how the phenomenon of mental religion appeared in the world , collected all the data to be obtained from travellers con , cerning savages ; they found that without exception all believed in occult powers , as distinct from material or human forces , and doubted not the efficacy of certain magic arts in use amongst them to attract these powers to themselves , and to constrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these writers contend that primitive man , doubtless impressed by the alarming phenomena of nature , would make search for the unknown beings around him , whom the storms , the thunders and the lightnings obey , but these beings were invisible , consequently there must be an invisible world in communication with the visible or human world . In this way were the beliefs of the present-day savages supposed to be those current at the dawn of religious conceptions of humanity . // The ignorance of a subject , of whatever nature , has never prevented the laying down of axioms concerning that subject . Towards the end of the eighteenth century some Portuguese navigators , who never embarked without providing themselves with talisman and amulet , ? to protect them ( luring their voyages , ? which they called feiticos , seeing some negroes of the Gold ( ' oast prostrating themselves with every appearance of reverence , before bones , stones , or Othe tails of some animals , concluded at once without further investigation that these were considered as divinities by the negroes ; and on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that savage races worshipped , /i.ili ; ? H , v. ' l'liis word , /eili , S'u5r corresponds to the Latin / ; tout as , meaning that which is made by hand , as the amulets were which belonged to the Portuguese sailors . The well-known ( ' resident he Brosses used the name and proiniilgated the idea , and without having set foot on Cm n 1ri ' s inhabited by negroes , composed and published a book en their fetishes . In this manner the French language was enriched in 1 760 by the new word fetish . All this seeiued so natural and plausible that the word , and the idea of ' the adoration of fetishes became quite general ; the theory of ' the worship of fetishes penetrated rapidly , and took deep root in the public mind , it found its way very readily into school books and manuals , and we were taught that the religion of savages consists solely in the worship of ' fetishes , and learned writers draw the conclusion that fetishists must necessarily have been the primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no less than the ignorant , allow themselves to speak without sufficiently reflecting on what they say . In order to elevate material objects , of whatever kind , to the rank of divinities , it would be necessary previously to possess the concept of a divinity . Writers on religion speak of that as existing in primitive times which they seek to describe ; they might // as well say that primitive men mummified their dead before they had rum or wax to embalm them with . Fetishism can not be considered as absolutely primitive , seeing that from its nature it must presuppose the previous growth of the predicate God . This idea of De Brosses and his successors will remain for ever a striking anachronism in the history of religion . The history of all primitive races opens with this note . " Man is conscious of a divine descent , though made from the dust of the earth ; the Hindoo doubted it not , though he called Dyn his father , and Prithvi his mother ; Plato knew it when he said the earth produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks of the Rhine , Tacitus listened to the war-songs of the Germans ; they were to him in an unknown tongue . " It resembles the whisperings of birds , " he said , but added , " They are cries of valour , " and his ear caught the sound of two words which recurred frequently , " Tuisto Mannus ! " We now know what formed the basis of these song ; the Germans were celebrating their lineal ancestors under the names of Tuisto , and Mannus , his son . Tuisto appears to have been one form of Tiu , the Aryan god of light . Tacitus tells us that the Germans " called by the names of gods that hidden thing which they did not perceive except by reverence . " 1 Mannus , so the Germans considered , sprang from the earth , which they venerated as their mother-earth who before nourishing her children on its fruits first gave them life . This Mannus , grandson of the god of light , meant originally man . Certain races living beyond the pale of organised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning their belief . // A very low race in India is supposed to worship the sun under the name of Chando or Cando ; they declared to the missionaries who had settled amongst them that Chando had created the world . " 1low is that possible ! Who then has created the sun itself ? " They replied with " We do not mean the visible Chando , but an invisible oue. " l " ) ur god , " said the original natives of California to those who asked in what god they believed , " our god has neither father nor mother , and his origin is quite unknown . But lu is present , everywhere , he sees every-thing even at midnight , though himself invisible to human eyes . he is tiie friend of all good people , and he punishes the evil-doers . " A Blackfoot Indian , when arguing with a Christian missionary , maid : " ' There were two religions given by the ( treat Spirit , one in a book for the guidance of the white men , who , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven ; the other is in the heads of the Indians , in the sky , rocks , rivers and mountains . And the red inch who listen to ( huh in nature , will hear his voice , and find at last the heaven beyond . " These I ndinns consider that that external nature which to us is at , the slum , time the veil and the revelation of the Divine , is sufficient to teach them so much concerning the Supreme living that missionaries are superfluous . Amongst those whose thoughts are occupied by the origin of religious perception in man , there exist several theories ; the first , that the idea of infinity is a necessity to the mint of man , and that by enlarging the boundaries of space and .. f time , it arrives at , that which is without space and without time . Thus may a true philosopher reason ; but , primitive man was no philosopher , and the infinite of philosophy had no existence for him . Another theory is that man is naturally endowed with religious A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? alone of all living creature ,  --  capable of perceiving the infinite in the invisible ; but the nature of this innate instinct not being clearly defined , it is in vain that we try to explain one mystery by another . Others again affirm that religious impressions were the result of a supernatural revelation , but they seem vague with regard to the time in the life of humanity , to which people , and in what manner this came to pass . At the same time they draw attention to the fact that men have always arrived at conclusions rapidly , and , as they consider , without due reflection ; one of these conclusions is that God is . Let us , for the sake of argument , replace the word man by the word intuitive sense or apprehension , and we shall understand why this intuitive sense renders it a superfluous task to make great researches as to the reasons of man 's decision that God is . This intuitive sense is wise , and utters at times great truths ; but the philosophers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are not content with what satisfies intuitive sense , and they act on their right . In our days the religious problem is viewed from two sides . What is understood by these wordseUthe conception of God ? This is the question of questions ; and the names of the writers on the subject , both philosophical and theological , are too numerous to give . It is a psycho-logical and thought impelling study . How did the idea of God first arise in the minds of primitive man ? This is another question which few try and answer . It is a historical study . This presentation of the problem is perhaps not cal culated to inspire excitement or let loose agitating passions ; and apparently the end of the nineteenth century will not witness the renewal of the philosophical debates oil the subject which characterised the last half of the eighteenth . Never either , before or since , has there been so much agitation , nor have men 's minds been so tossed by diverse // currents . Many various theories were promulgated at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought , towards one or the other of kvhieli they leaned . Accenting h ) Hume , ( ; ondillae and their adherents , matter : Ilene exists ; our understanding , our feelings , our will are only tfoish ( rined sensations . This was pure materialism . Pure idealism was represented by Berkeley , who went so far as to deny the reality of matter ; according to him the bodice narking up the universe have no real exist nee ; the true realities were God and the ideas Ile produced in pis . Those who preserved their ancient beliefs were the most treuhled , . they began to ask themselves whether the fonndatioas of their faith were solid , and they much desirid I ( I se , . eert , iin problems solved . These thoughts had exercised the minds of the sages of India , the thinkers of ( rev ce , the dreamers of Alexandria , and the divines and sehelars of the Middle Ages . They were the old problems of the world , what we know of the Infinite , the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lacstrn1s of the possibility of absolute certainty in the evidence of the senses , of reason or of faith . I l much was comprehended in these enquiries . Ono hundred years previously , the cautious reasoner , l h , se , u ? t es , 11510:01 of asking " What do we know ? " posed in its place the question , " How do we know ? " This was fact a fundamental question which appealed to pliilosepli rs who followed Descartes , as of the utmost import slice , ; aid they also asked themselves , " After what manner does the human mind acquire what it knows ? What is called Lucke 's tenet , " Nihil est in intellectu quod non ante fuel it iii sense , " Leibnitz answered by " Nihil ? nisi intellectus . " Noit ? : gives this sentiment a fresh turn by saying : " There is nothing in this plant that t= , // wur+ not , already in the soil , the water and the atmosphere , but t hat , which causes this plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed with Locke , thus formulated his opinion : " Penser s'est sentir " ; or , " In order to feel it is necessary to possess senses , " which is self-evident . Nevertheless , this sentence scandalised some of the philosophers , they considered it degraded thought . It degraded thought only in Condillac 's mouth , since he and his school had previously taken out of sent'ir or sensation all that possessed the right to be called thought ; but for those who admit that sensation is really impregnated with thought it is no degradation ; it is then true to say that thought is sensation , in the same way as an oak-tree may be said to be the acorn ; and a little reflection will show us that " the acorn is far more wonderful than the oak , and perceiving far more wonderful than thinking . " This was not acknowledged by some who disagreed as to the nature of reason and sensation ; they considered the former a mysterious power that could only be a direct gift of the Creator , and the senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simple , as not to require a scientific explanation . If philosophers , such as Descartes and Leibnitz , succeeded in influencing certain enlightened spirits , their language was not understood by the general public ; and Berkeley 's idealism when pushed to the extreme point , proved too abstract to counterbalance the sensualist doctrines ; its language hardly penetrated beyond the inner circle of the experts dealing with the subject , whereas the writings of Locke , Condillac and Hume permeated all classes of society ; everywhere the same questions were asked , and often unanswered amidst the maze of metaphysics , in which it would have been difficult to obtain a precise explanation of a science not yet clearly defined . It is natural that reason after its high flight in pursuit of truth , frightened by the obstacles met in its ascent , and // by the contradictions found in itself , should fall heavily to earth , exclaiming with Voltaire , " 0 metaphysics , we are as advanced as iu the tines of the Druids . " This same feeling of distrust towards proceedings which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , recognising that philosophy moved nowhere so freely nor with such certainty as in the domain of facts , recently cried , " ( ) physic 's , preserve no fr cii metaphysics . " " ' Towards the end of the eighteenth century the current public opinion had been decidedly in favour of materialism , hut a reaction was slowly setting in in the - Hinds of independent ticinkers when Kant appeared " ; 1e carne so exactly in the nick of time that one almost doubts whether the title was turning , or whether he turned the tide . To sketch briefly the chief points in Kant 's system such as he has given its in his hook called Critique of Pure L'eoson , is a rash proceeding ; my object , which is to satisfy the imperious and more immediate wants of our moral being , could only be attained by ignoring the irradicablo difficulties ; this is excusable if we , unlearned members of society , are to form any idea of this same philosophy . The technical terms which abound in philosophical works are useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse for those who are striving to grasp its salient features ; for understanding these terms partially only , or not understanding them at all , they are tempted to imagine that they take in the meaning ; this leads to vague notions being entertained on a subject which is nevertheless earnestly studied . Generally I abstain from the use of ' esoteric terms , but Kant having coined fresh ones to express his ideas it behoves us to use his own formula . To paraphrase them so as to render them intelligible without multiplying them might only further obscure the sense , and yet , on the other hand , to enter A DECISIVE STEP 1.1 : ) freely into further developments would require a volmne , and the end would be better served by going direct to Kant 's work . Hence the embarrassment I feel on approaching the subject . KANT 'S TEACHING . Kant undertook a work which no one before him had attempted . Instead of criticising , as was then the fashion , the result of our knowledge , whether in religion or in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that philosophy , whether sensualistic or spiritualistic asserted as true , and making Descartes his starting point be boldly went to the root of the matter ; he questioned whether human reason had the power of perceiving the truth , and in cases where this power existed ? but with limits ? he sought to discover why these limits existed . He therefore resolved to subject reason itself to his searching analysis , and thus to assist , as it were , at the birth of thought . He accomplished this extraordinary task with an ease of which no one previously would been capable . The world is governed by immutable laws , and the human race is subject to them . Kant gives an account of those which it must necessarily obey in order to pass from a passive " mirror " into a conscious mind . SENSATION . In any material object I may seek to obtain , such as a table , my interests are concentrated in the table itself , not on the tools which the workman has used in its manufacture ; but if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was produced by the human mind engage us ; and these means , of course , consist in the proper use of the instruments at man 's disposal . // That which was at the origin of mankind is repeated at the birth of every human being ; he comes into the world in a lethargic condition , but endowed with latent instincts which we Inoue in one word , sense ; common to man and to , animals , it places them in relationship with the things exterior to themselves ; this sense , or capability of sensation , is nierrly the general faculty of feeling . No newly-born child would emerge from its torpor if it were not , surrounded by material objects which affirm their presence by reacting on hire ; his first act , at the moment when he pi.reeives his surroundings is the transference of his own mind , until now isolated iu itself alone , towards the objects which solicit his attention . The sense which operates in each child is inward , we name it briefly sensation ? to distinguish it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , since even at school th it functions and modes of action have been explained to us . Vet . instance , we know that it is only necessary to touch the strings of an instrument to cause them to vibrate , the vibrations are communicated to the air , and are then called waves of sound ; they diffuse themselves with an ineredil , lc swiftness in space , advancing and retreating in the manner of the waves of the sea , they reach our ears , touch the , umliter.y nerve , cause the tympanum to vibrate , penetrate to the brain , and give us instantaneously the sensation of sound . And it is to the waves of light passing through the ether , and communicating with the optic nerve of the organ of sight , that we owe the sensation of sight of ' the objects before us . The vacant look of : a newly-hoar infant , implies that it has undergone an experience , it has feIt something of the nature of a shock ; rt shock always implies resistance and yielding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself amidst the impressions produced on it by the confused sight of external objects , and hearing the A DECISIVE STEP I 5 I noises which occur around him . This instance is analogous to the vibratory movement of the waves described and even drawn in all manuals on physics . It is strange that a natural phenomenon which learned men have taken some trouble to analyse , should find expression in the following commonplace phrase . " From the clash of opinions light is generated . " If this phrase were not only on our lips , but also implanted in our mind , we should more readily have grasped the physiological fact of sensation . Sensation plays such an important part in the world of humanity , that all the sciences , both physical and moral , deal with it ; but we , who grumble so readily and continuously at feeling either too hot or too cold , probably never enquire what philosophy has to do with purely bodily impressions . Sensations come to us from without , but they would leave us in a condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a mirror on which external objects are reflected ; we might have continued to sleep ? perchance to dream ? if a mental act on our part did not mark the awakening of our intelligence when in contact with the material world , and thus have proved the existence of a power within us hitherto latent , but quite capable of accepting , knowing , and realising sensations which come to us without having been summoned . We are nearing the solution of the problem . Descartes had asked : How we know . Kant had clearly explained that all our knowledge has its commencement in our senses , which give us pure intuitions , that is to say , a clear direct view of external objects , and he also proved that intelligence would not have been aroused without the aid of material objects . But still greater discoveries awaited Kant . We feel that nothing in ourselves is so free as thought . It comprehends the whole world , it mounts to the stars , // it descends to the bowels of the earth , arrested perhaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ; but although free to encircle the universe , it may not choose its path , thought is obliged  --  like the sun ? to follow one which has been previously traced out for it ; of this we call readily collvinc e enrselves . S1'WE AND TIME . All objects of which we become conscious must be placed Icy its in the imagination side by side in space , and at , a distance from ourselves , here or there ; as being now present , or as leaving been , or about to be ; but always in succession , i.e. , in time , time past , present and future . According to Kant , Space and Time are two fundaruent:cl or inevitad , le conditions of all sensuous manifestat ions , and he was the first to observe that they are imposed by se absolute a power that no effort , on our part , would enable us to escape from them , any more than we could avoid seeing the light of day at noon , unless we are either blind or have our eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we call Space and Time , being forms of our sensuous intuition , do not exist apart from ourselves , or , as Max Muller says , " depend on us as recipients , as perceivers . " It is we who say there can be no Here without , a 7'here , and no Now without a Then ; and this is necessary , since we are dependent on the 111 ( 1111 ( 1 of our nrintis , which work irr accordance with their const itut ieus . In 1 N1 1I NA . When opening a dictionary at the letters P. 11 . E. we should soon arrive at the word Phenomenon and its meaning : whatever is presented to the senses , or affects us physically or morally . // As long as knowledge comes to us only by the way of our senses , it follows that in speaking of affinity , electricity and magnetism as natural phenomena , which are known to us only by their effect on Space and Time , we speak in accordance with our method of representation , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least idea what these natural forces are in themselves . We recognise musical sounds because our ears hear them , and we appreciate colours because our eyes see them ; we take cognisance of them as they appear to us , but we are ignorant of both the one and the other as they are in actuality , that is independently of our organs which correspond to them . Thus all the objects that we know ? from the manner of our knowledge ? become for us phenomena , and the world in which we live is a world of phenomena . THE CATEGORIES OF THE UNDERSTANDING . I Besides these fundamental forms of sensuous intuition Space and Time , Kant by his analysis of Pure Reason discovered other conditions of our knowledge which could not have come from without . He divides them into twelve distinct classes , and in the phraseology of philosophy they are called Categories of the Understanding . Aristotle had previously arranged a table of Categories , but in his Logic Aristotle concerns himself with the laws of thought in general , the abstraction derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies the facts first themselves , or first principles , in their relation with certain fixed objects . The different categories have certain traits in common , not a single one of our thoughts but will find a place iii the one or the other . Another feature which characterises all is , that without them no experience would be possible , they rule our understanding . This is very marked iu the // category called Plurality . Let us try to think of anything without thinking of it at the same time as one or many , and we shall find it an impossibility . We can not think of an apple or speak of ' an apple without picturing more than one ; and Max llliiller Inc. : ; demonstrated that rational speech is incpossihle , if we can not when speaking decide whether the subject of a sentence consists of one or uuuiV . CAttsl : AND EFFECT . The ilea of ( 4tctxe and Effect belong to those first principles that reason draws from itself , and the category of causality is one of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , without attaching it , invelmitin ly and necessarily , to some external object which we know possesses the qualities corresponding to our sensations . ' I'lcus the impressions of heat or cold , sweet or hitter , Hue or yellow , evoke immediately the picture of eert ; tin objects which are hot or cold , such as fire ( Jr ice ; or wlcich are sweet or bitter , such as sugar or absinth ; or blue , as the sky ; or yellow , as the lemon ; and these external objects we consider as the causes , and our bodily sensations as the ef'f'ects . Ax1oMs . There are certain universal truths which are self-evident , and were evolved not by experience only or argument , nor science , as they are the natural appanage of common-sense , e.g. , such axioms as the following : the whole is greater than the part ; a straight line is the shortest distance between two points ; each body occupies space ; every event occupies time ; every effect has a cause . All these are more certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always known them , and the entire // human race has not waited for the coming of Kant to recognise these facts . It is strange that the majority of men who know so many things that are true by intuition , often make mistakes when they begin to reflect . They imagine that all things falling under their observation have the power of making themselves , known directly , as if they entered an empty space in the imagination which was ready to receive them . Are they ignorant of the fact that in order to think of an external object , it is not necessary to have it in actuality ? as it exists in nature ? before one 's eyes , but that it suffices to imprint its image on the mind ? This is very simple , and no doubt common-sense itself would see a truism which might be passed in silence . " What is there extra-ordinary , " common-sense might say , " if in thinking of a lemon , for instance , there should be at once presented to the mind a yellow fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a lemon in fact ? " This remark is useful only in showing our natural in-capacity for experiencing a sensation , of whatever kind , without connecting it with an external object possessing corresponding attributes to the sensation , and which was its cause . In any case the truism is not to be ignored , since Aristotle , great philosopher as he was , did not consider it beneath his dignity to employ it . He said : " I think of a stone ; the stone is not in my mind , but its form is . " To prove to common-sense that its remark has no connection with the thesis recently laid down , would serve no good purpose . A personal mental act , if it be lawful to personate a quality , would alone convince common-sense of its error ; but when once convinced common-sense would then have changed to something higher t han it had previously been . It will have mounted up one stage towards reason , and in following this route tinder the guidance of increasing reason , it will end by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as demonstrated by Kant : he who can not distinguish a real object from its representation will never understand the working of the human mind . The importance of this truth must excuse my digression . 11t:rnrr ? stcs . The n:tnte of Kant will always be intimately connected with the Won ' mct:Lphysies , lint because he buried himself it it , as some have supposed who only know his system of pliilr+pin by hearsay ; but because his labours consisted in forbidding reason to approach this science which is constantly threnterirg to invade it , and to get the upper hand by putting itself in its place . Kant , was the first to trace with decision the line of dent:r-rntion between the knowledge of which our reason is mpuldc , mid that of which . it is incapable . No one has drawn sn sl nrp a line between the knowable and the unknowable ; this was to explain metaphysics . Alfred Fouilli 's ? has defined them as " the critical study of pro  - -  Hems which ii mind seeks to unravel from a necessity of its nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solving them " ? such is metaphysics . This definition is excellent , but for those who make no prepur , itory studies in philosophy it would present itself rather in this forms . If certain questions are of necessity presented to the wind which it finds it impossible to solve , it follow that the mind vVoul ( l necessarily contradict itself . Thus this succinct definition of 1 ! ' ouillde requires to be itself ' defined . Noirt+ , whilst giving mere details , is also more exact . " Metaphysics is only explained on the condition that we understand the nature of our power of understanding , in so far as , on the one part , this power is actively manifested in experience , and secondly , in so far as it possesses // anteriorly to any experience , and to anything observed , certain ideas without which there could not possibly or even conceivably , be any impression made in the human mind . " I am afraid that this explanation of Noire will also be lost upon those who are not experienced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite , and is more concise than the two preceding . The foundation upon which all our knowledge and all our science rests , is the incomprehensible ? I fancy that the uninitiated will be equally unable to understand this . It is not surprising . Philosophers speak a language of their own , which must be learnt before it can be understood , which is the case with all languages . Kant develops this thesis with greater simplicity and clearness . " As long as the human intellect moves in the sphere of the senses and of experience it is safe ; this sphere is very vast ; it is there that all phenomena may be known which appears in space and time , that is to say , all belonging to the phenomenal world in which we live . But if the intellect rebels against the gaoler which holds it captive in the magic circle , breaks its chains and enters into the region of ideals , it will err . " Kant relates the following anecdote : " A dove , which found great pleasure in spreading its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration ; the simple bird was ignorant of the fact that its structure did not admit of its taking flights such as the swallow enjoys ; not divining the real cause of its inability , it blamed the fluid ether whose resisting power it had felt , and thought how much better it would fly in vacuo . ' " The dove was mistaken . Kant 's crowning merit is having discovered the object of metaphysics not only in the categories of the understanding , without which , as Noire says , no impression ( ) II the human mind would be possible , or even conceivable , // but chiefly in the power , inherent in our nature , of resisting or yielding to impressions . It is this power , according to Kant , which constitutes the transcendental side of our knowledge . The empirical school of philosophers is tried by Kant 's recognition of ' the transceudeni:I principle in man . Its unenthers nevus ) ) the spiritualists of seeking to raise human nature heyend its proper level , and of wishing at the same time to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : nnl : t. superhuman authority . But Kant is the verb ? l:tst person to i ? ocnnrnt ; e the thought ; on the contrr , through the whole of his philosophy he insists that these c/ priori fort 's , or antecedent conditions of knowledge , have no authority whatever " except in and for experience , " and to use the category of causality , for instance , in order to establish the existence of God is , according to K ; cut , a philosophical blunder . " If ? only we could always remember the first intentions of our words , many plcilosc , , 1 , h al difficulties would vanish . " In ( , reek ( ) lan meant originally , I have seen , and therefore I know . I n a court of justice the witness who says , " I saw " can hardly say anything more convincing . To apply such a word to our knowledge of causes , forces , and faculties would be a solecism ? to apply it to God would be self-cunt niclictery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vouillce , Noir6 , and Schopenhauer contains the leading conception of the subject ; if presented in more simple language it , would be within Ihc ' comprehension of all ; our understanding is blind to all with which it is not made acquainted by intuition derived from experience . Those things for which we have a strong desire , of which we have a certain conviction , but which are outside the sphere of our actual life , " for these , " as Max Muller says in this connection , " we want another word which should mean ? I have not seen and yet I know , and that is ? // faith . " i Our senses may not always authorise us to affirm their reality . God and the future life are not made the subjects of phenomena . All that I have said as to what distinguishes knowledge acquired by the senses from that which is anterior to all ex-perience ( Kant was the first to make this distinction ) , might seem simple to those heedless minds which are surprised at nothing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite useless to the rest of us . There may be something of truth in each of these primitive and superficial estimations , but the whole truth is that all this is very scientific , so scientific as to require a Kant to enable those who reflect to give a lucid account of it .
