SIR : It is perhaps of little moment who may be the author of the familiar couplet : " Count that day lost whose low-descending sun Views from thy hand no worthy action done " , but I have to confess a curiosity in relation to it which books of quotations have failed to satisfy . The ninth edition of Bartlett 's ' Familiar Quotations ' takes it from Staniford 's ' Art of Reading ' ( Boston , 1803 , third edition , p. 27 ) , and compares with it the lines : " Think that day lost whose descending sun Views from thy hand no noble action done " ; which , attached to Jacob Bobart 's autograph , occur ( according to Nichols in his work on Autographs ) in an album of David Klieg 's in the British Museum ; Bobart , son of the celebrated botanist of that name , dying about 1726 . Now , a French poet , Guy du Faur , Sieur de Pibrac , a contemporary of Salluste du partas , more than three centuries ago , pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat resembling the Rubaiyat of Omar , although tending more towards moral lessons . There are , in all , 116 of these stanzas , of which the 31st is as follows : " Iusque on cercuell , mon fils , vueilles apprendre , Et tien perdu le Jour qui s'est passe , Si to n'y as quelque chose amasse , Pour pins egavant , et plus sage to rendre . " The little work was rendered into English ? and very well rendered , too  --  by Joshua Sylvester , the leading religious poet of his day in England ( 1563-1618 ) . I am ignorant of the date of Sylvester 's publication , which is not specified in the Dictionary of National Biography , but can approximate to it by noting that his translation of the second of Du Bartas 's " Devine Weekes " was dedicated to Prince Henry of Wales , among others , and published in 1611 . In the dedication to the Prince , Sylvester says : " The gracious welcome you vouchsafed erewhile To my grave Ribrac , though but meanly clad , Makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come , though suited even as bad , To kiss your Highness 's hand " Henry was seventeen years old in the year 1611 , so it is not likely that the Pibrac translation was more than a few years earlier , at most , and it may probably be placed between 1605 and 1611 . Sylvester 's version of the quatrain is as follows : " Cease not to learns untill thou cease to live ; Think that Day lost wherein thou draw'st no Letter , Nor gain'st no Lesson that new grace may give , - To make thy Selfe Learneder , Wiser , Better . " The relation between the stanza and the couplet appears to be close enough to indicate that one of them was adapted from the other . T. W. HAIGHT . WAITIKEBTEA , WIS , November 1 , 1902 . Notes . The Century Co. has secured the American allotment of President Kruger 's Memoirs , which it will have ready by the end of the present month . About the same time , Houghton , Mifflin &; Co. will issue ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by William Lawrence , Bishop of Massachusetts . They further announce a new edition of Maria S.

The seven-volume edition of ' The Works of Edward FitzGerald , ' over which Mr. W. Aldis Wright presides , will make a monthly appearance through Macmillan Co. , from December on . Few announcements of the season rival this on interest . That the best is not always the enemy of the good will be proved , we think , by the reception that awaits A. C. McClurg &; Co. ' s clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text of the ' History of the Expedition under the Command of Captains Lewis and Clark . ' In other words , the late Dr. Coues 's monumental annotated edition , being out of print , can no longer compete in the market with the original edition of 1814 . The present publishers have appropriately chosen for " supervisor " rather than editor Dr. J. K. Hosmer , the historian of the Louisiana Purchase . His part has been also to furnish an introduction containing a broad view of the causes leading up to the purchase , and which linked Napoleon 's name with Jefferson 's in the most famous of our continental expansions ; and to supply an index . This is a welcome innovation upon Biddle . It is analytic in the case of the two leaders of the expedition and in some minor rubrics ; but such a one as " Mosquitoes " has fifty blank numerical references . Two new reproductions of portraits of Lewis and Clark accompany the facsimile of Biddle 's maps , but we miss a map of the whole route laid down upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but praise for this venture of the Chicago firm Two white and gold volumes in duodecimo issued for the gift season by G. P. Putnam 's Sons are a reduction of the Moxon edition of Tennyson 's ' Idylls of the King . ' Dord 's designs have undergone a corresponding change of scale with the letterpress , and naturally lose somewhat as illustration while answering all the purposes of decoration . Print and binding are in commendable taste . The joint effort of Carolyn Wells and Oliver Herford in ' A Phenomenal Fauna ' ( R. H. Russell ) reflects the cleverness of both Miss Wells 's metres sometimes limp from a false stress , and Mr. Herford 's pencil occasionally shows less droll , but they generally pull evenly together , as in the case of " The Fire-Dogs . " The lady 's natural history of " The Human Swallow " is more successful than the artist 's conception , which is , however , paralleled with great effectiveness in " The Flying Buttress " and " Time-Flies " ? two very convincing designs  --  and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herford 's " Round Robin , " " Bookworm , " " Jail Bird , " and " Irish Bull " ( to whose jokes John Bull is so impervious ) . Miss Wells sings merrily of " The Haycock " that never crows and " has no brains , - No , not enough to go in when it rains , " and concludes , respecting the bird already mentioned " The Swallow 's strong when he is in his prime , And yet a man can down him every time . " - Mr . William J. Long , in ' School of the Woods ' ( Ginn &; Co ) , has another entertaining collection of animal stories derived from his experience in Northern woods . His subjects are chiefly the larger and rarer animals , seldom met except by hunters and naturalists ; and some of his incidents are strikingly uncommon . He believes that instinct has much less to do in governing the lives of birds and mammals than early education has ; and that animal fear , which he defines as watchfulness and timidity , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As reasons for this belief , he suggests the frequent fate of young , untrained wild creatures abandoned to instinct , and of domesticated animals forced to take to the life of the woods , and , further , gives various observations of his own On one remarkable occasion , described more fully in a preceding volume , ' Beasts of the Field , ' he watched a group of caribou mothers teaching their young ones to follow a leader and to jump over a fallen tree , on another , he found hidden away two young fawns that showed no fear of him , and he noted the means by which the terrified mother- inspired them with distrust . Later , he had other opportunities to watch their education , until one fawn became wise and wary , and the other perished through disobedience to the mother 's teachings . Mr , Long also takes the ground , in opposition to well-known naturalists , that on the whole the life of wild animals is untroubled and joyous , and that for most of them death is not a tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell 's Miniature Series of Painters " ( New York : Macmillan ) , gives , in pleasant enough form , as much as is necessary to be known of that eminently skilful and popular but uninspiring painter . In the illustrations , however , his especial qualities of elaborate detail and suave execution are hardly treated by the excessive reduction which the scale of the booklet necessitates . In the more elaborate and crowded subjects , especially , one gets only a sense of confusion , which the artist 's system of composition does nothing to clarify . In ' Sea Fighters from Drake to Farragut ' ( Scribners ) Jessie Peabody Frothing-ham tells afresh the stories of Drake , Tromp , De Ruyter , Tourville , Suffren , Paul Jones , Nelson and Farragut , in a manner well calculated to arouse enthusiastic admiration for these gallant sailors in the boyish breast , and win a renewed tribute of respect on the part even of " the grownups . " It is only when she struggles with technical details that our applause falters . What Drake was doing when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to Tromp 's vessel when raked " from helm to stern " ; what " machinery " was " riddled " on board of Suffren 's sailing-vessel , the Mars ; who , in 1756 , had ever heard of a " coaling-station " ? these are conundrums to puzzle Benbow himself . Clear type , good Paper , excellent illustrations ( too few in number ) combine with a stirring subject and an agreeable style to commend the book to those weary souls soon to be in the thrall of the annual search after Christmas gifts , not only for sons and nephews between the ages of the hobby-horse and the polo pony , but for older friends as well , who still relish a deed of daring skilfully told . Capt . A. T. Mahan has collected a number of his contributions to various magazines , and republished them in a volume entitled ' Retrospect and Prospect ' ( Boston : Little , Brown &; Co . ) . The vaticinations concerning our future as a " World-Power " seem now a little stale , and must pall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spirit of Capt . Mahan 's teaching is well illustrated by his contention that private property upon the sea should be destroyed in war . Gen. Jacob Smith 's order to the American forces in Samar , to kill every one over ten years old , seems to be an improvement on this doctrine . Four addresses by Carroll D. Wright are republished by the American Unitarian Association , Boston , under the title ' Some Ethical Phases of the Labor Question . ' The essays are homiletical in character , and prove at least that their authdr has a benevolent disposition . He repeats the popular fallaey concerning the followers of Adam Smith , that they maintain that men should seek their own advantage without regard to the welfare of others , but he can hardly be blamed for believing a proposition so generally accepted . On the other hand , he does something to expose the far= lacy that the condition of laborers in factories is inferior to what it was under the domestic system . That our American public is more or less apathetic in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively arranged , is shown by the fact that Garden and Forest , a journal devoted very largely to this subject , and characterized by a fine taste , was suffered , after a useful life of ten years , to die from lack of support , This deplorable state of affairs can not be remedied in any more effective way than by the publication of just such works as ' A Plea for Hardy Plants , with Suggestions for Effective Arrangement , ' by J. Wilkinson Elliott , Landscape Architect ( Doubleday , Page &; Co . ) . One may not agree with all the advice here offered by Mr Elliott , but one must confess , nevertheless , that very little of the advice is really misleading ; nearly all of it is good and stimulating . The facility with which photographs can now be reproduced in printed illustrations gives modern works on landscape architecture a very great advantage over their predecessors . In Mr. Elliott 's volume the photographs have been excellently chosen , and their execution is nearly perfect . All the working plans seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person of taste ought , with a little leisure and with the suggestions offered in this hook , to be able to arrange , fitly and harmoniously , around a country-house , plants adapted to our outdoor conditions , It is pleasant to think that , even in our exacting Northern climate , we have a wide selection of beautiful plants . The main thing is to get them put in the right instead of in the wrong places . The first annual issue of the ' International Catalogue of Scientific Literature : Botany , Part I. ' ( London : Harrison &; Sons ) forms a volume of rather less than 400 pages , embodying an immense amount of work . Considering its costly character , it is offered to the scientific public at an astonishingly low price , namely , one guinea . It deals with one of the seventeen branches of science for which the International Council of the Royal Society of England has undertaken to provide catalogues . The original scheme , it will be remembered , provided that each catalogue " should comprise all original contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journals of societies , or as independent pamphlets , memoirs , or books . " It was held to be of great importance that not only the titles of papers , but their subject-matter also , should be indexed ; but financial considerations have led to the number of subject-entries being at present limited in number . There has been less cooperation on the part of authors themselves than the committee had a right to expect . Therefore , the index at present leaves a good deal to be desired . The second part of this volume on Botany will be issued in the course of a few months . The sections under Botany number more than cne hundred , and many of these are subdivided into numerous minor headings . When the plan is once understood , it is comparatively easy to find the special topic indexed . It may not be known to some of our readers that in Zurich , at the present time , an American , Mr. Field , is conducting successfully a comprehensive index to current zoological literature . His system is admirable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his system to botany , but , so far as we are aware , he has not yet done so . We lately noticed the appearance of Part I of ' Petrie 's Collection of Ancient Irish Music ' ( London and New York : Boosey &; Co . ) . Part II . is now to hand , bringing up the number of tunes and variants of tunes to 1,054 . We understand that a third part will finish this most wonderful collection of Irish folk-music in existence . All the tunes in Part II . are named , as were only some half of those in Part I. The ancient lullabys , laments , and funeral cries are particularly interesting . The setting , which is in the treble clef alone , is simplicity itself . The issue of Parts xxviii , and xxx . of Poole 's ' Historical Atlas of Modern Europe ' ( H. Frowde ) brings that work to a close . Part xxviii. contains Mr. C. Grant Robertson 's map of the Growth of Russia , 1415-1890 , Miss Eckstein 's Italy , 1167-1250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Kingdom of Delhi o. 1840 , and the Mogul Empire at the death of Akbar , 1605 The map of Prussia , in addition to the large map of Germany , comprises three insets , the Principality of Neufchatel , the Principality of Orange , and the Gold Coast , too small to serve as maps of value , but interesting and important as calling attention to abandoned incidents of expansion . The letterpress of Mr. Poole 's map is accompanied by a large table of the Mohammedan dynasties of India . Part xxix. comprises Europe at the time of the Third Crusade , by the Editor ; Mr. Robertson 's Germany , 1815-1897 ; and Mr. W. A. Craigie 's Scandinavia in the Thirteenth Century . Part xxx . includes Mr. Robertson 's Germany , 1647-1795 ; Mr. Charles Oman 's India in 1792 and in 1815 ( double map with inset ) ; and Mr. G. Geoffrey Palmer 's South Africa previous to the suppression of the Boer Republics . With these the series is complete , and the work can now , presumably , be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or should not be included in such an atlas must of necessity vary , but in the main the grouping , both in respect to selection and proportion , is very good . The inclusion of many maps , hitherto inaccessible in any authoritative form , notably those connected with English history , gives the atlas a value independent of its general worth . No one could recognize its dependence on the work of Spruner and Menke more fully than doss the Editor in his preface , yet the new material , the recasting of the older matter , and the mechanical execution make this atlas worthy to rank beside its predecessor and model . One feature , to be sure , hoped for rather than expected , is , indeed , lacking  --  an index . Such an addition would , no doubt , have greatly increased the labor and expense of making the atlas , yet one can but regret its omission . Our readers may be glad to know of the Quarterly Bibliography of Books Reviewed in Leading American Periodicals ( 29 in number ) , edited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and published at Bloomington . The successive issues embrace what has gone before , on the well-known cumulative plan . The entries are by author , when possible ; the name of publisher and the price are given ; and the reference is by volume and page Volume i began with January , 1902 , and the third issue comprises 144 octavo pages . The Smith College Monthly for November contains in the Alumna= Department an article on " The Problem of the South , " by Miss Helen M Chesnutt , daughter of Mr. Charles W. Chesnutt , the well-known author . It treats briefly of the race problem , and more at length of its solution in the work at Tuskegee . The subject and the writer make the article notable .

The account of the operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India , volume xvi. , is devoted to ' Details of the Tidal Observations taken during the Period from 1873 to 1892 , and a Description of the Methods of Reduction , ' by John Eccles , M. A. The observations were originally begun in order to investigate the supposed secular changes in the relative level of land and sea , more particularly on the coast of RathiawS , r . Eventually , the system of tidal investigations adopted by a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was put in practice , with a view to securing scientific results of the highest value . These researches , it was expected , would lead to an evaluation of the mass of the moon , to information concern- ? ing the rigidity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea from the observed velocities of the tide-waves , and to various practical benefits to navigation The results of the observations and values of the tidal constants appear in the second part of the volume Daily records of temperature , pressure and wind have been taken at every station by means of a complete equipment of meteorological instruments . Some attempts have been made to trace a connection between errors of tidal prediction and the effects of wind and pressure , but without success . Irregular tides , falsifying predictions , may be produced on a coast by storms in mid-ocean too distant to affect the barometer or the anemometer of the tidal station , or the effects of storms may be transmitted through the air and the water at widely different velocities , and may thus be recorded on the tidal and meteorological instruments at widely differing times The Geological Survey of Canada has published Part VII . of its ' Catalogue of Canadian Plants ' It contains descriptions , by John Macoun , of all the species of liverworts and lichens known to occur In Canada , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American mosses north of the United States is brought up to date ? The Soule Art Company , Boston , have issued what they boldly name a Complete Art Reference Catalogue ' It is a stout volume of nearly 1,600 pages of clearly printed text  --  evidently an enterprising venture . The 30,000 or more entries are the titles of the photographs which the company offers to supply at the prices named . Such a volume might have ' been of almost incalculable utility to students of art , but it is unfortunately constructed . on false principles To begin with , it mixes old masters and contemporary artists together , which every buyer of photographs of works of art will perceive to be a blunder . Few purchasers collect both kinds . It would have been quite easy to separate them in two volumes , and group the old masters in schools , and chronologically instead of alphabetically The other and worse error is that the name of the photographer is never stated . Now in modern books on art history the pictures of old masters are often , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Hanfstangl number . In the preface it is stated that the best print of a given subject is supplied , whoever its photographer happens to be . A buyer , however , will not be inclined to trust a dealer 's judgment in that matter , and will prefer to select for himself . We do not intend to imply that this catalogue will be useless  --  far otherwise ; but serious students of art history will prefer to keep on hand for their own use the now classical catalogues of Braun , Hanfstangl , Anderson , and the other photographers of established reputation . ? ' Fifty Mastersongs , ' for high voice , edited by Henry T. Frock for Oliver Ditson Co ' s " The Musician 's Library , " is a quarto volume most attractive without and within . The print of both words and music is beautifully clear , and each piece has attached to it the names of poet , composer , and ( if need be ) translator , their life period ; and the date of composition . The editor , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above personal data , portraits of nine among the greatest of the twenty musicians represented , and some informing discourse concerning the collection , with special remarks on each piece and its author . Mozart is the only one whose life fell wholly in the eighteenth century , Beethoven and Schubert the only other two born in that century . From Chopin on , we keep nineteenth-century company , down to Richard Strauss ( born in 1864 ) and the American MacDowell , whose setting of Mr. Howells 's " The Sea " dates from the present year and so is a twentieth-century product . The distribution of nationalities is very catholic . Of the fifty " mastersongs , " but twenty-nine are of German origin . Norway , Russia , Poland , Hungary , Bohemia , France , and the United States divide the remainder . Significant is the quota ( six ) allotted to Grieg . Mr. Finek could had no Italian song worthy to stand in line with the others ; and what a shock this would have given to the author of the ' Dictionnaire de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except French , and refers solely to Italy and ? Scotland as other lands of song . ( But he was later to be a partisan of Gluck ) Some now may wish that Mendelssohn might not have gone without a single witness in this collection , as being all " stale . " Heine leads Goethe m it as the inspirer of musical song , with seven and six texts respectively . Boden stedt and Tom Moore occupy the third place with two each . On the musical side , Schubert figures most prominently , with Robert Franz and Grieg tieing each other next after . We forbear to catalogue the songs , of which the high order is indisputable ; but we can testify to the validity of the publishers ' claim regarding the renovated translations , that they are a great improvement on those heretofore in vogue . ? Under the title Medimval Europe ' ( Holt ) , Miss Mary Sloan translates an excellent text-book on the history of the Middle Ages which MM . Charles Belmont and Gabriel Monod have prepared in collaboration . Though written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book is free from all parade of learning , and is even adapted to the use of higher schools Prof G B. Adams , who furnishes a preface , is impressed by the authors ' " great simplicity of statement , " and we must concur in the view that nothing clearer or more direct could be desired We also approve an arrangement that allots all the space to text , maps and brief bibliographies . It is becoming doubtful whether in these short manuals the illustrations are worth the room they occupy . As for the scope of the book , it begins at the close of the fourth century , and comes down to the death of St. Louis . There isan admirable account of institutions , and no time is lost in the narration of facts which can not be made to illustrate features of expansion and advance . The importance of France is not exaggerated , neither is there a disposition to slight the annals of the Church . One other point deserves notice . while all show of erudition is avoided , the text keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fact we must attribute much of its vitality . In short , we can praise the book with great heartiness , and urge its adoption in cases where the student 's view of the Middle Ages must be restricted to a brief survey . ? Whatever effect the " Rhodes " scholars may hereafter produce on the academic life of Oxford , the University itself has obviously no choice , at present , but to ignore what does not exist . The point of view in America and the British colonies is naturally less detached . With a somewhat precipitate faith in the ability of trustees and electors to light on students who will satisfy all the tests , intending candidates , chiefly Americans , are already inquiring into the conditions of study at Oxford . On behalf of the American Club of Oxford , Mr Louis Dyer has recently issued a neat sixpenny pamphlet entitled ' Oxford As It Is ' ( Macmillan ) , in which he answers these inquiries and forestalls others that will be certain to arise . It is , in fact , a revised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May , 1900 , " for the purpose of presenting information with regard to Oxford conditions of study in terms intelligible to American students unfamiliar with English University and College systems " The need of such a summary will be felt by the American student who realizes that full official information is not to be had in a concise form for the asking , but is scattered in a number of University publications , such as the Statute , the Oxford University Calendar , the Oxford Examination Statutes , and the University Gazette In addition to these , one could hardly dispense with the ' Students ' Handbook to the University and Colleges of Oxford , ' and to acquire them all would cost at least four dollars ; to use them effectively , one would need experienced advice . On the other hand , Mr. Dyer , in some forty pages , defines the general system of Oxford education , describes the Colleges and the University with their officers , and gives all the necessary information for the requirements of residence , matriculation , examinations , and degrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any list of the lectures in the various departments ; for these the student will need the Gazette , which the official programme is published at the beginning of each term , having been drawn up , as a rule , at the end of the previous term . Under the head of information concerning degrees and the steps to be taken by a candidate who approaches examinations , Mr Dyer 's readers , if they are already graduates , will probably be most interested in those degrees which do not require the Oxford B A. as a condition precedent . These are the B C.L. , the D.C. L , and the new " Research " degrees in Science and Letters . Until 1895 no degree except that of B.A was open to graduates of any university or college but Oxford , excepting only cases of " incorporation . " There are now , however , six degrees open to advanced students resorting to Oxford ; those in Science and Letters being conferred upon candidates who give evidence of having received " a good general education , " while those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved B.A elsewhere than at Oxford . ? It should be noted by those having Rhodes scholarships in view that they will not be allowed to avail themselves of the " non-collegiate status " ? that is to say , they will lid expected to enrol themselves on the books of one of the Colleges . Mr. Dyer has devoted a chapter to " Expenses and the Like , " in which he estimates that , " with strict economy , " ? 120 ( or $600 ) may be made to cover all the necessary charges of a student residing in college rooms for the twenty-four weeks of the academic year . But it would be a grave mistake , we are convinced , for an outsider , with no knowledge of English life and the points at which economy can be practised , to embark on an Oxford career with so small a margin ; it would entail a narrowing of outside interests and of social life that would rob an Oxford course of many of its advantages . The full account given by Mr. Dyer of the Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it will serve students from the British Colonies who go to Oxford with the intention of taking the B.A. course A few Americans have done this in the past , while others have added the Oxford B.A to their American bachelor 's degree . But whether or not it was Mr. Rhodes 's intention , it seems probable that his scholarships will be given to graduates , in which case it is to be hoped that an interchange of advanced students between America and England will result . Advocates of the elective system in America will see from Mr. Dyer 's table of examinations for the B.A. degree on page 25 that only " Responsions , " the first and very elementary examination , answering to the " Little Go " at Cambridge , and Holy Scripture are compulsory . After this , the whole scheme offers alternatives , and is as truly elective as the Harvard programme , except for certain regulations governing the intermediate stage of work for the student of Mathematics , History , and Law . Mr. Dyer devotes a page and a half to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fully served in the ' Graduate Handbook ' published by Bryn Mawr College ; moreover , they are outside the pale of the Rhodes foundation .
