txt A new submarine destroyer from which the crew can see and hear sights and sounds at a great distance and thus strike with greater accuracy has been invented by Lewis Nixon , the shipbuilder . Mr. Nixon admitted It yesterday , and said that he has applications for patents pending all over the world . The new submarine destroyer , Mr. Nixon said , will be offered to the United States Government by the inventor before any foreign power has an option on it . The boat has a secret device by which , it is said , it will be practically impossible for a torpedo or a strange craft to come within a mile or two of the submarine without being observed or heard . " After that , " said Mr. Nixon yesterday , " the question of the destruction of the unwelcome craft is another matter , requiring another device . This is covered by one of the applications for patents now pending and the blowing up of a hostile vessel approaching too closely is a very simple matter . My device includes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when exploded near a hull . Ey other parts of my invention , through which vessels under or above water can be placed by my craft , it is as though the eyesight were exaggerated and the hearing rendered extremely sensitive . " Further than this it would be disastrous to all interested to speak at present , save to say that my submarine will be more than half submerged when afloat . Only a small part of it will appear above water , but that part will contain the apparatus for observing and hearing and generally locating strange vessels . The new explosive and its opperation I do not care to discuss just now , except to say that it has been perfected . " Mr. Nixon , speaking of the progress in the use of torpedo and submarine craft in naval warfare , drew attention to the fact that the German Emperor had recently announced his intention of descending , as President Roosevelt had done , in a submarine boat in order to test its practicability . " This , " said Mr. Nixon , " is fitteresting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the submarine as more or less of a joke . When Prince Henry of Prussia was here he fold me that the submarine boat did not count for much . When I told him- that I could send out a. submarine boat that could destroy all the German ships , he laughed . " ' Nevertheless , your Highness , ' I said , ' In a few years you will be building submarine boats . ' " I think a few months will see that prophecy fulfilled . The submarine boat must now be considered as a serious force in naval warfare " While in Russia I had an opportunity , the first in many years , to really study naval needs as affected by the advances since I designed the Oregon . " While in St. Petersburg I designed armored destroyers  --  a 15,000-horse-power oceangoing destroyer and a. submarine torpedo-boat destroyer . These are propelled by the Standard gasoline marine engine . The action of Congress in placing alcohol on the free list I regard as almost equal in effect to paying off the National debt . Alcohol is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine destroyers will be small , capable of being carried on the decks of battleships and large cruisers , to be put overboard at the beginning of an action . " They will be able to sink a battleship , as they will carry torpedoes , besides my devices for locating and destroying torpedoes . These devices are very simple but novel . " I have not offered my new inventions to the Navy Department as yet , as I should have to prove them by trials . But , of course , anything I have is at the disposal of the Navy Department . Nevertheless I built the first of our submarines , and it was hard to get a report of what they really did on account of the great prejudice against this type of boat . " This prejudice is over , however , and we must now turn our attention not only to perfecting the submarine , but to combating it in its greatest perfection . This I am satisfied I can do . " The new destroyer will be produced in model in a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vessel for destroying the submarine , and I may make a public demonstration of its utility . It will have a speed of twenty-one and a half knots . "
