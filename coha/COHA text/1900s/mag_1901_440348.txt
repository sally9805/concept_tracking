A LITTLE old book , shabby and yellow and worn at the edges , found among the papers of a Quaker fanfily in Philadelphia , has come into my hands . On the outside is written , " Diary for the years 1760 , 1761 , and 1762 kept by A. W. ; " and within , every corner is closely filled with small , old , faded writing . A. W. , it is known , was Ann Whitall , one of the Cooper family from which , afterwards , Fenimore Cooper was born . She was the wife of James Whitall , a New Jersey farmer , and was the mother of seven children . They lived at Red Bank , across the Delaware , about six miles from Philadelphia . Save for one appearance in Revolutionary history , little was known about her until this diary was discovered . But this brown book of " Meddatations , " saved by chance out of the waste of time , gives us a strangely vivid glimpse of three years of her life . At the time this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred years in New Jersey and Pennsylvama . Originally exiled from England for the sake of their faith , they had grown rich , and the natural bent of their religion had given a certain stamp of staidness and comfort to their homes and meeting houses , which still are to be found about Philadelphia . But these English yeomen and laborers , called from their fields and farms by the religious excitements of the seventeenth century , swept as it were across the Atlantic by one of the storms of that stormy period , had soon fallen back into the rural ways of their race amid the peace and quiet of this remote colony . Any one who knows New Jersey can picture the old farmhouse where Ann Whitall lived , the great trees , the meadows and cattle , the broad Delaware flow- // ing by , the sandy roads ; and , not far off , the square gray little meeting house , whither on First Days and Fifth Days the neighbors would drive , and , hitching their horses in the sheds , would sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved now and then to preach or pray , and sometimes a farmer or farmer 's wife , weary with the week 's work , falling into a peaceful doze . A most pious and harmless community , surely , with its rustic cares and labors , and the little prim town of Philadelphia across the river . But Ann Whitall , as we learn from her journal , was a soul of the old stormy kind ; her spirit lived not so much in New Jersey as in the Jerusalem whose wickedness was denounced by the prophets . Philadelphia was a Babylon , or " bablon " she spelled it ; and her imagination , roused by the eloquence of the Old Testament , found amid her peaceful surroundings wickedness equal , apparently , to the wickedness of old Egypt , or the abominations of Chaldea and Assyria denounced by the prophets . Satan , else declared , was hunting up and downs the banks of the Delaware ; and her mind dwelt on the portents that announced the fall of Jerusalem , ? how the river was turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and armies and horses were seen fighting there ; and evidently , to her , the New Jersey skies were full of similar omens . " The Corn is to husk , and the wed gen to town ? but is it a time to bi and to set ? and to get gain , or is it a time to set and sleap ? 0 that we may be stopt in the lane as Balum won by his ass Ise rid upon , or as Pharoah won in the reed see ? we must go and leve all behind us , and we do n't know how soon ? then farewel corn , farewel wod , farewel ill cotnpanie that has tuck all my time when I spud a bits a reeding , or arighting sum gud matter like Judge Hale , or a wolking alone a midetating suns gud like Isaac of old . " " ' this field wants ploughing , tetherwants sowing ? 0 remember you must go and leve it al befor long . " " 0 our time , our little time , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the Grave always before her own eyes and the eyes of her sons and husband . lint the boys were so " eger after the world , staring about , " she wrote with tears , ? they hi' n't time to think they shall di . " Playing ball , fishing , and skating , ? which was as bad as playing ball , ? these were the especial iniquities of that rural neighborhood ; at the skating pond all the " ruscom " of the earth met together , the more the better . But did Abraham and Isaac and Jacob spend their time so ? Was this the way Judge Hale spent his " his prasious time ? no no , ; slots by himself praying and riling down sum good tnatter . " If skating and fishing seemed so wicked to her on week days , what insist she have felt when , as sometimes happened , these recreations were indulged its on the Sabbath ! Alone and deserted in the farmhouse , she would compare the Quaker villages of Wood-berry Creels and Haddonfield to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from heaven , or recommend that her children should remember Job 's children , " what revellin ' than NVOS with them , but , " as she adds concisely , " soon cut off . " But through these lamentations we are able to get glimpses of the quiet farth life that went on , and in which Ann Whitall evidently took ass important share ; she hardly found time to sit down , much less to write her " Meddatations ; " and the cries of her distressed spirit are put side by side with homely receipts which show the careful housewife , " a tea of Camfrey and water-melon seed , " a medicine of " upland sumach-berries , loaf-sugar , and spirit , " or her belief that whatever was good for poisons was good for scalds and bums . She writes , too , of the farm work , the ploughing and reaping , the droughts , the rainy summers , storms that almost blew down the house , 94 Two Generations of Quakers . the violent winters , ? " snow upon snow , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases are always curiously vivid . " It is the 74th of March , " she notes is the year 1762 ; " if it holds so cold what will become of the pours clam creters , o it sounds in my ears every ( lay , what will thay du for want of hay ; " and again , " O the poore duo creters , it sounds in my ears how they du safer . " And later on she notes with evident pleasure the coining of the tardy spring : " it is got so warm we can plant peas ? the grass du begin to gro and the frogs begin to cri ; " and by the 16th of April they had grass at least " for some of the embus . " We get , too , from these meditations a clear view of Ann Whitall 's husband , a well-to-do farmer , more fond of fishing and sport than going to meeting . He would go off with the boys down the river in the boat ; or when he was not at work or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . However , when one day her husband had an accident , and in cutting a piece of cedar to put a to draw cider , the knife , glancing out of the wood , pierced through three thick jackets into his breast , just below his heart , she rejoiced most sincerely that he was not killed . " 0 what a grat favour he is still Eyeing among his Childern 0 wonderful inded : it is one of the grattest blessings that his childern and I can have this side of the grave to have Idm along with us . Tho we do nt agree so wed as we shad about som matters , I ofen thinks , lie it as it will now , it wod be a hunredfold W OS if I was alone with such a passel of Children . 0 I ofen thinks what wod becom of me if he was tuck away . " For it was this " passel " of children that were the main cause of poor Ann Whitall 's troubles . John was still a child of two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but apt to be ill , and plainly the unlucky one of the family . At one time he bad a bail fever , ? " mourns and groves like an old man , " his mother notes , " cris and ses I ' s sick . " And another time he fell into boiling water , and was terribly scalded . It would not have been so bad , she says , with her love of prescriptions , " if they had put on it Indian meal and cold water , or molasses and salt to get the fire out , or Irish potatoes , or spirit of turpentine , or sweet oil and the white of an egg beaten together , or rattlesnake root boiled in hog 's fat , " ? and no on with a long list of prescriptions . Under which , in the trembling handwriting of an old woman , is a note , dated 1788 , twenty-six years afterwards , in which she remarks that John had always as a child had bad luck , and now had returned home apparently ruined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to the bottom . " But James and Job Whitall , the older boys , though healthy and strong enough , were greater causes of sorrow to their " poor afflicted mother , " as she calls herself . " Now James and Job has tuck up the trade of mining about , " she notes bitterly . They would go skating ; get into companies , prattling and talking ; would not think of death and their latter end ; nothing brought them home but night . " 0 I ofen ses has any poure mortal in the hol world so much trubel as I ; every day wormwood and gol ; some of it I right down for them to see when I am lade in my grave for I du believe it wil coin born to them when they ma' n't think of it ; James and Job wil du what thay plees ; for if I say woo word they will begin to hoof mee , and where is thare mannars to houf their Mother , " and she goes on to complain of what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to bed in times of idleness , or , as it seemed , of domestic trouble . Again we find the same complaint : " The boys nor thare father , has no religion in them but to go to meeting when they plees , and to tel inn I am no better than themselves nor so god , with all my going to meetings , and hod me every day I live . O it is as bitter as wormwood and gel ; I think sumtimes there never was a me. ther so unhappy as I am . " But the boys must have had their causes of complaint . It is not hard to see that Ann Whitall was by no means easy to live with ; all company , except that of pious old Friends , she regarded as bad company , or " pisen , " as she puts it , in her vigorous way ; she not only disapproved of all their sports and pleasures , and wished them to spend their young hours in meetings and meditations on Death , but she plainly made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ideas . The following is significant " O I have often thought of it with a gret del of sorrow , o the harm we du our chador , ' by leting of them go into ill Compani ? won of them said we shun have to answer for it . 0 keep them in while they are young , and master them . " Again and again she recurs to the need of severity and discipline with children ; and one of her favorite quotations which she quotes is from Lamentations :  --  " It is good for a man that he hear the yoke in his youth . " He sitteth alone and keepeth silence , because he bath borne it upon him . " And now and then she copied out of some pious eighteenth-century book she was reading a page or two bearing on the wickedness and ungratefulness of children , ? extracts that , with their correct spelling and affected style , make curious patches amid her own passionate orthography and vivid Scriptural writing . " We do sometimes observe , " one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's love , bestowed without the desired effect ; ' t is mournful to see children pierce with bitterness the breast that has been their support in their infantile years ; to fill that eye with sorrow that has &opt; the tear of maternal fondness ! ' t is a cruel thing for a child to mingle Gall and Wormwood in the cup of a parent descend- ing to the Grave . Let us be assured , " Ann Whited ' collies out with evident satisfaction , " that their own portion of Gall and Wormwood will be doubly creased . " Her daughters , Sarah and Hannah , were , at least while they were little girls , of more comfort to her . When she was nursing her sons , and could not go herself to meeting , she describes them going off to meeting with their father ; Hannah riding on her mother 's mare , and Sarah behind her . Hannah was eight years old . It makes a pretty picture , the two little Quaker girls riding off with their father . They were fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , their mother writes ; adding a characteristic doubt as to whether they would be so good when they grew up . Ann Whitall must have been , however , a more genial person than her meditations , written probably in moments of annoyance , would make us believe . It is a traditions among her descendants that , though she was difficult to live with , all her children were devoted to her . She reproves herself more than once for laughing ; and at the end of her diary , in a burst of frankness , she confesses that she is much too fond of eating . " I find suns freedom to right whot a tarabel thing this eating of to much is , and has been to me many times : I think I can say of a truth it is the wort sin that ever I did . I du believe it is as bad as drinking too much , eating too much is the root of all evil in me . I du believe , 0 had I minded it when I wos young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a driveing of no into sin , o that his chain moot be shortened won link ! " She does not tell us whether the devil 's chain was ever shortened ; but it is a relief to think of this earnest and pious farmer 's wife now and then relaxing , and allowing herself not only to feed on " wormwood and gol , " lest to enjoy a good meal of the shad or wild duck , or sweet corn or watermelons , 96 Two Generations of Quakers . of the bountiful New Jersey fare . For the ideal up to which she tried to live was a terribly high one . " I ofen thinks if I cud be so fixt as never to Laugh nor to smil I shod be won step better ; it fils me with sorrow when I see people so ful of laf and of prate ; our Lord pronounces a Woe against them that laugh now for they shall weep and mourn . The Wicked , says Holy Job , spend their Days in Mirth , and in a moment , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is Madness , and of Mirth , what cloth it . 0 I thinks cud my ies run down with tears always . " She evidently thought it was her duty to " cri day and night ; " and that the time to be given to religion and mourning ? and they seem to have been very much the same thing to her ? should be at least twelve hours is the twenty-four . Almost every human being has some peculiar place and refuge for his thoughts , which he dreams of amid his drudgery ; whither his desires turn , and where his life draws its nourishment and secret strength . One soon sees in this old journal that there was such a place of refuge in Ann Whitall 's life . It was not , however , her home , the farm , and her family of boys and girls ; she always speaks of these as causes of trouble and vexation , and remarks , indeed , in her strong Scriptural language , that she lives " among scorpions . " It was the Quaker meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Friends , its mystic silence , or the prophetical sermons , lamentings , and denunciations . There seem to have been two or three rural meeting houses within riding distance of Red Bank ; and there were evidently frequent week-day meetings as well as Sunday ones . She could ride to those meetings on her mare , but in bail weather she drove in the farm wagon . One stormy day the wagon was refused her . It was Quarterly Meeting at Haddonfield , and she was determined to go ; and riding through the rain " as the voter run down my skin , " she cons- forted herself with the thought of how much more the traveling Friends , Susannah Haddon and Jane Crosby , suffered " a traveling about , and the tears runing down their faces tor our sins . " Another time she was thrown from her horse , ? 3 day of 5 month 1761 . I must right sum of my trubbel , inure cict kicked Op with me , clown I went and hurt sum ; but got apon another mare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother and spook a grate del to us . I coin horn by myself , to mourn and to cry to the Lord . 0 that ever any mortel Eyeing was ever born to no know the treble that I no , no creeter can I have to ride that is fit , but I may cri out my dais , and more and more trubbel every day I live , and nothing but wormwod and gol to drink at . " And when she got home she had found her husband and sons were all away . " O what is more rong in my mind , all ways a gadding abrod when firs clay corns , there father is not at bons won firs clay in a bol year if lie can halp it ; 0 I think if I had a bin kild to-day with the fol off the mare 's back , then I had bin gone from all tears and trubbel . " There were many sudden diseases , she reflects , continuing her " Meddatation ; " it might be her turn next to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she feared her day was not yet conic ; her cup was not yet full of bitters . " I must drink more wormwod and goll , 0 the showers of tears that has fell from my fass this day , and now while I am wrighting . " Her only comfort was to go again to meeting . " 0 if it wont for the comfort that I git sountims at Meeting to here sou of such worthies of the same mind with myself , I cud not a stud til now , I must a smile in sorrow . " For here was her refuge from the " turmile of the World ; " here , with other serious-minded Friends , she could weep over the sins of their little community , " rasel for a blessing , " or listen to denunciations and prophecies in which her stern soul de- lighted , and with which she filled her little diary . " A had laborious meeting . " " Joshua Lord spoke a long while , he did rattle us a going , " she records in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemi out . 0 as Adam Mott said in our meeting , he is always rady to take us off our whack . " Probably those traveling Friends , preaching day after day to little drowsy congregations of New Jersey farmers , had come to attach no very distinct or terrible ideas to their chanted sermons out of the Old Testament prophets . Traditional echoes of older sermons , they were the last waves , beating themselves out on the peaceful shores of the Delaware , of the seventeenth-century storms amid which Quakerism arose . But to Ann Whitall they were terribly real and serious ; she believed literally in the judgments ( or " gugments , " as she spelled them in her curious way ) that , according to the preachers , were overhanging New Jersey ; taking a sombre joy in the sermons , preached out of Ezekiel , which denounced that pious settlement of farmers , ? a community which , she declared , was as full of iniquity as ever was Jerusalem before its fall . And strangely enough , on that little community ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " gugment " did at last come crushing down ; au event which is famous in history , and which left behind it legends of bloodshed and ghosts that are still remembered . " 0 they had polluted my Sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers idols ; wherefore I gave them statutes that were not good and judgments whereby they should not live . " Words like these , written down in this journal , bring with them a faint echo of the old falsetto singsong and prophetical chant of some ancient Quaker preacher , rising amid the silence of the meeting . " Weep and howl for your Miseries that shall come upon you , for you have lived in Pleasure on the Earth and been // wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of Slaughter . " " Thus saith the Lord , a sword a sword is sharpened ; it is also furbished . It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter , it is furbished that it may glitter . " And after listening to some very strong language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of turmile to the consolation and comfort of such a meeting . " And once when a woman Friend " from old England " had coma and had preached , mourning and crying over them , the poor farmer 's wife , with her house and seven children , wished vainly , " 0 had I nuthink to du but to go along with liar . " But Ann Whitall not only loved her meetings ; she thought it a sin not to go . " Whot is honour and glory of him that made as if it ant going to meetings ? " she asks , with conviction ; and in the storms of winter , from which she suffered , ? none so cold as I that has life , " ? she was afraid to go , she confesses ; and yet afraid to stay at home , " for fore of ( ) fending our mity maker ; I have paid clear for staying at home , this some makes a lite matter of it . " And once , when reaping came at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fields because meeting was neglected , and compared the conduct of her husband with that of Boaz ; for Boaz came to the farm from Betldehem , or in other words , as she quaintly remarks , " now want that from meeting ? " while her husband , although twenty years married , and the father of grown-up boys , neglected meeting altogether . But nothing in this mortal state is complete and full of satisfaction ; and Ann Whitall found many causes for tears in her beloved meetings . Indeed , it was too plain to her that the general corruption of the times had penetrated into the meeting houses ; and as Ann Whitall sat and listened to the preachers , she could see before her with her own eyes signs of the wiek'edness and 98 Two Generations of Quakers . abomination of which they preached . " The hor of bablon has brats among you , " one preacher told them ; and Ann Whitall seemed not in the least surprised . Not only were there the vacant seats of Friends who had not come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were who would go to sleep . This sin or " abomanation " of sleeping in meeting caused her great distress of spirit ; again and again she recurs to it : " 0 the concern I wos in to think of so many that can set and sleep Meeting ater Meeting , year titer yore ; " and on one occasion she was " led , " as the Quaker phrase is , to remonstrate , after meeting , with a drowsy widow , who , as we gather , did not receive her admonition in a very friendly spirit . Causes of equal or greater distress were the signs of worldliness and fashion among the New Jersey Friends . Fashions , no doubt , traveled slowly in those days ; the elegancies of the French court may perhaps have crossed the stormy Atlantic in little sailing vessels ; but it must have been slowly , and in very dim echoes , that anything of the kind penetrated among the Quaker community . Ann Whitall , however , was quick to denounce them .

Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entries have been made at different dates . They are brief , but they show that her spirit was not broken by advancing years . In 1777 there is a concise note of the death of a woman preacher , and the remark that the " gugments " of the Lord she had foretold had all by that time come on them . What these " gugments " were we shall soon discover . The next entry is as follows : " 23 of 6 mo 1780 a cler plasent day , a dry time , the gras is drill np in a many planes ? 0 we want rain , but who is worthy of won drop ? we deserve a famin . " In 1783 there is a note of " a most sorowful meeting , no dad and so miserabel . " And the last note of all , in a changed and aged handwriting , is the one of 1788 , already given , about her son John Whitall and his misfortunes . // For a few brief days only our diarist appears on the stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did at last descend , with literal and by no means metaphorical blood and slaughter . But to explain what happened , a reference to the history of the time is necessary . When the war of the Revolution at last broke out , the Americans built a series of forts on the Delaware to protect Philadelphia from the British fleet ; for without the fleet and its supplies it was not possible for the enemy to hold the city . Now it happened that one of these forts , Fort Mercer , was placed on the farm of Red Bank , so near to the Whitall house that Ann Whiten must have seen the work going on ? with what grins reflections we can imagine ? from her windows . When Howe , victorious at Brandywine , marched on Philadelphia , the British made determined efforts to capture , and the Americans equally determined efforts to defend , these river forts . And thus came about the attack on Fort Mercer , in 1777 , or the battle of Red Bask , a gallant and famous little engagement , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 2d Rhode Island Regiment , successfully defended this feeble earth fort against Count Donop with twenty-five hundred Hessians . The engagement was sharp and bloody . The American boats cannonaded the Hessians . Count Donop was mortally wounded , his troops driven back , and three or four hundred killed or wounded were left on the field . During the battle which raged about her house Ann Whitall sat upstairs , spinning . As a Quaker , she of course utterly disapproved of fighting ; during the war with the French she had thought , as her diary shows , the very mention of it wicked ; and her soul was not of a kind that human weapons could very much daunt . So there she sat , calmly spinning , in the midst of the cannon balls ; quite refusing to move , and probably not even lookingout of the window . And it was only , at last , when a shell burst through the wails and partitions behind her back that she reluctantly and leisurely took up her wheel and went down to continue her spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Hessians retreated , she came up to take care of the wounded who filled her house . We are told that she scolded the Hessians for coining to America to butcher people , but also that she was active and vigorous and kindly in nursing them ; and indeed , it was an unrivaled opportunity to gratify her love of herbs and prescriptions . Count Donop died in her house . " It is finishing a noble career early , " he said ; " but I die a victim of my ambition and the avarice of soy sovereign . " The gallant young German noble thus found his grave on this New Jersey farm . The French engineer , De Manduit , in the American service , not understanding Quaker principles , and considering James Whitall and his wife Tories , had cut down their orchard and destroyed their barns . Two of the British . vessels were driven on shore , and there exploded . The only reference in Ann Whitall 's diary to these events is the concise note already quoted , that in 1777 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eals Boll " had come upon them . And it seems that in her stern soul she believed this rage of musketry and cannon , these shells bursting through the house , and men-of-war exploding almost under her windows , were a judgment on them ; troops being sent from Germany and France , and warships brought by Heaven across the ocean , to punish her family and other Friends for sleeping in meeting , and for Sunday skating and fishing . To reinforce the small garrison of Fort Mercer , Lafayette made a night march from Philadelphia ; but after renewed attacks the fort had to be abandoned . Colonel Christopher Green 's gallant defense , however , was always , remembered ; and in 1781 Lafayette , traveling with the Marquis de Chastellux , came out from Philadelphia with De Manduit to visit the remains of the fort . The Marquis de Chastellux has left in his memoirs an account of this visit : how , on their way across the Delaware , De Manduit explained ( as far indeed as that Frenchman understood them ) the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cool reception . The reception was even cooler than he expected . Ann Whitall never even appeared ; while her husband sat motionless and silent by the fire , without even looking at the brilliant young French nobles , who tried in vain all their arts and charms of manner to make him talk . A curious scene We dimly imagine what each party , old New Jersey Quaker and young French courtiers , thought of the other . If only Ann Whitall had been present , and written one of her " Meddatations " on the subject ! It would be hardly fair to take this journal as a representation of the life and religion of the eighteenth-century Quakers . There is a very different spirit in the writings of the Friends ofthat time ; one need only mention John Wool : nun , who was a neighbor of Ann Whitall 's , and who , her journal shows , visited and preached at the meetings she attended . But Ann Whitall drew her religion entirely from the Old Testament ; lived in fear of a jealous God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wickedness and abominations against which she struggled with all the strength of her vigorous spirit . She dreaded death ; drew no comfort from the thoughts of a future life , and her one prayer was for peace , ? " 0 may I have rest when I am lade in the dust . " In those days it was not the custom of the Friends to erect monuments , or even to place stones over their dead . Quaker graves were but little nameless mounds of green about their square meeting houses . And under one of these little mounds , near the meeting house where she wept ancl mourned , and not far from the broad Delaware , lies Ann Whitall , long since gone from the " freting and turmile of the world , " and enjoying at last , we must hope , the rest and peace she so desired . Logan Pearsall Smith . RECOLLECTIONS 0 F A QUAKER BOY . MY earliest recollections are associated with the dress , speech , and manners of a sect that has become almost obsolete but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar or unusual , but as the most familiar objects in my daily life . The broad-brimmed hat , the " shad-bellied " coat with its narrow standing collar , the pale drab sugar-scoop bonnet , the scant sleeved and skirted gown with the white kerchief folded across the bosom , the addressing of every person by the singular pronouns , the naming of the months and days of the week by their numbers , seemed not no strange to my childish eyes and ears as did the dress and speechof the " world 's people . " From my point of view , it was these people , not my own , who bad departed , unwisely if not sinfully , from the ordinary and proper way of life . I was as much surprised as grieved when , in my first schooldays , my stiff-collared , single-breasted jacket and my " thees " and " thous " were derided , and I scoffed at for being a Quaker . I soon fell into the worldly custom of addressing a playmate as " you , " and calling his belongings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to learn the heathenish titles of the days of the week in their proper order . " Tuesday " and " Thurs. // day " sounded so much alike that I was always getting each in its wrong place . I was helped in this difficulty by the fact that on Fifth Day I donned a clean shirtee , " as my wide turn-over collar attached to a gathered front piece was called , and went to meeting with the family , and that this was the world 's people 's Thursday , which they did not so observe except at Thanksgiving . How well I remember Fifth Day meetings , whose silence particularly impressed me by its contrast with the noise and bustle wherewith the world 's people were carrying on their secular affairs ! From the road would come the occasional clatter of a rapidly driven wagon , rattling into and out of hearing , with the incongruously merry whistle of the driver ; from the fields the bawling of teamsters , and from barns the regular beat of flails ; while within reigned such silence that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a summer breeze , or the hissing of the sappy wood and the crackling of the expanding or contracting metal of the stove seemed loud and startling sounds . The silence frequently remained unbroken by any human voice during the entire session , till the elderly Friend who sat at the " head of the meeting , " on the " high seat , " would turn to the Friend who sat next him and shake hands with him ; and the hand-shaking ran along seat after seat , till every one had shaken the hand of the person on each side of him . I used to feel highly honored when some venerable Friend bent his kindly face upon me and gravely shook my little hand , but it did seem a trifle queer when it was my own father who so greeted me . This friendly ceremony was called " breaking the meeting . " It was peculiarly trying to a boy to maintain a decorous demeanor during the long periods of silence . If the spirit of evil did not arouse in him an unaccountable desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcame him with an un controllable drowsiness . When I was thus overcome , my father would set me on my feet , to my extreme mortification ; for I imagined Friends would think the Spirit had moved use to speak , when I had no message to deliver . One quiet summer day , when we were sitting in perfect silence , an old cow that had strayed into the meeting-house yard poised her head in at the open door , and regarded the assembled Friends with a countenance as unmovable as any of theirs . One warm October day , a big boy , who had come across lots to meet-big , and on the way filled the crown of his hat with thorn apples , fell asleep in his seat , near the door . Every man and boy wore his hat in Quaker meeting . A sudden nod tumbled his from Isis head , and all its contents clattered on the floor , whither he followed , and made his exit on all fours , pushing his last before him . The smile that this surprising exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assembly . Our meeting house was a great square unpainted building , with shingled sides , and of two stories , the upper one consisting of a wide gallery reached by a narrow flight of stairs . Beneath these was a closet , which was awful to my youthful imagination ; for in it were kept the tools for digging graves , and the rope for lowering the coffins into them .. The large lower room was divided midway by a partition : on one side sat the women ; on the other , the men . It was provided with shutters , which were closed during the session of meetings for business , to shut one sex apart from the other while each transacted the business especially belonging to it . The body of the house was furnished with plain , unpainted seats , so hard that it is a wonder how the drowsiest Friend could ever fall asleep sitting on them . Facing these , at one end , were three long , elevated seats , one rising above the other , with rails in front , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the 102 Two Generations of Quakers . seats of the ministers and elderly Friends . It was a very common habit of the preachers to slide their hands from side to side along these rails , as if keeping time to the slow and measured cadence of their sermons . In the open space between the high seats and the others stood a huge box stove , one in each apartment , that in winter made the atmosphere torrid in its immediate neighborhood , while it but slightly raised the temperature of the remote parts of the room . The elderly women had little foot stoves , tin boxes in wooden frames , with sheet-iron fire pans , which they filled with coals at the stove before taking their seats . The grounds around the meeting house were surrounded by a board fence , as shorn of all adornment as the house itself , except by nature 's contributions of grass and daisies , and one little maple tree that grew near the gate , and clothed itself in autumn with gay colors , in utter disregard of Quakerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set with no purpose of ornamentation , but for use at funerals . Its bitter aroma is always associated in my mind with those solemn occasions . There was an entire absence of display at funerals . The coffin was of unpainted wood ad without handles , and was placed in the grave without any outer box . There were no services at the grave , nor a word spoken but by the manager of the funeral , who , in behalf of the family of the deceased , briefly thanked those present for their attendance . This was not done till the grave was filled , wherein one and another in turn assisted . Even to the bounds of the mysterious world beyond the grave the Friends bore testimony against worldly ostentation . Many of the graves were entirely unmarked . Some had at head and feet small gray stones , as rough as when taken from the ledge or field . A few bore the initials , fewer the full name , with the age and date of death , in rude characters carved by loving but unskilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fifth Days . Each month two of these midweek meetings were followed by sessions for the transaction of business , that were termed Preparative and Monthly Meetings . After the religious service some Friend arose and asked , " Is it not about time to close the shutters ? " when this act was accomplished with some little stir , shutting the men and women apart as in separate rooms . I never knew what was done in the women 's room , but suppose the business transacted was substantially the same as in ours , where the clerk read the " minutes " of the last meeting , and then a list of nine " queries . " The one which I remember most distinctly was , " Are Friends clear of sleeping in meeting and other unbecoming behavior ? " Each time I was overwhelmed with the consciousness of guilt , and did not dare to look up and encounter the many eyes that I knew must be fixed upon me . The usual answer to each query , by the head of a duly appointed committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Persons " intending marriage " were required to make public declaration of such intention in the meeting . The man , accompanied by an attendant , entered the women 's meeting , and made formal declaration of his intended marriage ; and the woman did the same , in like manner , in the men 's meeting . A committee was then appointed to visit the parties , and learn if each was clear of other engagements ; and if the report was favorable , the marriage was in due time solemnized in the presence of the meeting . After the usual religious exercises , the couple arose , joined hands , and repeated the few solemn words prescribed by the Discipline , when such of those present as desired set their names to the certificate of marriage . The ceremony ended with a wedding dinner at the home of the bride 's parents . " Declaration of intentions " was a trying ordeal , as may be easily imagined . // " Who came in with Timothy when he declared his intentions ? " was asked of a Quakeress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell thee , " she answered . " 1 only know that he had a patch on one of his boots . " " Do any keep company with persons not of our Society , on account of marriage ? " was another query . For sixty years ago whoever married out of the Society was " disowned , " ? a serious penalty , especially to a " birthright member , " as one born of Quaker parents was Another serious breach of discipline was to attend marriages accomplished by a justice or a priest . So , also , was the performance of military duty , or the payment of fines for the non-performance of such duty . If a member became incapable of self-support , he or she did not become a town pauper , but was supported by the meeting , and was treated with as much respect as the wealthiest of the Friends . Twice a year Quarterly Meetings were held at our meeting house , and each occupied three days . Friends came from the precincts of other Quarterly Meetings , and of ten from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long distances . Ministering Friends from distant parts , men and women who " had a concern " to visit Friends , were frequently present . What with the religious " opportunity , " the generous but unostentatious hospitality , and the social intercourse of old and young , Quarterly Meetings were the great events of our year . I remember how unwontedly full the meeting house used to be on these occasions . It seemed to me there could not have been more present before the deplorable " Separation , " which I so often heard spoken of . The division of the Society , on Actrinal , points , into Orthodox and Hicksites occurred some years before my remembrance ; but a good deal of the bitterness which always attends religious quarrels still remained , and there was no /TH. gious unity between the two sects , though some members of each felt a warm personal regard for some of the other . The old meeting house remained in possession of the Dicksites , but their thinned ranks only meagrely filled its wide seats , and the useless gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loose flooring of boards . At Quarterly Meetings the seats were almost crowded , and it seemed strange that the place could be so still with so many living people in it . No sounds were heard but the dismal moaning of the wind in that mysterious upper room , the hissing of the sappy wood , the hollow murmur of draught , and occasionally the sigh of sense burdened spirit or the cautious clearing of a clogged throat . Then , rising without a rustle of garments , some venerable preacher , moved to bear testimony , would break the solemn silence with as solemn speech . The sermons were delivered with a peculiar intonation , a kind of monotonous tune , not always unpleasing in its effect . Sometimes they seemed interminable to children 's sleepy ears and aching bones ; but they were sure to end at last , and then came the welcome signal of hand-shaking , and pre-smithy the bustle of departure to homes and warns firesides and bounteous tables and visiting . I am afraid that I was not religiously inclined , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " for what was said and done at meeting is not so strongly pressed upon my memory as the home events incidental to Quarterly Meeting . How distinctly through the mists of near threescore years I see the circle of worthies gathered around the Franklin stove , all arrayed in their best sober-hued attire ; the mess eating apples , if doing anything , the women almost always knitting , and all busily chatting . No one was addressed as Mrs. , Miss , or Mr. , but by the first or full name , or as Friend Soand-So , whether man or woman . From another room came the subdued sound of the young people 's decorous merriment , in which I was too young to be permitted to take part , but was assigned to the humblest place in the circle of the elders , a footstool or little chair by my father 's knee . Much of the conversation was of so grave a nature that it did not interest me ; but it never failed to do so when it drifted into reminiscences of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pioneers in the northern wilderness , and stories of the wild beasts that had not then long been rare . Even now I feel the pain of the bitter disappointment I suffered when , as the most thrilling point of some story was approached and the name of an actor was mentioned , some worthy woman Friend would interrupt with the incongruous inquiry , " Now thee speaks of Ichabod Frost , John Holmes , I want to ask thee if his wife was n't Zebulon Thorne 's daughter ? " Then they would go off on the genealogical trail of the Frosts and Themes , till the subject in which I was so deeply interested was lost sight of ; and remembering the oft-repeated maxim that children were to be seen , not heard , I never dared to lead them back to it . For two or three days the houses of resident Friends were filled wall visiting Friends , who in turn were filled with the best that each house afforded , and then , with kindly farewells , departed , to resume the ordinary affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded the bustle of Quarterly Meeting was attended by a depressing feeling of loneliness . If the elders of the family shared it , they were too rigidly disciplined in restraint of all manifestations of emotions to give any outward sign of it . It was rare indeed to see a Friend moved to tears , or excessive mirth , or any violent expression of singer . The sweet yet strong faces of the women , especially , wore an habitual expression of serenity , as if victory had beengained over all enemies of the soul , and that peace entered upon which passeth all understanding . How befitting was their dress ! What could be more becoming to the placid face than the plain muslin cap , without ribbon or ruffle , or the spotless muslin kerchief folded across the coins , untroubled breast 1 I remember the clearstarching of these articles as a sort of half-religious rite , performed , in a room withdrawn from the public gaze , by my mother and my aunt , walking slowly to and fro as they clapped the precious muslin between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such mild and guarded gossip as Quakers might partake of . I am unable to know how much early associations may influence my opinion that there could be no more becoming dress for a middle-aged or elderly woman than the simple , unchanging garb of the Quakers . Yet I am forced to admit that the bonnet , precious as it was to its owner , was a very ugly article of headgear . In shape it closely resembled a sugar scoop , except that it had a bulging crown , folded lengthwise in broad plaits . The covering was of finest light drab silk , or sometitnes black silk , and lined with white silk , and of course entirely without any sort of adornment . Indeed , it is impossible to imagine how such a headdress could be adorned but by the calm , sweet face to which it could add no charm . I remember a few cold-weather bonnets of beaver , with high square crowns and broad soft brims , that were quite as unattractive to the eye , but must have given the wearers much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men was not so unbecoming , especially when it had a round crown , like the modern derby ; but it was very stiff , and as uncompromising its form as its securer . My heart warms at sight of the ugliest article of the apparel , now almost obsolete , though once so familiar to my youthful eyes , and the old speech comes as readily // to my tongue as if it had never learned another . In Fifth Month was held the Yearly Meeting , of which we youngsters heard much , but saw nothing ; for it was convened in far-off New York . It was a solemnly momentous event in our lives , and not a small one in theirs , when our parents and some of the neighboring Friends set forth on their journey to the distant city , by stage , canal boat , and steamboat , or sometimes by their own conveyance , in which case they spent the nights in the homes of their hospitable brethren who lived on the route . By the speediest means , it took nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims were intrusted with many messages , commissions , and letters ; for the postage on a letter to New York was twenty-five cents , a sum then better worth saving than can now be imagined . It used to be said that the Quakers always brought rain to New York , but what else they did I have little idea , except to issue an epistle to the Monthly Meeting and one to other Yearly Meetings , which in due time were readbefore the Quarterly and Monthly Meetings . There are yet Yearly , Quarterly , and Monthly Meetings , and meetings for worship , but the good people who attend them are not like those with whom my earliest recollections are so fondly associated . Except by a few of the oldest members , the peculiar distinctive dress is no longer worn nor the " plain language " spoken . In the meetings one sees fashionably dressed congregations , and hears singing and organs , but no testimony against " steeple houses " and a " hireling priesthood , " and but little is said of the great guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers Quakerism as it was sixty years ago , its forms are not recognizable nor befitting its name , and its peculiar spirit seems to have departed . As for our old meeting house , like most others of its kind and time , nothing remains to mark its site but the rough stones that were the steps of its two front doors , and the last member of its worthy congregation sleeps in his adjacent quiet bed beneath the unshorn grass and daisies .
