 |p1294  AT this time , when heresy is in the air in both the Catholic and Protestant churches , it may be well to consider the clergyman 's attitude to the Church when he can no longer candidly preach all its doctrines . The easiest opinion is that to be honest he must quit the ministry . But his obligation is not fixt by any such simple principle . It is his duty , and should be his right , to preach the truth , and he should not have to leave the Church to do so . A Church is under as much obligation to have its doctrines true as he is to teach them ; and when they are thought untrue , its clergy should have the task of correcting them ; and that they may not be true all must sometimes suspect . They were formulated in times of great ignorance , when they got little attention from scholars , and many of them need revision . Modern thinkers can not force their opinions into the forms anciently fixt . The whole Christian world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonest to try to harmonize them with our present views . Untrue on their face , they can be accepted only by wresting language from its proper meaning . One 's chief duty is to preach the truth , not the doctrines of the Church ? to be correct , not merely regular . The clergy have the double duty of keeping themselves to the truth and keeping the Church to it . For the clergy must keep the Church right . No other class is chargeable with this work ; and if the clergy may not think and dispute on doubtful questions , the Church can never become better than now . We can not say that the Church is always right , and that the clergy need only learn its doctrines to preach the truth . There is no evidence of this ; but much evidence that it has often erred and often changed . As we are getting much light on all subjects , the Church as well as the scientists should have this . The Church should not be sensitive about heresy in its clergy when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own adherents ; for every denomination is heretical to all other denominations , so that the majority is evidently in error . Only a few Christians are thought by the majority to be orthodox . And since heresy is thus ascribed to the Church in general , each body should have patience with its clergy . They are guilty only of that of which it is itself guilty . The Church should not emphasize doubtful doctrines , and so , make it hard to enter its fold . It may not limit membership to those who believe a body of divinity , when its mission is to be universal . It should have the door wide open , not block it by improbable teachings . If one has no right to deny a doctrine he has no right to accept it . He should ask whether it is true , and he can not learn this if he may not consider whether it is false . If one may accept but not reject he is in no condition to find the truth . The doctrines of the Church are all matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainties , least of all the distinctive beliefs of any denomination ; and there should always be liberty where matters are so doubtful . The people are trying to settle their doctrines , learning what is true and what not . In mathematics and some sciences , there may be unanimity , but not where inadequate proof exists . The clergyman 's attitude should be one of inquiry . No theological dogmas are verified except to illogical reasoning , and man should not he constrained to reason illogically . He should give clue weight to every probability , and only due weight . There ought to be no place in the Church for prejudice . As its duty is to teach what is true and right it should not force anything arbitrary to be taken as such . Proceeding only on evidence , if it can establish little with certainty , little should be believed . What are enforced are matters which have never been proven ; and  |p1295  clergymen , like others , should have liberty to think on these ; and , if they find them false , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as proclaim it , and correct its opinions when found wrong as well as enforce what it believes . It should always be ready to listen and do better than it has yet done , never being as rigid as if its doctrines were sure . Did they rest on adequate proofs there would be no need of unusual pressure to get them believed . The force of reason would itself suffice to propagate them . When men are very anxious to have certain teachings believed , and take violent measures to suppress difference of opinion on them , they are presumably false . The creeds were made in ancient times when men were ignorant and could not adequately consider the subjects on which they formulated the doctrines . ' They are all , moreover , compromises . Those who made them differed in opinion , and to get uniform action had to waive their individual views . They could declare only that on which all agreed , and so on what was satisfactory to none . All wanted something else than what they got , as they always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They agree on what they decide to ignore . If they exprest what they believed they would have to make many creeds instead of one . A single creed for differing people is shorn of nearly all meaning , as in political platforms . The creeds , too , changed much in history . They were not thought as important in early times as now . Nearly every Church convention adopted one which was changed by the next convention ; and nothing was more common than to modify creeds . In some of the earliest Church histories many creeds are given . Those who made then did not intend them to be permanent . Men occupied a changing attitude toward Christian truth . The same creed was rarely reaffirmed by a subsequent convention or council . The very early Church had no creed , the members not caring what one another believed . When they began to form creeds they hewn to make blunders , which they subsequently tried to-correct . The creeds which we now have all went thru many forms before becoming permanent . Various attempts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its present form . The Apostles ' Creed past thru many changes , and it is not even now accepted in the same words by all Christians . It did not get the form generally used till the sixth century . The ancient creeds were not meant for accurate expressions of Christian truth . Like our political platforms , they were intended to express generally the opinion of the convention which adopted them . As no Republican or Democrat must accept the whole platform to be a faithful member of his party , so the ancient Christians had not to accept the whole creed to be faithful Christians . The creed exprest merely a passing phase of thought , and that but approximately . It indicated about where the Christians stood ; and , as they might change , they could change their creed without inconsistency . They might abandon it altogether and still be good Christians . A perfect creed has never been exprest . Only in modern times has the wording become rigid and petrified , so as not to be further changed . It is irrational to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to find a creed for present uses . The farther back they go the more erroneous creeds are , as the subsequent changes in them indicate . And when the early Christians did accept creeds they did not accept them entire . They rejected some of their declarations , thinking it enough if they believed the bulk of them . Where a dozen articles are given no man who thinks can believe them all ; and it should be ' enough to believe most of them . People are sufficiently harmonious who can accept ten out of twelve points of faith . Greater unanimity can not be had among intelligent people . If men 's present faith were examined a still smaller proportion would be found accepted . So , if a clergyman denies one , or a few , of the teachings of his Church he should not be condemned . He preaches substantial Christianity when he preaches the bulk of the doctrines . No one believes all , if he thinks about it . In the secular world men get along well enough together who have not such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises are conducted by those who differ much , and  |p1296  it should be so in religion . People should not be whipt into accepting every one of many opinions . To make them do so is to establish thoughtlessness among them ; and to make them say so is to promote dishonesty . There may be a creedless Church . The Baptist is such , as was the Apostolic Church . The Jewish is such . There is no creed or standard which all must accept . And yet they get along as well as others . If men are not questioned on their views , their heresy is not known , and generally not developed . Heretical clergymen may preach for years and not disclose their heresy ; and they might disclose it without its having any serious effect . It is unwise to call attention to unorthodox preaching . If men are sensitive about it they will get more heresy than by ignoring it . We should accustom ourselves to hearing dissenting views with indifference . We know that they exist , and their expression ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and live harmoniously with men who have them . Unanimity is nowhere essential , and the Church should habituate itself to as much diversity as others have . The Church 's faith , moreover , is the faith of the members , not of creeds . It is what they believe , not what they adopt . Few believe much of anything taught as dogma . The majority do not think of the intricate questions of theology . There is no more faith than what actually passes in men 's minds . Where many articles are formulated they are ignored . People do not know what they are , much less believe them . They are not the faith of the Church . Faith can not be made by voting on expressions , much less the faith of those who do not participate in the vote . They are generally made by perhaps a dozen men , and the rest of the Church know nothing or little about them . They are at most the opinion of those dozen . What Christians actually believe differs from what is officially exprest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believes as most Christians do . It ought not to be necessary to believe also the formulas which a few of them consider . Orthodoxy is now measured by standards which are adopted but not believed . In no other department is such emphasis put upon official utterances . Since it is the duty of every one , according to the teachings of the Church , to be identified with the Church , he ought to be candid in the Church , and not to have to go out of it to be conscientious . The authorities should give one the privilege of adjusting himself to the truth without declaring him heretical . If it is the duty of all to enter the Church , it is the duty of the Church to keep right . Some would make it a duty to join the Church , and then make it impossible to get in or to stay in . A truthful Church is possible only where much latitude is allowed for changes ; and when one tries to get nearer the truth he should not be assailed because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , is one of the Church , and if he is heretical then the Church is heretical to that extent . If many share his opinion , then the Church is heretical to the extent of that number . If he accepts only a few of its teachings , then , to that extent , those few only are the teachings of the Church ; and if many thus accept only a few of the teachings , then the Church doctrines are to that extent limited to those few . And since the majority reject many of its teachings , the majority is heretical , and it is only the minority that would call them to account ; and the minority would then dictate to the majority . As we have said , none would believe all the doctrines of the Church if they thought about them , and probably none do believe them all ; so that in strict parlance the whole membership is heretical , and no class of heretics should single out another class to persecute for heresy . Furthermore , - every clergyman has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it that error should not keep him out . He loses no rights when he changes opinion . If he thinks the Church is wrong and should be set right , he can not think he is wrong in holding that opinion . The wrong should be conceded to be in the Church , not in the one who has the truth . He ought not to have to get out of the Church because he is right . He should have a right to try to put the error out .
