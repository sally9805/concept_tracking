Dodd , Mead &; Co , have in press Mr. Luther S. Livingston 's new volume of ' American Book-Prices Current , ' for 1900 , the sixth in a series of which the back volumes are already difficult to procure . E. P Dutton &; Co , will soon issue ' The Adventures of Odysseus , ' retold in English by F. S. Marvin , R. J. C. Mayor , and F. M. Stawoll , and fully illustrated by Charles Robinson . Also , the ' Essays ' of Francis Bacon , uniform with their recent handsome edition of Marcus Aurelius . Further announcements from Macmillan Co. are ' Memories of the Tennyson , ' by Canon Rawnsley ; and ' Cameos , ' by Cyril Davenport , in the Portfolio monograph series . Almost ready is Houghton , Miffiin &; Co. ' s illustrated edition of the late James T. Fields 's ' Yesterdays with Authors . ' Portraits will be combined with facsimiles of letters not before published Marlier , Callanan &; Co , Boston , will bring out during the present month ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christ , ' by the Rev. Charles F. Aiken , S T D. The second part of the ' List of Private Libraries ' compiled by Mr. G. Hedeler of Leipzig , soon to be ready , will take account of more than six hundred important collections of the United Kingdom . It will also include a supplement to Part I ( United States and Canada ) . Mr. Hedeler is still desirous to insure completeness by volunteer reports to him of the size and special character of private libraries in the domain indicated above We receive from Charles Delagrave , No , 15 rue Soufflot , Paris , a specimen of his latest dictionary enterprise , viz , ' Nouveau Dictionnaire des Sciences et de leurs Applications , ' edited by the late Paul Poird , Edmond Perrier , and Alexandre Jeannie , with a large collaboration of specialists It is appearing in fortnightly parts at a franc each , and is in octavo form , set in double columns , condensed but legible . It is very copiously illustrated . Baths having a medicinal value are entered alphabetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineralogy , technology , anatomy , surgery , physics , rural economy , industrial mechanics , etc. , etc . Four years ago we had an opportunity to pronounce a favorable judgment an Prof. J. P. Gordy 's ' History of Political Parties in the United States , ' . or at least upon the first of three contemplated volumes The remainder do not appear to have reached . us subsequently . Meanwhile the work , from being published in Ohio , has been taken over by Henry Holt &; Co. , of this city , and we again have the first volume , but this time one of four , for there is so much extension in addition to a thorough revision We shall say no more for the present , therefore , except that the opening sentences ( no- mean criterion often ) are of -a nature to xvvhet the appetite for what is to come . Enlargement from three to four volumes - has- also been the portion of President Charles Kendall Adams 's ' Representative British Orations ' ( Putnams ) , a work which originally appeared in 1884 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Alden . One-third of it is occupied by Daniel O'Connell in defence of Magee , with the characteristic peroration to the jury : " If you be slaves and hypocrites , he ( Magee will await your verdict , and despise it . " Palmerston on the case of Den Pacifico requires nearly as much space , and what is left is divided between Robert Lowe , Chamberlain , and Lord Roseliery . Mr Alden 's brief introductions are scarcely firm or independent delineations of character , but as they are not indispensable in the case of so eminent personages , they answer well enough . The first instalment of Lockhart 's ' Walter Scott ' in the admirable " Library of English Classics , " edited modestly but effectively by A. W. Pollard ( Macmillan ) , consisted of two volumes . Three more now bring it to a conclusion . We note again that the abridged edition of 1848 has been sifted for additions and alterations never made in the text as bore printed from the ten-volume edition of 1839 . There is an index of fifty-seven pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are likely to be with as for some time , and their outward appearance may be described once for all . They are tastefully bound in grass-green cloth with embossed pattern , and one remarks how the stamp on the side cover boldly makes a ligature of the double a in " Classics " in order that eight letters may line under the seven of " Century . " The form of the printed page is rather narrow for a duodecimo , in the interest of a broad margin , and on this proportion opinions will differ . In the typography Mr De Vinne has his way in a black and legible letter , and all eyes may be thankful for that . There is delicate rubrication on the title-page , and each volume has its frontispiece portrait of the author . Each has also its editor ? Mr. Aldrich for Herrick 's Poems ; Henry James for Goldsmith 's ' Vicar of Wakefield ' , Professor Waodberry for Bacon 's Essays , Sir Walter Besant for Defoe 's ' Journal of the Plague Year ' , Mr. Bryce for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bunyan 's ' Pilgrim 's Progress . ' Mr. Aldrich , of all these , has taken his task most seriously , judged by space ; the introductions , as a whole , are both brief and meant for nothing more than manners . It is safe to predict a large demand for these handsome reprints . Mr. Henry James 's ' Little Tour in France ' ( Houghton , Mifain &; Co ) makes a fresh start after sixteen years with the illustrations which it had been planned should accompany the first edition . Not the same illustrations , however , these are from Mr. Joseph Pennell 's pencil . The result is a better realization of the superior guide-book originally intended , and a pleasant preparation for the tourist in the fairly wide territory traversed by Mr. James and touched off in short chapters . Mr. Pennell 's drawings are numerous , in his well-known style , and the printed pages very attractive to the eye . A more recent impressionist abroad , Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin , presents anew ( through the same publishers ) her two vi-.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Penelope 's Progress , ' with upwards of 100 illustrations , all told , by Charles E. Brock In marked contrast to Mr Pennell 's series , these are either decorative or in depiction of manners and customs , scenery is quite neglected . In both cases we have the right treatment in the right place , in very pretty books . The author of ' Elizabeth and her German Garden ' seems to play with her incognito in the photogravure illustrations from nature which lend a real distinction to the latest issue of this ponular work and of ' The Solitary Summer ' ( Macmillan ) . We have her surroundings frankly disclosed , but the inmate of house and grounds still eludes us The get-up is altogether attractive , for gift or ownership . The attention of the civilized world has been suddenly diverted from South Africa to China , and ' The Rise and Fall of Krugerism , ' by John Scoble and 11 R. Abercrombie ( Frederick A. Stokes Co ) , will now have but one reader for a hundred that it would , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even , that faithful one will lose heart before he has made much progress . The authors are entirely without judgment of perspective , and appear to suppose that the outside world can spare time to master the details of the petty bicker-logs of the inhabitants of South Africa Their style is tedious and commonplace , and their race prejudice so overpowering as to make it impossible to trust their statements The book is dedicated to Chamberlain , Milner , and Rhodes , " the triumvirate in whose hands is placed the future of the British Empire in South Africa . " Its animus is shown by the demand that the members of the Boer Government shall be punished if they have not " assumed the responsibilities towards private property imposed by modern warfare , " while as regards the operations of the English forces , satisfaction is expressed that , " notwithstanding the yelping of the Africander press , when captures of live-stock or wagons have been made , no prayer for restitution has been listened to by the military authorities as in the past . " Possibly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact from this mass ; but his task will be difficult It were an easy guess , for those familiar with his previous writings , to name the author of ' The Brass Bottle ' ( D. Appleton &; Co. ) , after the perusal of a few chapters , for Mr Anstey has reopened the vein from which he drew the material for plot , humor , and ludicrous situations in his earlier successes , ' Vice-Versa ' and ' The Tinted Venus . ' In this instance , it is a jinn , bottled in the time of Solomon , who endeavors in an Arabian Nights way to reward his liberator , a young and struggling London architect , but instead , of course , manages to muddle thoroughly the young man 's love affairs till once more sealed up in his original abiding-place . There are casual traces of humor in this tale , but as a whole the fun seems forced and hardly up to Mr. Anstey 's standard . To bring home to the careless or erring golfer the rules and etiquette of the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mr. H. L Fitz Patrick 's aim in ' Golf Don'ts ' , ( Doubleday , Page &; Co . ) . He has beenL at pains to compile a long list of injunctions against what would seem to be all possible golf sins of , omission and commission , and , at the same time , to emphasize them with a little mild and humor- ous sarcasm . A book 4 inches by 3 by 1 is truly a little room in which to store even the finite riches of a bilingual dictionary . Such are the dimensions of the ' English-Spanish and Spanish-English Dictionary ' compiled by G. F. Barwick and published by Eyre aria Spottiswoode , London Compared with the abridged and presumably " pocket " Velazquez , it contains an appreciable percentage more of-words , rather more judiciously , selected , in a little more than half the cubic space . Score one more for Oxford paper ! In addition to mere vocabulary , this tiny friend for pocket or travelling-bag has lists of Spanish irregular verbs and proper names , tables of weights and measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of Spanish proverbs  --  all legibly and tastefully printed . The whole is a little marvel of book-making and convenience . Another volume has appeared of Dr Rodkinson 's translation of the Babylonian Talmud ( New York . New Talmud Publishing Company ) It embraces the first eight chapters of Baba Qamma , the first tractate in the Seder called Nexiqin , leaving the last two chapters to appear with Baba Metsia , the second tractate Lake the rest of this Seder , Baba Qamrna is of the highest interest for the student of comparative jurisprudence , and presents problems of relationship and development which are still far from being worked out It is curious that while Indian law and the legal systems of other still more primitive peoples have been studied and analyzed by profeisional students of the history of law , the Jewish codes and the codes of Islam have met with little attention . Yet the harvest for a widely and thoroughly trained investigator would undoubtedly be rich , and the field has the great advantage that results in it can be tolerably tested Thus , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mosaic legislation through accretion from the Roman codes , through the necessities of the Jewish communities in exile which were practically ruled by their own Princes of the Captivity , and through that strange abhorrence of a vacuum which belongs to the Semitic mind , expressing itself in endless distinctions and hypothetical cases Yet , though the foundation may be Biblical , the guiding conception for the investigator must be that the plan of the structure itself is dominated from Rome . Similarly , the codes of Islam have met with scant attention ; the few Arabists who have considered them could rarely boast of any legal training And these codes , too , stand as daughters to Roman law , both directly and through the Talmud Dr Rodkinson 's work may therefore be commended not only to students of things Jewish , but also to students of comparative law The Neapolitan scholar , Benedetto Croce , well known for his researches upon the Spanish influence in Italy , as well as for his contributions to critical theory , has performed a pious task in reprinting Baumgarten 's ' Meditations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900 ) , which has never been republished since its first appearance in 1735 . Baumgarten was a pioneer in the field of aesthetic theory , and the , term cesthetics , first employed in this book , gave the science its name , his large treatise , ' . /Esthetica , ' still awaits a modern editor In this connection , attention may be called to Croce 's latest contribution to the same field ; his ' Tess Foudamentali di un ' Estetica ' ( Naples , 1900 ) is a fragment of a prospective history of aesthetics with special reference to Italy This work is another illustration of the modern tendency to seek the assistance of analytical psychology in the explanation of aesthetic phenomena , and may accordingly , be compared with such a work as Santayana 's ' Sense of Beauty . ' J Baumann of Regensburg contributed an article some time ago to the Frankfurter Zeituny on " Postage Stamps , their Beginning and their End , " in which he predicts that stamps , as now used all the world over , will soon be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their use . He recalls the fact that the postage stamp was conceived in the mind of James Chalmers of Dundee in 1834 , and that on May 6 , 1840 , the first stamps were issued to the English public . To-day about 25,000,000,000 stamps are issued annually , and the time of about 800,000 persons is consumed in making and cancelling them . Herr Baumann thinks that most of this time is wasted , he draws a picture of the inconveniences to which the public is put by the present arrangement , and then unfolds a plan which he conceived two years ago , and which , he says , is now under favorable consideration by the British postal authorities . The main feature of this plan is that the present letter-boxes are to be converted into a kind of penny-in-the-slot machines , which will refuse to admit a letter unless the proper amount of coin for the postage has been dropped into the slot . By this arrangement , he thinks , every letter-box would practically represent an automatic post-office , and the postal departments of civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saving of 89,000,000 or more a year . For business firms that mail a large number of letters , he would have a kind of stamp made ( similar to the present cancelling stamps ) , capable of making only a certain number of impressions , and purchasable at the post-office Two of Germany 's leading men of letters , Paul Heyse and Julius Rodenberg , were recently brought before a Berlin court on the charge of maliciously misrepresenting the character of Franz von Dingelstedt . Roden-berg had printed in his periodical , the Randscham , an article by Heyse , in which Dingelstedt was referred to as having been " frivolous " and " cynical , " and as having gone so far in his eager desire to be taken for a dandy as well as a poet ; that he made hie barber address him as " Herr Baran " His wife was credited with " Bohemian " tendencies , and Heyse related that one day , after she had delighted a number of guests by her singing , she faced about and put out her tongue at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libellous , but the court did not sustain them , and the two men of letters were acquitted . The Annual Report of the State Geologist of New Jersey for 1899 is accompanied by a Report on Forests , copiously illustrated , both by views and maps in the text , and by a series of admirable large-scale sheets , showing in color the forested areas of the entire-State . It is encouraging to learn that , " taking the State as a whole , there is nearly as much forest to-day as there was in 1860 , " while " the deciduous timber . . . has generally increased in size and improved in qualify since the period of the topographic survey , from 1880 to 1886 . " There has been a marked reforestation since 1850 , owing to the displacement of charcoal in the use of forges and furnaces , and this means the saving of the cutting of six square miles annually for the iron industry alone . More than a hundred sawmill sites have been abandoned altogether or devoted to manufacturing purposes . The section on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is shown that the rainfall at New York from 1836 to 1868 was steadily increasing , when it suddenly fell off and remained below the average till 1883 , since which date it has been fluctuating The same is true of Newark , yet deforestation was actively going on in northern New Jersey during the period of increase , and reforestation had set in before the period of drought As forests retard the melting of snow , they may induce later and cooler springs Archeology of the Thompson River Region , British Columbia , by Harlan L Smith , forms the concluding part of the second volume of ' Memoirs of the American Museum of Natural History . ' It contains an account of researches among the burial-places and n+ CTIonne , e T , r10-a , Van-dr-171S and in Nicola Valley , and includes descriptions , with illustrations , of the various stone implements , tools , and weapons found with the skeletal remains The conclusions drawn from these investigations are that the ancient culture of the whole of the southern interior of British Columbia was uniform , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This culture shows affinities to that of the interior of Oregon and of California , and its affiliations are with the tribes of the plains rather than with those of the North Pacific Coast Nevertheless , the presence of shells and the bones of the whale , from which utensils and implements were made , show that there were importations from the coast , while some of the carvings indicate a familiarity with the art of the Coast Indians The examination of the skeletons of the prehistoric people does not suggest that any change of physical type has taken place There is a fundamental difference between the types of the coast and those of the interior , the former being characterized by broad faces and large heads , while the latter have narrow faces and small heads The Fine Arts Division of next year 's Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo promises to be a noticeable feature of that exceptional enterprise . Its exhibition will be held in the Albright Art Gallery , a permanent marble fire-proof building , within the grounds , and well isolated All classes will consist of original work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salon " from the loans which are sought Information as to plan , insurance , transportation , etc. , may be had by addressing the very competent and experienced Director , Mr , This gives Mr. Barrie the needed opportumty for killing Tommy , republishing the obituary notices of him , and telling us what his own intentions were in giving the world this true account of his life . " You may wonder , " he says , " that I had the heart to write it " Sometimes the biographer " pretended to himself " that he did it in order that we might all laugh " at the stripping of a rogue , " but that was never his true reason " Have I been too cunning , or have you seen through me all the time ?

After all , we see through a glass , darkly " A Little Gossip , " by Rebecca Harding Davis , contains reminiscences of a Virginian 's glimpse at New England in the Transcendental period She hits off Emerson , Hawthorne , Alcott , Dr. Holmes , and one or two others very neatly , and accounts for the Transcendental movement , objectively , by insisting that New England . . ? and underfed persons , who had outgrown Puritanism , and needed some substitute for religion to take its place This leaves unexplained , however , why , subjectively , Transcendentalism was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emerson 's characterizing Thoreau as an " animal in human form " He had " the eye of a bird , the scent of a dog , " etc .

Everett T. Tomlinson has , in the Atlantic , an article on " Reading for Boys and Girls , " in which he calls attention to " the disappearance of the distinction between books for boys and those for girls " In a list of sixty-eight " favorite books " of a girl of twelve , made recently by a librarian , twenty-seven were books written specially for boys , only eight were books for girls , and all the rest were books adanted to either class .

The mere fact that a trained Englishman has been able , in the last forty years , not merely to reform completely a branch of the Chinese service , but to create one where none existed before , and make it a main reliance of the Chinese Government , is a striking proof - that the Gilman:an is at bottom an or-. &nary; human being , governed by the same motives and desires and manageable by the same means . What we read of China makes us hopeful even of ultimate pure government in Pennsylvania . William Garrott Brown 's paper , " A . Defence of iAmencan Parties , " is based on an idea , now very common , that the Republicans are the heirs of ' the Federalists and are the party of action ; while the Democrats are still Jeffersonian at heart and the party of ideas . Even Bryarosm , so far as it " reflects character , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past " This is certainly not the accepted view of Bryan-ism among " Jeffersonian Democrats . " The whole matter is very , much obscured nowadays by the confusion which exists between the party considered as a nominating " machine , " and the party as a body of men held together by a common political object and faith . This confusion ' did not exist in the days of the Federalists and Jefferson Such political contingencies as we have to face were not thought of , much less discussed , by Hamilton , Madison , or Jay . Mr. Bradford Torrey has a good article on Edward Fitz-Gerald It will console many an honest man who fails to be able to like and dislike according to established canons , to find that FitzGerald , certainly a man of most comprehensive intellectual sympathies , confessed that Goethe was a sealed book to him , never cared for-Hawthorne , and found ' Gil Blas ' uninteresting . ? In the Century , among the illustrated articles , is one on " Our Schools for the Stage , " by Bronson Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such schools , the National Dramatic Conservatory ti , a St , ehope-Wheatcroft Dramatic School , and the American Academy of the Dramatic Arts . With what Mr. Howard says of the dramatic art , and the necessity of teaching it , and its connection with and relation to nature , no one can quarrel , but we must warn the reader against the idea , which he seems to encourage , that this country is already established as the headquarters of the dramatic art . He speaks with considerable contempt of the Conservatoire , but there is pretty good acting at the Francais , and Bernhardt and Coquelin compare favorably even with the graduates of the American Academy of the Dramatic Arts . Bishop Potter 's article on " The Problem of the Philippines " seems to be an answer to his own question , " What will the Philippines do to us ? " They seem to have converted him into an Imperialist , and also to have quite upset his moral ideas . Some hold us responsible for the war in the Philippines because we began it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it entirely to " the blunder of the naval commander " ' who , after destroying the Spanish fleet in the harbor of Manila , failed to sail away . This is a new burden on the shoulders of poor Admiral Dewey , who was at least supposed to have obeyed orders , and A opens up a wide field- for speculation . It seems that , " through " this blunder , we are fixed with a responsibility for what takes place in the Philippines for all time . We can assure the good Bishop that this is not the view of the Administration Our responsibility for the Philippines rests solely on the Treaty of Paris , by which we bought them from Spain , and will terminate as soon as we have made another treaty selling them to somebody else . No ' writer on international law or publicist ; from hoods about alcohol ; but the " trend " of the hour is evidently the other way . ? ' The Venetian Republic , ' by W. Carew Hazlitt ( Macmillan ) , is notypiniply reprint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's third attempt to write a history of Venice In 1858 he published a sketch cin two volumes which , while it showed signs , of promise , had been prepared too hurriedly and was filled with mistakes . Dissatisfied with the quality of this early effort , Mr. Hazlitt , after two more years of study , issued four volumes upon the same subject . The second book proved to be much better than the first , and though somewhat uncritical , contained the fruit of wide reading . Like its predecessor , it was attacked on the score of inaccuracy , and it certainly bore the marks of inexperience . For instance , it did not distinguish with sufficient clearness between the value of one chronicle and that of another . Now , after forty years , a period during which he has produced a good many other books , Mr. Hazlitt returns to the Venetian Republic and presents a final edition in two volumes . " The text has profited by the result of mature experience so far as to be to a considerable extent rewritten " Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present edition is the first complete one of the work , for it not only profits by the gradual and large , accumulation of valuable particulars relative to Venetian history and institutions , but brings down the career of the republic to the abrupt close in 1797 . " Quite apart from the continuation of the narrative to 1797 and the improvement of special features in the work of 1860 , Mr. Hazlitt finds good reason for reshaping his history in the vast volume of material relating to Venice which has been made accessible since the expulsion of the Austrians in 1866 To give two examples only : the ' Storia Documentata ' of Romanin , and Rawdon Brown 's ' Calendars of Venetian State Papers , ' have placed new and grave responsibilities upon the historian of Venice Assuming that it was within his power , Mr Hazlitt should have rewritten his book completely But this may seem like an ungracious remark , for , even as it stands , the present edition marks a long advance beyond the point reached in 1860 It contains an immense amount of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ardent lover of Venice has been able to devote to her during nearly half a century . We may add that it is printed in very handsome style . ? In reply to the recent clamors of victory on both sides of the Atlantic , M Paul Lacombe utters a vehement protest against all warfare , which he entitles ' La Guerre et l'Homme ' ( Paris : Georges Bellais ) . He takes especial delight in stirring up his ' readers with paradox , in playing at ninepins with the most prescriptively respectable opinions concerning the ennobling effects of war and the courage of men therein , and in flouting the cheap self-deception of nations passionately eager to justify their iniquitous victories . The whole volume is a commentary , humorous but stinging , on Jingoism that hands the sword to others , as well as an arraignment of leaders , whether civil or military , who involve-nations in the alternative calamities of triumph or defeat Viewed in this light , war - can not obtain sanction from morality or religion ; the holiness of a cause is treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is superfluous , because abundantly familiar . On the philosophical side , most eof his arguments were long since definitively formulated by Mill The merit of , his book consists , therefore , in the interesting originality of its tactics , and in the supporting of every position with ' facts of recent occurrence Of this method the reader may judge in the chapter on military courage , which M. Lacombe 's discussion reduces to an almost non-existent , negligible quantity . The chapter entitled " Les Martyrs " should be hailed with enthusiasm in Cuba , the Philippines . and the late South African Republic
