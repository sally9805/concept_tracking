txt The appointment of the lieutenant and personal representative of RICHARD CROFTER as receiver of the Brooklyn Wharf and Warehouse Company by Justice FITZGERALD was an act for which it is not easy to imagine any justification , and which is open to explanation by motives that , if allowed to influence judicial discretion , must shake the confidence of the public in the courts . The company whose affairs were brought before the Court is a very important one , with outstanding bonds and stock to the am lunt of nearly $30,000,000 . Its annual receipts have been stated at over $2,000,000 . The reorganization or adjustment of its business is a matter plainly iequiring ability of the first order , practical experit:nce , and familiarity with affairs on a large scale . The agent selected by the Court for this peculiar and difficult trust should obviously possess , in addition to these qualifications , a reputation for integrity and a standard of personal conduct of the highest character . Nothing less would satisfy the claims of the parties in interest under the law , and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of the obligations of his office and determined to discharge them without favor or fear . We do rict think that JOHN F. CARROLL meets these requirements . We do not believe that Justice FITZGERALD could convince a jury of competent lawyers and business men that CARROLL meets these requirements . We doubt if a dozen of CARROLL 'S political intimates could be found to say , if they told the truth , that the appointment was , in their opinion , made because CARROLL was thought by the Justice to meet these requirements . We have no means of knowing the motives of the Justice , and we have no desire to impugn them . But if he were called on to demonstrate to the satisfaction of intelligent men , aware of the facts , that the appointment of CARROLL was not a piece of gross political favoritism , in the interest solely of Tammany Hall and its chief , to the imperiling of large interests and the terrible discredit of the court in which the act was committed , we are utterly ignorant of how he would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
