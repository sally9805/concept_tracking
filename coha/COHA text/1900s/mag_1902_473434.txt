WHEN I first knew him he was merely one among fourteen others of his kind , and as the fourteen lay arranged in two concentric rings about Lopho* in the centre , it was not easy to see wherein one differed from any other . They were each a beautiful and regular ovoid in shape , about an inch in diameter , and fully a fourth greater in length ; and the color of them was a rich creamy white , smooth and shitting , u.og , sometimes decidedly huffy , profusely covered with spots and blotches , some well rounded and of various sizes , some irregular in outline , and all of different shades of dark chestnut-brown , olivaceous drab , or golden russet . But to any one who sees things as they really are it was apparent that Lopho , or what was to be Lopho , possessed some slight advantages over the others . He was a little larger , and a little less sharply pointed , which last gave him more elbow-room , and permitted him to turn about , and stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , as he grew larger and felt more and more the restraints of the close confinement of his Lophortyx californicua is the scientific name of the California quail . narrow house . And his slightly greater size , with its accompanying greater weight , was another point in his favor ; for in the hollow hemisphere in which the fifteen had their home , was he not the one of the whole fifteen who was most sure to find his way to the centre , where he would be surrounded on all sides by his fourteen brothers and sisters , where no chilling winds nor smothering fogs would reach him , and where be could always keep snug and warm ? True , his mother , once every day , turned him over , for to lie too long on one side is not good for any one , and moved him to the outer ring ; but , unruly child that he then was , he never stayed where his mother placed him , but straightway crowded himself back into the centre of the nest again , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did sometimes stay away longer than usual when she went for something to eat , or when the little spring dried up and she had to go far across the fields to get a cool drink from San Franeisquito Creek , as it flows among the alders down by the cottage called Cedro . Then those in the outer row sometimes got chilled a little , and the blood flowed slowly in their veins . And once , when it seemed to them their mother was gone a long , long time , two of those in the outside row ? two that were not very big nor very strong anyway ? felt such chill as they had never felt before ; their blood coursed slowly through their veins , their hearts became weak , the light grew dim and yet more dim , and they wondered what it all meant . Then a numbness came over them , and a sleep came over them , from which they never awoke to see the light . And all the while Lopho lay snug and warm in the centre of the hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had lain in this manner some eighteen days , and was now full of strength and impatience , and a desire to see more of the world . During the last few days a little sharp bony point had been growing upon the top of his nose near the end , and he was very much ashamed of it ; for a sharp horn on his own nose made him feel like other people who have carbuncles on theirs ; so one day ? I think it was the twentieth ? he determined not to have it ; he would rub or break it off , if he could . But the only thing that he could find upon which to strike it was his own house , the shell that surrounded him so snugly on all sides , and which , he now noticed for the first time , seemed to press upon and confine him within too narrow limits . So he began striking and pushing and rubbing against this shell with that ugly thing upon his nose with all his might , determined that it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , nor how firmly fastened to his nose it was , and he felt discouraged very much . " I shall never be able to break it off , " he cried in despair . And then he felt more smothered than ever . He could n't stand it another minute ; he must have more room ; besides , the horn on his nose seemed bigger and uglier than ever . So he drew back his head as far as he could ? and precious little it was ? and struck and pressed with all the strength of determined and final effort , when , lo ! the walls of the house began to give way ! He had broken the wall down in one place , and pushed it as far from him as he could ; and to those who saw from the outside there were three triangular little pieces of shell pushed up into a nice little pyramid , and those who listened heard asoft , satisfied chirping inside . And Lopho felt that something strange and unusual had happened . Just what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something of great importance . He now felt stronger than he had ever felt before , and so he pushed his little nasal horn harder and harder against the wall . But he soon found that he had pushed the wall so far away that he could barely reach it now . He tried again and again , but nothing could he do ; then he turned a little in his bed and discovered that he could now reach the wall very easily ; so he began pushing with all his might , and another little pyramid was raised upon the shell . Now lie saw how it was done , so he kept turning more and more in his bed , pressing the ugly nasal horn against the wall from time to time , raising a row of little three-sided pyramids entirely around the shell . Then as he stopped to rest a moment he felt the sweet air coming in through the rents he had made , and he filled his lungs with it ? a thing he had never clone before ? and it intoxicated him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt before . So he straightened himself out just to show how big and fine he was , when , lo1 the whole top of the house fell off , and he rolled out , into the bottom of the hollow hemisphere , the most astonished creature you ever saw ! Ile lay there for a moment , then got up , pulled the " crick " out of his back , shook the kinks out of his legs and wings , and after critically examining himself for a moment , felt that he was now really somebody worth while , and was starting off to see the world , when his mother called him In come back and wait a few minutes for the other children , when they would all go together . He sat quietly under the edge of his mother 's wing , looking wonderingly out upon the strange new world . Very soon other little fellows very much like himself began to peep out from under his mother 's wings and breast , and when she got up and stood beside the nest , she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mothers ever looked upon . But Lopho , her first-born , was the largest and strongest of them all . Then , with their mother leading , they all started off to see the world , and at the same time get something to eat , for they were ravenously hungry . So their mother showed them the world , and picked up delicate morsels for them to eat . Lopho asked his mother , and father ( who had now joined them ) , many questions about the world , and what to eat and what not . He learned that he must not go near or look into the cold gray eyes of Soma , the gopher-snake , and that he must keep away from old Felis , the cat . He must hide and keep very still when Strix , the barn-owl , comes about at night-time , nor must he be friendly with Accipiter. him of the sharp shin , who ranges the fields and searches the groves . And thus passed the long dry summer and fall , when they had to go away over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink ; and then the winter , which was no winter at all ? only a time when the rains come again and the wild oats spring up on the hillsides , with the peonies and rnalvas , and the poppies and weeds in the fields . And the spring came , and this year the rains ceased earlier than usual , and the foothills and fields became dry and parched long before their time . The outlook was so unpromising that many of the birds never paired at all , and few if any nests were found , except near the creeks or in the few other favored places . Lopho took his mother 's advice and remained with her and his father all summer . Some of his brothers and sisters , not heeding the counsels ? f their elders , sought mates , built hollow hemispheres in the fields for homes , and hatched broods of young ; but the little ones , not being able to go so far as ' Cisquito Creek or to " the lake , " soon perished from thirst . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another year , gaining in strength and wisdom every day . He was of unusual size , standing full one-half inch higher than any other of his kind ; and as for strength and beauty , there was none to compare with him . The brown of his breast was especially rich , the verrnic-illations on his sides were unusual in their artistic delicacy , and the nodding plume upon his head ? there was no other quail in all Santa Clara County that had a plume one-half so rich and fine . When the second spring came and Lopho was nearly two years old , the drought still continued . The winter 's rainfall had again been light , and no rain had fallen since the first of April . Lopho wandered far and wide in search of water , and though he found none that promised to withstand the long dry summer , he made a discovery which filled him with feelings he had never felt before . One day , as he wandered along the bed of an " arroyo seco " in a little canyon in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his sweet mother than any other he had ever seen , only she was younger , her feathers were smoother and fresher-looking , her plume was larger , and as to her eyes , they were the largest and brightest he had ever seen . So when he returned to his mother that evening he took Ortyx with him , and she , wise old mother that she was , knew well what it all meant . She simply said : " Lopho clear , I see how it is . Ortyx is evidently a very superior girl , strong , healthy , wise , and with a : beauty which , your father says , recalls that which l possessed in my younger days . I approve your choice , and may the spirits bless you . But do not make a home on this parched hill-side . Find living water somewhere where there are not already too many birds , and there make your home . " And Lopho lost no time in his search for living water . Day after day he travelled far and wide without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he went farther toward the bay than he had ever gone before , end closer to the large cream-colored buildings where there are so many pretty girls and so many noisy boys , who yell , " Rah , rah , rah ; rah , rah , rah ; rah , rah , Stanford ! " than he ever dared go before , when he came to a pretty grove with many kinds of trees and shrubs and flowers , and in the centre of which is " Xazmin House . " There was a big Blue Dane dog , named Ulf , chained under the great live-oak near the barn , and lying on a mat on the front piazza was a sleepy gray cat , called Cap . So Lopho looked about the place , and found many long pipes running about shallow in the ground , and at several places the pipes stood up straight for a foot or more above the ground , and there was a hole in the side of each , and , " Eureka ! " from these water was gently dripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a nice pool of good pure water stood on the ground beneath . With joy and hope in his heart , he hastened back to the hillside , and brought Ortyx to see what he had found . Together they returned to the grove of trees of many kinds . They wandered about it for several days , examining every part with care . They watched the water most closely , and found that it kept running all the time , and that linnets and goldfinches and the curious sickle-billed thrasher , as well as other birds , came to it regularly every day . They examined the hedge-rows and the bushes and grasses along the south fence for suitable nesting-places . Nor did they fail to inspect the fields near by for wild oats and the various kinds of weeds whose seeds are good for quail . And they learned many things , not only with their own eyes , but by talking with old Crooked-bill , the thrasher ; Modesty Itself , the brown towhee ; and El Carpintero , the woodpecker . They learned that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jasmine , in which lives a wise man who loves the trees and shrubs and flowers , and birds and monkeys and bees , as well as the fishes in the streams and sea , and who tries to see things as they really are . And so he had planted around Xazmin House many kinds of flowers and vines and shrubs and trees , many of them queer and curious and from foreign lands ; and the huge old live-oaks he had spared , and where did quail or other bird ever find safer retreat than among their thick , matted branches ? For more than a week Lopho and Ortyx wandered about , taking note in their way of many things . They observed that ITlf , the Blue Dane , though sometimes permitted to go unchained , was a big , kind-hearted fellow , who seldom made any noise , and never bothered any of the birds in the least . And Cap , the cat , though roaming freely among the bushes and trees , never seemed to notice the birds except in a kindly way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were always careful not to let him become too familiar . John , who watered the flowers , was kind to all the birds , so they bad no fear of him . By-and-by Lopho found a nice seeluded grassy place down by the fence next to the field which pleased Ortyx very much , and no sooner said than done , they began pulling up bits of dry grass , 011 I of which they fashioned a beautiful hollow hemisphere . They placed it under the spreading and protecting branches of a weed where it was not easily seen . The making of the home was a matter of only a few days , and what happy days they were as they together gathered the blades and fashioned them into the symmetrical nest ! And a few days later ho who cared to look could see that hollow hemisphere filled almost to the edge with curiously mottled eggs , such as we saw on the hill-side two years ago . There were a baker 's dozen of them , and as regular and handsome as any mother bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them some twenty days later to see how they were coming on , I saw nothing but a great pile of more or less irregular and broken little hollow hemispheres piled in and about the one of grass . Among the vines not far away was heard a mild scolding and now and then a contented clucking , and if you cared to wait until they came out into the open , you would have seen stately Lopho and modest Ortyx proudly leading thirteen as pretty little fluffy grayish-brown balls of energy as you will see in many a day . And how proud Lopho and Ortyx were of their promising family . Lopho dearly loved to Lake them on little exploring expeditions about . the place , and to impart to them the wisdom and knowledge of the world which he had learned from his mother or gained through his own experience . With the wise and motherly help of Ortyx he taught them the kinds of seeds they might eat . He led them about through ail parts of the grove of trees of many kinds , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fields near by . He showed them the spigot which the master of Xazmin allowed to leak , and taught them to drink the refreshing water from the little pool beneath it . Three times a day , or oftener when the sun was unusually hot and the air was unusually still , he led them to this pool ; first they came early in the morning , then again about two o'clock in the afternoon , and for the last time in the evening near the going down of the sun . Following the afternoon visit they were wont to go to an open place where the ground was clean and powdery and soft , and there they would play in the dust for many minutes . The old birds were the first to begin the sport . Lying upon one side , Lopho would scratch the loose dirt vigorously with his feet , then with a rapid motion of his wings and a rotary motion of the body he would throw the fine dust all over himself , and deepen the hole in which he lay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old birds looking on admiringly ; and a pretty sight it was . And when they bad done , and had wandered away in quest of food or adventure , if you cared to examine the dusting-place , you would have seen two larger hollow hemispheres and thirteen small ones , as if made by two mammoth and thirteen smaller raindrops in the finely powdered dust . As the sun began to pass beyond the hills to the westward and the air began to grow chill , they would make their last visit to the pool beneath the spigot . Having slaked their thirst , they would for a little time scratch in the dust or feed upon the seeds of the weeds near by ; and then , when the sun had wholly disappeared , Lopho and Ortyx , with a call which the little ones understood , would fly up into the live - oak , the thirteen young following like so many animated balls of dust shot into the air . Then the old birds would call : " Are all here ? Are all here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command : " Hide yourselves ! Hide yourselves ! " which they at once proceeded to do by crawling in among the matted branches where the leaves were the thickest and they would not be seen . But the days were not always days of happiness without anxiety , fear , and sorrow . For Accipiter , ho with the sharp shin , who lives among the oaks in the canyon beyond the stock-farm , and who is a bloodthirsty freebooter who ranges far and wide , was wont to make occasional visits to Xazmin . So Lopho and Ortyx tried to be always on their guard , for they greatly dreaded the visits of the cruel Accipiter ; and when they saw him coming from afar , or noiselesslyand phantomlike from among the trees , they scurried under cover with their greatest speed , uttering the startled cry which they had taught the little- ones meant " greatest danger , " and then calling : " Run right here I Run right here ! " They had all been taught never to fly into the matted branches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on the fly " is Aceipiter 's strong hold ; but one day when they were out in the dusty road Accipiter suddenly emerged from the grove , and was over them before even the watchful eye of Lopho saw him . There was no copse near by which they could reach , and they did not know which way to run . Now was Accipiter 's chance , for which he had manoeuvred , watched , and waited for many a day . Like a flash he dashed among them on the ground , readily seized one little brown body in his sharp talons , and as the others in direst desperation rose to fly to the matted limbs of the live-oak , he caught another in his equally sharp bill . Thus heavily handicapped he did not fly far , but alighted upon the top of the big water-tank upon which the Rah , rah boys had painted " ' 03 . " There was enacted the old game of " addition , division , and silence , " after which Accipiter flew with the remaining little bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now and then in the twilight of the evening or in the early dawn of morning old Strix , the barn-owl , who has his home away among the pepper-trees in the Arboretum , did not fail to visit Xazmin , hoping he might find Lopho napping and off his guard . Though he came on noiseless wing and as stealthily as old Cap himself , Lopho was never taken by surprise , and Strix had to depend on gophers , grasshoppers , and sparmophiles for his food . As it happened , it was at about this time that old Soma , he of the evil eye , crawled from his burrow under the rocks not far away , and came at night to the grove of trees of many kinds . Examining the ground with care , he found the little cup-shaped depressions in the dust , which were now only thirteen in number , and all nearly as large as the largest . This was just the place for which he had long been seeking ; so he carefully coiled his long cold body in the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement of a muscle or the batting of an eye , during the long forenoon and until the middle of the afternoon . Then he saw the eleven fine young quail going slowly from under the almond and acacia trees to the pool beneath the spigot . A little later Lopho and Ortyx were seen to follow . Then Callie , one of the brightest and bravest of the eleven , without waiting for the others , started toward the dusting-ground . Just as she lay down in one of the hollow hemispheres , with her head toward the currant-bush , she saw the two cruel eyes of Some peering into her own , and with a fierceness and power she had never before seen or felt . Not for the shortest moment were the evil eyes taken from her own ; not for the briefest instant did they lose their terrible fierceness or the power they gained in that first cold stare . If there had been any possibility of her escaping from this terrible power , it entirely vanished when Soma thrust out his tongue and she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the control over her by him of the evil eye was complete . Limp and without the power to move a muscle or to take her eyes from the cold gray ones , she lay awaiting her fate . Just as Soma felt that his conquest was complete and that . the time had come for him to strike and seize his helpless victim , Lopho , the brave , came to the dusting-ground . Seeing Callie lying helpless upon the ground , he instantly knew the cause . A glance under the currant-bush , and he saw the long cold coiled body of Soma . his deadly enemy . Quick as a flash , and with a fierceness and power such as none of his kind had ever before shown , he dashed upon the terrible foe , not thinking of the great danger to himself , but determined to save his child , whatever the hazard might be . He well knew that once he could get the cold evil eyes of the snake to cease staring into the eyes of the helpless bird , the charm would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he flew into the face of the cruel hypnotist , striking him with his bill and scratching at the evil eyes with his claws . The suddenness and vigor of the attack dazed the snake for the moment , and he tried to shield his head by thrusting it beneath the coils of his own body . Recovering his presence of mind almost instantly , he struck at Lopho with a viciousness that only snakes are capable of , but the heavy feathers of the bird 's breast afforded full protection . The next blow Lopho parried with his wing . Then he dashed again upon the snake 's head from behind , and with bill and claw and smart blows with his wings he proved more than a match for the gopher-snake , who now , filled with fear and a desire to save himself , retreated to the protection of the tangled copse near by . Lopho followed him to the edge , striking him in a frenzy of fierceness again and again . In the mean time , when the cold evil eyes no longer looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recover self-control and hasten away from the place of such terrible influences . When Lopho found her she had joined Ortyx and the others of the family among the matted branches of the great live-oak in which El Carpintero , the woodpecker , has his home . After a time , Lopho and his flock , losing the fear and memory of the terrible combat , resumed their usual strolls about the grove . And at present if you should go to Xazmin House and sit under the big live-oak , you would see that the master still lets the water drip from the spigot , that to the pool beneath come birds of many kinds , and that the bravest and most stately of them all is Lopho , the Plumed Knight of Xazmin.
