txt Joseph Ramsey , Jr. , President of the Wabash Railroad , gave out a statement to the security holders of that road yesterday , denying that he was ever Mr. Gould 's man and asserting that he is guilty of no ingratitude in attempting to retain his place as President of the road against the wishes of George J. Gould . At a meeting of the Directors of the Wa. - bash Railroad held yesterday a resolution was passed granting Mr. Ramsey an indefinite extension of his leave of absence . Mr. Ramsey attended the meeting and formally protested against what was in effect an effort on the part of the board to remove him as President . In his statement which , It is expected , will be distributed to the security holders to-day , Mr. Ramsey gives at length the record of his services with the Wabash and with other roads , and replies to many reports which he says have been circulated concerning him . In his address to the debenture and stock holders , Mr. Ramsey says in part : " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to make It a personal one , but as the ' personal ' element has been forced in by statements made , if not by Mr. Gould , by members of his kitchen cabinet and those working to get proxies for him , I am forced to reply to them . " It is now due my own reputation , my friends and those whom I have asked to honor me with their proxies , that I should answer , and answer openly , the stories which are being told on the street by Messrs . Butler , Terry , and other , Gould adherents , and they , and not I , are responsible for this letter . " The stories being circulated are of several varieties . One of the serious ones , judging from a Wail Street clipping , is that of ' ingratitude to Mr. Gould , who made him ( Ramsey ) known to the railroad world . ' Satan reproving sin ' is not in it with Wall Street preaching gratitude to Gould . ' " I might admit that I owe Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny that a man who is filling a responsible position as a ' Trustee ' and President of a corporation should permit personal ' gratitude ' to warp his judgment or blind him to the right. , of all the owners of the property . Gould Did n't Make Me . " Rut ? did Mr. Gould make me known to the railway world ? I think not . I had been railroading twenty-five years before I met Mr. Gould , and had some little standing in that world at that time . In 1001 I was elected President of the Wabash , of course with Mr. Gould 's support and because he thought I had earned ' ite No great cause for ' gratitude ' there . " The same item says : ' Mr. Ramsey , as an employe of Mr. Gould , has no right to take the position he has . If be did not like Mr. Gould 's policy , it was open to him to resign . ' I was not in any sense ' an employe of Mr. Gould . ' I was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also interested in the company , and it was my duty to oppose If I did not approve . But I did resign , and resigned twice , on account of not liking Mr. Gould 's ' policy , ' or , rather , the policy and methods of some of his advisers , and If my resignation had been dealt with In a proper manner the present conditions would have been avoided . " For eight years I seemed to have Mr. Gould 's full support and friendship , and I showed my ' gratitude ' by working night and day to carry out our plans . To use Mr. Gould 's own words before the board as late as May 28 , 10 ( 15 . ' Mr. Ramsey has done the work of three men for the Wabash , ' &c.; " Now , as to making my fortune . which , according to one story , I owe to Mr. Gould . While my fortune is a modest one , and I thank Providence that I am able to take care of my family and live the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not make Mr. Gould a part of that Providence . It is true that I was ' In several syndicates with Mr. Gould ; so were a large number of others . Of all these syndicates , four in number , I made up three , originated them , and secured most of the underwriting , of course , as Gould projects . The fourth I went into at Mr. Gould 's request . Of the four , two  --  the Pittsburg-Toledo Syndicate and the Western Maryland Syndicate  --  were closed up and distribution was made or to be made under plans of the New York coterie and ' securities ' only distributed . The other two , which I managed clear to the end , were closed , or are in process of being closed , in cash , with a nice profit ever interest charges , without the slightest aid or assistance from Mr. Gould and his advisers . Syndicate Profits . " The story- is told by Mr. Gould 's adherents that Mr. Gould carried $1,000,000 underwriting for Mr. Ramsey in the Pittsburg-Toledo syndicate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fortune . When the syndicate was made up I signed ' $1,000,000 J. Ramsey , Jr. , and Associates . ' Mr. Gould asked me a few days later who was going in with me . I said I would get some of my Western and Pittsburg friends in ; I wanted all I could carry . He very kindly said , ' I will take care of it all for you and charge interest . ' I was glad to have him do this . About one year later Mr. Gould asked me if I would be willing to let him have $500,000 of my underwriting for Mr. Hyde . as he wanted Mr. Hyde interested . I said if he wanted it for Mr. Hyde , all right , but if it was on account of his being tired of carrying it so long , I would make other arrangements . He said it was for Mr. Hyde , and he could not get it any place else . This left $500 , - 000 in my name . When's-the distribution was made Mr. Gould reported that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to surrender the other $375,000 , ) and he had sold my bonds without authority ( to a sub-syndicate for buying up the bonds ) at an average of SO , when they were about 04 on the Street , and had practically compounded his 5 per cent . interest on the loan . I closed up my investment with Mr. Gould at about 13,000 less than cost . This is the only ' financial deal ' I ever . had with Mr. Gould , so ' my fortune , ' for which I should be ' grateful to Mr. Gould , ' is small . " - Out of the two syndicates I handled and closed up Mr. Gould will get in interest and profit about 5650,000 more than he paid in . I think Mr. Gould owes me a little ' gratitude . ' " As the properties of these two syndicates referred to were not sold to any Wabash interest , none of the money came from any company in which Mr. Gould or I were interested . " The Pittsburg Terminal . In regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he has been held responsible , he asserts that much of the excess over the original estimates was due to the subsequent determination to make the road high class and modern in every respect . He adds that no word of objection to the cost was ever spoken by Mr. Gould . Part of the excessive cost , however , Mr. Ramsey declares . was directly due to dilatoriness and delays , for which he was not responsible . In regard to the differences between Mr. Gould 's policies and his own Mr. Ramsey says : " They are exactly the same as are now agitating the whole corporation world and being so thoroughly investigated today in the great insurance companies , namely : Are corporations private institutions . to be controlled as private property by a large or controlling mterest , or are they corporate properties , to be managed and controlled in the interest of all the stockholders ' : I will state the whole proposition in a nutshell and use Mr. Gould 's words in doing so : " ' Ramsey , ca n't I spend my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my reply , ' Yes , Mr. Gould , you can spend your money and manage your property as you please , but this is the money and property of a corporation . in which millions of other people 's money is invested , and as its legal head I must know something about and be consulted with before such large contracts are made by outsiders . ' " This conversation with Mr. Gould , Mr. Ramsey says , occurred at a conference between them which followed a letter of resignation as President of the WabashPittsburg Terminal Railway sent by Mr. Ramsey to Mr. Gould . This letter was dated March 23 , 1905 , and was the second resignation of Mr. Ramsey , the first having been sent last January . Mr. Ramsey gave as his chief reason for resigning that Mr. Gould . by his action , had practically discredited Mr. Ramsey as President of the company . Referring to Mr. Gould 's treatment of this letter , Mr. Ramsey says : Ca n't I Spend My Money ? " When Mr. Gould received this letter , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Ca n't I spend my money ? ' &c.; He then went on to say , ' Mr. Harriman does not permit one of his Presidents to buy a car wheel . ' I replied : ' Many good railroad men do not entirely approve of Mr. Harriman 's system , but he is at least methodical in his ways . He has a Director of Purchases , an official of the company , and every official knows who is to attend to the purchases , but your way is absolutely demoralizing ; one day you ; next day Mr. Jeffrey , then Mr. Nicoll . and maybe I am meddling with things at the same time . ' He admitted . ' It probably is . ' The conversation took on a more pleasant tone , and at his request the matter was laid over for farther conference . " Dealing with e th Wheeling and Lake Erie financing , Mr. Ramsey tells what he considers advantages of his plan of issuing 4 per cent . bonds of the Wheeling and Lake Erie with 52.000.000 of Wabash notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aiatxxsono , which was adopted . Referring to his Efforts in regard to the bond plan Mr. Ramsey says : " I finally delivered to Mr. Gould a firm bid by a responsible house for from ten to fifteen million Wheeling and Lake Erie bonds on a basis of 41a , per cent . The board ratified the bond sale instead of the note proposition . Mr. Gould was in favor of the bond issue provided it could be done . and before the board he was quite complimentary to Mr. Ramsey , ' stating that ' the carrying through of the bond proposition was entirely due to Mr. Rainzeja and that by so doing Mr. Ramsey had saved the company four or five hundred thousand dollars . ' The aggregate saving could have exceeded SS00.000 on the full proposed issue of 515,000,000 as between the note and bone propositions . " As I have stated . Mr. Gould was very complimentary at this board meeting of April 12 , and yet . one week later , on April 19 , a meeting of the Pittsburg Terminal Hoard was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be necessary to a quorum , and immediately after the meeting I received a telegram from Mr. Gould saying that the board , in accordance with my urgent request , had accepted my resignation . " There have been many intimations that the bond sale fell through on account of misrepresentations made by Mr. Ramsey . This is absolutely untrue . Of my own knowledge I know that the purchasers withdrew their bid as soon as it became publicly known that I was out of the Wheeling and Lake Erie and Pittsburg properties , they claiming that the dissensions and my leaving would greatly discredit the securities and interfere with their sale . After this negotiations were opened again and the bonds offered them at about two and a half points lower , and these negotiations also fell through for reasons which need not be stated here . " Indefinite Leave for Ramsey . Mr. Ramsey and Mr. Gould , who is Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Wabash , met yesterday at a special meeting of the Board of Directors of the road at the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , as far as is known , that the two men have come together since Mr. Ramsey 's appeal to the security holders of the Wabash for their proxies to be used at the annual meeting on Oct. 10 , at which Mr. Ramsey will contest the control of the road with the Goulds . The meeting yesterday was called for the express purpose of declaring , in effect . that Mr. Ramsey was no longer President of the road , but Mr. Ramsey attended the meeting to protest in person against any such action . The Executive Committee , it was learned yesterday . had met on Thursday last and passed a resolution granting to President Ramsey an indefinite extension of his leave of absence . The meeting of the Directors held yesterday was a special meeting of the board , called to ratify this action of the Executive Committee . Mr. Ramsey was present , with seven other Directors . When the matter of his leave of absence was brought up he protested formally against the action of the Executive Committee and the proposed action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his protest . the board confirmed the action of the committee . It was learned after the meeting that its proceedings were calm throughout . In effect , however , the hoard was voting him out of office against his formal protest . From statements made yesterday by friends of Mr. Ramsey . it appears that he protested on the ground that he was elected President by the stockholders and could not summarily be suspended by a ' vote of the Directors . A leave of absence was granted Mr. Ramsey early last Summer . It was expected to end on Oct. 1 . Mr. Ramsey came back from , Europe three weeks ago And returned to the Wabash offices , maintaining his right to the Presidency of the road , although . in fact . very little was submitted for his consideration . By voting yesterday to continue his leave of absence the board . as far as its vote was effective to that end , suspended Mr. Ramsey from office from Oct. 1 to the time of the annual meeting a week hence . ERIE 'S $12,000,000 ISSUE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erie Railroad 's purchase of the Cincinnati , Hamilton and Dayton Rails-cal ' , it was announced yesterday , will be financed . by the issue of 612.000,000 of the company 's convertible bonds , exchangeable into common stock at 60 .
