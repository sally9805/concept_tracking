 | WE Americans are a practical people , surely . We are a progressive people , liberal , broadminded , rebellious against tradition and the downward drag of old cutoms . Yet there are wide areas of life where we might as well be Hindus for all the advance we make . We have developed a breed of trotting horses which are the admiration of the world , we have bred the trophy tomato and the navel orange , and here is Mr. Burbank ranging easily ahead in playing tricks on nature , with his " plumcot and white blackberries , his stoneless prune and pitless plum . In especial do we excel in two points ? in a keen , farsighted business sense and in mechanical adaptability . Also we are noted for our family affection and our general kindness of heart . Why , then , with all this array of valuable qualities , are we content to leave three-fifths of our population without proper accommodation ? In the census average five persons are allowed to a family , two adults and three children . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , and we are growing . At the lowest computation our children constitute more than half the people of the land . Their mintenance , education and general shelter and protection is becoming every year more of a problem of civics , and good progress is being made in this line of study ; but their housing is a problem in real estate , in building , a practical business proposition , which could be met on quite other lines . The city is the place where these questions confront us , naturally , and in the city they must be answered first . Here in New York in a population of three and a half millions we have two million one hundred thousand children . For this vast number of citizens the only provision made is civic ? the parks , the schools and a few playgrounds . Their parents , of course , do not provide these accommodations for children ? the period of parental supply is long past ; if children were left to the sole care of their parents only the few rich would have schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playgrounds . Our rich men 's children have finer clothes , and private schools , but even they must be pushed and pulled about the public streets and public parks ? their parents can provide for them only a remote nursery and small backyard . Poor and rich alike must mainly use the street for what outdoor life they get ; and here the poor child has some advantage , for he is not herded by a servant . he has freedom of body and brain , and learns much more than the poor , dull baby in the white velvet coat and leggings . But what a scandalous inadequacy it all is ! Here are these thousands and ' thousands of growing citizens , and here are the city fathers and the homebound mothers equally indifferent to their needs . Among the traditions we have not rebelled against , a superstition as old as those of Brahma and Vishnu is our complacent assumption that the home is the place for children . Perhaps it was , once . Perhaps the cave dweller arranged his excavation especially with a view to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sioux or the many-celled hive of the Pueblo is planned for children ? the peasant 's hut , or the baron 's castle , or the king 's palace .  | In that vast vague period of the Matriarchate , which antedates all history , there may have been homes made for children ? but there are not now . On the contrary ? the glaring and horrifying contrary ? we build houses to exclude children ; we do not want them in the home ! Go about with a family of five children and see the attitude of householders toward them . Lydia Kingsmill Commander has shown us in THE INDEPENDENT this phase of the question with amusing conclusiveness . Our houses are built and planned entirely and exclusively for adults , and in the more expensive ones children are frankly objected to ? often prohibited . Of course , we continue to have children , and they do live somewhere ; so they must needs be huddled about in the accommodation for " grown ups , " and turned into the street , with all its dirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stultifying nursemaid . We are so used to this , so helpless under the weight of age-old customs , that it never occurs to us that proper accommodations could be made for this large and important class of citizens . We do not at the moment recognize what is meant . " Accommodation for children ? What do you mean ? What do they need that they do not have ? " If hard pressed we may admit that the street is not a safe or nobly educative playground ; that the poor child runs horrible risks and that the rich suffers drearily in the benumbing clutch of an ignorant servant . But our inert brains can see nothing else possible . " They have to be in the street , " we say , sadly ? " they must have air . What other place is there ? " There is another place , even in the city ; an unobstructed area , miles and miles of it , with the best air possible in the circumstances , and that is ? ? the roof . " Roof ? roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no place for children ! " No , it is not , at present . But it could be , it should be , it will be when we see the right and reason of it . Take it from the private point of view : Here is a city lot and house . The lot is 100 x 25 feet , the house 25 x 75 feet , the yard 25 x 25 feet , and the sidewalk 25 x 10 feet . Now the sidewalk and yard together give the child but 875 square feet , whereas the roof would give him 1,875 feet . In the street is dirt , noise and danger . In the yard is less light , less air and a sense of imprisonment . On the roof is the best air a city has to offer , all the sun there is , comparative quiet and security . But the private point of view is not the one from which to regard the child . One 's own poor solitary private child or two , soon growing up to the longed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never command the attention and respect which we must give to the bulk of our citizens ? a steady , permanent class . Your child grows up and becomes an adult and forgets his infant limitations ; but children ? the children of the city ? remain continually , in their thousands upon thousands . And the same roof ? O , purblind parent ! ? will in course of years accommodate more than one child ! Now , suppose our house builders and investors in real estate should wake up to the fact that there was a market they had never catered to , a huge and influential patronage clamoring for proper provision . Suppose , while your imagination is in use , that this enormous number of children were organized and influential ? that they knew what they needed , and had the money to pay for it . Fancy them forming a syndicate and investing millions in the building of houses which did not exclude adults , but did include children as the governing factor . What would they build ? Our imaginations refuse to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of children as a class ? except as school children . There we have , indeed , accomplished something . As soon as we consider them as a class ? as a permanent class ? we do make shift to meet their needs . Now children at home are just as numerous and just as permanent as children at school . Why should we not give as much care to providing homes for them as we do to provide schools for them ? Now , to really stretch our minds to the  | consideration of home accommodations for children . Let us take a city block in New York as a basis ? nothing worse will present itself . If we can solve the problem in New York we can solve it anywhere . This block represents an area of 16o , - 000 square feet in this shape : In this block there are , say , one hundred families ; two hundred adults , three hundred children . This is not a passing incident , but a continual fact . That number of children are the permanent residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adult tenants , for that matter ? but as a class of residents they remain . Being the majority , it would seem reasonable that the place should be planned mainly with a view to their needs . The needs of children , as distinct from those of adults , are mainly , educative . The adult is a settled quantity . He or she wants a home wherein to rest after the day 's work , a place of quiet , ease , comfort , personal expression . In all this , as part of the family , the child shares according to his powers . But the period of childhood has dominant necessities of its own . To begin with the baby . He should have , besides proper food , shelter and protection from danger , the fullest means of growth , physical and mental . We dress our babies more with a view to our sense of beauty and to the protection of our clothes and furnishings than with a view to the care and free growth of the little body . If we , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering their smooth and normal development as the main thing , they might be very differently dressed , and wholesomely undressed most of the time . For air , sunlight and quiet the roof and the floor under it are the natural place for the little ones . When a whole block is thus arranged we shall have an outdoor space of two-thirds the whole area ? quite a park . One side could be for the infants , three for the older ones , who require more space . For the babies the quiet sleeping rooms , bathing rooms not only for lavatory purposes , but with wide , shallow pools , where the delighted fatlings could play in the wafer for blessed hours when the weather was not suitable outside , baby gymnasia and general nursery accommodations . Above , within insurmountable high railings , there could be sun-gardens and sand-gardens , flower-gardens , too , of sorts , and , again , gymnasia , in the open air . Babies can not , it is true , swing clubs and dumbbells , or do elaborate acts on ladders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are capable of ? pulling upon soft large ropes within easy reach , incipient swinging , climbing tip and rolling down , and sliding ; there are plenty of exercises in which the waking hours of healthy yearlings and twoyear-olds could be passed in pure delight and great profit . No perambulators needed . The child could get the air and sun while stationary , and get real exercise when in motion . They do not like to be strapped in , smothered in blankets and helplessly pushed around . When asleep a baby can lie still ; when awake he should be free to move . The perambulator is a device to keep the child tolerably safe and clean in our unsafe and unclean streets . When we have the sense to provide a place proper for babies they will not need these antiquated devices . Our retinue of nursemaids , and the " unceasing care " which the fond mother gives are necessary while the poor baby roams among the elaborate furnishings of an adult home or the dangers of the street , but legitimate accommodations will simplify " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones the same general needs are to be met . Rooms suitable for child life , where their natural activity can cause no inconvenience to older people and where are provided , opportunity and occupation for those activities , instead of expecting a child to be " good " in doing nothing , and calling it naughty for nearly all it does . As I have remarked in another place , mischief is a term we use to describe the natural interaction between a child and a home . When children have homes really  | planned for them they will do no mischief ? there will be so many natural things to do . The elements are a delight always ? earth , air , fire and water ? and with experiment and unconscious instruction they could playand learn from year to year , having a jolly good time every day . Simply playing in water is occupation and education in itself under right supervision . A shallow swimming pool , chutes to slide down splashingly , boats to sail , all the games possible in this delightful media ? there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted gymnasium , too ; but , mainly , large playgrounds , with little individual garden boxes and suchlike provision for happy growth and observation . From the cheapest and easiest arrangement of a clean , safe place to play to the most elaborate and advanced for unconscious education , every block in the city , according to its rents , could offer suitable accommodation to this large proportion of its tenants . While the whole block may be beyond our reach at present , even a small apartment house could begin the good work ? even a private house if the owner could afford it . But private interest and private means are no more to be trusted to make suitable homes for children than they are to make suitable schools . Take an ordinary apartment house of the more reasonable sort ? five stories high ? ten families ? with an average of thirty children . Even on that limited roof space a big sun parlor for babies and sand garden for toddlers could be placed , and the other half fitted as a playroom and gymnasium for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family home , to which the child would return from his own playground , as he now returns from the school or the street . Having a place of his own , with acknowledged rights and privileges , he would easily learn to respect those of others ? a somewhat difficult lesson now to a healthy , vigorous child , who grows up , on sufferance , in an adult home , and on the street . In the matter of expense there is no serious obstacle . The rich could save enough off their armies , of futile nursemaids to pay for first-class care in the roof playgrounds . The poor would have less elaborate provision , and could save what was needed on doctors ' and undertakers ' bills and the taxes which support our prisons and asylums . The question of association among the children will not trouble the poor , who now flock thickly in the street , and need not trouble the rich , who can keep their little ones in solitary confinement in individual pens on their roofs if they prefer ; or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit gossiping with the others and drag the child about . It would be in a safe place , that is all . Neither is there any question of separating the children from their mothers . The mother may , if she will , sleep by the child all night , and sit , stand or walk by it all day ( as she does now ! ) ? it is simply that she would have a proper place to do it in . As a matter of fact , very few mothers are incessantly with their children . The poor have too much work and the rich too much play . Also these last are ashamed to be much seen with their children in the street lest they be taken for nursemaids . I remember once , when I was wheeling my own baby , being stopped by a benevolent old lady , who admired the child and asked , " Whose baby is it ? " It never occurred to her that the mother could really be with the child . This building provision need not exclude the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides permanently for the needs of our young residents . One more thing may affright us : " Where shall we dry our clothes ? " Possibly the home is meant to be a place for children as much as a laundry . When we do make it a place for children we may be forced to take dirty work outside . So let us look forward to the advertisements of the farseeing landlord : " Elegant residence for families with children . Best roof acommodations in city . Absolutely no smoke . Double railings . Outer and inner promenade . Ample provision for swimming . Gymnasia from one year up . " And so on and so on . The market waits . Two million children in New York ? permanent residents ? will no one build houses for them ? " Wanted : A home . Apply to The Child . "
