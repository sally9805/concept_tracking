 | By an Act of Congress , approved by the President on March 10 , 1906 , the trustees chosen by Mr. Carnegie were incorporated under the title " The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , " and the purpose of the foundation is described in that Act in the following words : " To provide retiring pensions , without regard to race , sex , creed , or color , for the teachers of universities , colleges , and technical schools in the United States , the Dominion of Canada , and Newfoundland , " and " in general , to do and perform all things necessary to encourage , uphold , and dignify the profession of the teacher and the cause of higher education . " In a word , this Foundation is intended , not so much to benefit a particular individual or class of individuals , as to advance and dignify the profession of the teacher and the cause of higher education which the teacher serves . Its name indicates , in part at least , the aim for which it stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take is the establishment in a number of institutions of higher learning on the American continent of the retiring salary as a part of the academic compensation . Long ago the older European countries recognized clearly that the calling of the teacher could not command the money reward of other callings and professions , and they have aimed , and generally successfully , to meet this professional disadvantage to some extent by removing from the teacher 's life the uncertainty and anxiety which go with modest income . In all European countries the teacher 's retiring allowance is a recognized part of his compensation . It is the purpose of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , and will be its first work , to establish this principle in so large a number of American institutions as to make it a part also of our American system of education , so that the teacher may feel that the retiring allowance to which he is entitled is one of the compensations which go with small pay and modest living ? a compensation which he receives , not as a gratuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally occur to the teachers themselves and to the friends of education concerning the administration of this gift , and they are these : Granting the great need for the establishment of the retiring pension system in our higher institutions , how far will this gift go toward the accomplishment of that object ? What rules will govern the granting of retiring allowances , and what institutions and individuals will share in the benefits of the fund ? There are , in the three English-speaking countries of North America something over seven hundred institutions calling themselves colleges or universities . For many of these it is difficult to obtain any accurate data as to the pay and support of their teachers . About one-half of these institutions have given information of such a nature as to show the general character of the support accorded to the teacher . Briefly stated , it may be said that 327 colleges and universities employ 6,207 teachers at a total annual expense of $9,630,000 , or at an average compensation to the teacher of $1,550 a year . It will be understood that the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faculty ( a professor , associate or adjunct professor , or assistant professor ) . These figures do not include the pay of instructors and assistants whose places are temporary , and who are not considered as eligible to apension . Of these 327 institutions 218 have some denominational connection , 58 are supported and controlled by the State , and 51 are not connected with denominations nor controlled or supported by the State . The first group pays an average annual salary to each professor of $1,180 , the second an average salary of $1,787 , and the third group an average salary of $1,907 . The mere inspection of the financial exhibits of these widely scattered institutions reveals much of the heroism and the devotion of the American teacher and the sacrifices which an American community will make in order to furnish to its youth what it believes to be an education . In these details of college salaries is laid bare the story of many a struggling college standing bravely for high ideals in education and sincerity and thoroughness in college standards . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows many a case of unwise devotion . There are many universities and colleges in this long roll which are such in name only and which have no other reasons for existence than those which spring from local pride and personal or denominational ambition . The annual income of the fund provided by Mr. Carnegie is a half-million dollars . It is evident that this sum will be inadequate for the maintenance of a fair system of retiring allowances in all these hundreds of institutions , and that , if the principle of the pension system is to be established , it can be done only by the devotion of this income , not to isolated individuals as a general charity , but by its use in the recognition of institutions and individuals along some definite and well-considered plan . To pay a modest pension here and there among the 6,000 teachers of these 327 colleges would be a worthy charity , but it would accomplish little toward the inauguration and establishment of the principle of the retiring pay as a part of the teacher 's compensation , and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher or the cause of higher education . The practical problem which the trustees have to face is the administration of this trust in such a way as to deal generously and fairly with the individual teacher , and at the same time to establish the principle of the retiring allowance as a part of American academic administration . In framing an administration to accomplish these ends the trustees have found themselves face to face with questions of the highest importance and of far-reaching significance . Among the most difficult are three which are fundadamental . First , What is a college ? second , What constitutes denominational control ? and , third , Should a private agency step in between the State and one of its institutions and establish a system of retiring allowances for university professors who are officers of the State ? With regard to the first question it may be said that the term college is used to designate , in the United States , Canada , and Newfoundland , institutions varying so widely in entrance requirements , standards of instruction , and facilities for work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution . Of the seven hundred and more institutions calling themselves colleges or universities , many are such in name only . The title college has been adopted in many cases by an ambitious high school , and the title university by an ambitious college , in much the same way that the title colonel is assumed by individuals . To recognize all these institutions as colleges would be to abandon all educational standards , and would go far to encourage every high school to call itself a college . The trustees of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching have , therefore , adopted for the present an arbitrary definition of the term college , which is that now in use under the revised ordinances of the State of New York , and which reads as follows : " An institution to be ranked as a college must have at least six professors giving their entire time to college and university- ; : ork , a course of four full years in liberal arts and sciences , and should require for admission not less than the usual four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to the pre-academic or grammar school studies . " The trustees will also require that an institution , to be ranked as a college and to be dealt with as a college officially , must have a productive endowment of not less than $200,000 . This definition of a college is a modest one . To accept less than this is practically to throw away any real standard of work both for the college and for the high school ; and the trustees , representing as they do all sections of the country , have felt that they could do no higher service to education than to maintain some fair standard of what an institution ought to be in order to call itself a college . The Act of Incorporation for the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching provides that " retiring pensions shall be paid to such teachers only as are or have been connected with institutions not under control of a sect , or which do not require their trustees ,  | their officers , faculties , or students ( or a majority thereof ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not impose any theological test as a condition of entrance therein or of connection therewith . " While this language seems definite enough , the practical administration of the matter is not so simple . A large majority of all the colleges of the country have a connection more or less strong with denominations . Indeed , nearly all colleges not founded by the State have grown out of the efforts of religious bodies , and they can not forget the obligations they owe to the denominations . As the country has grown older there has been , however , a growing tendency among the older and stronger institutions to give up the denominational relation . One finds , therefore , every possible form , today , of denominational connection exemplified in American colleges . In the more extreme form this connection involves absolute ownership and the control of the trustees and faculties by a denomination ; while in its weakest form the denomination appoints simply a visiting committee to report and advise . In nearly all these cases , however , whether of the strict or of the loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees who govern the institution and choose its officers are of a specified denomination . At just what point between the extremes an institution should be considered undenominational is a difficult question to decide . In this matter the trustees of the Foundation desire to go slowly , but to deal with the question in a fair and generous spirit . It is evident that in many cases colleges must choose between the advantages of this gift and the benefits of a denominational connection . The question of the inclusion of the State institutions is one which involves consideration of a matter of large public policy . This fund is a gift to higher education , and from the educational standpoint there are serious objections to a policy which would recognize , in a State like Wisconsin , for example , a modest college , and yet which did not recognize the State University , the real leader of higher education . On the other hand , the State universities have labored through many discouragements , for many years , to bring home to the people of their respective States a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported generously by the State . This lesson has now been well learned , and the great State universities are to be the richest institutions in our country so far as income is concerned . The States may fairly be expected to provide a retiring pension system for their own professors , and it is certainly questionable whether such wholesale action on the part of a private agency in the endowment of State institutions might not do them an injury rather than a kindness . It will be seen , therefore , that the trustees who have in charge Mr. Carnegie 's gift have found themselves at the very outset face to face with questions of the highest importance , with which they are endeavoring to deal as wisely and as fairly as they are able . It is their hope that the teachers of America will appreciate the fact that it is far more important to establish the principle of the retiring pension than to maintain a charitable fund , and that it will serve a far greater purpose in American education to establish this principle and to maintain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve the needs of individual teachers , however deserving they may be . The board of trustees is composed almost wholly of men who have spent their lives as teachers , who have the utmost sympathy with the problem which the teachers confront , and who realize as only college teachers can the inadequacy of the teachers ' pay . They hope , therefore , that in their effort to solve these questions they may have the support and at least the patience of the American teachers . And it will be remembered that American is used here in the continental sense . In the actual administration of the Foundation the trustees have adopted the following principles and rules . They desire , first of all , to recognize the teacher , wherever possible , through the institution in which he works ; and to the teacher in such institutions the benefits of the Foundation will be available automatically . That is to say , once the teacher in an accepted institution has  | complied with the conditions , a retiring pension will be granted him immediately upon the recommendation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the same officer of his college from whom he received his salary while in active service . Just what institutions will be included in the first list admitted officially to the benefits of the Foundation can not at this moment be named . Such a list will be announced in due time . In the nature of the case it will be a provisional list only , and to it additions will be made as rapidly as the wise solution of the questions involved will admit . On the other hand , the trustees recognize that in many institutions which , by reason of low entrance requirements or for other cause , can not be for the present recognized as colleges , there are teachers who have been and are doing splendid work for education . In such institutions , which are undenominational , they will deal with the individual professor , and will confer such pensions as distinguished and faithful service may seem to warrant , using again , so far as their charter may allow them , a generous interpretation of the purpose of the gift . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retiring allowance , such as a stated per cent . of a professor 's salary when retired , can not be adopted without working a serious hardship in many institutions where salaries are low , and under the best conditions must remain low for many years . As the foregoing statement has shown , the average pay of a professor in American colleges is $1,550 , while many professors are doing excellent work on a salary of $1,200 a year . To grant to such men a retiring allowance of fifty per cent . of their salary would scarcely tend to dignify the profession of the teacher . It seems , therefore , more fair to men in small colleges and on small pay to use in reckoning the retiring allowance a scale which has some relation to the salary received . Thus , under the rules adopted , a professor receiving an active salary of $1,200 would receive a retiring allowance of $1,000 , while one receiving a salary of $5,000 would receive a retiring allowance of $2,700 . Normal retiring allowances will be granted either upon ground of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extracted from the regulations of the trustees , just published , give the practical conditions upon which such retiring allowances may be earned : I. In reckoning the amount of the retiring allowance , the average salary for the last five years of active service shall be considered the active pay . II . Any person sixty-five years of age , and who has had not less than fifteen years of service as a professor , and who is at the same time a professor in an accepted institution , shall be entitled to an annual retiring allowance computed as follows : ( a ) For an active pay of sixteen hundred dollars or less , an allowance of one thousand dollars , provided no retiring allowance shall exceed ninety per cent . of the active pay . ( b ) For an active pay greater than sixteen hundred dollars the retiring allowance shall equal one thousand dollars , increased by fifty dollars for each one hundred dollars of active pay in excess of sixteen hundred dollars . ( c ) No retiring allowance shall exceed three thousand dollars . III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years as a professor , and who is at the time a professor in an accepted institution , shall be entitled to a retiring allowance computed as follows : ( a ) For an active pay of sixteen hundred dollars or less , a retiring allowance of eight hundred dollars , provided that no retiring allowance shall exceed eighty per cent . of the active pay . ( b ) For an active pay greater than sixteen hundred dollars the retiring allowance shall equal eight hundred dollars , increased by forty dollars for each one hundred dollars of active pay in excess of sixteen hundred dollars . ( c ) For each additional year of service above twenty-five , the retiring allowance shall be increased by one per cent . of the active pay . ( d ) No retiring allowance shall exceed three thousand dollars . IV . Any person who has been for ten years the wife of a professor in actual service may receive during her widowhood cnehalf of the allowance to which her husband would have been entitled . Copies of these rules have been printed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These rules have been adopted after careful discussion and consideration , and , while the actual administration will undoubtedly show changes which must be made , they represent the best lines of administration  | which the experience of the trustees can at this time supply . From the standpoint of the administration of trust funds , and particularly of educational trusts , this board of trustees presents two characteristics of unusual interest . The first is that Mr. Carnegie has placed the administration of this great gift for education in the hands of supposed experts , representative of the entire country . Heretofore gifts for education in America have been the gifts of private philanthropy , a philanthropy directed in nearly all cases by the personal acquaintance of individuals or by personal knowledge of a particular institution or community . It will be-an interesting outcome of this fund to observe the lines upon which a body of experts in education , drawn from all parts of the United States and Canada , will administer a fund for education . A second interesting fact involved in the establishment of this board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in educational administration , which represents not a locality or a single institution , but which aims to take into account the educational needs of all sections . The single step of adopting a modest but reasonable definition of a college is a far-reaching one in education . This idea of the scope of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a centralizing and standardizing influence in American education promises to outweigh in importance the primary purpose of the fund , great as that primary purpose is . The influence of such an agency , if wisely directed , in clearing our ideas of educational administration and in setting fair standards can scarcely be overestimated . If it accomplishes nothing other than to call attention to the need of doing thoroughly the grade of educational work in which an institution is embarked , it will have accomplished much . If the trustees of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching can make plain the lesson that it is the duty of a high school to do well the work of a high school and not try to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college to do the work of a college and not to try to call itself a university , a great step will have been taken in academic consistency . If they shall succeed in dealing in a generous and yet sincere and wise spirit with the questions of denominational and State control , they will have served a still larger purpose in contributing to the sincerity and thoroughness of American education .
