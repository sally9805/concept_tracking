Alderman - Kenneally , Chairman of the Aldermen 's ? Buildings Committee , which is conducting the hearings on the two reports of the Revision Commission , representing Charles F. Murphy 's home district in the Board . and the members of the committee wrangled continually throughout the session , : and it looked several times as if the hearing might break up in a row . ? The principal insurgents were Alderman I Doull , who is practically the only member of the board who can be called a Croker man , and as a member of the commission was one of the leaders of the minority : Alderman Colgan , who represents a strong McCarren district in Brook ' lyn . and Aldermen Schloss and Gunther. two of the principal Republican mentbeitt of the board . Kenneally began the tactics adopted'by 11 him at the previous hearing of interriipting the speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunther objected iepeatedly and suceeded nearly always winning their point . The Chairman was backed yesterday by John D. Moore , the engineer , and one of the leaders of the majority of the commission , who was censured by the members of the committee at the previous hearing for prompting Alderman Smith in questions to the speakers . Every time Kenneally showed that-a speaker was saying something he did not like , Moore Jumped to his feet and fired a question at the man . At times his man . ner was so objectionable that the speaker refused to answer . Finally Alderman Gunther got angry at a question direoted at Richard L. Humphreys of the United States Geological Survey , and even Kenneally decided that the tactics had gone too far and ruled that no more questions should be asked . At this the insurgents shoufed in unison : " We 'll attend to that , the whole committee will decide the rules of procedure . " The fun began during , the remarks of Ernest Flagg , architect of the Singer Building , who opposed both the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code are malicious , and could not have been devised by men of fair minds and intelligence , " said he . " The code Is filled with demands for unnecessary extravagance and lacks common sense . It was drawn by men of narrow vision whoSe acts leaves them open to suspicion . " Kenneally had stood this as long se he could , and shouted . " Do n't cast any reflections or insinuations on the commission ! It was appointed under the Charter . " " This is apublic hearing , and I believe I have a right to say anything I wish , " retorted Mr. Flagg . " You may do so , " remarked Mr. DOtill. and after the applause had died , dawn Mr. Flagg went on , declaring among otis er things that the men who drew . the code showed " infinitesimal intelligence. ? He concluded by shouting : " The whole thing is monumental idiocy. " ? - Thomas Hart , who said he appeared al " a citizen of the United States , ' created the next diversion . " Ninety-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know their jobs , " said he . As he resumed his seat he remarked loudly to a neighbor , " I guess I showed up ' some of those dopes , eh ? " Moore interrupted Prof. Charles I. Norton or Ise Massachusetts Institute of Technology with several questions . Finally Alderman Colgan shouted : " I protest against these unnecessary Interruptions . It looks to me like an attempt to prolong these hearings . " " The gentleman can ask all the questions he likes , " announced the Chairman . " Let us go into executive session and settle this thing right now , " the Alderman then demanded . Doull agreed with him , and Moore said with a sneer : " I hope my nuestions do not distress Prof. Norton as much as they appear to disturb Mr. Doull and Mr. Colgan . " During the remarks of Martin Goldwitz , Secretary of the Cement Laborers ' Union , who declared that the restrictions placed by the code on the use of cinder concrete fireproofing would put a large number , of the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company fight came to the surface . " Are you not a foreman for Roehling ? ** demanded Kenneally . " I am not , " shouted Goldwitz . " I represent my organization and you can find me at my office any day you care to call . " He later admitted , however , that he had been employed by the firm at one time . Mr. Humphreys stated that if New York had as carefully drawn a Building Code as have foreign cities $8,000,000 a year fire loss would be saved . " You have firetraps surrounding your fireprosf buildings , " said he . ' None of the 4 would survive a serious conflagration , aid think what the occurrence of a. fire in this city like that in San Francisco would do to the country as a whole . Business would be paralyzed and a. panic would be ore- , ? ted such as was never heard of before . The wholy country is interested in the revision of your Building Code and is watching you now . ? " You are attempting to create different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Building Code . YOu have in this city so-called fireproof buildings in which there-are enough people to populate a good sized ' town working every day in false security . You should pay more attention to the exits of buildings and fire escapes . " Mr. Humphreys closed by saying he was present to advocate the causella no particular kind of material . Moors jumped to his feet and asked , " Did you , not tell the commission on Feb. 14 mar you were a friend of concrete ? " " I did , and I am a friend of concrete . or any other good kind of building mite terial ; replied Mr. Humphreys , " Now , Mr. Moore , why do you persist In asking questions like that , ? ? demanded Alderman Doull . " I am sorry if my question gave foil anguish , " shouted Moore , shaking his finger at the Alderman . Then the members of the committee all began to talk at once and shout at each other . Above the uproar Humphreys was heard to say , ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this kind , but I will answer any questions he wants to ask . " Among those who addressed the committee were C. F.
