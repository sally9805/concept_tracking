" COUNTRY Lice " was the opening lecture of a course given by Mr. Emerson at the Freeman Place Chapel in Boston , in March , 1858 . It was followed by " Works and Days " ( printed in Society and Solitude ) , " Powers of the Mind , " " Natural Method of Mental Philosophy , " " Memory " ( the matter of these three mostly now found in Natural History of Intellect ) , and " Self-Possession . " " Concord Walks , " which will be printed in connection with " Country Life " in the last volume of the Centenary Edition of Mr. Emerson 's works , was originally a part of the lecture , as given by him to his neighbors in the village Lyceum. ? EDWARD W. EMERSON . The Teutonic race have been marked in all ages by a trait which has received the name of Earth-hunger , a love of possessing land . It is not less visible in that branch of the family which inhabits America . Nor is it confined to farmers , speculators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of land , seems to be the calling of the people of this new country , of those , at least , who have not some decided bias , driving them to a particular craft , as a born sailor or machinist . The capable and generous , let them spend their talent on the land . Plant it , adorn it , study it , ? it will de- vel op in the cultivator the talent it requires . The avarice of real estate , native to us all , covers instincts of great generosity , namely , all that is called the love of nature , comprising the largest use and the whole beauty of a farm or landed estate . Travel and walking have this apology , that nature has impressed on savage men periodical or secular impulses to emigrate , as upon lemmings , rats and birds . The Indians go in summer to the coast for fishing ; in winter , to the woods . The nomads wander over vast territory , to find their pasture . Other impulses hold us to other habits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nomad life is given up for settled homes . But the necessity of exercise and the nomadic instinct are always stirring the wish to travel , and in the spring and summer it commonly gets the victory . Chaucer notes of the month of April , Than longer folk to 1:0011 sit pilgrymages , And painters for to seken straunge strondes , To force hnhves , condi ? in sondry londes . And , in the country , nature is always inviting to the compromise of walking as soon as we are released from severe labor . Linnteus , early in life , read a discourse at the University of Upsala On the necessily of travelling in one 's own country , based 011 the conviction that nature was inexhaust- ibly rich , and that in every district were swamps , or beaches , or rocks , or mountains , which were now nuisances , but , if explored , and turned to account , were capable of yielding immense benefit . At Upsala , therefore , he instituted what were called herborizations : he summoned his class to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to collect plants , and insects , birds , and eggs . These parties started at seven in the morning , and staved out till nine in the evening ; the Professor was generally attended by two hundred students , and , when they returned , they marched through the streets of lipsala in a festive procession , with flowers in their hats , to the music of drums and trumpets , and with loads of natural productions collected on the way . Let me remind you what this walker found in his walks . He went into Oland , and found that the farms on the shore were perpetually encroached on by the sea , and ruined by blowing sand . He discovered that the arundo nrennris , or beach grass , had long firm roots , and he taught them to plant it for the protection of their shores . In Tornea , he found the people suffering every spring from the loss of their cattle , which died by some fright-h1 distemper , to the number of fifty or a hundred in a year . Linnteus walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to grass , and found it a bog , where the water-hemlock grew in abundance , and had evidently been cropped plentifully by the animals in feeding . He found the pl ant also dried in their cut hay . He showed them that the whole evil might be prevented by employing a woman for a month to eradicate the noxious plants . When the shipyards were infested with rot , Linnams was sent to provide some remedy . He studied tine insects that infested the timber , and found that they laid their eggs in the logs within certain days in April , and he directed that during ten days , at that time of the year , the logs should be immersed under the water , which being done , the timber was found to be uninjured . He found that the gout , to which lie was subject , was cured by wood-strawberries . He had other remedies . When Kahn returned from America , Limit-ens was laid up with severe gout . But the joy in his return , and the curiosity to see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend as good as the treatment by wood-strawberries . He learned the secret of making pearls in the river-pearl mussel . He found out that a terrible distemper which sometimes proves fatal in the North of Europe , was occasioned by an animalcule , which he called Furia inlernalis , which falls from the air on the face , or hand , or other uncovered part , burrows into it , multiplies , and kills the sufferer . By timely attention , it is easily extracted . He examined eight thousand plants ; and examined fishes , insects , birds , quadrupeds ; and distributed the animal , vegetable and mineral kingdoms . And if , instead of running about in the hotels anti theatres of Europe , we would manlike see what grows , or might grow , in Massaclmsetts , stock its gardens , drain its bogs , plant its miles and miles of barren waste with oak and pine ; and following what is usually the natural suggestion of these pursuits , ponder the moral secrets which , in her solitudes , Nature has to whisper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have the finest climate in the world , for this purpose , in ' Massachusetts . If we have coarse days , and dogdays , and white days , and days that are like ice-blinks , we have also yellow days , and crystal days , ? days which are neither hot nor cold , but the perfection of temperature . New England has a good climate , ? yet , in choosing a farm , we like a Southern exposure , whilst Massachusetts , it must be owned , is on the Northern slope , towards the Arctic circle , and the Pole . Our climate is a series of surprises , and among our many prognostics of the weather , the only trustworthy one that I know is , that , when it is warm , it is a sign that it is going to be cold . The climate needs , therefore , to be corrected by 596 Country Lip a little anthracite coal ,  --  a little coal indoors , during ranch of the year , and thick coats and shoes must be recommended to walkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climates . " I have no enthusiasm for nature , " said a French writer , " which the slightest chill will not instantly destroy . " lint we can not overpraise the comfort and the beauty of the climate in the best days of the year . In summer , we have for weeks a sky of Calcutta , yielding the richest growth , maturing plants which require strongest sunshine , and scores of days when the heat is so rich , and yet so tempered , that it is delicious to live . The importance to the intellect of exposing the body and brain to the fine mineral and imponderable agents of the air makes the chief interest in the subject : " So exquisite is the structure of the cortical glands , " said the old physiologist . Malpighi , " that when the atmosphere is ever no slightly vitiated or altered , the brain is the first part to sympathize and to undergo a change of state . " We are very sensible of this , when , in midsummer , we go to the seashore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house , we go abroad into the landscape , with any leisure to attend to its soothing and expanding influences . The power of the air was the first explanation offered by the early philosophers of the mutual understanding that men have . " The air , " said Anaximenes , " is the soul , and the essence of life . By breathing it , we become intelligent , and , because we breathe the same air , understand one another . " Plutarch thought it contained the knowledge of the future . " If it be true , that souls are naturally endowed with the faculty of prediction , and that the chief cause that excites that faculty is a certain temperature of air and winds , " etc. liven I.ord Bacon said , " The Stars inject their imagination or influence into the air . " The air that we breathe is an exhalation of all the solid material of the globe . . . . It is the last finish of the work of the Creator . We might say , the Rock of Ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystic constitution of man 's mind and body . Walking has the best value as gym II : , tics for the mind . " You shall never break down in a speech , " said Sydney Small , " on the day on which you have twelve miles . " In the English universities , the reading men are daily perform. - ing their punctual training in the bond - clubs , or a long gallop of many miles in the saddle , or taking their faille , " i3O11-stittitionals , " walks of eight and len miles . " Walking , " said Rousseau , " lull something which animates and vivifies my ideas . " And Plato said of exercise . that , " it would almost cure a guilty CON-science . " " For the living out of doors . and simple fare , and gymnastic exercises , and the morals of companions , produce the greatest effect on the way of virtue and of vice . " Few men know how to take a walk . The qualifications of a professor are endurance , plain clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor , vast curiosily , good speech , good silence , and nothing too much . If a man tells me that he has an intense love of nature , I know , of course , that he has none . Good observers have the manners of trees and annuals , their patient good sense , and if they add words , ' t is only when words are better than silence . But a loud singer , or a story-teller , or a vain talker profanes the river and the forest , and is nothing like sun good company as a dog . There is also an effect on beauty . . De Quincey said , " I have seen Words . worth 's eyes sometimes affected powerfully in this respect . His eyes are not under any circumstances bright , lustrous , or piercing , but , after a long day 's toil in walking , I have seen them assume an ininpearance the most solemn and spiritual that it is possible for the human eye to wear . The light which resides in them is nit no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a light which seems to come from depths below all depths ; in fact , iL is more truly entitled to be held the light that never was on land or sea . ' a light radiating from some for qiiritual world , than any that can he lamed . " But De Quincey prefixes to this ileseripl ion of Wordsworth a little piece of advice , which I wonder has not attracted more attention . " The depth and subtlety of the eyes varies exceedingly with the stale of the stomach , and , if voung ladies were aware of the magical transformations which can be wrought in the depth and sweetness of the eye , by a few weeks ' exercise , I fancy we should see their habits in this point altered greatly for the better . " For walking , you must have a broken country . In Illinois , everybody rides . There is no good walk in that State . The reason is , a square yard of it is as good as a hundred miles . TOIL can distinguish from the COWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the naked eye : fence , you have the monotony of Holland , and when you step out of the door , can see all that you will have seen when you come home . In Massachusetts , our land is agreeably broken , and is permeable like a park , and not like some towns in the more broken country of New Hampshire , built on three or four hills having each one side at forty-five degrees , and the other side perpendicular : so that if you go a mile , you have only the choice whether you will climb the hill on your way out , or on your way back . The more reason we have to be content with the felicity of our slopes in Massachusetts , undulating , rocky , broken and surprising , but without this alpine inconveniency . Twenty years ago in Northern Wisconsin the pinery was composed of trees so big , and so many of them , that it was impossible to walk in the country , and the traveller had nothing for it , but to wade in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they showed me in Illinois , that , in the bottom lands , the grass was fourteen feet high . We may well enumerate what compensating advantages we have over that country , for ' t is a commonplace , which I have frequently heard spoken in Illinois , that it was a manifest leading of the Divine Providence , that the New England States should have been first settled before the western country semis known , or they would never have been settled at all . The privilege of the countryman is the culture of the land , the laying out of grounds and gardens , the orchard , and the forest . The Rosaceous tribe in botany , including the apple , pear , peach and cherry , are coeval with man . The apple is our national fruit . In October , the country is covered with its ornamental harvests . The American sun paints itself in these glowing balls amid the green leaves , ? the social fruit , in Which Nature has deposited every possible flavor ; whole zones and climates she has concentrated into apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look over the fence at the farmer who stands there . I fe makes every cloud in the sky , and every beam of the stun , serve him . His trees are full of brandy . He saves every drop of sap , as if it were wine . A few years ago , those trees were whipsticks . Now , every one of them is worth a hundred dollars . Observe their form ; not a branch nor a twig is to spare . They look as if they were arms and fingers , holding out to you balls of fire and gold . One tree yields the rent of an acre of land . Yonder pear has every property which should belong to a tree . It is hardy , and almost immortal . It accepts every species of nourishment , and yet emtld live , like an Arab , on air and water . It grows like the ash Ygdrasil . It seems to me much that I have brought a skilful chemist into my ground , and keep him there overnight , all day , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of refuse rubbish , to manufacture Yirgaliens , Bergamots , and Seckels , in a manner which no confectioner can approach ; and his method of working is no less beautiful than the result . In old towns , there are always certain paradises known to the pedestrian , old and deserted farms , where the neglected orchard has been left to itself , and whilst . 598 Country Life some of its trees decay , the hardier have held their own . I know is whole district , Estabrook Farm , made up of wide straggling orchards , where tire apple-trees strive with and hold their ground against the native forest trees : the apple growing with profusion that mocks the pains taken by careful cockneys , who come out into the country , plant young trees , and watch them dwindling . Here , no hedges are wanted ; the wide distance from any population is fence enough : the fence is a mile wide . Here are varieties of apple not found in Downing or Loud on . The " Tartaric " variety , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you dare , " the " Beware of this . " Apples of a kind which I remember in boyhood , each containing a barrel of wind and half a barrel of cider . But there was a contest between the old orchard and the invading forest trees , for the possession of the ground , of the whites against the Pequots , and if the handsome savages win , we shall not be losers . ' .. . According to the common estimate of farmers , the woodlot yields its gentle rent of six per cent , without any care or thought , when the owner sleeps or travels , and it is subject to no enemy but fire . Evelyn quotes Lord Caernavon 's saying , " Wood is an excrescence of the earth provided by God for the payment of debts . " Lord Abercorn , when some one praised the rapid growth of his trees , replied , " Sir , they have nothing else to do . " When Nero advertised for a new luxury , a walk in the woods should have been offered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old age . For Nature makes a like impression on age as on youth . Then I recommend it to people who are groWing old against their will . A man in that predicament , if he stands before a mirror , or among young people , is made quite too sensible of the fact ; but the forest awakes in him the same feeling it did when he was a boy , and he may draw a moral from Hoes followed the passage about trees which appears in " The Address nt the Consecration of Sleepy ' Hollow Cemetery " printed in the Miscellanies ( Centenary Edition ) . the fact ! hat !

I admire taste which makes the avenue to a hoe , . were the house never so small , through a wood ; besides the beauty , it has a positive effect on mariners , as it disposes the mind of the inhabitant and of his guests to the deference due to each . Some English reformers thought the cattle made all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if there Were no cows to pasture , less land would suffice . But a cow does not need so much land as the owner 's eyes require between him and his neighbor . Our Aryan progenitors in Asia celebrated the winds as the conveying Maruts , " traversers of places difficult of access . Stable is their birthplace in the sky , but they are agitators of heaven and earth . who shake all around like the top of a tree . Because they drive the clouds , they have harnessed the spotted deer to their chariot ; they are coming with weapons , war-cries , and decorations . I hear the cracking of the whips in their hand : . I praise their sportive resistless strength . They are the generators of speech . They drive before them in their course the long , vast , uninjurable , rain-retaining cloud . Wherever they pass , they fill the way with clamor . Every one hears their noise .

I think sometimes how many days could Methuselah go out and find something new . In January the new snow has changed the woods so that he does not know them ; has built sudden cathedrals in a night . In the familiar forest he finds Norway and Russia in the masses of overloading snow which break all that they can not bend . In March , the thaw , and the sounding of the south wind , and the splendor of the icicles . On the pond there is a cannonade of a hundred guns , but it is not in honor of election of any President . He went forth again after the rain ; in the cold swamp , the buds were swollen , the ictodes prepares its flower , and the mallows and mouse-ear .

In June the miracle works faster , ' " Painting with white and red the moors To draw the nations out of doors . " Alan feels the blood of thousands in his body , and pumps the sap of all this forest through his arteries , the loquacity of all birds in the morning ; and the immensity of life seems to make the world deep and wide . In August when the corn is grown to be a resort and protection to woodcocks and small birds , and when the leaves whisper to each other in the wind , we observe already that the leaf is sere , that a change has passed on the landscape . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days which October always brings us , when , after the first frosts , a steady shower of gold falls in the strong southwind from the chestnuts , maples and hickories : all the trees arc windharps , filling the air with music ; and all men become poets , and walk to the measure of rhymes they make or remember . The dullest churl begins to quaver . The forest in its coat of many colors reflects its varied splendor through the softest haze . The witch-hazel blooms to mark the last hour arrived , and that nature has played out her summer score . The dry leaves rustle so loud , as we go rummaging through them , that we can hear nothing else . The leaf in our dry climate gets fully ripe , and , like the fruit when fully ripe , acquires fine color , whilst , in Europe , the damper climate decomposes it too soon . i These descriptions of the advance from Winter to Spring recall the first part of the poem M-ay-Day. 600 Count But the pleasures of garden , orchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on the sick of change of air , ? the action of new scenery on the mind is not less fruitful . We must remember that man is a natural nomad , and his old propensities will stir at midsummer , and send him , like an Indian , to the sea . The influence of the ocean on the love of liberty I have mentioned elsewhere . Its power on the mind in sharpening the perceptions has made the sea the famous educator of our race . The history of the world , ? what is it , but the doings about the shores of the Mediterranean Sea , and the Atlantic ? .. . What freedom of grace has the sea with all this might ! . . The freedom makes the observer feel as a slave . Our expression is so thin and cramped ! Can we not learn here a generous eloquence ? This was the lesson our starving poverty wanted . . .

Shores in sight of each other in a warm climate , make boat-builders ; and whenever we find a coast broken up into bays and harbors , we find an instant effect on the intellect and industry of the people . ' On the seashore the play of the Atlantic with the coast ! What wealth is here ! Every wave is a fortune , one thinks of Etzlers and great projectors who will yet turn all this waste strength to account : what strength and fecundity , from the sea-monsters , hugest of animals , to the primary forms of which it is the immense cradle , and the phosphorescent infuso- 1 Here followed the description of the sea written by Mr. Emmen as he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so metrical that it needed tort a few verbal changes to become the poem Sea-Shore. ry Li fc ries ; ? it is one vast rolling bed of life , and every sparkle is a fish . What freedom and grace with all this might ! Th , seeing so excellent a spectacle is a certificate to the mind that all imaginable good shall yet be realized . The sea is the chemist that dissolves the mountain and the rock ; pulverises old continents , and builds new , ? forever redistributing the solid matter of the globe ; and performs an analogous office in perpetual new transplanting of the races of men over Ilte surface , the Exodus of nations . We may well yield us for a time to its lessons . But the nomad instinct , as I said , persists to drive us to fresh fields and pastures new . Indeed the variety of our moods has an answering variety in the face of the world , and the sea drives us back to the hills . Dr. Johnson said of the Scotch //101111-tains , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dkmissed by nature from her care . " The poor blear-eyed doctor was no poet . Like Charles Lamb , he loved the sweet security of streets . It was said of him that " he preferred the Strand to the Garden of the Hesperides . " But this is not the experience of imaginative men , nor of men with good eyes , and susceptible organizations . For my own part , " says Linnaeus , " I have enjoyed good health , except a slight languor , ? but as soon as I got upon the Norway Alps , I seemed to have acquired a new existence . I felt as if relieved from a heavy burden . Then , spending a few days in the low country of Norway , though without committing the least excess , my languor or heaviness returned .

There is somewhat finer in the sky than we have senses to appreciate . It escapes us , and yet is only just beyond our reach . Is all this beauty to perish ? Where is he who is to save the perfect moment , and cause that this beauty shall not be lost ? Where is he who has senses fine enough to catch the inspiration of the landscape ?

The gulf between our seeing and our doing is a symbol of that between faith and experience .. Our schools and colleges strangely neglect the general education of the eye .

My compassion and I remarked from the hill-top the prevailing sobriety of color , and agreed that russet was the hue of Massachusetts , but on toying this experiment of inverting the view he said , " There is the Campagna ! and Italy is Massachusetts upside down . " The effect is remark-able , and perhaps is not explained .

But there are more insane persons than are called so , or are under treatment in hospitals . The crowd in the cities , at the hotels , theatres , card-tables , the speculators who rush for investment , at ten per cent , twenty per cent , cent per cent , are all more or less mad , ? I need not say it now in the crash of ban kruptcy , ? these point the moral , and persuade us to seek in the fields the health of the mind .

Where is the Norway pine ; where the beech , where the epigeea , the linnica , or sanguinaria , or orchis pulcherrima , or sundew , or Taurus benzoin , or pink huckleberry ? Where trout , woodcocks , wild heeS , pigeons ; where the bittern ( slake 4 river ) can be seen and heard ; where the Wilson 's plover can be seen and heard ? The true naturalist can go wherever woods or waters go ; almost where a squirrel or a bee can go , he can ; and no ism is asked for leave . Sometimes the farmer withstands Lim in crossing his ds. but 1 is to no purpose ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoises . It was their land , before it was his , and their title was precedent . My naturalist knew what was on his land , and the farmer did not , and sometimes he brought them ostentatiously gifts of flowers , fruits , or rare shrubs they would gladly have paid a price for , and did not tell them that he gathered them in their own woods . Moreover the very time at which he used their land and water ( for his boat glided like a trout everywhere unseen ) , was in hours when they were sound asleep . Before the sun was up he went up and down to survey his possessions , and passed onward , and left them , before the second owners , as he called them , were awaked If we should now say a few words on the advantages that belong to the conversation with Nature , I might set them so high as to make it a religious duty . " I ' is the greatest use and the greatest beauty . T is the lesson we were put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every fact of Nature we know . Ind the study of them awakens the like truth and elegance in the student . One thing , the lover of nature can not tell the best thing he knows . . . . What alone possesses interest for us is the natural of each man . This is that which is the saliency , or principle of levity , the antagonist of matter and gravitation , and as good as they . This is forever a surprise , and engaging , and lovely . We ca n't be satiated with knowing it , and about it . It is related to the purest of the As Thoreau was still living , 111r . Emerson did not name in these paragraphs his invaluable g , uide and friend . world , to gravity , the growlI of grass , and the angles of crystals . Nature speaks to the imagination ; first , through her gra/ I style , ? the hint of immense force and unity which her works convey ; second , because her visible productions and changes are the nouns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible thought . Every new perception of the method and beauty of nature gives a new shock of surprise and pleasure ; and always for this double reason : first because they are so excellent in their primary fact , as frost , or cloud , or fire , or animal ; and , secondly , because we have an instinct that they express a grander law . ' 1 ' is not easy to say again what Nature says to us . But it is the best part of poetry , merely to name natural objects well . A farmer 's boy finds delight in reading the verses under the Zodiacal vignettes in the Almanac . What is the merit of Thom-son 's Seasons but copying a few of the pictures out of this vast book into words , without a hint of what they signify , and the best passages of great poets , old and new , are often simple enumerations of some features of landscape . And , as malt is the object of nature , what we study in nature is man . " I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc not to be imposed upon by the apparatus and the nomenclature of the physiologist . Agassiz studios year after year fishes and fossil anatomy of saurian , and lizard , and pterodactyl . But whatever he says , we know very well what he means . He pretends to be only busy with the foldings of the yolk of a turtle 's egg . I can see very well what he is driving at ; he means men and women . He talks about lizard , shell-fish and squid ; he means John and Mary , Thomas and Ann . For nature is only a mirror in which man is reflected colossally . Swedenborg or Behmen or Plato tried to decipher this hieroglyphic , and explain what rock , what sand , what wood , what fire signified in regard to man . They may have been right or wrong in any particulars of their interpretation , but it is only our ineradicable belief that the world answers to man , and part to part , that gives any interest in the subject . If we believed that nature was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls wandering in the Universe were shipwrecked , we should think all exploration of it frivolous waste of time . No , it is bone of our bone , flesh of Our flesh , made of us , as we of it . External nature is only a half . The geology , the astronomy , the anatomy , are all good , but ' t is all a half , and ? enlarge it by astronomy never so far remains a half . It requires a will as perfectly organised , ? requires matt . Astronomy is a cold , desert science , with all its pompous figures , ? depends a little too much on the glass-grinder , too little on the mind . ' T is of no use to show us more planets and systems . We know already what matter is , and more or less of it does not signify . Ile can dispose in his thought of more worlds , just as readily as of few , or one . It is his relation to one , to the first , that imports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world and man , man is by much the largest half .

Matter , how immensely SOCNTr. larged by the telescope , remains the lesser half . The very science by which it is shown to you argues the force of Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as man knows himself as its interpreter , knows that nature and lie are from our source , and that he , when humble and obedient , is nearer to the source , then all things fly into place , then is there a rider to the horse , an organized will , then nature has a lord .
