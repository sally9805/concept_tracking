BENTON says that when he has worked long enough and accomplished all the duties of maintenance that are pressing , and is very tired , he expects to get sonic kind of a job to cooperate with small children in the pursuit of happiness . I do n't know where he expects to find this em ? employment . A place as toy-mender to a child 's hospital might suit him . Or by the time he is ready to rest he may have grandchildren enough to afford him suit ? able society . Ills aspiration , whether he fulfils it or not , is a sound and nat ? ural one , entirely proper to a man of soldierly spirit , who wants , not only to earn a place on the retired list , but to like the place when he gets it . Moreover , it shows his capacity to appreciate that as childhood is the door through which we come into the workaday world of matter of fact , so it remains always a dour through which those to whom it opens can escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . That childhood is such a door must be one reason for the softening of spirit that often comes at the end of a hard day from the mere sight of children , or , better still , from the touch and talk of them . The littler they are , the better , because farther removed from the world that is ours , and deeper placed in their own world . A good baby radiates peace . Every ore who is rightly constituted smiles at the sight of it . Children play ? ing in the street soothe the mind . pro ? vided it is a suitable street where trolley-ears do not run nor automobiles ravage , That the street is a good place for chil ? dren can hardly be maintained , but there are many streets in great cities which are good places to observe them , because there are so many children to be seen , and an experience based en observa ? tions made in the most populous streets of New York is that children , even in an environment so far from ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person would expect . They are busy , they are cheerful , as a rule they seem to he kind to one another . They are not bored , and unless the weather is in ? sufferable , or they are sick , they are not depressed . With a pavement to play on and plenty of playmates most of them arc happy , and are cheering in the im ? pression they make upon a sympathetic observer . That . is because of the wonder ? ful power children have to make their Own world and live in it . They do not see with grown-up eyes , nor judge by grown-up standards . They have no large experience of life and places out of which to make comparisons . The place where they are and which they know , be it street and tenement , farm or palace ? that is the world to them , and they accept it without questioning and get what they can out of it . What philosophers ! What heroes ! Is it strange that the attitude of an moor ? verted child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children as com ? panions lies in the breadth of their tolerations . They are easy to please , agreeable to most propositions , and not very critical . The very pith of success ? ful companionship is a consensus of de ? sires . It . is not hard to get children to do what you want them to if you are ready to do it with them . With fairly good leadership they are ready for most any adventure , provided they have not tried it before and condemned it . But they have not tried very many things , and have condemned very few . None of the natural objections of grown ? ups to suggested adventures have weight with therm They are not afraid of crowds , or rain , or of being bored , or of getting tired . They are not daunted beforehand by details , nor have they ob ? stinate preferences as to methods and routes . They do nut " know better " : that one of their delightfulest traits . There ere are such a lot of grown-ups whose " knovr-betters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be any fun . Chil- dren will trust you , and that is one of the moat gratifying compliments pos ? sible . You can have your own way about things if you are judicious in choosing it , and can follow out your own whims nod exercise an undisputed judgment . Being judicious about choosing your own way consists in finding out what the chil ? dren want to do . or will probably like to do , and doing as nearly that thing as circumstances and the limitations of childhood 's strength and the rompunc ? tiona of grown-up judgment will permit . And in the company of children yen have relief from considering what will pay . The things that they do and pre ? fer to do , do not pay as a rule except in the doing of them . Children can he helpful and be happy in helpfulness and profit by it . There is useful work that children can do that is good for them to do ? details of farm-work in the country . details of housework anywhere . So to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worth helping . But the business of making children useful ! nay so easily be overdone , that the re ? straint of it is a constant subject of legislation , or of efforts to get legislation , all over the country , and after proper laws are made it still requires incessant watchfulness to keep them enforced . The great business of a child is to grow up , gathering due development of mind and character as well as of body while it is about it . The value of a child 's labor is insignificant compared with the value of its time if wisely bestowed in growing up . There are a thousand profitable things that children , even very small ones . can do if they are put to it . They can be made horribly useful , under compulsion , from the time they are about seven years old . By no means let any such mis ? chance befall them . Be wary of setting tanks for them . Their instinctive pref ? erence for play that is untainted by ma ? terial profit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them make scrap-books , scrap-books that take hours and days in the making and that are good for noth ? ing when made . Our modern world VOL CI TV.  - -  yo. 679. - 11 abounds enormously in excellent scrap ? book material . The advertising sections of the magazines yield illimitable spoil to the scissors and paste-pot of childhood , and incidentally bring developing minds into close and rapturous touch with contemporary people and contemporary merchandise . To get them in touch with nature there are few things so good as a running brook . Ever so small a brook will do if only it runs , for every running stream is water-power , and that is a live playmate , that can be dammed , diverted . and waded in day after day and week after week . And in the winter it freezes and in the spring it has floods . It came from somewhere and it goes somewhere , and it can be followed both ways . It is hard to beat a brook as a plaything for children . And the sea is another great plaything for children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight to grow , to pick , to paint , or to imitate in paper . The scrap-books will find their way back to the paper-mill , the brook will run on forever , unimproved by the children , the flowers will wither , and the sea will wipe out the sand forts ; but from all these playtime employments and associations the child will get a benefit that never will perish . Out of school the most important busi ? ness of young children is play , and the busier they are about it the better . Lucky for them if a large part of their early lives is spent away from the great cities , with their cramped quarters , and air that is too much used to be good for young lungs . Happily the material things that are most important to childhood are neither dear nor scarce . Simple food is fairly abundant in this country . Outside of the largest cities clean air is easily come by . The necessary clothes are cheap . and elementary education is within the reach of almost all American children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tho rarest of all the advantages that children profit by . Wise elders who are qualified to train the mind of a child are pretty scarce . The next best thing is the elder who is wise enough to respect the child 's mind , and give it a chance to develop in a sympathetic atmosphere by its own natural processes .
