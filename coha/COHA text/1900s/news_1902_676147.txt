txt The state board of charities ran against a snag yesterday in formulating its report of the Kankakee insane asylum investigation . Before the board met , J. Mack Tanner announced the work would take an hour . After an all day session the report was not completed , and the time for making it public was set for next week . It appeared during the discussion that Judge Gibbons was not as pliable as had been hoped , and demanded several concessions before he would agree to sign the report . Iu the meantime the executive committee of the Protective Agency for Women and Children held a meeting during the morning and indorsed a report made to it by Mrs. Anna Lowell Greely , its first vice president , and Maud Parcells , its agent , who represented it at the asylum investigation . Calls It a Whitewash . ? This report , in holding the asylum manager responsible for the birth of children - in the asylum , scored the state board of charities for the manner in which the investigation was conducted , saying : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ptirpose of investigating alleged abuses were astonishing to us : " On account of the absolute indifference displayed , by the majority of the board as to the existence of abuses ; " . On account of its resolute determination to exclude evidence where it was possible to do so on any technical ground ; " On account of Its apparent intention from the first to find no fault with the management of the hospital and to make as little as might be of any damaging evidence which could not be set aside . " There was a manifest disposition to doubt the motives of all witnesses giving adverse testimony and a readiness to accept any suggestion ' that they had left the institution under a cloud . .. is difficult to discriminate between the state board of charities and the trustees of the asylum because of their evident sympathy and harmony of purpose . " Gibbons Firm on Retirement . Before the meeting of the state board of charities at the Great Northern hotel in the morning a strong effort was made by members of the board to discredit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . The judge , however , personally vouched for the correctness of the report , saying he probably Would quit the board when his judicial duties begin , in about two weeks . " You will not quit until the asylum inquiry is completed ? " was asked of him . " No , " was the answer . " I will not quit under fire . " J. Mack Tanner " Explains . " During the afternoon J. Mack Tanner declared that the reason Miss Julia Lathrop had resigned from the board was because she had been disappointed In not securing office . " It was not because she objected to me individually as secretary of the board , but because she wanted the place for herself , " said he . When Miss Lathrop was told of this last evening she laughed and said : " I am afraid I can not dignify's() ridiculous a story by taking the trouble to deny It .. " Long and Lively Session . The precise terms of the report which Tanner is credited with having brought to Chicago with him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board kept their deliberations well to themselves , but it is safe to say that the meeting was a lively one and that Judge Gibbons was the objecting member . The " hour " which Tanner had given the board to do its work stretched into three , then a recess was taken and later there was another long session . Jayne Sneaks for the Board . In the evening President Jayne said : " We have agreed on a skeleton of a report , but it will have to be written out and submitted to the members and the governor for their approval before it can be made public . That will probably be some time next week . " 2 , ate , / tz - the rho rn star of President Jayne said : " In the main it will be favorable to the management of the institution . We will , however , submit some recommendations for improvements where we consider them necessary . Forrinstance , we will try and make it impossible in the future for children to be born in the asylum . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent assessments ? " was asked . " We do not understand any political assessments were levied , " said Mr. Jayne . " There may have been some voluntary contributions , but there is no harm in people contributing for the benefit of either their party or their religion . " Forecast of the Report . As nearly as can be gathered the report Will acknowledge the truth of the charges of child births In the institution , and , while criticising the management which allowed it , will-be severe in doing It . It also will be recommended that stricter regulations be enforced in allowing attendants to have keys to the store rooms and medicine chests . It is expected the report will not acknowledge absblutely the truth of the charges of drunkenness among the at . tendants . It also is reported that in deference to the wishes of Judge Gibbons a recommendation will be made for the appointment of a state board of control for all the charitable Institutions of the state , on the lines mapped out by Judge Gibbons in THE TR/HUNE. yester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital is expected , . and , in the matter Of the control of patient= ? . their care and the food given them  --  the re= port probably will be laudatory . During the entire day 's session much attention was paid to Judge Gibbons by the other members of the board . Insley Moore being absent , He was entreated not to resign and it was suigested that if he had any fault to find with the report it would be modiAdvises Vlore Safeguards . The report of the officers Or the rro.eccrso Agency for Women and Children , approved by the executive committee of that organization , confines itself to the treatment of female patients in the asylum . After the arraignment of the rotate board of charities as to its manner of conducting the investigation , the report says : " With reference to the two unfortunate women to whom babies were horn while they were In the charge of the hospital it was shown that in the case of Lena Dystra she had an Illegitimate child before she was sent to Kankakee. and In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parole system , which is considered to be the best for the greater number of patients . " We would suggest that , as it was known to the authorities in the first case that the ; woman had fallen , she should either have been discharged if , as it is claimed , she was not a fit subject for the hospital , or if she were allowed to remain she should have been so protected that no further harm could have come to her . " Instead of this she was put to work in a kitchen with men and women , in connection with which there are large closets used in common by the two sexes . Parole System at Fault . " As to the second case , the parole system Is admitted to be of value as a curative agent . Under this system such patients as are considered trustworthy are allowed to be at large unattended in the hospital grounds but must report at meals and be in at 7 in the evening . One-half of the grounds is for the use of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , is all that divides the two halves , and there is only one policeman whose duty it is to keep order in the grounds . " Fanny Cannon was working during the day at the residence of the superintendent , and it was due to the negligence of the housekeeper , whO was supposed to take her back to the ward when she was detained after hours . But she returned alone at S in the evening . The man whom she met was also a patient , and is said to have been on his way to one of the entertainments given by the patients . But that he should have been alone an hour after his parole was over indicates negligence in enforcing the rules of the parole " Such accidents should be absolutely impossible , and surely means can be devised by which the patients of both sexes can have the benefit of the parole system with no perannosr Need of Worthy Attendants . The necessity of having a good class or attendants also is insisted on in the report , which continues : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the asylum realize how entirely Its inmates are dependent on and at the mercy of the attendants . We have been told that a not uncommon punishment has been to transfer a patient from a comparatively well ward to one where the cases are more violent , sometimes only for one day . " The report cites cases where it- seemed to the visitors that patients were unnecessarily and unduly restrained , and especial stress is laid on the fact that in many cases male attendants have keys to female wards . " We hold , " concludes the report , " that female patients should never be put to work with men , ? whether patients or employes . The only real safety lies in the complete i.nln thin of the sexes .
