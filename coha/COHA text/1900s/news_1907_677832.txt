txt PART-MAMENT AND CONGRESS . The discovery that it would be int:practica.ble to assemble Congress ' take action upon financial matters ' happened to coincide with current telegrams showing how this difficulty would be obviated in England . Accord-:log to the cablegram : - Although a royal proclamation was issued yesterday announcing that Parliaznent was further prorogued from Not . 16 to Dec , there will be another proclamation issued before the latter date . : Parliament Is not expected to reassemble until Jan. 29 . It thus appears that Parliament had notice both of the time when it might be required to meet , if necessary in thb ; public interest , and also of the later date to which adjournment would be made if nothing required the session to be held . Parliament was ' thus held aln-ays in hand , and there was no such dilemma as would have confronted the President in case he had wished to loummon Congress . The difference is that in England the Wine of assembling Parliament is matter of discretion , while Congress meets , upon dates set by law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session . The British method designed to guard against those unexpected things which are sure to hap4pen , according to the proverb . There would be no difficulty about summon ing a. special session for anything anticipated , but emergencies are not as well guarded against as in the British . manner . Our method of adjournment also is ? awkward , for each Congress expires by law at a fixed date . For weeks pre ' ceding there is a rush of legislation , and intriguing for precedence upon a : calendar which expires at the fateful . noon . So awkward is this that the session is frequently prolonged by the : expedient of stopping the official clock . until the condition of the calendar suite the committee in charge . The aseeml. bling of Congress is also regulated in a manner open to criticism . The law ? fixes it for the second December after tie : th.e-election . The passage of a year and a traction , ' : : betwein election and the meeting of Congress results in such an anomaly as Is now witnessed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representatives a year ago . But every one who follows public affairs at all knows ? that the Issues which will press upon Congress when it meets are not those of the election so many months now past . The result is that there is no popular mandate , and no way of getting a popular mandate , upon such matters as those now uppermost in public attention . If our financial flurry had happened in the October before the Congressional elections , and a Congress had been elected with refereinceteto the policy to be adopted to amend such conditions , it would not have met regularly , and could not even have been summoned in special session , until the previously elected and existing Congress had held its final session When there was no telegraph , and travel was by stage coach , there might have been some reason ! or this . But it would seem that it would now be a good plan , could It be arranged , for Congress to meet say on the New Year 's next following election in November .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
