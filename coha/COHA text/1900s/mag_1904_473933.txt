AT the present day one meets occasionally in newspapers such a locution as " he would better do so and so . " It is of course not absolutely impossible that this corruption may come in time to be accepted as proper ; for the users of our speech have more than once accomplished feats fully as difficult . Now , however , it is as ungrammatical as it is unidiomatic . What the one who employs it really says  - -  going on the assumption that he says anything ? is that he would do so and so better than something else . What he is trying to say is that it would be better for him to do so and so instead of something else . A locution of this sort is the invention of the purists in speech , ? who , it is quite needless to remark , are beings essentially distinct from the pure in speech . In every period are to be found persons who can never be sincerely happy unless they can parse every word of every expression they use . To their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing that they constantly come across it , or locutions like it , in the writings of great authors ? never so often , indeed , as of late years . This fact satisfies the ordinary man ; it does not satisfy them . Before they are willing to accept authority for any idiom , it must be reconciled to their reason ? or what they choose to call their reason . If in this they fail , they are ready to sacrifice sense to any method of expression which they fancy to be consistent with grammar . Hence has originated the substitution of would better for had better . This latter is not the only locution of the sort which has fallen under censure . There is a similar one contained in a favorite text of the Bible which has excited as much grammatical heart-burning as various other texts of that book have theological . " I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness , " says the Psalmist . It is fair to observe in behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the explanation of it does not lie on the surface . It presents a very genuine difficulty which has perplexed generations of men . The hostility to it is in consequence no new thing . To many lexicographers and grammarians in the past it has been both a stumbling-block and an offence . Further , though its nature had been previously pointed out , no exhaustive study of its exact character and early history was ever made until nearly a quarter of a century ago . Then the task was accomplished by Fitzedward Hall , who so effectually demolished the myths pertaining to the junction of the particle to with the infinitive . Accordingly , in telling the story of these locutions , much that is said here is based primarily upon the results of his investigations and upon the materials he collected . There have existed and still exist in our tongue three idioms of essentially this same character . They are had liefer ( or liefer ) , had rather , and had better . The order in which they have been mentioned is the order in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be said that none of them goes back to the earliest period of the speech . At that time the regular expression for the first of these locutions which presented itself was made up of the comparative of lief , " dear , " the dative of the personal pronoun , and the preterite subjunctive of the substantive verb . Instead of I had liefer , men said me were liefer ? that is , " it would be dearer to me . " The words are modernized , nor was this the order in which they always appeared ; but essentially it is the original idiom . It was towards the close of the thirteenth century that had tiefer followed by a verb made its first recorded appearance in the language . Once established it came rapidly into extensive use . No reader of Chaucer needs to be told how frequently it is to be met in his pag . Nor is his practice in employing it different from that of his contemporaries and immediate successors . For about two hundred years this particular locution may be said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in literature of all sorts . But about the middle of the fifteenth century a rival idiom sprang up . It conveyed the same idea with the use of a different word . This was had rather . The newcomer did not expel had liefer speedily . As a matter of fact it never has entirely . But it steadily encroached upon the frequency of its employment . Though the two expressions lasted side by side for at least a century , the later form not only pushed gradually the earlier one from its supremacy , but finally drove it almost entirely from literary use . The practice of Shakespeare may be said to indicate the fortune which in his time had overtaken the supplanted and supplanting idioms . Had rather is found in his plays scores of times , had liefer not once . Practically , therefore , after the sixteenth century this particular locution had died out of the language of literature . It can , indeed , he found employed in it occasionally . Even in our own clay it is not altogether disused . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; but as a general rule , when it now occurs , it is either put in the mouths of the imeducated or is the conscious adoption of an archaism . In this latter respect the effort made by Tennyson to revive the idiom is worthy of mention . As early as 1842 he had made use of the archaic combination of lief and dear in the " Morte d'Arthur " ; but it was not until his later writings that he introduced had liefer . The first instance of its occurrence is in the Idyls of the King , which came out in 1859 . Twice does Enid employ it in the poem which goes under her name . Her first use of it is where she says that , compared with having her lord suffer shame through his love to her , Far liever bad I gird his harness on him . But Tennyson 's course seems , up to this time , to have found few imitators . Decay has overtaken the expression . There has probably never been a period in which it has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in literature its day has lung been gone . Had rather is therefore the lineal successor of had liefer , or , strictly speaking , its supplanter . The meaning of both is essentially the same . But in. the sixteenth century there began to be employed an analogous , though not a rival , locution . This was had better . An example of it has been cited from a poem of the fifteenth century ; but even if no doubt exists of its appearance then , it did not come into general use until a good deal later . Like liefer , but unlike rather , better had been originally employed with the pronoun and the substantive verb . Me were better ? that is , " it would be better for me " ? was the method of expression which gradually gave way to I had better . It may be remarked in passing that a confusion of these constructions sprang up in the Elizabethan period and became somewhat prevalent . The dative with the substantive verb was sometimes replaced by the nominative . Hence we find such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were better love a dream . " It was had liefer , however , which pretty certainly furnished the model upon which had better was formed . But the latter was apparently slow in coining into any wide general use . It could not encroach upon the employment of had rather , for it was distinct in meaning ; but for some reason there seems to have been for a long while a reluctance to resort to it . In our version of the Bible it dues not occur . In Shakespeare it is found but once followed by a verb , and that instance belongs to a part of Henry MI. which is now usually ascribed to Fletcher . This condition of things seems to have continued during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . Had better , though employed , was , comparatively speaking , not much employed ; at least this is true if we confine our consideration to the writings of authors of the first rank .. But in the nineteenth century all this was changed . The idiom came to be constantly used in literature , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold upon colloquial speech , began to appear less frequently in written . The change which has taken place in the employment of the two idioms may be indicated by the result of an examination of representative novels of two of the greatest novelists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries respectively . The first is Fielding 's Tom Jones . That work appeared in 1740 . In it had rather occurs just fifteen times . It is used indifferently by characters of every station , including the author himself when speaking in his own person . On the other hand had better is used but twice . Nearly a hundred years later ? in 1818 ? Thackeray 's Vanity Fair was published in book form . In that work had better occurs twenty-three times , while had rather occurs only once , if we leave out of account locutions beginning with contracted and therefore doubtful forms like Pd . The situation had been completely reversed . It may further be added that in neither of these novels , largely representing , as they do , colloquial usage , does had liefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the double comparative ? giving us had lieferer ? is in one instance put in the mouth of an illiterate person . Facts of this sort do not justify the formation of sweeping generalizations . They represent nothing more than an incomplete and necessarily one-sided investigation of usage . Inferences based upon them must therefore always he given subject to correction . Yet it is not likely that fuller examination would yield results essentially different . Certainly all the evidence which has so far ever been adduced points to the conclusion that distinct preference is now exhibited in literature for had better over had rather . Take , as a further illustration of the prevalence of the feeling , Disraeli 's novel of Sybil . This appeared in 1845 . In it the former locution occurs thirteen times , the latter not once . It is no difficult matter to explain the present comparative infrequency in literature of had rather , once so much more common than had better . The place of the former can be easily taken in most instances by would rather . This latter locution bad appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . It consequently preceded had rather ; furthermore , it had always existed alongside of it , and had generally been interchangeable with it . If less idiomatic , it served the purpose well enough to be adopted by the timid as soon as the outcry against the assumed ungrammatical character of the almost synonymous expression made itself distinctly noticeable . This first began to be heard in the second half of the eighteenth century . From that time on the use of had rather became less frequent in the literary speech . But the case is different with had better . In no such easy way could men escape from the employment of that locution . Would rather says , even if sometimes imperfectly , just what it means ; would better is forced to have a sense imposed upon it in order to mean anything at all . The use of it is so distinctly repugnant to our idiom , not to call it absolutely improper , that , when met with , it is apt to provoke a cry of pain from him who has been nurtured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be stated positively where and when would better came first to be employed ; but the vogue it has now , such as it is , it owes largely to the influence and example of Walter Savage Lander . We may entertain what view we choose of that author 's style ; but there can hardly be two opinions , among those who have studied the subject , as to the value of his pronouncements upon points of usage . In his observations upon language no man of equal abilities ever surpassed him in the combination of limited knowledge of the facts with unlimited wrong-headedness in drawing conclusions from them . In the hostility he entertained towards had better , of the origin of which he adopted and repeated an entirely erroneous account , he resorted on more than one occasion to the use of the inadequate and improper would better . Nor did he stop with this . Lander had always the courage of his perversities . In his devotion to what he fancied correctness he was capable of writing had better left for had better have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of grammar ; but perhaps none can be found that equals this in defiance of the English idiom . In consequence of the modern wide use of had better and the partial avoidance of had rather , there are those who think that the latter is destined to undergo the same fate as had liefer ; that while it will continue to be heard in colloquial speech , it will disappear from literary . But this is altogether improbable . There may be variation in the extent of the employment of the locution at particular times and by particular persons . That is something , however , quite distinct from its abandonment . Had liefer had died out of general literary use before literature had had full opportunity to exert its preserving influence . For the great agency which prevents the decay and death of words and idioms is their employment by a large number of writers of the highest grade . Such authors always continue in fashion ; they are always read and studied and imitated . Hence they give enduring vitality to the forms of expression which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past had rather is found almost universally ; in some of them it is found very frequently . Their employment of the locution is certain in consequence to keep it alive ; its concurrent employment in the colloquial speech will keep it vigorous . The most determined efforts directed against it for a century and a half have failed to displace it from the usage of the educated . With the fuller knowledge now possessed of its origin and character these efforts are sure in process of time to be abandoned altogether . It accordingly remains now to explain its exact nature and to recount some of the various views entertained about it . It is clear from what has been said that during the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries men were in the habit of using had rather , and to a less extent had better , with no thought at all of the peculiar character of these locutions . They accepted them , as they did many other idioms , without seeking to understand them . It was enough for them that they found them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in good use in the past . But there always comes a period in the history of a cultivated language when it begins to be studied for itself as well as for what it contains . The vehicle is to some of full as much importance as the material it conveys . Points of linguistic propriety , which at all times have interest for the few , begin now to be discussed by the many . In English this feeling first made itself distinctly manifest in the second half of the eighteenth century . Grammars and dictionaries than took up to some extent the question of usage . Manuals made their appearance instructing us as to the expressions we ought to avoid . It was inevitable that an idiom of the peculiar nature of had rather should attract attention . It was not understood in the least ; and idioms not understood , like men in the same situation , are sure to be misunderstood . At the outset , accordingly , to mention this particular locution was usually to misrepresent it and to censure it . The analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature ; had better was comparatively little employed . The brunt of the attack fell consequently upon had rather . There are two persons who are deserving of particular mention in connection with the early criticism of this idiom . Attention is due to the one because of his influence upon English lexicography , and i.e the other because of his influence over later grammarians . It was in 1755 that Dr. Johnson brought out the dictionary which goes under his name . No previous work of the nature , so far as I can discover , contained even an allusion to the locution under discussion . Their compilers either did not have their attention called to it or chose to refrain from committing themselves upon a matter which they were unable to comprehend . It is certainly not referred to in the dictionaries of either Dyche or Bailey , the two works of this kind which were in widest use before the appearance of Johnson 's . It would have been no injury either to the truth or to his own reputation had Johnson preserved the same reticence as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one under have , and the other under rather . The fifth definition which he gave of the verb was " to wish , to desire in a lax sense . " Two passages were cited to exemplify the meaning , and of these one was the text of the Psalms previously quoted . Under rather he defined to have rather as meaning " to desire in preference . " " This is , I think , " was his added coinwent , " a barbarous expression of late intrusion into our language , for which it is better to say will rather . " In these remarks Johnson not only showed ignorance ? which , considering the time he wrote , was pardonable ? hut he displayed obtuseness , which is not a characteristic he was wont to exhibit . Still , he was addressing a generation even more unintelligent in this matter than himself . It is therefore not particularly surprising that these almost ridiculous statements should have been approved by several later lexicographers ; that Sheridan , for instance , a quarter of a century afterwards , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had rather is a bad expression which ought to be replaced by will rather . The other writer alluded to was Robert Lowth , who died in 1787 as bishop of London . in 1762 he brought out a small work entitled A Short Introduction to English Grammar . Lowth was a man of ability and an eminent scholar in many fields ; though it is well to remark here that English scholarship , as we understand it , can hardly be said to have existed in his day . Accordingly , while he knew a great deal more than his predecessors of the historical development of our grammatical forms , what he knew was not itself a very great . deal . The consequence was that though he corrected some misstatements and removed some misapprehensions , he added both misapprehensions and misstatements of his own . It is a question , indeed , whether in the long run he did not ? do more harm than good . For T.owth was perhaps the first person , and certainly the first person of any recognized learning and ability , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed mistakes of usage in the writings of eminent authors . Undoubtedly there is some justification for the course . Every great writer is liable , through haste or carelessness , or even at times through ignorance , to commit errors . But the difficulty with those who assume the office of critic is that in nine cases out of ten the so-called errors they fancy they find are not errors of the author in violating good usage , but errors of the censor arising from lack of knowledge of what good usage actually is . T.nwth was no exception to this general rule . In the original edition of 1762 he had nothing to say of the particular locution here under consideration . But in a later one he took notice of it . He found it by no means reducible to any grammatical construction . He then proceeded to account for its origin , and promulgated the theory that it almost certainly sprang from a mere blunder . The proper form was I would rather . This had been contracted into I 'd rather , and then erroneously expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had crept into the language . This precious piece of etymology , for which there is not the slightest justification in fact , became during a good share of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries a common , not to say the common , explanation of the origin of the locution . From Lowth 's day down to Landor 's it was fairly certain to be dragged into the discussion of the idiom by every one who objected to it . In truth , it was for so long time an accepted solution of the difficulty the expression presented that it is not unlikely that it may be found lingering still in sonic quarters , in spite of the not infrequent exposure which has been made of its falsity . In this country particularly it was adopted in the early editions of Webster 's Dictionary ? it has been discarded from the later ones ? and owing to the great circulation of that work , was spread far and wide . From Worcester , too , it received a quasi-support . In England , however , grammarians and lexicographers were , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . question of the propriety of the locution . This is true in particular of the early ones . Some of them clearly refrained from saying anything about it because they knew not . what to say . On the one side was the adverse decision of the great literary autocrat of the times . On the other , they could not fail to observe that . the expression had been regularly used by the best writers ; and that even Dr. Johnson himself , four years after the denunciation of it in his dictionary , had fallen , during a temporary lapse into the English idiom , into the employment of it in his Rasselas . " I had rather hear thee than dispute , " says the prince to Indae , in the course of that not altogether exciting narrative . Men of literary eminence , indeed , were not often likely to display hostility towards a locution which they themselves were in the habit of using consciously or unconsciously . In this matter the practice of English authors has been generally much more creditable than the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism of the idiom to be made without entering any protest . Men have in consequence been led to assume that the censure of it has not been questioned because it can not be questioned . Take as an illustration of too frequent comment the remark of Mrs. Orr , in her life of Robert Browning . She quoted a passage from a letter of his in which he used the expression " I had better say . " Then she informs us that 11r . Browning would have been very angry with himself if he had known that he ever wrote I had better . If he did not know that he had written it , he was inexcusably ignorant of his own poetry . Assuredly if he took pains to make himself familiar with that , he would have been furnished with several opportunities for being angry with himself for using both had better and had rather . It seems , indeed , rarely to occur to purists that an expression which is heard everywhere from the lips of cultivated men , which has also , as authority for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our speech , must have justification for its existence , even if they can not comprehend what that justification is . In such cases we are hound to accept on faith , even if sight be denied . But in this instance sight is not denied . That the idiom in question is in accordance with the requirements of the most exacting syntax an analysis of any one of the three locutions specified , wherever it occurs , shows conclusively . Let us take , for example , the had rather be of the text from the Psalms which has been already given , and subject to examination each one of its constituent parts . In regard to the first of these three words two things are to be taken into consideration ? its grammatical character and its meaning . At the outset it is to be observed that had is here not an auxiliary , but an independent verb . Furthermore , it is in the past tense of the subjunctive mood and not of the indicative . The use of this subjunctive form has never died out , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . Yet , if in later times its employment has become more restricted , it can not be called uncommon , especially in conditional sentences . in the raising of Lazarus described in the Gospel of John , both Mary and Martha are represented as saying to Christ , " Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . " " But for delays of the press he had had this answer some months ago , " wrote the great scholar Bentley . So Byron represents the pirates , at the close of their song in " The Corsair , " when deploring the fate of their comrades , as exclaiming , while they divide the spoil , How had the brave who fell exulted now ! It is needless to multiply illustrations . In fact , the instances where had is thus employed , though not common in colloquial speech like would have or should have , are so frequent that its occurrence creates no ambiguity and causes no surprise . As regards the meaning of the verb in this particular locution , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word have , which is to hold a material thing in one 's hands , underwent a natural extension to holding a conception in the mind . Hence it came to mean " account , " " esteem , " " consider , " " regard " ; to signify , in fact , the idea which is often expressed by the word hold itself . In this respect it has gone through precisely the same course of development as the Latin habere , and the corresponding verbs in various other languages . In English- it remains no unfamiliar usage . The phrases " had in reverence , " " had in contempt " ? for the verb of which we might substitute held ? are heard not infrequently , and do not strike us at all peculiar . Combining , therefore , what is implied by the grammatical form and the meaning , the I had of I had rather be can be exactly represented in ordinary English by " I would hold , or deem . " So much for the first word ; now comes the second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both the adverb rathe , meaning " quickly , " " early , " and the corresponding adjective rath , ( e ) . The positive forms of each practically died out long ago . When they appear now , they appear as archaisms ; indeed , Milton 's " rathe primrose that forsaken dies " is the one passage which has made the word familiar to most modern ears . Further , the comparative rather , while common as an adverb , is hardly known with us as an adjective . It is , in truth , to the particular idiom under consideration that it is now almost entirely restricted . There is but little difficulty in tracing the development of meaning which took place . Rather strictly signifies " quicker , " " earlier . " But when a man wishes to have something more speedily than something else , it is generally safe to say that he has for it a distinct preference . Accordingly , the transition from the sense of " quicker " into that of " more desirable , " " preferable , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made we know outside of this particular idiom ; but here it has found its regular manifestation . It follows that I hod rather is precisely equivalent to " I would ( or should ) hold more desirable ( or preferable ) . " An it might be inserted between the verb and the adjective , to denote the following clause ; but it is not necessary , and is here omitted , as in several other like phrases . We come finally to the last word , be . This is not only an infinitive , but . it is now invariably the pure infinitive . Originally , however , it was not such in all cases . In the earlier period the sign to frequently accompanied it , as it did also the infinitive when following had lieter and had better . There was a good deal of variation in the use of this particle . When the sentence contained two clauses , each with an infinitive of its own , to sometimes preceded the first verb and was omitted before the second . More frequently it was omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that of the second . The former construction is seen in the following lines , with modernized orthography , from Chaucer : Liefer I had to dien on a knife Than thee offende. true dear ? wife . The other mode is exemplified in the text of the Psalms now under examination . But while both these practices existed , the preferred one was to drop the to altogether . In process of time this became the exclusive one , as we find it to-day . As a result of this analysis , the passage of Scripture in which had rather be is found can be legitimately paraphrased , so as to exhibit clearly the grammatical character and construction of that idiom . This done , it would read as follows : " I would hold ( or deem ) it more desirable ( or preferable ) to be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness . " An explanation essentially similar is true of any sentence in which the archaic had liefer occurs . Had better , however , stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has regularly the sense of obligation which does not belong to it , as found in the other two locutions . To have to do a thing , implying that it is a matter of duty or of policy to do it , and not one of mere inclination , is a usage of the word which has existed from an early period and is current to-day , at least in colloquial speech . It is this which is found in had better , and it is this which makes it impossible to substitute for it would better . One further observation remains to be made in connection with an idiom of this general nature . In the three examples of it which have been considered , lief el. , rather , and better are , as we have seen , not adverbs , but adjectives . This is also true of the superlative best in had beet , and of the positives good and lief in the expressions had as good and had as lief . The last-named locution maintained itself in usage after had liefer had died out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of its youth . But in all these phrases the words have seemed and still seem to the popular apprehension not adjectives , but adverbs . Especially is the observation true of had rather . With this feeling on the part of the users of speech , it could he predicted with certainty that adverbs would be resorted to and not adjectives , if any new locutions were formed in imitation of the old ones . Such a result has shown itself in the extension of the idiom which has taken place . In our later speech we find had sooner , had as soon , and had as welt employed , and the first two in particular have come to be used extensively . About the propriety of employing these there is some chance for controversy ; in the ease of the others there is really none .
