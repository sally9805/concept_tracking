THERE is no epic like the making of a state . Beneath the hard , homely , even repulsive details of pioneer life are hidden all heroisms , all sacrifices , all achievements . The ox team , the flatboat , the prairie schooner , and the log cabin will some day become invested with the halo of the Golden Fleece , and they will be far nobler historically , because the symbols of a grander epoch . In this age of railway and telegraph we do not appreciate the period of the pioneers . Immigration has become almost a science at the present day . Whole cities are picked up and moved West bodily . But this period of state-making , is all its railroad swiftness and continental vastness , began with the flatboat and the immigrant train , and these were preceded by the hunter and the explorer . In the space between the first explorers ( six months across the continent ) and the vestibule train , sleepers , dining car , and all ( five days from New York to Seattle ) , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of all that group of states carved out of the majestic wilderness with which this continent faces the mightiest ocean , none now excites a livelier interest than that named for the Father of his Country . But it must be remembered that Washington as a state , even as a settled country , is very young . She was practically unpeopled , except in a few places , twenty-five years ago . She became a state only twelve years ago . Her heroic age was as a part of Old Oregon Territory . Glance at a map of that lordly domain marked Oregon , Washington , and Idaho . A land of thrilling and romantic history , of scenic grandeur and beauty , of pleasant and healthful climate , of rich and varied resources , ? such was Old Oregon Territory , the " Westmost West " of a generation ago . Oregon had her heroes of discovery , ? WASHINGTON . Bodega , Drake , Juan de Fuca , Hereto , Gray , Vancouver , Lewis and Clarke , and many more whose deeds are unrecorded . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKay , McLeod , Day , Wyeth , Bonneville , Smith , McLoughlin , Ross , Meek , ? some of whom have told their own stories , some of whom have found preservation in Irving 's fascinating pages , while many others exist only in the fireside tale . There were also heroes of missions , ? Whitman , Lee , Wilbur , Eells , Spalding , ? whose works follow them . Without doubt the Spanish claim to the Pacific coast by right of discovery was just . But in 1579 came the advance guard of that race whose descendants were destined to deprive the Spaniard of his misused realms in all the western hemisphere . For in that year Francis Drake , boldest and most picturesque of English freebooters , reached Mt . 43 ? , some claim 48 ? , on our western shore . Then , in 1592 , old Juan de Fuca , whether myth or man no one knows , left his name for the strait which now separates Washington from British Columbia , and which lie supposed to be the long-sought Strait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many names of many nations built into our state ; for each bore a part in the great epic . There gradually became evolved from the mass of myth a definite impression that there was somewhere between lat. 43 ? and lat. 47 ? a great river , variously named River of Rings , River of Aguilar , River of the West , Rio San Roque , River Thegayo , and at last the Oregon , so first named by Carver , an American , in 1774 . All felt that the discovery of this river would constitute the best title to possession . In 1792 the mystery was solved ; the Columbia bowed his neck to the foot of civilized man . Three nations had 506 The State of Washington . contributed to the discovery , ? Spain , United States , Great Britain . But we shall probably not be thought too partial if we believe that the shrewd Yankee skipper , Gray , from Boston , in the gallant bark Columbia Rediviva , was the Jason that first set foot on our western Colchis , and delivered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far West . Following the explorers by sea came those by canoe , foot , and horse . After Napoleon , with one of those lightning glances by which he was accustomed to outrun time and forestall destiny , had said that he would help build upon the western hemisphere a maritime power that would sometime humble England ; and after Jefferson and Monroe had , with equal quickness , grasped the transcendent opportunity of the Louisiana purchase , thereby stretching out beyond " the crack of doom " the westward destiny of the United States , there came an eager public interest in our sunset domain ; and in 1804 Lewis and Clarke ascended the Missouri , crossed the " Shining Mountains , " descended the torrents of Snake River , embarked upon the Columbia , and in the autumn drizzle looked through the parted headlands upon the infinite expanse of the sea . In 1811 the first town in Oregon , Astoria , was founded ; and to execute the- designs of its founder , John Jacob Astor , the ill-fated Tonquin and her consort ships rounded Cape Horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trappers , led by the gallant Hunt , crossed the continent , encountering incredible hardships amid the cartons of the Snake , ? " that accursed mad river , " in the imprecatory phrase of the Canadian voyageurs . And now came on apace the second era of the history of Oregon , that of the fur trade . It had started long before . Bering had led Russia into the North Pacific , and in 1771 the first cargo of furs had been transported to China . Then it became known that the waters of Kam ? tchatka joined the China Sea , thence leading to the island empires of the South Sea , and that the same ocean throb of the Aleutian Islands beat against the stormy battlements of Cape Horn . Then first Europe realized the vastness of the Pacific . All nations joined eagerly in search for furs . But England and the United States soon distanced their rivals in Oregon . Then the British Hudson 's Bay and Northwest companies outgeneraled , and finally put out their American competitors ; and after a brief struggle between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands over a dozen degrees of latitude and longitude , and to all appearance Oregon Was destined to be the perpetual home of Indians , trappers , and fur-bearing animals . But through the joint occupation treaties of 1818 and 1826 our nation still retained an interest in Ore . gon , and in 1834 there entered a champion into the lists apparently so puny that the nabobs of the fur trade would have noticed him but to laugh at him , if they had noticed him at all . Yet he was destined to be one of the great epic figures of our history , the Siegfried to deliver the Kriemhild of the American state from the dragons of the desert and the giants of commercial despotism . And this champion of the American state was the American missionary . A strange thing occurred in 1832 . Three Flathead Indians came to St. Louis in search of the " white man 's book which should show them the way to heaven . " The pathetic story reached the churches at that time of profound religious and missionary sentiment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , the Methodists , under Jason Lee , established a mission in the Willamette Valley in 1834 ; and two years later , Marcus Whitman , under commission of the American Board , settled at Walla Walla . In this last man and place there was the destiny of empire , for his mission became the out- The State of post of the American state , the entering , wedge of . American occupation . Of Whitman 's midwinter ride to Washington city in 1842 for the purpose of showing the government the momentous importance of this region to our nation , of the great immigration of 1843 which he led across the Rocky Mountains , and of his martyrdom at the hands of the Indians in 1847 , we can not speak . Suffice it to say that , of many who bore a part in bringing Oregon into the Union , the missionary and martyr , Whitman , must be accorded a foremost place . Hard upon the period of the missionary came the establishment of a provisional government by American settlers in 1843 . Than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wider tribunal of the English and American governments ; very nearly , indeed , to the arbitrament of war . For Oregon became the burning question of two administrations , and " Fifty-four forty or fight ! " was the cry of at least one campaign . Then Caine the treaty of 1846 , by which the parallel of 49 ? became the boundary , and our territorial destiny was secured . We say " secured , " for if the American state - builder had not raised his banner of triumph over Oregon , it is possible that we might have delayed the acquisition of California until too late . But the Tancreds and Godfreys of American emigration had triumphed over the English trader , and , unlike the successors of Tasso 's heroes , we hold what they Won . Such was the heroic age of Oregon . Washington became a separate territory in 1853 . It was a land of magnificent distances . Walla Walla County then included all of what is now eastern Washington , Idaho , and the western third of Montana . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missoula , and it would have taken hint three months to visit the county seat and return . He never qualified . The new territory grew very slowly until 1883 , the // period of railroad - building . Then she sprung into a life that astonished the country , and in 1889 she because a state . And /IOW , with this hurried outline of the ancient epic days , our sketch requires an answer to these two questions : What is the nature of the land thus won from the wilderness and from contending nations , and what are the descendants of the heroes snaking of it ? First , then , what are the resources , actual and potential , of the state of Washington ? Take your map , and note its physical features and the international location , and data for an answer will lie at command . To a person of information and imagination , a map is a picture gallery and encyclopedia combined . Three salient local features are revealed by map , ? Puget Sound , the Cascade Mountains , and the Columbia River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet been written , it is evident that its physical features are the work of fire and water , of volcano and inland sea , of glacier and torrent . The soil , now marvelous for fertility , was made of volcanic dust , covered by the silt of rivers , drained by stupendous erosion , and then covered with the grass and decomposition of ages . When the sky-piercing heads of the Cascades were uplifted they created two climates , and consequently two divisions of natural productions and resources . The oceans of warm vapor from the Pa , rifle , condensed upon the snowy crests of the mountains , pour down their floods upon the western slopes ; giving to that part of the state a soft , humid , and uniform climate , the home of giant trees and succulent grasses . East of the mountains is a land of sunshine , of wheatfield and bunch grass . But all parts of the state are much warmer than the same latitudes on the Atlantic coast . The Japan ocean current sweeps the vast circuit of the Aleutian Islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a growing season nearly 508 The . State of Washington . two months longer than that of New England or the Lake states . With respect to the productive capacity of Washington , accounts so glowing as to excite incredulity have sometimes found their way into the Eastern press , Yet , in truth , the " frozen facts " are more and more enlisting the interest and the industry of shrewd and far-seeing men . The state is not a paradise , and it has its drawbacks ; but the consensus of opinion of capable observers is that it is conspicuous among American states for ability to supply all the needs of civilized man . The great fact is its variety of resources . Substantially every industry possible to a temperate climate is represented here , either actually or potentially . Lumbering , shipbuilding , fishing , dairying , mining of every sort , agriculture , horticulture , fruit-raising , stock-raising of all kinds , manufacturing of every manner of fabrics , utensils , and structures , ? all these industries not only have every natural facility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the utmost variety and fullness of development . The state is naturally divisible into four great zones of geography , climate , and production . The first zone is that of the sea , the Sound , and the Lower Columbia . Here the chief industries are lumbering , fisheries , shipbuilding , and manufacturing , though dairying , gardening , fruit-raising , and hop-growing have a vast field of development . But the timber ! Between the Cascade Mountains and the ocean stand the finest known forests of fir , spruce , pine , cedar , and hemlock . Along the multiplied arms of Puget Sound ( and the Columbia River , Gray 's Harbor , and Shoalwater Bay are similar in character , only less extensive ) , these forests , in close juxtaposition to innumerable water powers and mountains of coal and iron , afford resources for shipping and manufacturing that will some day create here another England . Puget Sound is one vast harbor , in which the navies of all nations might almost be lost . It needs no prophetic eye to see that here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already the biggest sawmill on earth is on Puget Sound , and the yearly output is about a billion and a half feet . Yet the forests are hardly more than scratched . hit the forests of the Great Lakes are giving out . During May of last year , orders for 30,000,000 feet of bridge stuff and ties were placed in Washington by railway companies of the East and Middle West . Most remarkable to Eastern readers is the yield of an acre of Washington timber land . A single acre has been known to produce 500,000 feet , and one tree has yielded 50,000 . It is estimated that within a radius of eight miles from Shemokawa is standing 600,000,000 feet of yellow fir . There is poetry in one of these swaying forests , which carry their coronals of green 300 feet aloft , with the sunlight filtering through greenishly , as if in leafy eclipse ; but there are dollars in the knotless stems when sawed , and of the latter feature only the lumberman thinks . We can not linger to tempt the disciple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block the course of streams , and it must suffice to say of our piscatorial resources that the royal Chinook salmon , noblest of the finny tribes , has furnished yearly , for two decades , upon the Columbia River ( which belongs to Oregon and Washington together ) , from 400,000 to 650,000 cases of his toothsome sides , and probably twice as much more in other forms . Puget Sound formerly yielded about half as much fish as the Columbia , but during the past year considerably exceeded it . Deep-sea fishing promises to rival the fisheries of Newfoundland . The second zone is that of the mountains . Grand , sombre , mysterious , beautiful , sublime , the Cascade Mountains are the repositories of mineral wealth of many kinds , coal , iron , gold , silver , cop- per , ledges of onyx , marble , and granite , hardly touched as yet ; only waiting for capital to develop and bring them into the markets of the world . The third zone , so different from the others that it is hard to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arid centre ; seeming desert , yet blossoming like the rose when touched with water . This borders the Columbia , Snake , and Yakima rivers , with smaller areas on other streams . This is the land of the orchardist and gardener , of the dairyman and hop-grower . We can not speak of the treasures of vine and tree , which the hot sun , the rich soil , and the glad streams cause to drop so bounteously in the valleys of Walla Walla , Yakima , and Wenatchee . Even a picture of a Snake River peach or cherry or apricot or bunch of grapes is tantalizing , and we forbear . The last zone is the eastern border , with long arms on the south and north central . This is the wheat belt , Fringing the snowy chains of the Blue , Bitter Root , Cceur d'Alene , Klikitat , and Badger mountains is an irregular semicircle of rolling prairie , where 40 , 50 , even 60 bushels of wheat to the acre is not uncommon , 100 has been known , while the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union . There are about 14,000 square miles of these wheat lands . The crop for this year will probably be 30,000,000 bushels , worth perhaps $15,000,000 , ? nearly 830 to every man , woman , and child in the state , and doubtless over $100 to every inhabitant in the wheat zone . But the imperial resources of Washington would lie idle were it not for the transportation lines , and in the number and character of these the state is singularly fortunate . There are four transcontinental lines , and , in effect , a fifth . These are the Northern Pacific , Great Northern , Union Pacific , and Canadian , while the Southern Pacific , reaching Portland , is also accessible . Of these lines the Northern Pacific was the great pioneer , and the completion of its line to Wallula in 1883 , and to Tacoma in 1887 , marked an epoch in the history of the state and of the nation . The Northern Pacific and the Washington and Columbia River railroads recently performed the unexampled act of lower ing their passenger rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or people ; being quickly followed by the Great Northern and Union Pacific in the good work . This fact well shows the healthy nature of business and the effect of active competition , as well as a liberal policy on the part of the railroad lines . As a sample of the amount of local work on the new lines of this region we may take a few figures from the Washington and Columbia River Railroad , which is a line connecting the Northern Pacific with the wheat region of Walla Walla and Umatilla counties , the latter being in Oregon . The road has about 160 miles of line , and the population tributary does not exceed 40,000 . Moreover , the Union Pacific traverses most of the same territory , doing about as much business . Yet this line carried in , during 1900 , 40,000 tons of freight , and carried out 150,000 tons . About 130,000 tons was wheat and flour . It carried 2,000,000 grain sacks . Double these figures , to include both roads , and we get some conception of the energy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical epic of building their state . But great as is the sum of the commerce already reached here , it sinks into insignificance compared with the prospective transcontinental and oceanic business that is heading for Puget Sound . Consult the map again , and note the position that this body of water occupies with respect to the world . It sounds extravagant now , but sober and coolheaded business men , familiar with the facts , believe that Washington holds the key to the future commerce of the world . She stands at the crossroads of the na- 51 0 The State of Washington . tions , at the confluence of the commodities or the four quarters of the globe . She is the successor of Pluenicia , Carthage , Italy , and England , as the natural exchange point of all lands . Europe and the United States are at her back , Alaska and British Columbia at her right hand , the tropics at her left , and the Orient , with half the population of the world , in front . Formerly California was supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discredit the magnificent location and resources of that state , but it is true that Washington is gaining on California by leaps and bounds . This is due to three causes first , Washington has five transcontinental railways in reach , California is under the despotism of one ; second , the vast developments of Alaska and British Columbia have made Puget Sound the hub of Pacific coast trade ; thiid. , and most important , the route to the Orient , owing to the rotundity of the earth , is materially shorter by Puget Sound than by the Golden Gate . The epic of Washington is going to involve the nations of the earth . The great fact of the twentieth century will undoubtedly be the commerce of the Pacific Ocean and the disposition of the Orient . And at what point is that mighty commerce first to touch the American continent ? A student of maps , history , and contemporary trade can hardly doubt that Puget Sound is to be the place of destiny , the great wharf line of the continent . And not alone are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean of the Pacific , " but Alaska rises from her boreal mists to join with tropic islands in a grasp of this handle of the world 's trade . Latitudes and longitudes are merging along these fair archipelagoes which the mythical old Greek pilot of Cephalonia , Juan de Fuca , imagined to link Atlantic and Pacific , The genius of this railway age has created a substitute for the fabled Strait of Anian . That dream of the older navigators has been realized , though it lies be . tween lines of steel instead of headlands of the sea . As we " dip into the future , see the vision of the world and all the wonder that will be , " converging toward the western approaches of this new Northwest Passage , " We eau see the heavens fill with commerce , argosies of magic sails , Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down in costly bales . " But the great question of an epic is , after all , the character of the hem . " Men , high-minded men , constitute a state ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not so easy as seine imagine to differentiate a Pacific " type . " There is no distinct Washington type . Eastern people often suppose that the West is essentially different from the East , forgetting that only yesterday it was transplanted from the East . " Do you lian to tell us , then , that if we came West we should fail to encounter desperadoes ? Are you going to bereave us ruthlessly of the heroes of Bret Haste , Joaquin Miller , and Mark Twain ? " All peace to the men who have immortalized the age of the Argonauts of ' 49 , but truth compels us to suggest that Roaring Camp is not a universal picture of the Pacific coast . Of course California is " peculiar . " Washington is " peculiar . " So is every other country . But strangers and travelers habitually exaggerate peculiarities . They first note the rougher , wilder , more sensational phases of life . The quiet , unobtrusive life of home , school , office , and shop is not visible from the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of observation for the ordinary passer-through . Travelers are usually all agog to see the sensational , grotesque , criminal aspects of the West , the job lots of desperadoes and frontier ruffians , but their eyes are closed to the common virtues of home . They did not go West to see that sort of thing . Human nature loves the marvelous , and // bids good-by to the commonplace after it crosses the Mississippi . And it may be observed that the faithful Westerner usually does his best to provide the kind of spice that his visitor wants . Hence arise reports partly unjust , partly ludicrous . There is nothing more exasperating or amusing to the old-timer than the calm assumption of superior moral virtue by visitors from the East , and their tranquil assurance that flaunting vice is an every-day affair " out West . " The truth is that a traveler to any country is most likely to see the worst , and is often unaware that the very same thing exists down the back alleys of the town he lives in , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another land adventures into a domain whose counterpart exists right around his own home without his knowledge . A story is told of a Scotchman in the Far West , disappointed in not finding the typical " bad man " whom he supposed to be the common product of the country ; and while thus hungering to be thrilled , suddenly encountering his man on a steamboat . There he was , sure enough , ? ferocious mustaches , cowboy hat , fringed " shapps , " buckskin coat , " gun " in belt , vitriolic breath , and all , strictly according to Bret Harte . Our Scotchman gazed upon this " Western type " some time , and at last ventured to interrogate him . The " bad man , " as soon as he heard the Caledonian tones , leaned over confidentially and exclaimed , " Hoot , mon , I 'm fast oot from Inverness ! " It was another Scotch-man , on a Western steamboat , who , seeing a man at the table distinguishing himself by his horrible voracity and greed , was remarking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that specimen of the West . We never see a thing like that in Scotland , " when the " specimen " suddenly shouted , " Hi , waiter , hae ye ony main f ash ? " The writer was once told , by a delightful man of Hartford , about going into a hotel in a California town , when a gigantic " Western ruffian " stumped up to the register , and on discovering the stranger 's name thundered out , " Where is that man from Connecticut ? " Our friend , though expecting that he would at least have to treat the crowd , and probably get is shot through his hat , at last timidly acknowledged his identity , when the giant bore down on him with broad grin and extended hand , exclaiming , " Shake , parch ! I ' m from Connecticut myself . " Do we have no Pacific coast type , then ? Yes , we have , but it is elusive and indefinable , a composite of many types . The Atlantic and Pacific seem , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than of character of people . There are only four real generic types in the United States , ? the Down East Yankee , the Southern colonel , the " Pike , " and the Western " cowboy . " There is no Pacific type of such distinctness ; or rather , there is a heterogeneous mixture of all types , with a resulting " blend " in the native product . The following table of birthplaces of the 597 registered voters of Yakima , an agricultural WWII in the central part of the state , will be of interest as showing the composition of an ordinary town in Washington : ? ? In addition , there were three each from Holland , Nebraska , North Carolina , North Dakota , West Virginia , New Hampshire , Switzerland ; two each from Ontario , Arkansas , Italy , Georgia , and New Brunswick ; and one each from Connecticut , Florida , India , Luxemburg , Utah , South Carolina , Wyoming , Prussia , Alabama , France , Louisiana , Isle of Jersey , Isle of Man , and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our communities , the reader will see the impossibility of any distinct type as yet . Surprised Eastern visitors sometimes say , " Why , this state is not so very wild and woolly , after all . " And inasmuch as the majority of the people that they nsect have been out from the East only four or five years , this is not strange . But " East , " it must be remarked in passing , does not mean to us what it means to the New Englander . Anything the other side of the Missouri is " East " to us . A new arrival from Massachusetts was once greeted very cordially , in my hearing , by a lady who had been here some time , and who said , " I came from the East myself ! " " ! " said the New Englander . " From what place ? " " From Iowa , " was the unexpected answer . It is evident that if we can not distinguish between the Pacific coast and the West in general , we shall be unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a subtle something by which the older resident will recognize his own . California has , in general , more glare and glitter and " style ; " Oregon is less venturesome and progressive ; Washington is , with some qualifications , more solid and reliable than either . In business methods and spirit , Washington is more like the East , especially the Lake states , than are the other Pacific states . With regard to manners and outer semblance , the men are less reserved , more flexible , less mindful of dress , style , and appearances , than men of like wealth and education in the East . Outside show counts for very little with one of these hard headed , keen-sighted pioneers , who , in his varied career , has " rubbed up " against nearly every species of human being . in Washington , to It will never do , judge a man by dress or immediate surroundings . You may think that you have a country bumpkin or a raw backwoodsman , only to find , when you have " scratched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran of half a dozen wars . But the women and children of the Far West come nearer to being " types " than do the men . The average Western man leaves literature , art , and society to his wife and girls . The Western woman is an institution in herself , keen , alert , eager for impressions , education , culture , experience , career , independence , ? anything , in short , that will widen her " sphere . " The native Pacific girl is conspicuously bright , ambitious , rather spoiled by excessive petting from the men ; not so regular and " cultured , " in general , as her Eastern sister , but thoroughly womanly and faseMating , and possessing good sense , and capacity for improving her own powers and imparting inspiration to others , beyond most of her sex . The majority of Western mess are ma of their element in anything except business and politics . The wife usually acts as head of the family in all manner of social and religious crises , as inviting a ministerial guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while the masculine partner slouches around , at such times , in hulking and uncomfortable consciousness of his own lack of piety and polish . That solemn sense of Isis own dignity as head of the house , that shrinking deference paid to him by the " weaker vessels " of his family , which magnify the paterfamilias in England , and to some degree in the old-fashioned New England community , ? these never lighten the pathway of the average Western householder . He may consider himself in great luck if he is not discrowned entirely . The independ- The State of core and ? ? go-aheadativeness " of women seem to coexist with a general high standard of intelligence ; for statistics show that Washington is third on the list of states in freedom from illiteracy , being surpassed by Iowa and Nebraska only . In fact , the Pacific coast ranks very high in average education and intelligence , though there is not , of course , so much real cultivation as in some circles of older communities . The schools of Washington have not yet had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even of California ; those of the last state being among the best in the country . Yet nearly every town of three or four thousand or more has a high school ; and the high schools , as well as the primary schools , are laid out on such a basis as will give the state an excellent educational system when time has had due opportunity . There is a State University at Seattle , superbly located , and provided with excellent buildings and a generous support , with a faculty of 32 and over 600 students during the present year ; and this bids fair to become an acceptable sister of Michigan , Wisconsin , California , and the other high-grade state universities of the country . The State Agricultural College and School of Science at Pullman is.equipped with fine buildings and apparatus , has an annual income of $60,000 from state and national funds , and during this year had an enrollment of over 500 students and a faculty of 28 . There are three well- equipped normal schools in the state . There are also four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Whitman College , at Walla Walla , bearing the name of the martyr missionary whose foresight and heroism were factors in making Oregon a part of the Union . Whitman College had 14 professors and 265 students during the year 1900 . A number of academies have been established in various sections . With regard to the other agencies of VOL. // // an intellectual life , it may be said that Washington has the usual large Western number of newspapers , 204 in the last gazetteer , four of which , the Times and Post-Intelligencer of Seattle , the Spokesman-Review of Spokane , and the Ledger of Tacoma , will compare favorably with almost any of the newspapers of the land , aside front the great metropolitan dailies . The Times inaugurated the bold experiment of a two-cent daily , and to all appearance-is succeeding , from both a pecuniary and journalistic standpoint . Washington has a state law for the maintenance of free public libraries , under which all the larger towns are making excellent beginnings . Seattle has about 24,000 volumes ; Spokane , about half that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement is active throughout the state . There are 47 women 's clubs , and this genuine American idea is leading to many practical steps in public improvement . As to permanent literature , there has not yet been time for a native growth of poets , essayists , and philosophers . The prevailing atmosphere , like that of the West in general , is materialistic . Dollars , not ideals , constitute the staple of men 's thoughts . Nevertheless , all the natural conditions , scenery , climate , environment , history , and future outlook , favor the hope that there will be , in due season , a due meed of honor for the makers of ideas as well as of money , and that we shall have our proportion of " those rare souls , poets , whose thoughts enrich the blood of the world . " Of Washington politically , it must be confessed that there is more need than hope of a high standard . In this we have plenty of company , East and West . Yet few Westerners , loath as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , venture to claim equality with New England in the character of men chosen to office . If we should institute a comparison between Washington and Maine , while we could 514 Tire State of Washington . claim for the former an infinite superiority in every sort of natural resource , and at least an equality in intelligence and character of people , we should have to retire without a contest in comparing legislators and members of Congress . The reason is not far to find . Maine has usually looked for national and intellectual qualifications , while Washington , like the West in general , has sought , with some honorable exceptions , local and pecuniary qualifications . The curse of the West is that polities is made a mere tool for business . Greed and commercialism have worked like the canker . Men are chosen to office , not to devise statesman , like methods of raising the standard of life for the whole state , but to engineer some scheme for squeezing tribute out of the state for the benefit of private business enterprises . . The West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the common history of men. ; but it is a curious anomaly that such consummate selfishness in business and politics coexists with such intern. gence .. and such hearty good will in the other . relations of life . The cause is It is the individualistic and competitive system of business . The extreme individualism , which from its good side has made all that is best in American history , Our ambition , our self-reliance , and our originality , and from its evil side has created our mono , polies , our bossisms , and our partisanships , ? this is keener , more eager , more speculative , and ( sometimes , at least ) more unscrupulous on the Pacific coast ? than elsewhere . In California this guer , rilla strife for personal and corporate gain is most intense , and its evils are most flagrant . There , according to the local press ( we would not venture to say it ourselves ) , the question in regard to a legislature is not whether it will be honest , , ? nobody expects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than its , predeee , asor . In the newer state of Washington the evils of excessive individualism are not yet so gross , but they exist in pretty sturdy infancy . The spirit of cooperation is correspondingly weak . Statistics of 1897 show that them was municipal ownership of water works in 52.3 per cent of towns in New England , in 67.3 in the middle states , mid in 37.5 in the West . Massachusetts led the list , and California ended it . These figures no doubt indicate in a rough was the degree of cooperation , and hence of public spirit , in these different sections . And yet this individualistic spirit of the West is simply one stage in its growth toward a higher civic life . Cooperation is essential to a noble state , but the first requisite of a strong union is strong units . The work of our bold , overbearing , scheming West is the creation of these units . The units will unite in time . The pi esent state administration of Washington is " fusion , " ? Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are largely " reformers . " old anti - slavery and anti - monopoly men , " Lincoln Republicans , " temperance " cranks , " radicals , and the " date gerous " element in general ; while the conservative , " respectable , " business class usually belong to the Republican party . The state went Republican in 1900 by a good majority , except in ease of Governor Rogers , who ran about 15 , - 000 votes ahead of his ticket . The Philippine question has cut sharply across the former alignment of parties , and produced " confusion worse confounded . " The sentiment of all parties is strongly in favor of the retention of the islands . In nine cases out of ten , the sole reason assigned is that it will help American trade , and especially favor the introduc- ? tion of Washington flour and lumber into Asia . It must be confessed that the Western man 's treatment of the " im ferior " races has not been dictated by philanthropy or sentiment . And yet , underneath the apparently harsh and mercenary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rugged fair play and good-heartedness which are the saving grace of our masterful Anglo-Saxon race . Of all features of Washington , as of the Pacific group in general , the ! nest interesting and encouraging is the ambition and originality of the young people . They are intensified Americans , the legitimate offspring of the epic heroes of American immigration from Plymouth Rock down . The vital air of the land is freedom , Conventionality and affectation are hated . The beaten track is abandoned for some new road across some new wilderness . The Pacific boy and girl are born explorers , experimenters , and inventors . They are singularly susceptible to all sorts of new impressions and aims , and , in consequence , furnish the best kind of material for grafting culture and scholarship upon . It is re marked by educators who come West as teachers that the native boys , while sometimes lacking in external polish and regular discipline , are conspicuous for versatility , native force , ability to " get on , " and capacity of rapid improvement . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges have in many eases become distinguished as scholars and athletes . Pioneer qualities of mind are indeed liable to abuse , haste , superficiality , presumption , and lawlessness , but out of such mental soil have sprung all the heroic growths of history . It has made the epics of our race . It has made the trails westward over plain and mountain , through forest and sea . Our state of Washington is simply one more of those marvels of the conquests of nature which have made America " the last best hope of earth . "
