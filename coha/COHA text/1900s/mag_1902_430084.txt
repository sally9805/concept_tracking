 |p501  NOT a few of the eminent players of the present time began their stage careers when they were little children . Miss Ellen Terry made her first appearance on the public stage at the age of eight years as Mamillius in The Winter 's Tale ; " Miss Annie Russell appeared first at the age of ten years as Jeanne in " Miss Mutton ; " Mr. Joseph Jefferson was but three years old when he made his professional debut as Jim Crow ; Mrs. Fiske was about a year younger when she made her first public appearance as the Duke of York in " Richard III. , " and no older than three years when she played one of the apparitions in " Macbeth ; " Miss Julia Marlowe was a small girl of twelve years when her stage life began ; and Miss Maude Adams was only nine months old when , as a little child of the theater recently told me , she played " the part of a baby " in The Lost Child . " How interested we all are in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what delight we listen to stories about their childhood triumphs and despairs , and how eagerly we welcome the quaint old photographs of them in their baby roles ! We often wish that we might have seen these stage children ; quite as often do we forget that in no case were they famous as children . They had no such renown as Elsie Leslie or Tommy Russell , and very far from such prominence in the plays in which they appeared . They acted their small parts and no doubt they aroused a correspondingly small interest in the audience an interest as large perhaps as an audience of to-day feels in the performances of present day stage children . Such an enthusiastic hero-worshipping people are we that we find it next to impossible to believe that Miss Ellen Terry 's childish acting would not have been remembered by us much more vividly than that of the little girl who was with Mr. Willard when he played Tom Pinch , or that Mr. Jefferson as Jim Crow would not have amused us far more than did the funny little boy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square Theater . We are reluctant to agree to the fact that those stage children at that time were no more important in the play than are these stage children at this time . At least half of the plays produced during the past theatrical season have required the services of children ; throngs of them . as in " Ben Hur , " " Lovers ' Lane , " and " The Unwelcome Mrs. Hatch ; " small groups  |p502  of them , as in " The Forest Lovers , " " Quality Street , " and " A Doll 's House : " occasionally , only one child has been needed , as in ' Little Italy , " " The Climbers , " " The Girl and The Judge , " " The Cardinal , " and several plays given by local stock companies . Unless the child 's part in a play is of exceptional importance , a child to act it does not usually travel with the company , but is engaged in each city in which the play is produced . Of all the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were regularly and continuously with the companies in which they were needed ; the others were changed almost as many times as the theaters in which the companies played . This seems rather a hazardous plan , but evidently it is not . Once I asked a player whose play included a child 's part , " What happens when you can not find a child to take the part ? " She laughed . " I always can ! " she said easily . Last summer the little girl who played the child 's part in " Rosedale " and in " The Charity Pall " came to spend a few weeks with me in the country . Just as the daisies were exactly the right size for chains , as she plaintively said , her mother sent her a part , and intimated that she must return to the city and be taught it . In order to prolong her visit , I offered to teach her at least the lines . They were numerous and difficult , and we spent many half-hours over them . The little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wish to learn them . One afternoon . when she had repeated them ten times , and still not quite correctly , I said , " If you are tired you need not try them again today . " She was only eight years old , but the actor 's instinct was strong in her . " I am tired , but I do n't want to stop till I get them . " she said stoutly . " Just as soon as you say them without one mistake , " I said , " we shall go down and get pink ice cream . " She tried again and still again , and finally she said the lines to the last word without a mistake . In the play the child dies with the last word ; and the small player closed her eyes as she said it , and gave a soft little sigh . Then she sprang to her feet , tossed the paper on which the part was written into the air , and asked gaily , " Will the ice cream be just pinky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw her play the part . " Was I all right in it ? " she asked me , shortly afterward . " Did I speak nice and clear , and ' member not to fidget ? " " Yes , " I replied , " you did , but in one place you twisted your lines . " She reflected . " But it was n't my fault , " she said earnestly . " The leadin ' lady called me ' darling ' in the wrong place . Did n't you notice she did , and twisted my cue ? " This little girl invited me to come to the meeting of a dramatic club , and one day when I went she introduced me to the children I did not know with descriptive comments as delicious as they were varied . She brought forward one of the small boys who had been in " Quality Street . " He  |p503  had not acted ; she gravely said he had " just been an extra . " The boy turned upon her indignantly . " Well , ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he hotly demanded . Who shall say that it is not ? If we listen to the words of any simple and unaffected child we shall hear much that we have read in the books of our most profound scholars . Quaintly as they express them , some of the opinions of the smallest children of the stage echo the opinions of the greatest critics of tile acted drama . One day I went to a May party in the woods with about twenty of the little stage children . I had my camera with me , and they helped me take photographs in the most enthusiastic fashion . I chose for a model the little fair-haired girl who played the part of Roxalana in " Peg Woffington . " She was sitting on the grass making bouquets of the wild flowers . " If only you had a few more flowers -- - " I began ; but before I could continue the other children had added all their own . They fastened them in her hair and the frills of her dress , filled her lap with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hand . @# " She looks like she was going to play Ophelia , " one of the other little girls whispered to me . " Perhaps some day she may , " I said . " Maybe , " the child agreed ; " only , " she added pensively , " Shakespeare 's kind of goin ' out on the stage . " Could anyone sum up the theatrical condition more accurately ? The tiny girl who was the May Queen with Mrs. Fiske in " The unwelcome Mrs. Hatch " followed me ? or the camera ? faithfully about ; she had a banana in one hand and a doughnut in the other , which she ate in alternate bites , and between the bites she put questions to me and advised me with regard to taking the photographs . " Now , I want to take you ? with your flowers . " I presently told her , and she turned and solemnly faced the camera . " Could you smile ? " I asked . Wo n't you ? if you feel like smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like smiling ? " she cried , " but even if I did n't I could ! " Most of the little stage children are equally sturdy and light hearted . We have all read about the tears Miss Terry shed when as Mamillius she fell over her little cart and the audience laughed . She and does not the artist 's little girl dabble with brushes and paint ? They are kind and gentle children , the small girls and boys of the stage . The little girl who visited me was a never-ceasing marvel to the servant who attended to some of her wants . During her first visit I happened to be away the greater part of one day , and when I returned a tale cf true wonder met me almost at the very door . " It 's a sight of children I 've snowed , Miss , " were the awed words with which I was greeted as the door was opened , " but that one is ahead of ' em all . ' Will ye have jam on your bread , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as you said to . ' Whichever you 've got most handy , ' she says that sweet . Did ye ever hear the like of that ? An ' at half past , when I puts on her white dress , an ' brushes her hair an ' fixes her all neat , Thank you , ' says she : Which if 1 do say it , Miss , your own niece do n't be sayin ' ! " I actually blushed for toy family connections as I listened to these eulogies of my small guest . She is , indeed , an exceptional child , but the little boy who was in " Ping Charles I. " IN ROSEDALE. ' ' thought she had ruined at one and the same time the play and her career as an actress . One of these stage children of the present day who was in " The Forest Lovers " with Miss Bertha Galland told me that she tripped and felt one night when she was running about in the forest on the stage . " But I told the manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " because , you know , children are so likely to fall clown when they are playing in the woods . ' ' She romped with the other children at that May day party in the real woods quite as joyously as though she had never pretended to romp with them in the stage woods . They all had gathered paper flowers , but they had lost none of the child 's love for gathering real ones . There is , indeed , no reason why they should lose it , for the children of the theater are different from other children only in their environment . They are deeply interested in the stage and the people of the stage whom they know : they talk of little else , but do not the small boys of a college town prattle about the ' varsity crew , quite equals her in sweetness of temper . At the May party he and another boy were given slices of plain bread and butter . " I waaated a doughnut , " the other boy whispered . " So did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no use makin ' a fuss about it . " We all know the children of the theater ? in the theater we have seen them marry times . Possibly , we gave them no more than a passing thought ; perhaps we said , as I have many times overheard spectators say , " The stage is no place for children ; they should be at home , asleep ! " We may have felt that they added something to the scenes into which they came . Probably some of us were curious about their life off the stage , and wondered whether they were as happy and as lovingly and well cared for as we would wish all children in the world to be . We may even have speculated as to their futures , not only on but off the stage . It is a question as to whether their childish efforts in the play are of benefit to the children of the theater in their more mature dramatic work . Some great actors were stage children , and some equally great were not . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few have attained to any later prominence ; very many have not even continued in the dramatic profession . Among the little children whom we saw on the stage last winter , and shall no doubt see on the stage next winter , there may be one or two , or even more , who in the future shall be called great , and there may not . In the course of the years we shall see . Meanwhile , the children of the presentday theater are very near us ; they should never lack our sympathy and our help . We may wish that they were not on the stage ; but since it seems , as it always seemed , inevitable and necessary that they should be , we may not forget that it is our happy duty to help them whenever and however we can . They are tender little human children , and in so many small , as in so many large , ways , one may help a child . And we all know that Phillips Brooks said " IIe who helps a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brighter glories to our American stage , but whatever they may be in the future , they are now only little children , innocent and simple-hearted. friendly to every one , and most dear to all those persons who truly know them .
