txt " Democracy , as a general form of government , is on trial . " These are the words with which the veteran historian GOLDWIN Seirret closes an article in the current number of The North Ameri-6 can Review on " Defects of the American Constitution . " Among the defects he notes are the following : Equal representation of small and large States in the Senate ; the short term of Representatives and " their moral supersession , during a part of even that short term , by the election of their successors " ; the lack of leadership and organization in the House ; the separation of executive and legislative powers ; the clumsy mode of electing the President , to which he at , tributes much of the violence of party I conduct . On this point the writer is not very clear , but , apparently , he thinks party action would be more responsible if it led to more definite power , and if the majority really ruled more directly and more nearly completely . If this is the correct Interpretation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' United States because the Government is so far from being truly and effectively democratic . There is plenty of logical support for this criticism . The government of the United Kingdom by a committee of the popular branch of the national Legislature , with a tenure dependent on retaining a majority in that branch , is theoretically distinctly more democratic than our own . But it is to be noted , on the one hand , that the English system is the outgrowth of many centuries of evolution , and , on the other , that in practice it is hampered by incongruous elements as marked as ourgown . On the face of things , it has one advantage  --  it is not bound by the fetters of a written Constitution . But these fetters do not bind as hard as they might be expected to do . The election to the Presidency , which Prof. GOLDIVIN SMITH says was meant to be " the calm and impartial choice , by select boards , of eminent and respected citizens , " has become more nearly an absolute democratic election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English-speaking communities the essential principle of democracy has been steadily advancing for a long time , and apparently with increasing force for the past century and a half . It still encounters many obstacles and works around or over them when they become sufficiently bothersome to arouse strong sentiment , and it will probably go on doing so . It is " on trial " in the sense that every human institution is an experiment . sure to lead to changes with changing conditions . It is not on trial in the sense that a choice is being made between it and some other principle , for I in English-speaking communities there is no other principle in sight . Judged by net results so far we are convinced that the experiment is really tremen- I dously successful . It demands care and vigilance and fidelity to public duty among all intelligent enough to understand its demand ; but it prom ; ises the most beneficent outcome the i human mind has conceived .
