SIR : We have been taught that a workingman 's duty to his union was superior to his duty to the Constitution and the laws , and even to the eternal principles of right and justice ; but the doctrine that it is superior to the duty and affection of a son to a father , seems to me to touch the high-water mark ' of " union " ethics . Wit , ness the news item herewith subjoined . O. MORES . October 7. 1903 . " CHICAGO , October 7 . ? Five hundred glove-makers , employed in four factories , went'on strike to-day because the employers refused to grant demands for increased wages and to renew an agreement that expired September 21 . Among the manufacturers whose employees were called out is Samuel R. Clexton , sr. , father of Samuel R. Clexton , jr. , Presideht of Glovemakers ' Local Union , No. 4 . ' I called out the men in my father 's shop , as my union has first claim on my duty , ' the latter declared . " GOVERNMENTAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RESPECTED FRIEND : In the Nation of the 24th ultimo there is an admirable editorial on " The Public Land Problem and Irrigation , " in which occurs the following statement : " The public lands having already been occupied , values have reached figures which are practically prohibitive to the man in a ' prairie schooner . ' If . it is not for these that the costly irrigation enterprise upon which the Government is entering , then who is to be benefited ? Those already well to do and able to finance their own ditch undertakings  --  the - wealthy speculators or range-owners ? " If I am not mistaken , the above statement and query , and also the Nation 's concluding comments , are of peculiar significance from the fact that it is impossible to benefit the " man in a prairie schooner " by Governmental irrigation . Even if the water is brought to the land at public expense , the benefit will necessarily accrue to . men of considerable means ( presumably " those already well to do and able to finance their own ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the " man in a prairie schooner " will still be shut out by the cost of constructing and maintaining the lateral ditches , and of putting the land in condition for irrigation . The truth of the matter is , that land which depends on artificial irrigation for its fertility is about the last place on earth for men with light pockets . In the first place , the land when prepared for irrigation is necessarily costly , although the water may be brought to it free . In the second place , the ' situation is peculiarly subject to unlooked-for contingencies , which involve either the prompt use of ready money , or ruin . The man who has capital enough to establish himself safely on the irrigated plains , has enough to establish himself any- ' where , and needs no aid from the Government . In regard to. - the cost to the Government of bringing the water to the land , the lowest estimate that I have seen is $10 an acre ; and this only for the two or three hundred millions of acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possible indefinite extension of the scheme , the " ultimate average cost ' to the Government may be just as well placed at $200 an acre as at $10 . And even if this land was secured to the " man in a prairie schooner , " how can the Government be justified in providing land for the landless in.the Far West at a cost of even $10 an acre , when excellent . land may be purchased throughout the country , especially in the Southern States , for $5 an acre , . and less ? ' fin the territory adjacent to the cities of Boston , New York , and Philadelphia -- -within 100 miles of the vast fruit and vegetable markets of these great cities  --  very productive land may be purchased for less than $10 an acre . If the Government may properly use the public funds for the development of arid land in the Far West , osten- sibly for the benefit of unequipped home . seekers , why may it not more economically and properly use public funds in the purchase and development of Southern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the same purpose ? The equitable distribution , or sale , of public land is a legitimate Governmental function , but the use of public funds for the commercial development of land is exactly the same principle as- the use of public funds for the purchase of land and its commercial development ; and if the Government uses the public funds for the commercial development of land in , and for the benefit of , certain States , how can it equitably neglect the commercial development of land , by the use of public funds , in and for the benefit of each of the other States ? If the commercial development of land at public expense in four or . five States is " one of the greatest undertakings ever begun in any age , " it seems ' to follow that the commercial development of land at public expense in all the States would be the greatest of all public undertakings . In this connection , however , it may be remarked that when an undertaking is based on false principles , its magnitude only makes it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is , that the idea that it is a proper function of Government to furnish fertile - land to all applicants is a misleading delusion which is exceedingly demoralizing to both Government and people . The Government might as well undertake to furnish capital to all applicants . When the Government had fertile public land to give away , it could give the landless a home for the asking ; but ( unless Canada should come into the Anion in the near future ) that situation has passed away never to return . Fertility of soil everywhere now has a commercial ' value which makes it equivalent to capital , and it can not be had except in exchange for capital . The water which gives fertility to the arid land of the Western plains is , commercially , ' exactly the equivalent of the fertilizer Which must be used on an Eastern farm . At the present time the best opportunity , in the United States , for the " man in a prairie schooner " is the cheap and fertile land in the Southern States  --  in other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained with the least outlay of capital ; and the effect of Governmental irrigation will be to benefit the wealthy speculators and range owners ' to the detriment of all other agriculturists . In developing the arid land of the Western plains , the Government enters upon a strictly commercial enterprise in direct and detrimental competition with private agricultural enterprise in all other parts of the country . ISAAC W. GRISCOM . PHILADELPHIA , 10th Mo. , 8th , 1903 , THE AMERICAN COLLEGE PRESIDENT . ' To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Will you allow me a few words of comment on your very suggestive article , " The , American College President , " contained in No. 1995 of the Nation ? The American College President of to-day is in reality a relic of the times when , as Les-sing says , the clergy was still thinking  --  and eating  --  for us In those happy times it was believed that the intellectual welfare of our boys was safest in the hands of a spiritual guardian , who , being by his profession accustomed to begging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college . Fortunately those idyllic times have passed . The clergyman president is gone , but the promoter has remained . In academic circles the opinion is growing that the promoter president , too , should go as soon as possible , not only because he presents a ludicrous spectacle , but also for more serious reasons It is being felt more and more as an intolerable anomaly that , in the very heart of our democracy , a monarchical institution , such as the college presidency really is , should still exist . This feeling has grown all the more since the experiment in several Western colleges of giving the president absolute power has proved an absolute failure . Favoritism and corruption of various kinds were the natural results of this experiment in academic despotism , not to speak of the humiliating sight of scholars , free American citizens , cringing before the almighty president . No wonder that we are appealing in vain to our colleges and universities for help in purifying municipal and national politics . The American university , moreover , will never reach an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal , called president , at its head . The history of the German universities shows us clearly that scholarship can reach its highest form of development and influence only in the academic republic , where the individual professor , the personification of his specialty , his Fach , is responsible to himself alone . This highest form of academic liberty , the only source of great scholarly and educational achievements , can not be attained with a president , who will in some way or other try " to shape a policy " for his university , or interfere where interference is a sin against the spirit of the true university Hence the constant secret or open frictions between president and faculty . If most college presidents knew what their faculties  --  not their personal friends among these  --  really thought of them , but dared not express , they would , if men of honor , resign their positions at once . Not that professors are natural fault-finders . A distinguished university president once told the writer that a man could not be a college president without being more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar who possesses self-respect and high professional ideals look with respect upon an office whose occupants - seemingly can not practise the elementary principles of morality in their dealings with their faculties ? I am not exaggerating Hundreds of professors would corroborate my statements if they dared speak That they dare not speak characterizes better than all my statements the rottenness of existing conditions . And are we to tolerate these conditions because they are sanctified by American traditions ' ? Away with an office that has become an anachronism and an obstacle in the development of the true university idea , If a faculty , composed , as it ought to lie , of the best specimens of American scholarship and manhood , can not govern itself , then all self-government is a farce , which we should end , the sooner the better . Let the faculty elect , as you suggest , one of their number yearly to the honorary position of representing the university and of presiding over inevitable academic functions These are now the essential functions of the president , since in all the larger institutions government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business part of the university let us have a business man , whom ambitious institutions may easily find among the employees of our great advertising firms But let us remove with due honors the old college president and the university president of to-day before he fully take the famous step from the sublime . VERITAS . TITIAN 'S " SACRED AND PROFANE LOVE . " TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR . In the issues of the Nation for July 2 and September 24 , two entirely contradictory interpretations of Titian 's " Sacred and Profane Love " were presented , and supported by arguments both earnest and interesting . To add n third theory to the controversy , may I call to your notice the interpretation which was brought forward by Signor Palmarini , in the Nuova Antologia for August , 1902 ' Setting aside the theory of Herr Wickhoff , which Signor Gnoli presented to your readers , that the picture represents Venus persuading Medea to escape with Jason , and of Mr. Andrews 's presentation of Crowe and Cavalcaselle 's theory that the subject is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses to paraphrase it , " Innocent and Satisfied Love " ) , we find that Signor Palmarini names the picture " The Fountain of Arden . " To former critics the differences between the two female figures have been the chief aids in interpreting and naming the picture Signor Palmarini , ' however , finds these two figures so similar that his key to the right understanding of the picture is found en the fountain , in the presence of the little love god , in the background and the accessories In the women 's figures he finds an identity of complexion , of the color , quality and arrangement of the hair , and of physique . Both have the same eyes , surmounted by fine and slightly arched brows In both the mouth is small , curved and of the same design , the nose straight and aristocratic , the chin rounded . To him the women are alike in feature , and contrasted only in expression Here he differs radically from your correspondent , Mr. Andrews , who describes the mide figure as " an innocent maiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Signor Palmarini she has the appearance of a woman to whom love has left nothing unrevealed , " the mouth sensual , as though swollen by kisses , the nostrils dilated , the neck more full " Both gentlemen describe the face of the other figure as serene and quiet . In Mr. Andrews 's opinion , the serenity comes through " absence of passionate desire , " because this hasbeen satisfied , while in Signor Palmarini 's opinion it is lack of experience which produces the expression of serenity , Ingenuousness , and almost coldness . Because of the similarity of feature , and perhaps , also , because of the difference in expression , Signor Palmarini finds a further resemblance to this type in Titian 's " Magdalen , " in the Pitti ; his " Flora , " in the Uffizi ; his portrait of Laura Dianti , in the Louvre . To this list we might add the head of the daughter of Herodias , in the Doria gallery in Rome  --  a head with the same glowing coloring of hair and skin , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the favorite and afterwards the wife of Alfonso , Duke of Ferrara , is the most important link in the chain , as , in the opinion of Signor Palmarini , this resemblance helps to name and approximately date the Borghese picture . The picture has been supposed to belong to the period of the " Bacchanal " and the " Ariadne " in Madrid , a period when Titian was painting at the court of the Este family in Ferrara , and where , in fact , in 1518 , he made the portrait of Alfonso d'Este which is now in Madrid . It was during this same period that Alfonso 's first wife , Lucre= Borgia , died ' and Laura Dianti became his second wife . It is known from a letter of Ticozzi to Cicognara that at this time , also , Titian painted Laura " nuda e vestita . " Other historic details help to further strengthen Signor Palmarini 's argument . An existing letter of Titian 's of the year 1517 tells of a commission given him to paint a vasca , or basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year later the Duke asked him for the design of a painting whose subject was to be supplied by the poet Ariosto At the Ferarra court Titian had been brought into intimate relations with Ariosto , and Ridolfi records in his ' Meraviglie dell ' Arte ' that the poet often visited the painter 's studio , watching him compose pictures from subjects taken from Ariosto 's own poem , the ' Orlando Furioso ' " For , " as Ridolfi said , " painting performs the service of mute poetry , and poetry that of speaking painting . " Another letter of Titian 's , written on the first of April , 1518 , speaks of the great diligence and study which he was devoting to a picture whose inspiration had come from the Duke , while only the " corpo " ( the body of the picture in distinction from its soul ) was to be executed by the painter . Three weeks later , on the twenty-second of April , Tebaldi , the Duke 's representative in his transactions with the painter , wrote to Alfonso that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture for the Duke , and had given him the paper on which the figurine was sketched Given these historic data , together with the coincidence of time , the resemblance to Laura 's portrait in the Louvre , and the record of another picture of Laura , it seems not unreasonable to follow Signor Palmarini 's conclusion that in the figures in the Borghese picture we have two perhaps somewhat idealized representations of Laura Dianti . The commission , then , came from the Duke Alfonso , the inspiration from Ariosto , and the model was found in Laura Dianti , who about this time , certainly very soon after the death of Lucrezia Borgia in 1519 , became Alfonso 's bride . Ariosto , in his ' Orlando Furioso , ' had told of Rinaldo dismounting from his horse in a forest beflowered with red and green and yellow , where he came upon two fountains , one of which " filled the heart of him who drank of it with the longing for love ; while the other banished all love from the heart and turned into ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lovers , Rinaldo and Angelica , drank , experiencing in their own hearts the-burning and the chilling effects of the two draughts . Ariosto had found his inspiration for the incident of the fountain in the forest of Arden in the ' Orlando In. namorato ' of Bojardo , and to this poem Titian turned for further details . Bojardo introduced Rinaldo into a " shady forest of trees ; which has in its midst a stream of clear water Near by he found a fountain , never fashioned by human hands  --  a fountain of pure and polished alabaster , elaborately carved . Round about were the flowers of spring ; the beech , the pine , and the green olive cast their shade over the waters This was the fountain of love , which sets on fire whoever tastes of it . " This description of Bojardo fits Titian 's picture as closely as many of Politian 's - verses fit the paintings of Botticelli . In the same way , in these two different periods , pictures and poems were composed for the same patrons and inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture in detail , finding much in the accessories to strengthen his theory ' " Here we find butterflies , the symbol of love ; hares , the symbol of wantonness , a shepherd and shepherdess embracing ; the little god in the act of bathing his arrow in the fated water . In those days , no painting , even though it were allegorical , was complete without a human figure . At the fountain in Arden there must be an Angelica Hence , naturally , arose the thought of placing there Laura  --  cold and shy before she drank the dangerous water of love  --  so cold as to have brought with her her brazier , then , having drunk of the water , fired with love , throwing aside her garments , she lifts up to Venus the flame of love To emphasize this thought , the painter has placed beside the undraped figure a metal bowl , in which we can see a little of the charmed liquid . ? " To make more clear these two phases of the same doubly revealed personality  --  her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see on the left , back of the draped figure , a tranquil landscape , the two hares indifferent , peaceful , fearlessly nestling against each other ; while on the right , after love has driven them forth from their quiet and shady retreat , they are chased by dogs and hunters On the right the shepherd and shepherdess are seen in lovers ' attitude , and two butterflies pursue each other Even in the carving on the front of the fountain the painter has wished to signify the erotic nature of the waters On the left we see the little love-god , drawing a youth on to a barebacked horse , the symbol of lucky fate . On the right a man lashes Cupid , as though in revenge for the flame which burns him . Adam and Eve , the first victims of love , witness the scene " To some of us the symbolism may seem a little hard pressed by Signor Palmarini ; but his theory is certainly an ingenious one and , to all appearances , sufficiently well supported by contemporary data and internal evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings of the Venetians who fell under the spell of Giorgione as poetic idyls , vaguely inspired , perhaps , by some classic legend or contemporary poem : " and turned in one direction or another according to the fancy of the patron or the mood of the painter . Whether the picturerepresent Earthly and Heavenly Love , Artless and Sated Love , Venus and Medea , or Laura Thant at the fountain of love in the forest of Arden , matters little . Love is the subject of the picture , love and its effect as shown in the human face and in the natural world . No contradiction of interpretations can rob us of this conviction or of our intense pleasure in the picture . To this painting  --  to many of us the very flower of Renaissance art  --  we may perhaps wisely apply the words of Rossetti in his sonnet on Giorgione 's " Fete Ohtani:are " in the Louvre : " Nor name this ever Be it as it was , Life touching lips with Immortality " TERESINA PECK . DIRECTOR ram . To THE EDITOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " praises , in your issue of October 1 , of Dr Ricci 's recent rehanging of the Brera are far from exaggerated , and your readers will be glad to learn that this most competent of Italian gallery directors has just been appointed to the Uffizi , the finest post in his country As Dr. Ricci , for many reasons that do him credit , is no favorite at Rome , his promotion is a great triumph for honest and able administration .
