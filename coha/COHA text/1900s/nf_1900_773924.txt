txt // its methods were yet to be found , its possibilities to be explored . Little by little , as one period succeeded another and the art became in many respects perfected , changes were introduced , and especially changes that tended to greater simplicity . Old theories became old fashioned and were thrown aside to make room for new doctrines . " Fencing , in fact , was developed like most other things . But we must not lose sight of the fact that the early methods of the old masters , both in Italy and France , date from the sixteenth or seventeenth century , and that the weapons employed in those days differed materially from ours in shape , weight , and function . The change of weapon has naturally led to a change of method . " It would doubtless be interesting to the antiquary to trace the successive changes that have taken place in sword-play , and to compare it as it exists to-day with what it was in 1536 , when Marozzo wrote his treatise on the sword . ( Pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wide straight blade with two cutting edges . I need not say that Marozzo was Italian . The first French work on the subject was , I believe , a treatise by Henri de Saint-Didier , // which was published in i , 3 , and dedicated to Charles IX . At that time France was a long way behind Italy , where for twenty years already the edge had been abandoned for the point . " It is not my intention to retrace the abstruse history of the development of swordsmanship ; such an inquiry would , however , prove that in all ages the new truths were invariably denied bofore they established themselves as accomplished facts . There is no need then , as you will doubtless be relieved to hear , to discuss the systems of antiquity ; we will pass over the intervening periods without further preface , and come down at once to modern times . " We are told to draw a hard and fast line between two schools , ? probably for the convenience of putting ourselves in the right and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and speaking seriously , I fail to recognise more than one . True , that one may be regarded from several points of view . I can distinguish three very clearly , but 2 2 Secrets of the Sword these different aspects are very far from being distinct in the sense of clearly defined natural orders . I will describe three kinds of play , which are adopted by fencers according to fancy . " The first is fencing regarded as a graceful athletic exercise , contrived very much on the lines of a ceremonious dance , the interlacing movements of the combatants , as they close and fall back to their original positions , recalling the figures of a quadrille . One might almost say that the simplest example of this method is the single . combat of melodrama , the stage duel with its concerted movements , and that it finds its most perfect expression , or , if you prefer the phrase , attains its object in the execution of a series of voltes and passes or dodgy side-steps , a complicated succession of attacks , parries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly in accordance with prescribed regulations . " The second is fencing conceived as an exact science . Here it is the noble art ' that calls for profound study and arduous research . The student must explore its truths and consider them in all their bearings , pursue theory to its remotest ramifications , and drag to light its most reluctant secrets . Solid hard work and assiduous // application , such as science always demands of her votaries , backed by physical and intellectual resources naturally fitted to the task , are the only means which will enable you to achieve this consummate skill , the highest degree of attaintnent in the art . You will not be surprised when I say that the annals of the sword record but few names of undisputed preeminence , new stars that mark the epochs in its history . " The third is fencing considered from the point of view of practical self-defence . In this case the method is fashioned , so to speak , by personal inspiration , and is impressed with the stamp of individual character . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the terrors and sudden crises of warfare . Instead of passes ingeniously complicated , and foiled by parries as scientifically elaborate , steel clashes with steel , intent on forcing somewhere a passage for the point . The game becomes a fight , and a fight all the more grim , because the fighting animal is reinforced by science , and chooses from her armoury the weapons that make him strong , rejecting whatever is cumbrous or likely to obscure his native hue of resolution . ' " We now see the difference between the two styles , ? call them schools if you like . One // wishes to preserve intact and unalloyed the ancient academical traditions , ? I had almost called them the traditions of the dancing master , ? while the other inclines to what nowadays we call realism . Is that a gain or a loss ? At the present time everything tends to realism , but we are not , so far as I know , obliied to admit that the dream is the type of perfect beauty , and the real the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a practical age , perhaps too practical . Sometimes one may regret that it is so ; but what other result could you expect to follow from the convulsions that have so frequently shattered it ? The ideal , scared by the noise and confusion of our revolutions , so often repeated , so seldom foreseen , has used its wings to some purpose , and taken flight to a world far removed from ours . IV . " You will tell me that my comment is too grave for my text , but you know as well as I do that small things and great are linked together by bonds , which may be invisible but are none the less real . " t The First Evening 2 5 " Every age , " remarked one of my friends , " his its own manners and customs . We no longer live in the days when every gentleman carried a sword at his side and as a matter of course knew how to use it . The taste for fencing is not so universal that we are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us may not have sufficient leisure or sufficient inclination ; we are too busy or too lazy . I believe that what most men think about it can be put in a very few words : ? ' We do n't want to fight but ? if we must , we should like to be able to show our teeth and fight like gentlemen , ' that is all that the average man wants with fencing . " " Quite right , " chimed in the Vicomte de G. with a laugh , " we only want just so much of it as will serve . our private ends . " " All that you say , " I continued , " is true , but it is not the whole truth , as you would readily admit if you paid a visit to one of the fencing rooms of Paris . If you happened , for instance , to drop in on my friend and esteemed master , M. Pons , you would find a gathering of amateurs , who are devoted to the practice of arms , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understand thoroughly well how a sword ought to be used . " But , to be quite fair , I must hasten to add that the prowess and prestige of these brilliant players would not suffer by the simplification of sword-play . The point I wish to make is that a treatise on fencing for the use of gentlemen , who have so little time to spare and so much to waste , is a book to be written , a book of real utility and importance , and indeed almost indispensable . I have put my finger on a felt want , and if you will allow me I will briefly explain how I think such a book ought to be written , and what it ought to teach . I know , of course , that I shall be violently contradicted , but after all ? I know that I am on the right track . V. " I have told you that we are asked to make an absolute distinction between two schools of fencing . Obviously it is the new school that is wrong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must give me leave to defend it , or , at all events , to explain its tendencies , logically , theoretically , and practically . " // " Take care , Sir , " a voice was heard to remark , " those three words are decidedly appalling . " " Do n't be afraid , " I answered , " they are not so formidable as they seem at first sight . You will find that if we thresh out the general principles , what I have to say presently will be much simplified and easier to follow . " You often hear men say : There is no pretty fencing nowadays . It has relapsed into its primitive brutality . ' " Not at all , " I should answer , " it has come back to its proper object . For consider , ? an exercise , an art which starts with the fundamental idea of a fight between two men who are thirsting for each other 's blood , can not be regarded as a mere amusement , or as an academical study in civility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that to sacrifice the first essential principle of the art to superior refinements , which were really too exclusive , was a risky game to play , and that , sooner or later , the players were sure to discover that fact to their cost . Now I should maintain that the revolution , which has been brought about , is a clear advance , and only brutal , if 2 8 Secrets of the Sword you will have it so , because it is the assertion of the brutal truth . " With the exception of the few who have the ambition to make themselves accomplished swordsmen , men you meet in the fencing room do not as a rule come there to sit at the feet of the professor , and imbibe the mystic lore of scientific theory which he expounds , but rather to be drilled and disciplined in the practical use of the sword which he holds in his hand . " As a young man I was passionately fond of fencing ; I worked at it with enthusiasm ; my diligence and devotion were untiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really skilful swordsmen , experts worthy of the best days and most glorious traditions of the sword . I am thinking of such men as Ambert , Caccia , Choquet , Lord Seymour , the Marquis de l'Angle and others , a group of amateurs well able to hold their own with the most skilful masters . I believe that at that time , and I give you this as my sincere conviction , fencing reached as high a level as at any period in its history . // VI . " It was the opening of a new era . Hitherto the art had advanced along a narrow track . Now the old ways suddenly broadened out . Old methods were superseded . Fencing was no longer treated as an academical accomplishment , a graceful exercise in courtly skill and bearing , from which originality was barred . It had become something more than the glib repetition ' , of set phrases , that had been got by heart from a book and carefully rehearsed . The new movement , as it may well be called , though it abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought our elusive art back to regions less celestial , I readily admit , but at the same time brought it face to face with other than imaginary difficulties . " The art received a new impetus . Natural fighters , ' men equipped with abundant energy and assurance , who were convinced that all that was necessary for self-defence was a general athletic training such as they possessed , called the fencer 's skill in question . Regarded as fencing their style may have been faulty , not to say atrocious , but they confronted the fencer with this logical dilemma : ? ' You are a master // of the sword or an accomplished amateur , I , on the other hand , know nothing about it . Hit me and do not let me hit you . That is all I ask . I shall fight by the light of nature and do what I can ; you will be strictly scientific and keep to your rules . ' " To my mind the only way to silence an opponent of this sort was to take sword in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally ignorant and incapable . This course , however , did not commend itself to others , who were content to fight this modern hydra , which reappeared every day in some new shape , with ? contempt . " The professors gnashed their teeth and swore , though a few of them kept their tem-per : - Is our Art then , ' they declaimed , ' a mere delusion , a fallen idol ? Are we to prostitute and expose it to the barbarous excesses of a brutal and ignorant mob ? Are we to join in an outlandish Babel , where every one claims to be heard in his own tongue , some jargon which no one can understand ? ' " There certainly was something in this line The First Evening 3 1 of argument , however magisterially it might be stated . But at the same time it was impossible to deny that there was , wrapped up in these ungainly eccentricities , a real truth , which could not be entirely neglected . For among the noisy crowd , who would have liked to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , men who by long training and-the use of scientific method had acquired sound judgment and thorough workmanship . These men , it is true , had the courage to trample on the ancient superstitions , and gladly welcomed the widening of the field , which would give ample room , and scope for every kind of bias . " It was clearly a revolution , and declared itself by the unmistakable signs of all revolutions , by its aggressive attitude and by its onslaught on old ideas and traditions , which till then had been thought unassailable . " Moliere 's famous maxim , ? ' Hit and do n't be hit back , ' ? asserted itself triumphantly . Truth and falsehood went hand in hand . The thing to be done was to winnow the chaff from the corn , and not reject the whole as worthless . // VII . " Well , let us now see if we can sum up the real changes which the new school introduced . " As a matter of fact it proposed absolutely none that was unreasonable . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judged not so much by his graceful attitude and classical style , not so much by his masterly command of precise execution , as by his power of quickly conceiving and quickly delivering the right attack at the right moment . When once a beginner has learnt the rudiments of sword-play ; when he has learnt that the movements of hand and body must correspond , and maintain an even balance in every position ; that the wrist must be quick to follow the adverse blade and form a close parry , without flying wild and wide in uncontrolled disorder ; when he can appreciate the value of a step to the rear and the value of a step to the front ; when he has grasped the danger to which he is exposed in making a complicated attack , and realises that the effectiveness of a simple attack depends on the power of seizing the critical moment , ? then he should be left to follow his natural instinct , and allowed to exercise his own judgment in making use of the knowledge he has acquired . ' " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now describe an exact circle , beyond which , by thought , word , or deed , you must not budge . You find it a more natural position , and easier for attack and riposte , to lean your body forward and double yourself up . It can not be helped , you are required to keep the " body upright by the rules of classical fencing . You prefer to keep out of distance , because you find that at close quarters your nervous dread of a surprise attack or of a quick thrust is disconcerting and disturbs your equanimity . You must not keep out of distance . You are required to keep the prescribed distance and to join blades . You are afraid of attacks on the sword , such as beats , binds , and pressures , or of surprise attacks , and to avoid them you refuse to engage your adversary 's blade . You must not refuse . You are required to engage swords by the rules of the game ; only bad fencers attempt to avoid the engagement . ' You attack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the belt . Quite true , the hit would be fatal in a duel , but in swordplay it is considered a foul blow ; the code does not allow it , therefore the hit is bad . ' VIII . " This sort of thing is mistaken prejudice . The assault ought to be a sham fight . " It follows that everyone should have liberty of action . Do not attempt to force A. to be graceful and elegant , if he is not built that way . Permit B. to develope his own style in his own fashion , and do not try to make him a servile copy of yourself , merely for the sake of emphasising your superiority . If he makes mistakes , take advantage of them , that is the most convincing kind of correction . If his play is dangerous but incorrect , show him that you can be at once correct and dangerous . " In short we ask for a fair field and no favour for every sort of style and theory that is based on a study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application . Do you seriously believe that these fencers are devoid of science , because they refuse to be judged by your standard , or because they try // to obtain new results , where you persist in seeing nothing but annoying tricks ? " You must allow one of two things . Either the methods which these fencers employ , their plans of attack and defence , are based on policy and their knowledge of the weapon , and their source of inspiration is the same as yours ; in that case they are justified by results , they have teeth and can bite , and are not the easy prey , which you expected to find them . Or on the contrary , they go to work without judgment , they let fly at random , and advance or retire without any notion of time or distance , their parries are wide and weak , without any sense of touch , their attacks uncertain , wild and inco herent . In that case they are not dangerous . Chance may perhaps protect them once , but you with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their slap-dash play will lead them promptly into every trap which you choose to set for them . IX . " Such is the controversy , the great quarrel between the two schools , the feud between the // white rose and the red . I have attempted to explain it to you in its general outlines as clearly as I possibly could . You will find it easier to understand the details , which we shall consider when we continue this discussion . " " What will your subject be to-morrow ? " asked my host . " I really can not say , " I replied . " It would be difficult to lay down a regular plan . No doubt something will turn up to talk about . And , by the way , this morning I noticed in the library one or two old books about sword-play , and I shall try to find time to turn them over . " The Second Evening I. I T began to dawn upon me that my undertaking was more serious than I had anticipated , and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I should have to advance solid reasons in support of the theories that I had so rashly propounded . I had committed myself to nothing less than the exposition of a system to men who , for the most part , knew nothing at all about swordplay , and could not be expected to understand the meaning of the technical terms . I - should // have to be clear and precise and ready to answer any questions that might be put to me . I was particularly anxious to carry my little audience with me , because I venture to think that no gentleman 's education is complete without some knowledge of fencing , and I consider that parents and guardians are much to blame if they fail to recognise the two-fold importance of this indispensable exercise , which not only strengthens and developes the learner 's body , but also insures his life . " Ah , " I exclaimed , as I joined the company in the smoking-room , where we met every evening , " my audience I see is before me . " You have kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we have kept an armchair waiting for you . Sit down , and begin as soon as you please . " " Thank you , " I replied sitting down , ? " I will begin at once . " II . " I remarked , yesterday , that the art of fencing would greatly benefit by simplification , and that it does not require such formidable and protracted // study as some of the text-books by their elaborate display of intricate and interminable combinations would lead you to suppose . " The elementary principles of sword-play are four in number . They are these : Table // " My classification , you see , is not very complicated . " " But , " some one objected , " you are surely forgetting to name an immense number of strokes and parries ; for it is impossible that the long lists of names , which are given in the books , and the directions for the various passes , which have the air of cabalistic formulae and are about equally intelligible , can be reduced to such simple terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I replied , " in fact more than willing , for I am convinced that they only serve to distract the learner 's mind . The simpler the principles , the simpler the practice . Give him fewer things to do , and he will do them more easily , and he will certainly learn to do them in a shorter time . " I have always said that a text-book of fencing , which contained nothing that was superfluous , would not fill a volume but might be written out on a sheet of notepaper , and besides , I would have you notice that several // of the attacks , parries , and ripostes included in my list might logically have been omitted , because they are simply different ways of executing the same movement . " For instance , what I have called " One , two " is the combination of two disengagements , one delivered in quarte , the other in tierce . The beat straight thrust is the combination of a beat on the sword with a straight thrust . The beat disco age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut-over , feint disengage are in like manner the different methods , which are most commonly used , of executing the straight //trust or the disengagement , the two fundamental strokes of sword-play . " Even the cut-over is really a sort of disengagement , since it starts from the same position , is aimed at the same point , and may be met by the same parries . The only difference is that the disengagement passes under the blade , while the cut-over passes over the point . The cut-over and disengage in quarte is the same movement as counter-quarte , conceived and executed in the one rase as an attack , in the other as a parry . Cutover and disengage in tierce is related in precisely the same way to counter-tierce. // " You see , then , that the multiplication of strokes , far from extending to infinity , may be reduced to very narrow limits . And I am firmly convinced , that if you transgress these limits you are at once involved in endless confusion , which you ought to be very careful to avoid. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of my argument . " The attacks and parries which I have described traverse all the lines which are open to the passage of the sword , that is to say the high and low lines , the inside lines and the outside . The fencer whose mind is set free from the perplexity of parries complete and parries intermediate and so forth , understands more clearly the materials that are available for his combinations , and the measures that he must take to meet the adverse attack . " The lucidity of his mind is reflected even in the movement of his hand which goes straight to its mark without hesitation or confusion . Speed and freedom of delivery follow as a matter of course . And we must not forget that quickness of hand , combined with what may be called fencing judgment , is of all qualifications the most important , the most necessary , the most vitally indispensable . The Second Evening 45 IV . " We may as well follow up the turn our conversation has taken , and pass under review without further preface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPEED . The man who should master these three would be the pattern of the perfect fencer . " Well , what of fencing judgment ? Why in the world should you be afraid of it , as though it were the hundred-headed hydra that guards the sacred portals ? What is it but that part of the understanding that we all bring to bear on the conduct of everyday life ? Nothing in human affairs however trivial or however great can be done without it . " Fencing judgment implies more especially distrust , cunning , a wise caution , the power of interpreting the dumb language of the sword , t he faculty of drawing correct inferences . These faculties are in the first instance directly stimulated by the master 's lessons , and natural intelligence , acting without any conscious effort // on your part , combined with experience , will make the good seed grow . Do not concern yourself about it . Over-anxiety always has a most disturbing effect on the mind . " The other night when I spoke of the alphabet of fencing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a language of the sword , by which questions are asked and answered . As soon as you have learnt the words you can speak and understand it . To admit that it is necessary to make a separate study of every possible phrase implies that a simple and straightforward method of instruction , which I hold to be of the highest importance , is unattainable . V. " In like manner the faculty of control is a thing that may be gradually acquired by practice . It is the result of imparting a supple temper ' to the wrist and body , and consists in the knitting up of the various operations into one continuous movement . But , as in the case of fencing judgment , so here , the desired result // can not be obtained all at once . It is the first and most natural consequence of your master 's instructions . It comes of daily practice and you must : patiently watch and wait for it , as you might wait for a peach slowly ripening on ' a sunny wall . Let it grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till it becomes a second nature . " Speed , not of course mere quickness of hand , but the rapid execution of every movement , is one of the fencer 's great resources , whether in attack , parry , or retreat . It is to my mind the main point to be insisted on from the very first . " And , accordingly , I think that the master should be careful not to overdo the sort of teaching , that consists in delivering a running commentary such as this : ? Steady now : not too fast : take your time about it : think what you are doing : keep your hand in order : mark each motion : at the word one , ? and so forth : do n't hurry , you will go fast enough by and by . ' " It is certainly useful to practise the hand by exercising it on the master 's jacket , but it is useless to practise it by slow movements . First explain how the stroke is to be executed , and then without more ado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quickly . Slowness is convenient , because it renders execution easy , but the ease of execution that is derived from it is dangerous , because it reacts on the judgment and accustoms the mind to lazy ways . Your object is , no doubt , to bring the hand under control and analyse the stroke in detail , but if the result of your teaching is that your pupil falls into a sluggish habit . you are sowing the seeds of a vice , which you will probably never succeed in extirpating . " Suppose you are teaching a child to walk , you are not surprised that his first steps are wavering and unsteady , and that he can not plant his feeble feet firmly on the ground . You hold him up , but you let him walk . In due time he learns to use his strength , as a bird learns to fly . The young fencer is the child learning to walk . As his knowledge and experience gradually expand , many faults will disappear of themselves , or will be more easily seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mechanical force , unreasoning , unconscious , but a force capable of development . You must add fuel to the fire and not allow it to go out . Do you suppose that all you have to do is to change the word of command : ? Now do quickly what you have done slowly 49 hitherto ' ? Your new command introduces a new idea and creates new difficulties . ' " Such , speaking generally , are the essential principles of fencing . 1 can not say whether I have succeeded in showing you clearly how siniple the lesson on these lines may be made , or how far I have been able to reassure those , who have inadvertently opened a treatise on sword-play and have fought shy of the subject ever since , but I am convinced that a course of instruction such as I suggest would produce very good results . " To explain myself more fully , as I am talking among friends and there are no professors present , I will go on to tell you briefly how I should set about teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar during the first month to give up half an hour a day to foil practice , and after that to keep it up three times a week . My first lesson would be devoted to // showing him theoretically and practically the vital importance of establishing a perfect concert or balance between the various movements . This is the fundamental principle of all athletic exercises , and applies equally to riding , swimming , gymnastics , and to fencing . " I should make him advance and retire , lunge and recover , taking care not to lose his balance . This first lesson is sufficient to enable the least intelligent to understand the mechanism of the different movements , which are based on the natural and instinctive faculties of the human body . " Come , C , " I said , rising from my chair , " unless I am mistaken , you have never attempted to fence . Will you allow me to make use of you by way of illustration ? " " I shall be delighted , " replied C , " but I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first five minutes . It is the common lot from which no one can escape . Now place yourself On guard ' ; the words explain themselves : ? to be on guard , to protect yourself , that is to say to hold yourself equally ready for attack or defence . " Bend your legs . Let me use an expression // Which is perhaps incorrect but which explains my meaning clearly : ? Sit well down . " Your right arm must be half extended . As a general rule the wrist should be at the height of the breast . You will be able later to modify these elementary studies , by adapting them to suit the position which comes to you most naturally . The important thing is to acquire an uncramped easy style , and to keep the body evenly balanced . In this position the sword can most easily traverse the various openings that are offered to it . " I advance on you . In order to get back and always keep your distance you have only to carry the left foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it immediately . To advance on me , simply reverse these movements . Bring the right foot forward and follow it up with the left . " Bravo ! you advance like a professor . See that you keep your legs bent and the body upright , so as to be always ready for advance or retreat . If you can not avoid stooping , lean forward rather than backward . By carrying the body forward you are no more exposed than you were before ; for the body by its inclined position protects itself , presents a smaller sur5 2 Secrets of the Sword face , and makes it more difficult for your opponent to fix his point , when he might otherwise hit you ; but if you throw the body back , you lose the power of making a quick attack and a quick riposte . Are you tired ? " " N o . " Good ! That shows that your position is correct , and that it does not cramp your muscles or paralyse any of your movements . You understand , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversary . " So much for defence . Now , for the attack . VII . " In order to attack , you lunge , by carrying the right leg smartly forward and straightening the left , so as to give the body its full extension . " Whatever the attack may be , whether simple or composite , the movements of the hand must be completed and the arm absolutely straight , before the lunge is made , though the different movements must follow each other without the least interval . // " It is equally important to remember that the recovery must be as smart as the attack . The , great danger of the attack is that it should be too intemperate. for a too intemperate attack leaves you exposed to danger , without strength or speed to escape . " " But , " some one asked , " is it really necessary when you are on guard , to arrange the left arm above the head in a graceful curve , and then swing it down to the leg as you lunge ? " The graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind your back if you prefer to do so , for if you bring it to the front you drag forward the left shoulder , and thereby expose a larger target to your opponent 's point . The arm , you see , acts the part of a rope-walker 's balancing pole . It steadies the movements and balances the weight of the body . Since you have a spare arm you must place it somewhere , and if you consider you will see that it is least in the way where I have placed it . It serves a useful purpose in the general arrangement , ? that is the only object of the position . I need not refine the point further . " In fencing , the movements of the body // . and limbs are of great importance . All the mechanical part of sword-play depends on the principles which I have just explained . I have now taken the mechanism to pieces and shown you how it is put together . VIII . " One word more . What was the reason for choosing this attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are natural and instinctive . Instinct dictated the rule , which is based on experience , on practical necessity , on correct principle . " What is the object to be attained ? " First , for defence , to allow the limbs their complete liberty of action , their natural elasticity and easy play ; secondly for attack , to give the extension of the body its full force . " Now try to change the position ; straighten your legs ; you will at once notice the increased difficulty of executing the different movements , whether of attack , defence , or retreat . You lose your balance , and the lunge either precedes the // action of the hand and the extension of the arm , or follows those movements too late . " The legs are springs which support the body and determine its most rapid movements . If you are out shooting and want to jump a ditch , you bend your legs in order to obtain the necessary spring . Or again , if you jump down from a height , you bend your legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not , your whole body is jarred . " I dwell on this point in order to convince you of its absolute necessity , and to make you understand clearly the why and wherefore of the position . But , I repeat , instinct was the first teacher , experience came later and has only confirmed the principle . " One last caution . When once you have learnt by practice how to harmonise your movements , and have realised how great a power at a given moment the faculty of making these movements with ease and rapidity may be , then , and not till then , venture to take your personal inclination into account . And if after carefully weighing the pros and cons you come to the conclusion that you can , owing to some personal peculiarity , improve upon the elementary rules of the lesson , do not hesitate to depart from // them without scruple , but never without good reason . The best position is that which allows you complete freedom and perfect balance . But never forget that all exaggeration is bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ungraceful and ungainly style . That is all I have to say this evening . " The Third Evening I. We will continue the course of instruction of which you have studied at present only the first page ; I am going into very minute detail , as you see . " Our scholar now knows the different positions , and can appreciate why they are to be commended , and what is to be gained by adopting them . At the next Lesson , ? and each lesson would consist of not more than three bouts of eight or ten minutes each , ? I should show him and make him execute the simple // need not now recur to the consideration of general principles , with which you are already acquainted . I I. " If we could return to the past , and witness an exhibition of sword-play as it was understood by the professors of only fifty years ago , what a contrast we should find with the style of our own day , even with our most severely classical style . Our methods would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very long since to display upon the bosom a fair red heart , stitched to the fencing jacket , to show plainly for all eyes to see the spot where hits should be placed . Attacks , parries and ripostes were restricted by convention to a very narrow circle . Any hit that went wide of the mark was accounted execrable and received with the most profound contempt . Modern fencing is inclined to be somewhat less fastidious . Hits in the low line are generally acknowledged . But a hit below the belt ! You really do not expect me to follow your point down there V is still the attitude of most fencers. // ' Call it a hit if you like , but really it is not fencing . A school of arms , you know , is not a school of surgery , you might leave those base regions to the medical students . ' " You smile , but I assure you that they mean it seriously , without the least sarcasm . It is quite true that any wound in that despised region would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail ; and they forget that a sword , though it may be a civil and gentlemanly imple ment , is still a lethal weapon . It really is very strange to admit that it is wrong to disregard the deadly character of the point when aimed in one direction , but to claim that it is right to disregard it when aimed in another . Yet most men cling to this error with the utmost perti nacity . " That you should despise a hit in the leg or fore-arm I can well understand . By all means concentrate your whole attention on the pro tection of the parts of the body which contain the vital organs . But not to use your utmost cre , your surest parries , your most anxious precautions to defend the trunk , high lines and Iow , ? always has been and is still a delusion , a delusion which those who attempt to draw an 6 8 2 Secrets of the Sword impossible distinction between the assaults of foil-play and real fighting with sharp swords , vainly ask us to accept as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real distinction , for after all foilplay can only be an imperfect representation of real fighting . Our object should be to make the resemblance as perfect as possible , and so minimise the chances on which the ignorant and brutal too confidently rely . " Let them see that you both know the correct answer to a correct combination , and that you are equally prepared to deal with the wild and disorderly antics of an untutored point . " You may often hear men say : ? ' I do that in the fencing room , I should be very sorry to attempt it in a serious fight . ' " Then why attempt it at all ? If your judgment tells you that the stroke is good , it is good for all occasions . If it is bad it can not be justified in any case . " Always bear in mind that you must pay attention to all thrusts which might prove fatal // in a serious encounter , and then if some day you have the misfortune to find a real sword in your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fore-armed by habit against known and familiar dangers . I can not emphasise this point too strongly . " In short , the refusal to acknowledge hits however low is a dangerous and a gratuitous mistake . Why should a thrust aimed in that direction not be of its kind as brilliant and meritorious as another ? Why should it be boy-cotted ? Is there any reason for this mysterious taboo ? " " The old master who used to teach us fencing at school , " remarked my host , " would fall foul of you with a vengeance , if he heard you talk like that . " " I do not mean for a moment , " I replied , " that I have any preference for hits in the low line , but rather that I am more afraid of them , because I have fenced too often with fencers good and had not to know how necessary it is to be on one 's guard against the dangers of wild play . " For instance , those who make a practice of // straightening their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the point of their weapon , whether they wish it or no , is necessarily directed towards the low line . It is equally in evitable that the same part should be threatened by those who rightly or wrongly reverse the lunge by throwing the left foot back on your attack , at the same time stooping forwards , so as to let your point pass over their head ; and ignorant fencers nearly always hit you there , quite innocently and unintentionally . " You should therefore guard that part of the body as strictly as you guard the chest , and , by a parity of reasoning , when you meet an adversary who neglects to protect the low line annoy him in that region frequently . IV . " It often happens that things that are most neglected in one age become the ruling fashions of the next , just as things once highly honoured may often fall into complete discredit . " Take this instance . In an old and dusty folio , entitled Academie de l'Espee , ' which I // discovered yesterday banished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages entirely devoted to the art of delivering a stroke with the point at the right eye . ' The point is specified because in those days cuts and thrusts were held in equal favour . " What do you say to a thrust in the eye ? And yet if you will consult my folio you will lind a collection of plates illustrating all the passes by which this brilliant stroke may be brought off . " You know what is thought now-a-days of a hit in the face , that is to say on the mask ; we are taught , ? again quite wrongly , ? not to take the smallest notice of it . And this leads me to hope that some day we may yet see a revolution , by which the vulgar belly will claim its rights and in its turn drive out the lordly bosom . It will be rated too highly then , as it is too much degraded now . But when did revolutions ever know where to stop ? " For the assault the one thing needful is self-reliance . Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to repeat word for word the lesson that you have got by heart from your book , but rather look for inspiration to the resources of your native wit . // V. " If any one came to me for advice , the course I should recommend , not as a hard and fast rule , but in a general way , would be something of this sort : ? Act as much as possible on the defensive , keep out of distance , in order to prevent your opponent from attacking you without shifting his position , and in order to compel him to advance on your point , the most dangerous thing he can do , and without a doubt the most difficult art to acquire . If you make up your mind to stand your ground whatever happens , and to attack always in exact measure , instead of retiring and advancing with quick and irregular movements , and instead of trying to surprise and overwhelm your adversary with combinations for which he is unprepared , you are to my mind simply acting without the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then I should go on to say , always supposing that I was asked for my opinion : Make a practice of stepping back as you form the parry , if only half a pace . There is everything to be gained by it , and there is no objection to I // it that I can see , unless it be the strong objection that your opponent will feel to being considerably embarrassed on every possible occasion . " The advantages , on the other hand , are manifold . By stepping back you increase the effectiveness of the parry , because by withdrawing the body you , in a sense , double the rapidity of the hand . If the attack has been delivered with sufficient rapidity to beat the parry , by retiring you parry twice , the first time with your blade , with which you try to find your adversary 's weapon , the second time by removing the body to a greater distance , with the result that the point , which would have hit you if you had stood your ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against simple attacks you counteract rapidity of execution , and by employing it against composite attacks or against feints you encounter the last movement forcibly . It is also of service in screening one from attacks made by drawing back the arm , for it often happens if you stand your ground , that your hand starts too soon , and your sword encounters nothing but empty air . It has the further advantage of increasing the fencer 's confidence in himself . " Do not imagine that it hinders the riposte. 8 8 Secrets of the Sword It renders it easier and more certain . Nearly always , when a fencer has lunged right out , and ? as often happens ? does not recover immediately , the two opponents are so close together that it is very difficult to get in the riposte without shortening the arm , and so giving an opportunity for a remise . " The parry and riposte without breaking ground are certainly of value , I do not dispute that , but against the fencers of all sorts , whom you have to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they should not be employed except occasionally , and only when they are almost certain to succeed . To my mind . it would be dangerous and unreasonable to adopt them as the systematic basis of your play . VI . " My reason for insisting so strongly on this point is that I have nearly always found that it is thought to be very magnificent to stand up to the parry , whereas breaking ground is regarded as the shift of a man hard pressed , a last resort when the hand has proved too slow , or when it is necessary to retrieve an error of judgment . " Now my plan provides you with a second // line of defence , without infringing any of the recognised canons ; it is consistent with the most classical style , and with perfect control of your weapon . And one may well ask why , when two chances of safety are at your disposal , you should deliberately resolve to avail yourself of only one of them ? " I should accordingly reverse the usual advice , thus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you parry , either by a few inches or by a clear pace , according to the momentum of your opponent 's attack , for by breaking ground I do not mean to say that you are to avoid a hit by continual and precipitate bolting . Sometimes stand firm , but only when you are sure that you have at last induced your opponent to develope an attack , which you have long been waiting for him to make . ' VII . " Unless I know my man , or have come to an understanding with him beforehand , I have very little faith in a prolonged concatenation of parries , ripostes and counter-ripostes , and here again I should try to relieve the mind , as much // as may be , from an unnecessary burden , by getting rid of complications instead of multiplying them . " I look at it in this way . If a fencer has to concern himself with the different lines in which he may be attacked , he must be in a state of continual suspense . He will be continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line or the outside , in the high line or the low . Thus , in order to parry to advantage and correctly he must wait until his enemy 's object is clearly disclosed . Take the case of a simple attack promptly executed ; it is obvious that the attacker must gain a considerable start . True , there are a few fencers , but very few , gifted with so fine a sense of touch , that they can divine their adversary 's intention , and read his inmost thought . " Less gifted mortals should be content with a parry which mechanically traverses all the lines . Such a parry must of necessity encounter the adverse blade forcibly in whichever line the enemy has selected for his attack . When once you have acquired this universal parry the strain is lessened , your mind is more at ease , you are more sure of yourself and feel that you can act with certainty and decision . The Fourth Evening VIII . " There are two kinds of parry , among those which I enumerated the other day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in combining the parry of tierce or counter tierce with a cut over and beat in quarte ; the second in parrying counter tierce and counter quarte in succession , and vice versa , or counter quarte and circle . " These covering parries though they are technically composite , in practice are fairly simple , and rapidly pass through all the lines that are open to attack . Choose the one which you prefer instinctively , which is another way of saying the one that conies most naturally to your hand . Or , if you like , use sometimes one , sometimes the other . " " But what if this parry is deceived ? " asked the Comte de R. " Well , " I answered , " Deception no cheating ' is the fencer 's motto . There is no such thing as an attack that can not be parried , or a parry that can not be deceived . Sooner or later the fatal // moment comes , and superior activity or superior cunning prevails . " If any professor can invent an attack which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to deceive , I should advise him to take very good care to secure the patent rights of his invention without a moment 's delay . He would certainly have no difficulty in floating a company to put it on the market in all the capitals of Europe . " I have already expressed my opinion that a fencer 's strength lies much more in presence of mind and in quickness of hand than in a very varied play . This is so true that the majority of fencers , amateur and professional alike , affect certain favourite strokes ; they have favourite attacks , favourite parries and ripostes , and always come back to them as to old friends on whose services they can confidently rely . In the course of an assault the same stroke is often repeated in many different ways ; the shape it takes changes with the changing incidents of the fight , and accordingly as it is adapted to suit the peculiarities of the individual against whom it is employed . That is the great beauty of a stroke in fencing . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fencers , but there are one or two connoisseurs present , who have studied the art , and are experts . It is to them that I now appeal . As an illustration of my argument I will take the most simple parry , the parry of quarte , and I will ask them if it is not the fact that it constantly changes and undergoes surprising transformations ? Sometimes it is a light touch , sometimes a vigorous , almost a violent blow ; it may form a high parry , it may form a low parry , it serves for every purpose and answers every call that can be made upon it . Watch the blade as the parry is formed ; ? perhaps it just meets the adverse blade and suddenly quits it or it may hold and dominate it . " It is this power of varying the stroke and transforming it at will that marks the true fencer . " The man , I repeat , who is content to recite his lesson by rote , however well he has learnt it , can never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accomplished parrot , whichever he prefers . // IX . " I was reading one of the ancient treatises , which are reposing peacefully on your dusty shelves , my dear C. , when I came across the following passage , which rather struck my fancy The law of defence declares that your motions should be the natural motions of a man 's body . But , however sacred the dignity of law may be , nevertheless you ought to consider that necessity knows no law , and that it overrides even the weightiest laws of human contrivance . " That was written in i600 . The maxim is a trifle too sweeping for general application , but it seems to me to be a good and serviceable maxim when applied to sword-play . " My remarks are perhaps somewhat disconnected . I am simply giving you my ideas at random , as they occur to me . But my main object is to direct your attention to the points which appear to me of some importance . " After the parries come the ripostes . On this subject a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and riposte are twin sisters , // whose lives are so closely bound up in each other , that they can not exist apart . Riposte and parry ought to be so closely allied that the riposte may seem to be the second part of the parry . Therefore , as a general principle , riposte direct , in the line in which you have found the blade . Changing the line wastes time , and gives your adversary an opportunity to pull himself together and make a remise or renew the attack . Never , on any consideration , allow yourself to draw back your arm , for then your riposte is lost , ? as well throw your purse in the gutter . " If your judgment tells you that your adversary is waiting for your direct riposte , and has attacked you with the object of drawing it , or if you have noticed that he covers himself effectively on that side , while he leaves you a clear opening elsewhere , then avoid the trap by a disengagement or a cut-over ; but only make one feint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , though you may succeed once , you will probably find out later that your success was dearly bought . It is always wise , you know , to count the cost , and economise your resources , unless you wish to take the straight road to ruin . // X. " Our chat to-night , " I remarked after a moment 's silence , " if it has not been very long , has at least been very serious . I only complain that you have not sufficiently interrupted me . " " We have been listening to you , " said the Comte de R. , " very attentively , because you warned us of the importance of your subject . " " Very well , my dear R. , " I replied . " Now just imagine you are in court , and let us hear how you would sum up the case for the benefit of the jury . " " I fancy I can do that rather well , " answered R. " Let me try : ? The lesson , you say , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a free field for enterprise , where he must stand or fall by dint of his own unaided genius . The only counsels , which are worth anything , are those which have governed attack and defence from time immemorial . For attack , the union of desperate energy with cool and calculating caution ; for defence , firmness , wariness , selfreliance . " Then , passing from the general question to // points of detail , or execution , I should add It is a great mistake , a piece of inconceivable folly , to have boycotted , to use your own expression , hits in the very low lines , because the fencer is prevented thereby from acquiring the habit of strictly guarding those parts of the body , where in a serious encounter any wound would probably prove fatal . " As a general rule step back as you form the parry , to make assurance doubly sure , and to give greater freedom to your riposte . Stand your ground only when you think you have judged the stroke to a nicety , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he can not escape . " " I am infinitely obliged to you , my dear R. , " I remarked . " You have summarised most excel lently the points that I have worked out in detail , and you have exactly caught my meaning . " " Very good of you to say so , " answered R. , " but let me finish : ? In order to keep your wits about you , and to avoid trying to think of too many things at once , adopt as a rule a universal parry , which will cut all the lines , and must meet and drive away your opponent 's blade . // Always riposte direct , and be careful on your riposte to avoid making feints which expose you to a remise or to a renewal of the attack . Does that satisfy you ? " " You have taken us over the ground most admirably , my dear Professor . To-morrow , I propose to discuss the attack , and in this connection we shall have to consider what is usually called Ye sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To this sovereign principle we are asked to swear allegiance , as though it occupied the throne by divine right . I shall ask you to consider the pretensions of another claimant of very noble lineage to a share of the royal honours . " The Fifth Evening ALTHOUGH our conversation was quite informal and simply an after-dinner amusement , I found that it involved diligent preparation , especially when I was approaching one of the questions where I was in open conflict with current theories , which are often taken for granted on no better ground than their respectable antiquity . One of these theories , which is described in fencing language as the importance of judging the blade by touch , I was now prepared to // challenge , and I was ready to maintain the superiority of another principle , against which the professors raise their voices , almost with one accord , in a chorus of unmerited abuse . Accordingly when we assembled in the smokingroom , I took my usual seat and began without preface . I I. " Perhaps I had better explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that , as soon as you have come on guard , you break away from the engagement , and avoid crossing swords with your adversary , instead of allowing the blades to remain in contact . " This , I consider , was one of the most successful innovations of what it is the fashion to call The New School ' ; and I am therefore very far from sharing the opinions of the professors , who discover in the practice the corruption of the best traditions of sword-play , and declare that the refusal to join blades is equivalent to fencing blindfold , and without judgment ; it leads , they say , to mutual hits , and deprives the fencer of one of the finest accomplishments he can acquire , the power of judging the sword by touch . // " Undoubtedly the fencer 's touch is a great resource ; I am even willing to allow that it is invaluable , and it is a thing that can only be obtained by practice and perseverance ; it gives lightness and dexterity to the hand , and enables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is the refined result that is derived from extreme ease in regulating the extension of the arm , from exquisite subtlety in the use of the fingers , and from precision of play , which involves its victim almost unawares , dismays , and utterly confounds him . I profess the greatest admiration for this consummate power of fence , so seldom seen to perfection . No one can think more highly of it than I do , and on that account I am strongly convinced of the necessity of devising a means to resist it , when it is used against me . I shall perhaps be told to combat it by an equally fine sense of touch ; ? but it is still more rare to see a bout of fencing in which the two men are evenly matched in this respect , and general principles should be based on general grounds , not on exceptional cases . // " The man who possesses this consummate sleight of touch may almost be said to control his opponent 's blade by the exercise of his will . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it what he pleases . If you refuse the engagement , you create a difficulty for him ; if you do not allow him to bring his blade into contact with yours , you put an impediment in his way , which his skill will doubtless overcome , but with less certainty ; his course is not so clear , and he is no longer completely master of the situation . For if you join blades you are always within striking distance of his point , that is to say he can attack you at any moment without shifting his ground . Now such attacks are exceedingly difficult to stop , even for the most practised hand , especially simple attacks such as straight thrusts or simple disengage ments . " The mind perpetually held in suspense is harassed and distressed , you have no leisure to think for yourself and are demoralised by the slow torture of a constant strain . For , I repeat , it is very rare to find two fencers so evenly matched in this respect that the risk is equally divided . " In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Fifth Evening io5 please . ' In the other case : ' By refusing the engagement you can at first keep your opponent out of distance , which will compel him to advance in order to attack you , and so give you fair warning of his intention . You are no longer exposed to the paralysing influence of a constantly threatened attack , which destroys your liberty of action and judgment ; you disconcert your adversary by leaving him in the dark as to the line in which he will encounter your blade ; and you can choose your own time , when you are ready to attack or parry , to engage his blade with decision . ' " For my own part , I am quite satisfied that the system is a safe and sound defensive measure , which offers advantages that can not be denied . Pressures , binds , beats and croises , all those dangerous movements by which your opponent can bring the fort of his blade to bear on the faible of yours , are rendered very difficult to perform , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least so nearly eliminated , that their occurrence is a rare event . 1 06 Secrets of the Sword IV . " I have endeavoured to state as clearly as possible the advantages that a weak fencer may derive from this system , when he is opposed to a combatant more experienced and more skilful than himself ; but further than that , I believe that the skilful and experienced fencer has also something to gain by adopting this much despised method . I have myself never been able to discover that it is incompatible with perfect form , ' or that it tends to wild play . It opens a wider field , it shows the fallacy of certain ideas , which have been wrongly supposed to be unassailable , and it furnishes a whole range of new situations , another world to conquer . " What ground is there , I would ask my critic , for your assertion that I must be fencing blindly , because my sword does not happen to be in constant touch with yours ? Why do you say that mutual hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of duffers , who charge each other blindly , you may trust them to commit every possible blunder , whether they join blades or not . " But why should you exalt so highly what // you call the faculty of touch , the power of judging the blade by touch , and be so ready to degrade that other sovereign principle , which may be called the faculty of sight , the power of judging the sword by eye ? Can you deny the controlling influence of the eye , the authority that belongs to it ? Do you believe that the eye can not be trained to the same degree of nicety as the hand ? Why , when you have these two forces at your disposal , are you content to let one of them do duty for both ? " You may keep your opponent at his distance by the menace of your nimble point , which flashes in his sight incessantly ; while your watchful eye follows the movements of his sword and reads his thought , as well as if the blades were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel . Then , when it suits your convenience , when you see a favourable opportunity , when you have by a rapid calculation reckoned up the situation , weighed the chances , taken everything into account , then is the time to offer your sword , then is the time to engage your adversary , or by bold decided movements to get control of his blade . " // V. " But , " objected one of my hearers , " what if your adversary adopts the same tactics , and refuses the engagement ? " " That is where science and strength , skill and personal superiority tell . What is fencing if it is not the art of leading your opponent into a trap , the art of making him think that he will be attacked in one place , when you mean to hit him in another ? the skill to outwit his calculations , to master his game , paralyse his action , outmanoeuvre him , reduce him to impotence ? ? That is the sort of thing the accomplished fencer sets himself to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an engagement . Very good ; then you must force him to it by feints , or by threatening to attack . Either he attempts to parry or he attempts to thrust . In either case you get command of his blade by a simple or by a double beat , as the case may be , and then you drive your attack home . " It holds good with fencing , as it does with all warlike measures , whether on a large scale or // small , that you must not wait for what you want to be brought to you ; you must learn to help yourself ; take no denial , but by force or fraud get possession . " Now , I appeal to you all as critics , not on a technical question of fencing , on which no one can be expected to give an opinion without a thorough knowledge of the art , but on a simpler matter . I will contrast two assaults . Imagine that you are the spectators . The first is between two fencers of the classical school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are crossed , and the two adversaries , both gifted with consummate skill , stand facing each other , foot to foot . Feint follows feint , and parry parry ; a simple attack is delivered , it is succeeded by a combination . The attitudes of both are irreproachable ; the body always upright ; the quick hand with exquisite finesse manipulates the dancing point by subtle and accurate finger-play . You admire the exhibition ; for a moment you follow the quick passage of the blades , but your sympathies are not aroused , you are not carried away , or enthralled in spite of yourself in a fever of anxious expectation . r to Secrets of the Sword " Now turn to the other assault . This also is fought by two skilful fencers , but they go to work on quite a different system . " Look at the combatants . Instead of standing foot to foot , and blade to blade , they are out of distance , on the alert , ready to strike but cautious . Their eyes follow each other , and watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades cross , interlock , and break away . That was a searching thrust ! But by a sudden retreat , a rapid movement , perhaps a leap backwards , the fencer evades the hit , and is ready on the instant to give back the point . This assault is a battle between two men , who mean hard fighting , keen swordsmen , dodgy , artful , and slippery , who bring to bear all their science , employ every trick they can think of , and throw themselves body and soul into the fight . " Now let me ask you , which of these two assaults is the more interesting to follow ? The Fifth Evening r t r VI . " I remember an assault , in M. Pons 's rooms , between one of my friends and a man who was generally considered and really was a strong fencer , although he insisted on clinging to that mischievous routine , which with some men is a superstition . " They came on guard , and my friend , after crossing swords to show that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked , and hit his opponent several times . But , Sir , ' his opponent objected , you do not join blades . ' Why should I ? ' Unless you join blades , how am I to fence ? ' That is your look-out . ' But you must join blades . ' Why must I ? My only object , I assure you , is to endeavour , as well as I am able , to disconcert my opponent , and as I find that this plan disconcerts you considerably , I see all the more reason why I should continue to employ it . ' That may be , ' rejoined the other sticking to his point , but if you do not join blades , it is not fencing . ' I12 Secrets of the Sword Well , ' said my friend , ' let us try for a moment to discuss the matter . Tell me , are my hits improperly delivered ? ' Oh , no . ' Did I stab , or come in with a round-arm ? ' Certainly not . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too wide , or what ? Is my hand too heavy , or do you complain of mutual hits ? ' No , that is not the point . ' Then , what more do you want ? ' I want you to join blades . ' To oblige you ? ' No , I do not say that . But unless you join blades it is not fencing . ' And say what one might , nothing would make him budge from his everlasting axiom . " It is always so , whenever an attempt is made to interfere with the traditions of any art whatever . The man who tries to strike out a new line can not fail to disturb the tranquil repose of ancient custom . The conservatives resist , they object to interference , they feel that their placid triumphs , their cherished habits are threatened . The regular routine , which has been drilled into them , till they know it like an old // tune of which every turn and every note is familiar , will be unsettled . They have good reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right . VII . " At the present day people have gradually come to admit that there is some good in these innovations , which have suddenly enlarged the scope of fencing . Fencing , ' they say , is more difficult than it used to be , but less graceful . ' Are these qualities then necessarily incompatible with each other ? " In order to make a clear distinction between those who run after strange gods , and the auld lichts ' who have preserved intact the primitive tradition of the true faith , a phrase has been invented to describe the backsliders . They are said to be difficult fencers . ' " Now what are these words supposed to mean ? Do they imply that a graceful fencer is not difficult ? No doubt , classical grace and a masterly style are very fine things , which I , for one , can appreciate and admire . But if I am asked to choose between the graceful and the 8 // difficult fencer , ? if it is not possible to be both at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that difficult ' can only mean difficult to hit , difficult to defeat . " But there is no need to suppose that difficulty is incompatible with grace , at least with grace of a certain kind , the grace of manly and robust energy , which sits well upon the fighting man , such grace as in old times so well became the gallant chevaliers , who illumined by their prowess the spacious days of ruff and rapier . " We have here another of the important points of difference between the two schools . Some people treat the newcomer like an inconvenient guest , whom they can not very well turn out of doors . But they may as well make up their minds that the intruder can take care of himself , and will find room for his ample proportions in the domestic circle . He has . come to stay , and whether they like him ornot he means to make one of the party . " The axiom ? ' Hit and do not be hit back r ought , in spite of everything that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who fight with the sword . Science may teach how to hit well , but its first lesson should be , how not to be hit // at all by the arrant duffer , who uses his sword by the light of nature . When swordsmanship fails to keep this end in view , we may be very sure that it is off the track . ' Business first ' must be the invariable rule . VIII . " There was a time when the mask was not worn for the assault . And I remember reading some time ago in the Encyclopaedia , published about the middle of last century ( 1755 ) , under the word mask the following remarks : In foil-play Fencers have sometimes carried precaution so far as to wear a mask , to protect themselves from possible hits in the face . It is true that those who have acquired little skill in the Art may chance to wound their Adversary by a clumsy thrust , or cause themselves to be wounded by throwing up the point with a bad parry . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This encyclopaedia evidently reflects the ideas which were generally accepted at the time . i 16 Secrets of the Sword To wear a mask in a bout with the foils was as much as to say that you considered your op ponent a duffer , and was not far short of an insult . " Fencing in those days was nothing but a formal series of attacks , feints , parries and ripostes , well understood and defined by the code ; every movement led up to some other movement , which was rigidly prescribed . If a fencer had ventured on a straight thrust while the feints were in progress , instead of elaborately following the blade through every turn of the labyrinth , he would have been considered an unmannerly cub , and sent back to study his rudiments . It was only in the last years of the period signalised by the famous Saint-Georges that the mask came into general use . Even then the only masks used were made of tin , and the professors ' view was that such safeguards were permissible for rough players . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . And their respect for ancient tradition did not go far enough to induce them to risk losing the one that remained . After that the wire mask was generally adopted , but not without regret . // IX . " Every generation takes the march of progress one stage further , or at least modifies existing institutions in its own way . It is not so long since the fanciful multiplication of feints , of which I was speaking just now , was considered the correct game ; the right thing to do was to follow the blade until you found it . At the present day it is no longer part of the necessary ritual to follow always every vagary . Suppose you feint inordinately , I suddenly let drive with opposition of the hand , or simply straighten my arm and hit you with a stop thrust , which interferes rather effectively with your trickiness , and spoils the magnificent flourishes of your arabesques . These hits are now recognised and regularly taught . If need be , instead of lunging you slip the left foot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to be out of the way , and drop the body , in order to avoid being hit yourself . " The system of our fathers , which in many respects was excellent but at the same time was remarkable for several very odd and very // peremptory theories , has in many instances been successfully assailed . Perhaps in some cases its assailants have themselves been too peremptory , and this has led to that loss of temper and angry recrimination , by which the debate has been embittered . " But I must not tax your patience further to-night . We had better adjourn the discussion until to-morrow ; otherwise you will be tired of hearing me talk , and I am sincerely anxious to command your whole attention . " The Sixth Evening I. FENCING , " I began , when we had all reassembled ' as usual , " is such an inexhaustible topic , that I could not , if I would , pretend to go minutely into all its practical details . No one gifted with a modicum of sense , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike out a line for himself . I am obliged , as you see , to content myself with a general view . For we can not consider the assault , and especially an assault in which the combatants use their heads as well as their // hands , without assuming that our young friend has gained some science , and has become an educated fencer . " I have already spoken of parries and ripostes , and you have seen that the lesson teaches how these should be employed . You know what use may be made of the sense of touch , the power of feeling the blade , and of the electric influence of the eye . It remains to say a few words on the subject of attacks . " It is more dangerous to attack than to parry . Instead of waiting you let yourself go . And the great difficulty is to know how to let yourself go far enough without going too far . " Remember that discretion is the better part of valour ; but do not confound discretion with timidity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and willing , and more than that , that you ought to make it your object to encounter every sort of style , even those styles which are hardly worthy or ? to be quite candid ? are quite unworthy of the name . As a matter of fact there are such styles , and therefore it is just as well not to allow their exponents to become conceited , or to imagine that by any chance they can possibly be effective . The Sixth Evening 1 23 " It is important for the prestige of fencing , that those who have no knowledge of their weapon , or at most a mere smattering , should not be allowed to suppose that they can depend upon mere energy and a blind rush to defend themselves against a man who has been trained to the skilful handling of the sword . Confidence , that mainest mainstay of defence , ought not to be possible for the ignorant fencer ; it ought to be the peculiar privilege of the trained and scientific expert . I I. " To come back to the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a fencer , as soon as he falls on guard , engage swords , and at once hurriedly let fly thrust after thrust , attack following attack in quick succession , if he neglects to test the length of his opponent 's sword by gradually feeling his way , by employing all the necessary tactics of the preliminary skirmish , by prospecting for information and discreetly sounding the enemy , then to my mind he may be classed at once . He // may have some dexterity , a certain power of execution , but by the mere act of joining blades he may be set down as a blind fencer , far more truly than the man who keeps out of distance , and chooses the proper moment at one time to refuse , at another , when least expected , to take the engagement . or to seize his opponent 's blade with courage and resolution . " " I suppose , " remarked the Comte de R. , " that , a few years hence , it is highly probable that a new set of theories will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hotly disputed now , and they in their turn will be considered out of date . " " No doubt that is to be expected in the nature of things . The form may or rather certainly will change , but the substance will be unaltered . Let me submit evidence to prove it . I mentioned the other day some old books on sword-play which I hoped to look through . I will only refer to them for one moment . I managed to read them all , and dreary reading it was , but I got through them , being supported by a conscientious sense of duty , and I unearthed among others the two following passages . The Sixth Evening 12 S " The first on the subject of Approaches was written in the seventeenth century , that is to say , it is about two hundred years old : The reason why you must make your steps of unequal Measure is that thereby you always hold your Adversary in Suspense and uncertain what you would be at . For if you always go about your business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , it may happen that the Enemy will make his reckoning so exactly , that he can direct his sword not only at the place where he sees you to be , but even at that place to which he knows you will presently come , whereof by this means he is hindered . ' " One might suppose that this was written yesterday . Could any professor , however skilful , put the point better or more logically ? The weapons however were very different from ours , heavy cut and thrust rapiers , wielded sometimes in one hand , sometimes in both ; but the laws of judgment , caution , and strategy were the same , and will be the same a hundred years hence . " To prove once more that this new school , which a few years since was received with a howl of abuse , really did not advance such // very extravagant doctrines , and that the power of eye , which we were discussing yesterday , is intimately connected with the power of touch , I have made a note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks : It follows that the great gain that Science gives is Security in making your Approaches , which can not be obtained except you thoroughly comprehend the Importance both of Touch and Eye ; and you may rest assured that bodily activity and readiness of hand are alike as nothing when weighed against a good Approach . ' " And we are reluctantly obliged to admit that after all our original ideas have been anticipated , and we stand convicted of plagiarism . " I might revenge myself for the trouble I have taken to ransack these ancient folios , by inflicting upon you any number of quotations , but I will be merciful , and am content to have demonstrated that the ideas that are supposed to be most radical are often , when they come to be examined , most truly conservative . " // " I have another question for you , " continued the Comte de R. " You were speaking the other day of feints and stop thrusts . Of course it was ridiculous to expect an opponent to follow every gyration , which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do n't you think that nowadays the practice of straightening the arm on every possible occasion is utterly overdone ? " " No doubt it is by some men ? overdone , or rather very badly done , which amounts to the same thing . Ne quid nimis ' you know is a good motto , and I quite agree with you , however little you may like it , that this movement , which comes more by instinct than by intention , is now the refuge of those who can not parry ; but , mind this , it is a refuge , from which it is often very difficult to dislodge them . I quite admit that those who straighten the arm without any justification are hopelessly unscientific , but they present a difficulty to surmount , which requires serious attention . " Let me explain before going on . There is a distinction to be made between stop thrusts , // and time thrusts . The stop thrust is taken , when your opponent advances incautiously , or when he draws back his arm while executing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which leaves him exposed . The time thrust on the other hand , correctly speaking , is a parry of opposition , ? the most dangerous of all parries , for if it fails it leaves you absolutely exposed and at the mercy of your opponent . I have seen it taught in the lesson by every master ( as an exercise no doubt ) , but I have hardly ever seen a master put it into practice in the assault . The thrust has nothing to recommend it , but on the contrary it is to be condemned on many grounds . I should like to see it ignominiously expelled from the fencing room , as the buyers and sellers were expelled from the temple . Iv . " Do you follow the distinction ? A time thrust is taken on the final movement of an attack , when you think you know exactly what is coming , and can judge with certainty in what line the point will , be delivered . Very well , then // parry instead of timing ; for if you are wrong ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate have recourse to another parry . Whereas the time thrust , when misjudged , results in a mutual hit , and for one that is good tender how much base metal you will put into circulation . The stop thrust , which is taken , as I have said , on the opponent 's advance , is less dangerous . Therefore never attack a man , who straightens his arm on every occasion , without making sure of his blade , and you need have no fear of the result . " It is quite true that the practice of straightening the arm is much more prevalent than it used to be ; simply because this style of play , which is of great antiquity , had gone out of fashion , and given place to another method , which in its turn was overdone , ? the method of feints and flourishes . " So too , the trick of reversing the lunge by throwing back the left foot and dropping the body , to allow the attack to pass over your head , is not an invention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ christened . It is an old trick , a ruse of great antiquity , which may or at all events ought to be found in Homer . Still , unless your opponent drives I 30 Secrets of the Sword you to it by wild and frantic rushes , it is a stroke to be used sparingly , and with the object of letting him know that you are ready to re-ceive him . By this means you will stop him from rushing at you on every possible occasion . I like to see a stop thrust correctly taken , always provided that I do not see others in the course of the same assault taken incorrectly , ? for then it is obvious that the correct thrust was a simple fluke . V. " I am speaking now from the scientific standpoint . Perhaps I can put my point more clearly . If my opponent says : ? ' I do n't profess to be scientific ; I simply defend myself by the light of nature , ' he may do what he likes , I shall not complain of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no better . But the expert fencer has no business to make mistakes or at least he should try to avoid them as far a he can . " Even at the risk of being lynched for m unorthodox opinions , I should venture to say t // the would-be fencer : ? Above all things make yourself dangerous . Be a difficult fencer , ' since that is the stereotyped phrase . Without it there is no salvation ; your guns are not shotted , your performance is mere fire-works . ' " But be careful not to give these words a wider application than they are meant to carry . All that I would say is this : ? that you are to follow your natural instinct , to trust your impulse , to be yourself and not your master 's puppet . I do not mean to propound an acrobatic theory of fencing , or to recommend a meaningless , objectless , indiscriminate charging about , like the convulsive struggles of a wild beast , that has received its death wound . It would be as wrong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be unfair to argue from them in order to demonstrate the futility of the new school . " No doubt fencers of this kind , ? they call themselves fencers , ? may score an occasional hit , for , as I have had occasion to remark already , there is always a certain amount of luck in fencing ; but this sort of thing is not fencing ; it is much more like mere brutal fisticuffs . Such eccentric methods are of no importance , they are not based on any sort of principle , but are 9 ? 2 // the mere outcome of ignorance ; they belong to no school and have no permanent value . But it does not do to despise an unbeaten enemy . Therefore confront these methods and defeat them first ; you can afford to despise them afterwards . " " Quite so , " exclaimed Monsieur de C. , " that is exactly my opinion . " " One moment , " I said , " I have not quite done . I was going to say , that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimental fencing master being run through by the recruit . Such an event may happen , just as a chimney-pot may fall on your head when you are walking in the street , but I fancy that if you were to apply the rule of three to all the cases the result would not exactly support the paradox . " There is a class of fencers who are thoroughly ? in fact too thoroughly ? convinced that they are very dangerous fellows , and that they are never hit . You repeatedly come across this sort of thing in the fencing room : ? Your opponent delivers an attack which you parry ; he stays on the lunge doubled up , with his body dropped // forward ; your riposte lands perhaps in his mask , perhaps in his back , or arm . Thereupon he recovers and remarks with a negligent air : hit in the mask , ' ' hit in the back , ' arm only , ' as the case may be . " Oh , only in the mask ! But , Sir , the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . In fact it would have been quite as effective as a hit in the chest , which penetrated your lungs . The other would have gone six inches into your back ; while the third would have pierced your arm and run you through the chest afterwards . You offer your head , back , or arm instead of your chest , I hit the part exposed and am quite satisfied . You can not evade or parry a thrust by substituting for the part that would otherwise be hit some other part , which you do not attempt to cover ; all that you do is to offer an exchange . VI . " Do you suppose that these fencers would pursue the same tactics , if they had to face a naked point instead of the button of a foil , and // that they would fancy themselves out of danger , if they laid themselves open to be run through the head or back or neck ? Such wounds are not trivial and can not be ignored . A sharp point is a peremptory fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you imagine that anyone would be very anxious in a real fight to run the risk of double hits , by which he might succeed in inflicting a serious wound , but only at the expense of being run through the body himself ? No one would resort to such desperate measures as these , unless there was absolutely nothing else left to be done . " This is so thoroughly true , that if you set two men to fight in a fencing-room with blunt swords , you notice at once that the assault is something very different from what it would have been with mere foils . You might almost fancy that the swords , though they can no longer wound , are still possessed by the spirit of mortal combat , and retain some reminiscence of the real thing , of naked chest opposed to naked steel . " There is none of that brilliant dash , none of those brilliant strokes that are usually more conspicuous for temerity than judgment . The // ght is a sham fight still , but the players can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ? Now let me see what would happen , f we were in earnest . ' The different shape of he hilt , the harsh grating of the steel affect he imagination . Watch that fellow , see what e is up to , make him keep his distance , give im something to think about . ' That is the ort of caution that the swords are whispering . " You may easily satisfy yourselves of the ruth of my remarks the next time you have an opportunity of watching a bout of this sort . And if there is so great a difference between imple foils and blunt swords , you will have o difficulty in believing that the difference etween blunt swords and sharp is far greater . Wild play subsides , and those who were willing o charge blindly , when they risked nothing more than a dent in a leather jacket , prefer to tudy ways and means a little more closely . t is a very natural prompting of the instinct . The rule is almost universal , but there are occasional exceptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do not want to be aken by surprise , you had better make yourself acquainted with them beforehand for what they are worth . " 1 3 6 Secrets of the Sword " Then you approve , " said M. de C. , " of occasional practice with muffled swords ? " " Not only of occasional but of constant practice , and that not in the assault only , but in the lesson too . The greater weight of the sword and the wider blade , which is straight and less whippy than the foil , steady the hand , keep it in position , and give a truer aim . " VII . " I notice , " observed one of my friends , " that you have said nothing about left-handed fencers . " " No , " I answered . " The fact is , there is hardly anything to say , and even the text-books , which do not usually err on the side of brevity , devote very little space to them . For there is really no particular rule , which applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult ? " " Yes in a way no doubt they are , though one of my friends , a left-hander of course , used // to say that the supposed difficulty is only a convenient excuse invented by right-handed fencers . His suggestion is more witty than true , and 1 am willing to allow , without hesitation , that left-handers really are puzzling to those who are not accustomed to fence with them . Their only real advantage is that they have more opportunities of fencing against righthanders , than right-handers have of fencing against them . When once you are used to them the difficulty vanishes . The left-hander on the contrary , when it comes to fighting , is never rid of the far graver risk which he takes by exposing his left side . " I may add that the left-hander 's advantage , which consists entirely in his incognito , would exist no longer , if the professors , ? who I hope may take the hint , ? would make a practice of giving lessons occasionally with the left hand . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their good sense . If you come to think of it , there is not a single left-handed thrust or parry , which can not be equally well executed by a right-handed player . Only , from want of practice , the latter finds it more difficult to direct his point because the lines are reversed . Duarte becomes sixte , and vice versa . The left138 Secrets of the Sword hander prefers to take the inside engagement , that is to say gnarte . This line suits him better , and accordingly it is good policy not to let him take it without a struggle . It is usually more difficult to hit him in the outside line . " So much for general principles , for of course left-handed play varies as much as righthanded , although the contrary is sometimes maintained . But if all left-handers were providentially made alike , one would think that it could not be very difficult to get to know the pattern by heart . VIII . " Well , you must admit that in the course of my remarks I try not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have , or those who should , could , or would have a fancy for sword-play . " My object is to bring out the essential features in clear relief , and I intentionally omit the thousand and one minute details , which would overcrowd my canvas , and prevent you // from properly appreciating the leading features . These refinements , which come with experience and habit , can not be forced , they must be slowly acquired by the friction of the blades , by meeting all sorts And conditions of fencers , by facing the unforeseen and sudden perils , which confront you just when they are least expected . " You know how awkward a young fellow is when he makes his first appearance in society . When he finds himself in a drawing-room , he is shy and uncomfortable , he does not know how to sit down or how to stand up or how to talk , but presently without consulting any professor , simply , so to speak , by the daily friction of his common intercourse with other people , older and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , address , manners , and so forth . " It is just the same with fencers . Craft , finesse , tact , and judgment come by degrees , as wings grow out of feathers ; but do not forget that the lesson and the master 's pad are your first instructors and must not be neglected . To neglect them would be ungrateful , and ingratitude is always base . Besides you can not afford it .
