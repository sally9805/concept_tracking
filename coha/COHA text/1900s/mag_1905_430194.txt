 |p1043  . . . I have not written to you all this while because I felt completely crushed by all the grave calamities that have befallen poor Russia . . . . The heart is aching , one does not feel like thinking of anything , one does not feel like doing anything . I am sending you a letter devoted mainly to Leonid Andreyev 's new story , " Red Laughter . " This-is a remarkable story . . . . The title , " Red Laughter , " refers , in my opinion , to the bloody irony of war over all human ideals . . . . I shall write you of Gorky 's new play , " The Cottagers , " in my next letter . Stagnation has been felt in our literature of late . This is to be explained by the strange and terrible period which we Russians are going through at present . Moral repose is absolutely essential to mental work , and there is just such chaos in the soul of every Russian as in Russia itself . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for peace , and yet all expect war . . . . Such heavy clouds have come over Russia that we do not know where to look for light . . . . The work of my brother is meanwhile only the work of Sisyphus . The saying that " One man alone on the battlefield is not a warrior " ( One man can not make headway against many ) is perfectly true of him at present . But , of course , a thunder may crash suddenly from beyond the clouds and turn over completely the present situation . Russian society looks with suspicion upon the present promised reorganization . Upon the conferences of the Council of Ministers it looks as upon Penelope 's rug with which she held back the impatience of her suitors demanding from her an answer . Even as with Penelope 's rug , that which is done by the Council openly is later undone secretly . This is the opinion of Russian society . The rumors to the effect that my brother is to retire are without foundation whatever . So long as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the good of his fatherland , which he loves passionately . DURING the past few months there appeared in Russian literature several interesting productions of well-known authors , who have dared to fight against the sword with their pens . Of all these works , Leonid Andreyev 's short story , " Red Laughter , " produces a particularly powerful impression . What a strange title and what a terrible story ! The reader 's eyes see nothing but red , and it seems as tho it was written not with ordinary ink , but with real human blood , shed in such monstrous measure in Manchuria , where Leonid Andreyev wrote his story . This story is composed of a series of brief scenes , made up of fragments of the impressions of an artillery officer . The first fragment of the first impression begins thus : Madness and Horror : . . . The officer is seized with this sensation of madness and horror at first during the retreat of the Russian army from Liao Yang . The army marched for ten hours in succession without stopping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terribly , hopelessly , painfully hot . The sun was so immense , so fiery and so terrible , as tho the earth had come near it and begun to burn with a terrible , merciless fire . The immense , near , terrible sun lit upon every barrel of the guns , upon every metallic shield , thousands of small , dazzling suns ; and from every where , from both sides and from below , they flashed , into the officer 's eyes , fierywhite , sharp , like the point of white-hot spears . And the burning heat penetrated the very depth of his body , his bones , his brains , and sometimes it seemed to him that it was not his own head that shook upon his shoulders , but that it was something strange and terrible ? a strange  |p1044  heavy globe . All were silent , as tho an army of mute people were moving , and when some one fell , he fell silently , and others , stumbling over his body , also fell silently . Some rose , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mute people were also deaf and blind . And here , amid these strange , terrible surroundings , the officer suddenly recalled his home ; the cozy corner in his cabinet , a piece of light blue wall paper , a bottle of cold water on the table . In the adjoining room were his wife and son . . . . Recalling this he felt like crying out , but instead of this he merely lifted his hands in silence and started off ? inning , not knowing whither and wherefore . Unexpectedly he found himself upon a rock . And there , sitting upon the rough and hot rock , exhausted from the heat and from fatigue , he realized for the first time something very important and very terrible ; he realized that he was a madman , and that all these thousands of people , marching past him in silence , dulled from fatigue , were also madmen . Of the later impressions which influenced the officer 's mind the following is the most characteristic : Not leaving his battery for a moment during three days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . He dreamed of his house , of the piece of light-blue wall paper , and , on the table , instead of the bottle of water , stood a lighted lamp with a green shade . . . . Soon he would see his wife and his son . . . But at this moment he was awakened by something and he opened his eyes . Before him stood a young volunteer , with an unusually pale , beardless face . The officer was interested by this unfamiliar face , which was so pale , so frightened , yet smiling . " Are you afraid ? " asked the officer , gently . Instead of replying the young volunteer only laughed , forcedly , evidently attempting to conceal and to drive away from himself by his laughter his mad fright ; and suddenly something inexplicable , something monstrous took place : the officer was swung aside ? and that was all ? and before his eyes , in the place of the frightened , pale face , lay something short , blunt , red , and from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this short , red , streaming object there was still heard the laughter ? red laughter . . . . And since that minute the officer seemed to see and hear Red Laughter wherever he saw blood . The sensation of madness and horror seized upon the officer with particular power on that terrible night when a physician took him away , almost by force , to pick up the wounded that remained on the battlefield after the battle of the day before . Upon this field , which was strewn with the bodies of the killed and wounded , stood an even , unbroken moan . This moan reminded one simultaneously of the crackling of grasshoppers on the summer meadow , of the hopeless crying of children , and of the squealing of castaway and freezing puppies . The officer had heard many moans and cries , but this moaning was unlike anything he had ever heard . It seemed to him that the earth itself , soaked with blood , was moaning , that the sky was moaning , that the air was moaning , that the terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wounded were swarming and crawling over the field like sleepy crabs let out from a basket . Some were voiceless and obedient , others howled , cursed and shouted . A train was filled with wounded , and all the clothes of the officer who helped the physician and his assistants to carry them into the train were soaked with blood , as tho he was standing for a long time in a bloody rain . The train went away and the officer remained alone on the field . The moaning did not subside . It came from everywhere to the officer , and like a sharp , icy , endless needle it entered into his brains and moved slowly back and forth , back and forth . . . Later , during a very strange battle , when , through a certain inexplicable fatal error , the Russians fired upon their own , both of the officer 's legs were shot off . While he lay in the lazaretto he despaired and bewailed bitterly his legs , " his dear legs , which were so swift , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keen despair gave way to a profound and constant sense of unbearable longing ? longing for home : " I want to go home . . . . I want to go home , " ... he was  |p1046  him a future murderer . The youthful warrior can not bear such an insult , and in his vehemence he exclaims : " You are a murderer ! You ; not I. " Maxim had a few years ago , indeed , killed a woman out of jealousy , for which he was put into the friary for repentance . And I will fight for my fatherland , for its honor and glory , I will do only my moral duty ! " " Every one who kills is a murderer ; it makes no difference why and whom he kills , " replies Maxim to his brother , and then in vehement and convincing terms he proves to him that all words of honor and of duty in this case are a lie , with which people are trying to deceive themselves . It is either life or death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any life . He who killed another has also killed himself . Maxim suffers terribly because of the crime he had committed , and he warns his brother from committing a still more terrible crime . He had killed one woman who had done him so much wrong , and his brother would kill scores , hundreds of innocent people : " You will also kill a young , handsome , happy and noble young man like yourself ? one who , like you , is also the favorite of his mother , who lives but for him alone . " . . . Maxim 's words filled the young ensign 's soul with chaos . His feelings and his thoughts become confused . He knows no longer where falsehood is and , where truth is . Hero and murderer , heroism and crime suddenly blend into one another . The officer , confused and disconcerted , goes to church to attend mass before starting off , and there , instead of praying for his well being and health , he weeps and prays to God to send him death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people of whom Maxim spoke to him ? and it would free him from a life made unbearable by the consciousness that he took other people 's lives . Literary productions have always exerted a great influence upon Russian society , and let us hope that now the energetic campaign against the war . started by the best literary powers in Russia , will produce the desired effect . and will compose a unanimous chorus of the separate voices shouting bravely : " Down with the war , down with the red laughter ! '
