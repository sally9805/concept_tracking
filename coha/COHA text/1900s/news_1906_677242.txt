Ladders were run ' up to each window , firemen swarmed them , and the shutters ward thrown open . Then the windows were smashed , and as soon as the truckmen had dragged out enough paper with their hooks to make room for their bodies they squeezed through the secondstory windows . The smoke became thicker , and soon a muffled cry for help arose above the din of the engines . It was John C. Licdice of Engine 31 who called . Connor of No. 31 and Hardy of No. 29 sprang up a ladder and were dragging Licdice over the window sill when such a hot blast of smoke gushed forth that they had to shield their faces with their helmets . . They got Licdice out , but he was unconscious . Dr. Tomes of St. Gregory 's Hospital restored him . In quick succession these firemen , half suffocated , were carried down the ladder : Lieut. , Lyons and Bracken , of Engine 82 ; Neil of Truck 1 , Woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

A few minutes prior to this Chief Croker had tleclared : , " No man of mine goes to a hospital this night , " Policeman Apfel , without awaiting the ' Ire Chief 's sanction , had summoned ambulances from the Hudson Street and St. Gregory 's Hospitals . Dr. Williams was in charge of the Hudson Street ambulance . When the unconscious form of O'Connor was laid on the sidewalk a few feet east of the arch , Dr. Williams and the ambulance driver pulled out a stretcher . Chief Croker was then engaged in directing the men , and did not witness the preparations to take the man away . Capt . Rush of Engine 39 , who had heard ' his Chief say that his men were not to be taken to hospitals , did observe the preparations . He told Croker .

" Get that man out of that ambulance ! " roared Chief Croker . " You 're not going Ito take him to a hospital . He is n't in bad enough shape for that . Put him back on that truck . " " No , " replied Policeman Apfel . " He 's going to the hospital . We 're going to . take him there . " " He 's in pretty bad shape , " said Dr. Williams , " and I 'm going to take him .

Before they could go further Policeman Apfel and three or four onlookers yanked O'Connor , still unconscious , bodily away from them . Croker called half a dozen more firemen , and Roundsman Smith summoned two or three policemen , and between them they got O'Connor away from Apfel and the outsiders . The latter were forced outside the fire lines . O'Connor remained unconscious , and was at last taken to St. Gregory 's Hospital . Dr. Toms , who was there with the ambulance , declared that it was by Chief Croker 's orders . When the Chief was asked about this he disclaimed the order , and reiterated over and over again that he did n't think O'Connor 's condition was serious enough to warrant taking him to a hospital . Capt . Rush was asked if he knew anything about it . He said that Croker had ordered that any man who appeared to be badly enough off was to go to the hospital . The question had not been definitely settled at midnight , but Croker was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious condition . The Fire Chief talked a bit after the incident . " I am here in charge of the firemen , " he said . " The police have no right to summon ambulances . They are here to maintain the fire lines and keep back the crowd . If we need ambulances we will ask for them , and we can get them Just as quickly as the policemen can . " " Is there any rule about who shall summon ambulances ? " the Chief was asked . An agreement for the firemen to do it was entered into by ex-Police Commis , stoner and ex-Fire Commissioner Hayes , " was the reply . Chief Croker then muttered something about reporters making the firemen too consptcuous , and something that sounded like , ' If I had my way they would n't be allowed inside the lime .
