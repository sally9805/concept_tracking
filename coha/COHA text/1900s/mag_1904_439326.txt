THE strangest monument a man ever had in sacred memory , ? a pair of old boots . For a token of respect and admiration , love and lasting grief , ? just a pair of old river-driver 's boots hung on the pin-knot of a pine . Big and buckled ; bristling all over the soles with wrought steel calks ; gashed at the toes to let the water out ; slashed about the tops into fringes with the tally of his season 's work , less only the day which saw him die ; reddened by water ; cracked by the sun , ? worn-out , weather-rotting old boots , hanging for years on the pine tree , disturbed by no one . The river-drivers tramped back and forth beneath them , a red-shirted multitude ; they boated along the pond in front and drove their logs past , year after year ; they looked at the tree with the big cross cut deep in it-scaly bark , and always left the boots hanging on the limh . They were the Governor 's boots . Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The pine tree had seen the whole . It was old and it was tall . Its head stretched up so high that it could look over the crest of Grand Pitch , tremendous fall though it is , right up where Grand Falls come churning down to their final leap into Shad Pond . It had been looking up the river in the sunshine of that summer morning , and had seen the whole , ? the over-loaded boat that set out to run the falls , the wreck in the rapids , the panic of the crew , the men struggling among logs and rocks , the brave attempt at rescue , and the dead , drowned bulk , which had once been the Governor , as it was tumbled down over the Grand Pitch into the pond below . The pine tree had stood guard over it for days , and when , after four days in the grave of the waters , it rose again , the pine tree still kept watch over it , until , on the sixth morning , the searchers found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they cut a cross into a tree by the side of the Pond , and they hung up his boots in the tree , and they stayed there always , because everybody knew that they was the Governor 's boots . " If ever Henry David Thoreau showed himself lacking in penetration it was when he failed to get the measure of Joseph Attien . True , Joe was young then , ? he never lived to be old ; yet a man who , dying at forty-one , is so long remembered must have shown some signs of promise at twenty-four . ' But Thoreau hired an Indian to be aboriginal . One who said " By George ! " and made remarks with a Yankee flavor , was contrary to his hypothesis of what a barbarian ought to be . It did not matter that this was the sort of man who gave up his inside seat and rode sixty miles on the top of the stage in the rain , that a woman might be sheltered ; ? all the cardinal virtues without aboriginality would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed his opportunity to tell us what manner of man this was . Joe Attien 's best chance of being remembered lies , not in having been Henry Thoreau 's guide on a brief excursion , but in being just brave , honest , upright Joseph Attien , a man who was loved and lamented because he had the quality of goodness . " His death just used the men all up , " said a white river-man years afterward ; " after that some of the best men wa' n't good for anything all the rest of the drive . " I could give , as I have gleaned it here and there , the testimony to his worth , the statements of one and another that he was not only brave but good , an open-hearted , patient , forbearing sort of a man , renowned for his courage and skill in handling a boat , but loved for his mild justness . " He was just like a father to us , " said a white man who had been in his 1 The newspapers said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " forty years and seven months . " It is interesting to learn that one who lived so well and died so generously was born on Christmas Day . 2 His epitaph is wrong in asserting that he inherited the title of governor . The office had been a life office , hereditary in the Attien family , who were chiefs ; but at Joseph 's faboat . Thirty-three years after his death I heard a head lumberman , who also had served two years in his boat , a very silent man , break out into voluble reminiscence at merely seeing Joe Attien 's picture . But there is a story , indisputably authentic , which shows , better than anything else , the largeness of the man . He had been slandered by a white man , whom he had thought his friend , in a way which not only caused him distress of mind , but was calculated to interfere materially with his election to the office of tribal governor , the most coveted honor within an Indian 's grasp , and that year elective for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election in 1862 , ? for he was governor seven times . Hurt to the quick , he avoided his former friend , yet said nothing . But as soon as he discovered that the false accusation had arisen from a wholly innocent and most natural mistake , without a word in his own justification , leaving the charge to stand undenied , he renewed the old friendship , and his friend never knew what just cause he had given for resentment till , years after Joe 's death , it was accidentally revealed by one who had heard the misunderstanding explained . Such was the man . If you ask the men who were there at the time how Joseph Attien died , they will never suggest that it was accident or the hand of God . More or less emphatically , according to their natures and the vividness of their recollection , they will say right out , " Dingbat Prouty did it ; it was Dingbat Prouty drownded Joe Attien . " They will cheerfully admit tiler 's death it was made annual and elective . Joseph Attien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he carried seven out of the eight elections held up to the time of his death . The eighth ? by the intervention of the so-called " Special Law , " passed by the state to reduce the friction between the parties ? was the New Party 's first election , none of Joseph Attien 's friends , the Old Party , or Conservatives , voting that year . that this is not a man to be spoken of slightingly , because he is a great Waterman ; but upon this point there is only one opinion , ? that he forced Joe Attien to run a bad place against his better judgment , for the mere sake of showing off . " He pushed himself in . " ? " He had n't no business in that boat at all . " ? " Prouty drownded Joe Attien , everybody who was there says so . " ? " He had n't no business in that boat , and did n't belong there anyway , but he said he was going to run them falls , and he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a true story , and the more one knows about the facts the harder it is to make a story of them . Here was a simple tale of how the inordinate ambition of one man to win a name for himself brought grief upon the whole drive . But the next turn of the kaleidoscope gave a wholly different combination . For I took what I had gathered to John Ross himself . " Is this straight ? " And he said : " No ; you are all wrong there . Prouty belonged in that boat ; he had been bowman of it about two days . It was my orders for them to go down and pick a jam on the Heater , and they were going . I was right there and saw the whole of it , and I never blamed Prouty . " But why then should the men have blamed him ? No exculpation could be more complete . There is no appeal from what John Ross says he ordered and saw executed . Why do not the men know this ? Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square the mental circle ? For , with nearly two hundred men close at hand , it seems preposterous that the facts should not have become generally known ; it is still more incredible to suppose that , thinking independently , they could all have reached the same false conclusion ; but that , having been cross-examined in all sorts of ways for four - and- thirty years , they should never have varied from their first error is inconceivable . Why do the men stillhold Charles Prouty responsible if he was not to blame ? From being a study of facts , the story turns into a question of psychology . Why is it that when one has been looking at red too long he sees green , and keeps on seeing green , even when there is no green there ? ? that is the clue . A man does not get a name like " Ding-bat " and keep it all his life for nothing . Therefore , after the men had gazed fixedly upon the commanding excellence of Joseph Attien ; after they had seen him pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it were , " sounding for him on the other side ; " when they turned away and looked at the man whom fate had elected to stand beside him that clay , what would one expect them to see by contrast ? Green ! Very green ! And to keep . right on seeing ? green ! Having affirmed the worth of Joseph Attien and the warm esteem in which all held him , it remains to show how , because he was placed in too sharp a contrast with such a man , Charles Prouty incurred a blame which his chief says was none of his . We come now to the story . Chance gave to it a fitting frame , ? grand seenery , bright sunshine , a date of distinction , the eye of the Master . You are never to forget that up on a log-jam , just below where this happened , stood Himself , ? John Ross . He ordered the boat down ; he saw it go ; lie sent another to the rescue ; he reported this to me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , that which is unofficial , that which represents the current of the story , and carries us on to the ending of it , I gathered for myself among them . On the drive there is no distinction of days . Holidays or Sundays , the drivers know no difference ; one week 's end and the next one 's beginning are all the same to them . The Fourth of July now is marked for them by no other suitable recognition than extremely early rising . But it used not so to be . In the old clays , when it was a point of pride to have the logs in boom by the last of June , the men were free to celebrate on the Fourth . To them the Fourth of July was the greatest clay of all the year . Like boys just out of school , they were free from work , free from restraint , free to make just as much noise as they pleased ; and , having plenty of money in their pockets wherewith to purchase all sorts of a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never a quiet clay in Bangor if the drives were in the boom . However , the year of our Lord 1870 is distinctly chronicled as one of the most uneventful ever known , nothing at all going on but a church levee across the river in Brewer , so that the police loafed out the Fourth in weary and unwonted idleness . The drives were late that year , so very late that , though the head of the West Branch drive was some miles downstream , the rear of it rested on the Grand Falls of the Indian Purchase . The hands had been leaving the day before , so as to get home for the Fourth ; the water was falling ; the whole drive was belated and short-handed ; the head men were worrying ; no one had any time to remember that it was a legal holiday . That is , no one remembered it except the Chronic Shirk . His rights had been assailed , and , having found a Temporary Cripple , who could not escape by flight from his unwelcome company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opinions of working on a legal holiday with an explosiveness which reminded one of the reports of a bunch of firecrackers . It was " Rip ? rip ? rip ? bang ! but he did let like this workin ' on a Fourth er July ! The Declaration of Independuns had said ? that it was a man 's right ? on the Fourth er July ? to git as tight as Lewey 's cow ? and hedid rip ? rip ? rip ? object ? to bein ' defrauded out of his constitoot'nal rights ! " He was a sun-baked , stubble-faced fellow , less troubled with clothes than with the want of patches , but with shirt and skin about one color where the sun had toned them to each other around the more ancient rents ; and lie sat in a niche in the log-jam , expectorating tobacco forcibly and to great distances , and swore voluminously about his ill-luck in not being somewhere else . Just then he had nothing to do . He was an expert at picking out jobs where there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate , who had gone for an axe , and not a stroke of work had he done since his mate left him . There it was , a bright sunny morning about seven o'clock , a good time to work , and the logs ricked up like jack-straws on both sides of the falls , the whole river in that confusion which the rear has to clean up and leave tidy ; plenty of work for this fellow to do with his peavey in picking off singles and rolling in little handfuls caught along the edges , and helping to do his share of the setting to rights ; but , instead , he sat on a log-jam in the sun , and spat more vigorously and swore more violently , as it grew upon him how ill the world was using him in mar% him work on the Fourth of July . The Cripple , unable to escape , tried to divert him from his melancholy . " Well , Tobias Johnson 's boat got down all right , " he remarked . Tobias Johnson and his crew had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the boats go down that the Cripple had crawled out upon the logs . The water being very bad that morning , what Tobias Johnson had done was bound to be a topic of conversation all that hot day among little groups of men working on the logs . Even the Shirk ought to have whirled at such a glittering conversational lure . Instead he sullied . " I ' d be rip ? rip ? ripped ? if I 740 The Death of Thoreau 's Guide . was seen runnin ' these here falls to-day . It ' s a damned shame to have to work on the Fourth er July anyway . Head men that knowed beans from bed-bugs would ha ' had the whole jim-bang drive in long ago ; " ? and he exploded a whole bunch of crackers on the heads of the offending contractors of the drive . " Here we be a-swillin ' sow-belly an ' Y. E. B 's , ' an ' down to Bangor , do n't I know jes " s well as can be , Deacon Spooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Low 's Market , an ' is reportin ' all about the sunstroke to the schoolhouse an ' the camp-meethe they are gettin ' up down to Whisgig on Shoe-Fly , an ' salmon enough for all hands an ' the cook . " ( Deacon Spooner was a sort of summer Santa Claus , who purveyed imaginary information and real Penobscot River salmon . He was held in high local esteem , but he went out of print about this time , and the great volley of oaths which the Shirk shot off at the merry and inoffensive deacon , though they may not account for his disappearance , would provide good reason for looking for him among the damned . ) The Cripple tried to get away , but he was too closely followed . Then , deciding that talking was better than listening , he took the reins of conversation . " Bi must have found it awful rough water , " said he ; " do n't believe there ' 11 be not another bo't attempt it to-day with the water slacking so . Say , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy to leave Tobias 's crew an ' come into his boat ? An ' Con said he liked his own crew , an ' did n't want to change , not even to be in Joe 's bo't . I heerd that he got Ed Conley out of Lewey Ketchum 's bo't now Lewey ' s left the drive . Speaks pretty well for Tobias though , do n't it ? " The Discontented One turned impartially from Deacon Spooner and damned Tobias . That is , yellow-eyed beans . Pork and beans are the river-driver 's staple of diet as " Jim Hill ! " said the Cripple , " how them logs has took to runnin ' ! They ' re goin ' it high , wide an ' lively . That stops all bo't capers for one while . Any bo't that had it in mind to rival Bi Johnson had better think twice about it before they git out into this mix-up on slack water . Guess our fun ' s up , an ' I ' nought ' s well be crawlin ' back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay right here where I be , " said the Shirk ; " John Ross is up there on that dry jam east side , an ' I ' d jes " s soon be where I can keep an eye on him . " The Cripple made a few painful , hobblingsteps over the logs , and had reached thecrest of the jam , when he turned , with his hand shading his eyes , and looked down toward the Blue Rock Pitch , where a boat was drawn up on the shore , and the crew stood waiting . " Say , though , " he shouted to the Shirk , trying to snake himself heard above the water , " looks like they was talkin ' about runnin ' after all ! Who is it ? Make ' em out ? " The Grumbler put up Isis head cautiously , to make sure that John Ross was attending to his own business , before he ran briskly to the peak of the jam , and announced that it was that cling-dingdanged Injun , Joe Attien ; could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect figure of a man , though ! " broke in the other in admiration ; " pity his heft keeps him from his rightful place in the bow . " Joe Attien weighed two hundred and twenty-five , and , because of his great weight and strength , always captained his boat from the stern , although in running quick water the bow is the place of honor . The Leisurely One , having made sure that he was getting the right man , proceeded to curse Joe Attien and all his forbears . Then he sat clown upon the logs and resumed his original lamentation . " Now clown Bangor way to-day well as the lumberman 's , and not as much relished in midsummer as in the colder season . they ' d be doin ' somp'n wuth lookin ' at ? boss races an ' bo't races an ' " ? " Joe ' d be in the canoe race , sure , " interrupted the other . " Not by a long chalk ! " said the Grumbler ; " do n't you see he ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , when they made him a cling-dinged , no-good judge , all ' him one of the best paddles in the tribe , a rip ? rip ? rip ? splitting good man on a paddle , all because he was a ding-dang-donged governor ? " The other man admitted the cogency of the argument . " But say , " said he , " that ' s the real thing there . Ai n't that Dingbat talkin ' up to Joe ? " They watched the rapid , incisive movements of a slender , agile young fellow , outlined against Joe 's bulk . " Dinged little weasel , " muttered the Grumbler , identifying him , " so durn spry ' t he do n't cast no shadder ! " Then he relapsed once more into his reflective mood . " Now down Bangor way now , you bet ? oh , hoss races an ' bo't races an ' canoe races , an ' Torrent ' and Delooge ' a-squirtin ' out in the Square , an ' cirkiss , an ' greased pig , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 be somp'n down there to-day wuth lookin ' at , an ' up here nothin ' but this dodblasted or river an ' a ding-clang passel o ' logs ! " " Say , " said the other , " I ca n't quite make that out yet . I ai n't a-catchin ' on to that performance . There ' s McCausland , an ' Tomer , an ' Joe Solomon , an ' Curran , an ' Conley , they all belong , ? but where ' s Steve Stanislaus ? An ' that little Dingbat , ? what ' s he doin ' with a paddle there ? " " Wants Joe to run the falls . " " Well , but he ai n't in Joe 's bo't ! " " Course not , ru m scullion ! That 's it !

He shake the rafters o ' heaven , but he ' 11 show us that he ' s every bit as good a waterman as Tobias Johnson . " " What makes him light on Joe ? and where ' s Steve ? " The man did not know as yet that the day before , when the crews reorganized at the Lower Lakes , Steve Stanisla , us , who was Joe Attien 's friend and cousin and physical counterpart , had left Joe 's boat . But all sorts of low cunning being readable to the Shirk , he was not at a loss for an explanation . " Well , do n't you see , lie ' s cut Steve out some ways . Joe handlin ' stern , that gives him a chance to go in the bow , and that ' s right on the way to a bo't of his own , and what he could n't get with no other man . He do n't ship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to git . He ' s figgerin ' how to put hisself at a premum as a crack mail . " " Reel Dingbat trick , " muttered the Cripple . " Joe knows that this ai n't no runnin ' water to-day ; just wicked to try to run here the way things is now . " " Do n't want to , do n't have to , " retorted the Swearer , for once omitting the garnish of his speech . And it was more true than most epigrams . Joe 's orders to go down with a boat did not imply that he was to run the Blue Rock Pitch against his judgment . A waterman of his reputation could dare to be prudent , and all the spectators thought that he intended to take out above the pitch and carry by and put in below . Then they saw him pick up his long paddle . The Shirk pricked up his ears and began to be more cheerful . " Looks like somp'n was goin ' to happen now ! " he chippered . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re runnin ' her out . There ' s Dingbat takin ' bow . Wonder what they are goin ' to do with that spare man ? Which one of them rip ? rip ? rippin ' galoots do you s'pose Joe be leavin ' behind ? " 742 The Death of Thoreau 's Guide . That seventh man in the boat was what the men never understood , and it gave the color to the accusation that Prouty pushed himself in . Seven men is a boat 's crew when working on logs , but in running dangerous places they carry but six , or even four men . It would seem as if , planning not to run , Joe had his log-working crew , and then , changing his mind suddenly , forgot to leave behind the extra man . " Gosh ! how rough the water is ! " said the Cripple ; " all choked up with jams both sides , and the logs running to beat hell . They do n't stand one chance , not in ? My soul ! ? but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat ! ? Well , what you must do you will do . " It was the inbred fatalism of his class , which makes them stoical . Simultaneously the Grumbler fired off a volley of curses which made the air smoke . " Rip ? rip ? rip ? bang ? bang ! If that Go-donged Injun ai n't a-shippin ' a Mitddywanikeag crew ! " ( In the cant of the river a " Mattawainkeag crew " means all the men a boat will hold . ) The Shirk was fully alive now . He jumped up and took his peavey from the log beside him . " Guess I ' 11 be mosey-in ' right along down now , " he chirped . Then he set out running over the logs at a lively pace , trailing his peavey behind him . He anticipated seeing something fully equal to greased pig and velocipede races . But there was not much to see that time . The catastrophe came at once , before they were fairly started . The water was very rough that morning , ? on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowning current , heaped up in the middle , that would push a boat upon the shore ; there were the log-jams making the channels narrow and crooked ; there were the loose logs running free , that would elbow and ram a boat and crowd her off when shetried to avoid them ; there were the doubtful , treacherous channels , creatures of the log-jams along the banks and of the fickle current , new with every differing condition , never to be fully memorized ; there were the rocks , not less cruel because cushioned with great boils of water ; and there were the boat 's own weight and tremendous momentum . No thoroughbred waterman will ever undertake to say how fast a boat can run in a rapid , for he does not know himself . He says , " Very fast , " and turns the topic to all-day records . Still the great sharp-nosed boat had as little cause to apprehend disaster as any boat could have had . She bore a picked crew ; she obeyed Joe Attien ; and she was a stanch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water . She knew all kinds and how to take them . There were the huge boils , those frightful , brandy-colored boils , streaked full of yellow foam-threads spinning from a hissing centre ; and there were the slicks , where a great rock betrayed his lurking-place only by the tail of glassy current below , ? safe are such places , for the rock lies above them ; and there were the ridgy manes of white water-curls , where the slopes of two great rocks met and rolled the water backward ; ? but she knew how to take them all ; she was prepared for perils on all sides , danger unintermittent , whether she took it slick , or bit into the foam with her long beak , or caught it raw and crosswise beneath her flaring gunwales . What she did not expect was that her peril would come before she had caught the set of the current at all ; no one looked for that , not even the Shirk , who was running fast so as to be right on hand when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intended to be heard above the roar of the water , such as , " Guess you got your bellyful this time , old fellow ; " and , " Go it , boys , you ' 11 get plumb to hell this trip , " It was nothing to one of his kind // that seven men stood in deadly peril , and the show of the moment he was craftily neglecting that he might the better witness the closing spectacle . But he never dreamed that it would come as it did . It was a very simple accident ; the dragon fly , with bulging eyes , rustling in zigzag flight along the river 's brink , might have reported what he saw as well as could a man . There was the long , lean boat , blue without and painted white within , lying with pointed stern and longer , tapering snout , steeving sharply , like a huge fish half out of water ; within her the line of red-shirted men , their tinny oars fringing her battered sides , the stripling Prouty high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors of which he has won so many fairly since ; then the row of seated men , ? ragged red shirts , sorely weathered ; hard red knuckles , tense on the oar-butts ; sunburned faces under torn brims , or hatless ; sun-scorched eyes , winking through sun-bleached lashes ; all , Yankee and Irishman and Province man , black-eyed Indian and blue-eyed Indian , waiting on big Joe Attien , towering in the stern , confident that what he did would be done right . Seven men , and four were looking backward to the shore , and three were facing forward toward the water , four one way and three the other , as if emblematic of the coming moment when they should be divided by three and by four , for life , for death . What they thought and how they felt , who could tell now ; but out of all those there the man 's heart which would have been best worth reading was that spare man 's on the lazy seat , who knew rough water , and could see ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he unbuckled his stout , calked brogans , and slipped them off his feet , ' who could say whether it was done from fear or from foresight ? Then the poles dip , the long , spruce , iron-shod poles at bow and stern , the oars sweep shallow water , and , splashing and gritting gravel as they push off , the poles dipping one side and the other , abreast and backward , like the long legs of an uncertain-minded crane-fly , they shove her out . And then was their black fate close upon them : she did not swing to the current ; she was too heavy , the crew were raw to one another and to the boat , bow and stern did not respond as they always had done when Steve Stanislaus and Joe handled boat , as their old crews still say , " just like one man . " Logy and bewildered , instead of turning promptly to the current , the old boat let the water catch her underneath her side . It shot her straight across the channel , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the Blue Rock Pitch . And then , before she could be straightened , the River took her in his giant hands , and smashed her side against a rock , smote her clown with such a crash that the men along the banks who saw and heard it can not be convinced that she was not wrecked ; and some who saw her fill so suddenly still declare that her whole bottom was torn off as you rip the peel from a mandarin orange . That is not true ; she was not much hurt . But eighteen hundred pounds of boat and men were hurled upon that sunken rock with the full force of the River . The port side buckled fearfully ; the ribs groaned and gave ; the nails screamed as the sharp rock sheared off their heads , and a long yellow shaving , ploughed out of her side , went writhing clown the foaming current . Down to the water 's edge dipped the up-stream gunwale ; in poured the water in a flood , and before she settled squarely , the lifted port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shock that sent the man upon the lazy seat reeling backward , that tumbled the men at the oars forward upon their faces , that wrenched their oars from their hands and threw the batteau seats from the cleats , and sent the spare man 's driving shoes adrift among the litter of unshipped seats and useless men ? Un- 744 The Death of Thoreau 's Guide . manned , unmanageable , full to the lips of water , and just on the brink of the Blue Rock Pitch , what could the old boat do ? Joe dropped his useless pole and took his paddle , but she could not answer to it , and bow-heavy with the weight of water running forward as she felt the incline of the fall , her stern reeling high in air , her crew , disarmed and helpless , crowding on the bowman , she wallowed down that wicked water among rocks and logs . So much is fairly certain , but beyond this no one seems quite sure ; for I can find no one who saw it . Tobias Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs of their heads , for they had sprung at once to the rescue in their own boat . And the Shirk , who would have been glad to see , was out of the running . In his haste to be on hand , lie had tripped himself on his peavey , and had been plunged headforemost into a hole in the jam , where , kicking and clawing , he went off like Mother Hoyt 's powder-horn . ( Cursing his own awkwardness ? No , not a bit ! Damning the men who were struggling in the water , because they had tripped him up , and had not given him a fair chance to see them die ! ) Nor did John Ross on his log-jam see it , though he was so near . " I was on a dry jam right there , but I had kept Levi Hathorn 's boat with me in case any one should tumble in or anything should happen , and I sent it down to them , ? and I do n't know any more .

The others leaped and swam ; these clung to the boat . And Joe Attien stayedwith them , ? not clinging as they did , buried in water , not crouching and abject , waiting for the death that faced him , ? not a coward , now , never , but paddle in hand , because the water ran too deep for pole-hold , standing astride his sunken boat , a big , calked foot upon either gunwale , working to the last ounce that was in him to drive the sunken wreck and the men clinging to it into some eddy or cleft of the log-jams before they were carried down over the Heater and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one sees of Joe Attien ; no one has reported anything after that ; one remembers him always as standing high in the stern of his boat , dying with and for his men .

We do not speak of them , ? this is not their day . Enough that when they saw Joe Attien 's boat swamp they all leaped into their places and swept out to the rescue . Man after man they pulled in , heedless of their own safety . The last one they caught when they were just on the verge of the Heater , and then somehow , overloaded as they were , on the brink of sure death , they swung in and crept back to the landing-place . Ashore they looked over the saved and called the names of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stephen Tomer , an Indian lad , and Edward Conley of Woodstock , and Dingbat Prouty . They still hoped for these , ? hope dies hard , and they knew how difficult it is to drown a man who resolutely prefers to try his chances of being hanged . So they and all who had flocked in to them at the flying rumor of disaster took up pick-poles , pickaroons , peavies , whatever might be used to save a living man or to recover the body of a drowned one , and set off down the drivers ' path which skirts the falls . There was little hope of finding Joe . When they saw him go they all understood that , dead or alive , they would find him with his men . But Dingbat had been seen swimming strongly . If the logs had not crushed him , nor the rocks broken him , he might yet be picked up in some inshore cove where the eddy played , clinging to the alders , too for-done to pull himself out , but still alive . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , ? for I had it from one who was there , ? and when they did discover him , it was the rescuers who were scant of breath . " Ga-w-d ! but do n't he seem to be Lakin ' it easy ! " said one . For a man who had just been through what he had been through , he certainly was taking it very easy . He was sitting on a log out in an eddy , a great hulling-machine log , peeled by the rocks in rapids , with tatters of bark hanging to its scarred sides , bitten to the quick by the ledges , broomed at the ends by being tumbled over falls . There in the eddy it was drifting because it was too big to be dislodged until some driver prodded it out and over the Grand Pitch . Unable to escape , it went sailing round and round , sometimes butting other logs and ramming the weaker ones out into the rapids , sometimes nosing up against the line of the current , and always drawing back again into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever a little beyond the line of the bushes , ever a little inside the line of the current . The falls-spume gathered in clots against the side farthest from the eddy 's vortex , and the torrent , as it rushed past , threw up wavelets that lapped its flanks . And there in the warm morning sunshine , wet as a drowned rat , his hair plastered over his sharp-cut face , and the wrinkles round his nose showing more plainly than common , sat the missing bowman , drippingfrom every edge and elbow , but stolidly sucking his pipe . " Well , I call that nerve ! " remarked one of the rescuers , viewing him from behind a screen of bushes . He appreciated the self-command it took for a man considerably more than half drowned and entirely soaked to get out his old pipe , dig her clean , and clamp her under his spiked shoe to dry while he peeled his wet tobacco down to the solid heart , got out his matches from his water-tight vial , and filled and lit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment watching him , as , theatrically unconscious of their presence , which he well enough observed , he drew at his pipe , and swung with the eddy , his shadow now falling to the front , now to the rear . " Ai n't he a James Dickey-bird ! " said another beneath his breath . Then Dingbat overdid the matter . " Where ' s that damned Injun ? " he demanded , suddenly acknowledging their presence . The ichor of swift resentment coursed through their veins ; already it was settled in their minds who was responsible for this disaster . Here he was , safe enough , having saved himself ; Joe Attien was dead trying to save his crew . As the lightning flash sometimes photographs indelibly the objects nearest where it strikes , so on the minds of these men that unfeeling question branded forevermore the pictures that stood for those two lives , ? Dingbat floating at his ease in the eddy , having looked out for himself , Joe Attien drowned and battered and lost among logs and ledges , willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have never forgotten , never will forget , that difference . To this day when you ask one of them who was there at the time bow Joe Attien died , this contrast leaps before him , and he says that Dingbat Prouty ( lid it .
