It was learned by Allen that Gross had been home just a few minutes ahead of the patrolman and that he gathered up a few of his belongings and departed . Allen reported this to the station , and a general alarm , with a de-scription of Gross , was sent out for him , as Well as for the third man . Bartky is locked up , charged with carrying combustibles and also as being a suspicious person . Three of the bombe ' were wrapped in red paper , and the fourth in green .
