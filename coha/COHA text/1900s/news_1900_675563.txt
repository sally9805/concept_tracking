txt Evidence tending to show the wide-reaching ramifications of the divorce mill operated by Henry Zeimer , now under arrest for obstructing justice in manufacturing evidence on which absolute divorces might be obtained , was collected yesterday by the District Attorney , and it was stated that there is now ample proof to sustain the statement that nothing has ever been brought to light in the local courts which would compare with the scale on which Zeimer and his accomplices worked . The District Attorney 's office came into possession of facts yesterday which leads It to believe that Zeimer was not the MovInespirit in the conspiracy , the real head of which is a lawyer who had offices at 239 Broadway , and who posed under the name of W. Waldo Matson and NV . W. Royal . The police were looking for him yesterday without success , and on a search warrant issued by Recorder Goff Assistant District Attorneys Unger and Gordon had the office in which Morison operated opened and made a thorough search among the papers found there . It was in this same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that Zeimer acted for the plaintiff in all actions that had first come to Maison through the advertisements which he inserted in various newspapers , of whh.h the following is a copy : Divorces quietly ; desertion , non-support , insanity , separation papers , accident ( breach promise , consultations free ; confidential . Attorney Maison , 239 Broadway . The client was then requested to sign a paper , which made Matson his or her attorney and agent , and he was empowered to bring the action when and where he saw fit . Then it was that Zeimer came upon the scene as the attorney for the plaintiff . and in most of the cases Royal . who was really Maison , figured as the defendant 's attorney , either with or ? . ? ithout consent . Maison 's name rever appeared on any of the papers in ally capacity , and in this way the head of the gang was enabled to remain in seclusion so far as the courts were concerned . It was generally known in the building at 230 Broadway that Matson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hall appeared but these two names . ? MAISON Royal while on the office door on the sixth floor of the building was the sign : I " Royal and Matson. - ? There were no initials added to either name nor was the business of the firm mentioned . It was through the arrest of Mrs. Byrde G. Herrick , the plaintiff in Zeimer 's last case , that the District Attorney first got proof of the connection of Zeimer and Maison . Mrs. Herrick , who lived at 069 Bedford Avenue . Brooklyn . was taken into custody late on Friday night , and she made a. statement to - Mr . Unger which showed that she had first taken counsel with Maison in relation to a divorce and had thereafter left the whole matter in his hands . Zeimer was appointed by Maison to try the case for her before the referee , in whose office the arrest of the alleged conspirators was effected . THE FLIGHT OF ' - LIAISON . Mrs. Herrick , according to the District Attorney , is also responsible for Matson 's flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the referee in her case , when the detectives arrested Zeimer . Wilson , and the woman Tompkins , who aeteil as co-respondent for Mrs. Herrick . There was at that time no warrant out for Mrs. Herrick 's arrest , and the detectives told her to leave the room while they took the other persons into custody . Mrs. Herrick went at once to Maison 's office , where she told him what had happened . lie became much excited , and , seizing a bag , hurriedly put a lot of papers in it , and . telling Mrs. Herrick that he would meet her later , decamped . No trace of him has since been found . Armed with the search warrant issued by Recorder Goff , Mr. Unger and Mr. Gordon went to Matson 's office , which had been locked up since Maison 's departure . The warrant stated that the District Attorney had reason to believe that the affidavit in the Herrick case could be found In the office and that it was a necessary piece of evidence in the case . The order said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and under this restriction little else was taken . It was necessary , however , to look through a great mass of papers in searching for the affidavit , tho contents of which were noted . It is probable that the search warrant will be extended to-morrow and that these papers will be taken away and used as evidence . The office was divided in two parts . In each of these was a desk , one of which had been used by Matson and the other by Zeimer . There was no library and not a law book was in sight . Some cheap prints adorned the walls , and , to give the impression of offices beyond , portieres were stretched over the doors that led out of the rooms on either side , but these were nailed up and never used . The machinery of the divorce mill was elaborate and plentiful . A number of letters addressed " NV . W. Royal . " " ' . Waldo Matson , " and " Royal V. Matson " were found . These lay on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box opening , and they had not.been opened . They were in pink and blue envelopes and bore inscriptions evidently written by feminine hands . Papers in the divorce suits of Rose B. Tumblety vs . Bernard Tumblety , and James H. Norton vs . Della Norton , were found . There were a number of receipt books showing payments at various times by Matson to Zeimer . These were mainly for small amounts . Most of them were for $1.50 , $2 , and similar sums . There was one for $25 , which was the largest amount . There were also receipts from a New York newspaper for advertisements received , one calling for seven insertions for $1 and dated Feb. 11 last . In Matson 's desk were also a great number of photographs of men and women . As the identification of defendants by witnesses in divorce actions where the defendant does not appear in person is mainly conducted through the medium of photographs , these were evidently part of the machinery of the mill . An old four-barreled derringer was also in this part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine Treasure Seeking Company , " of which Matson was the promoter . THE CONSPIRATORS ' BLANKS . There was a letter from Edith Jameson , stating that her husband , a member of the Casino company , had deserted her and her child and asking what steps she could take regarding a divorce , and a letter from Annie Briggs of 161 College Street. , Middletown , Conn .. asking what had become of her divorce suit . The most interesting object discovered was a great bundle of blank and filled-out applications , showing the Method nude/ which the gang worked . One of the applications is as follows : APPLICATION FOR DIVORCE . Your name in full ' Post Office address ' Where married ' When married ' Have you children ' Names and Ages ? Who has possession ' Have you Real Estate ' Your occupation ' Are you living with uefendant ? Date of Separation ' Did you leave defendant ' Name of defendant ' Post Office address ? Has the defendant Real Estate ? Would defendant oppose divorce ? Your cause for divorce ' ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and appoint W. WALDO MAISON my Attorney and Agent , to procure for me a divorce . And hereby authorize him to bring the suit in any place that be may in his judgment think best . Witness , ) On top of the bundle of applications was one signed by Adolph Lindauer of a46 Tenth Avenue , who applied for a divorce from Luisa F. Lindauer . It was learned later that tills case had been tried in Brooklyn and that it nad been hung up on account of the strange proceedings noted by the referee . The defendant 's . lawyer was given as S. S. Campbell . There is no such lawyer registered here . 1 he searchers finally came upon the affidavit and order of reference in the Herrick case , which they took with them . They also a  --  ok a large flashlight picture repreSentlItg Maison sitting at his desk . In Zeimer 's desk was found an envelope addressed . " Henry Zeimer , 1,213 Hoe Avenue , Borough of the Bronx . " Inquiry there last night brought out the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander Avenue Station , lives on the ground floor and a lawyer named Lazarus on the second floor . The Lazarus apartment was unoccupied last night . and it was stated by persons in the house that Mr. Lazarus had not been there since yesterday morning , and that his wife had gone to Philadelphia last night . A description of Lazarus given by the neighbors fits Zeimer exactly . It was also stated that a man answering the description of Maison asked last night at the drug store on the corner where 1.213 Hoe Avenue was . He went in that direction and soon returned , when he asked the drug clerk to cash a money order for him . The clerk refused and the man went away . In Zeimer 's desk there were also a great number of letters from persons all over the country referring to actions for divorce . Some of these were from South America , Porto Rico , and England . Although the District Attorney refuses still to make known the names of the defendants ' attorneys in a number of the cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found , it was admitted by Mr. Unger that Matson had evidently posed under a great number of names , the defendant 's attorneys being , in fact , dummies who never put in an appearance before the referee . n several cases the defendant 's lawyer was named either " Rothchild , " " Botschilde. " or " Rotschild. " the changes on this name having been rung several times . In the cases of Parsons vs . Parsons , Gardner vs . Gardner , Cortelyou vs . Cortelyou , and Johnson vs . Johnson , the defendant 's lawyer is " W. W. Royal . " THE REFEREES SUSPICIOUS . Zeimer operated extensively in the Brooklyn courts and made a number of applications for references to Justice Marean . In two of ' these cases the referees became suspicious and refused to make favorable reports . In every instance where the names of the defendant 's attorney is given on the papers a search failed to reveal any lawyer registered under such name . All are believed to be dummies . Besides the Lindauer and Tumblety cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeimer appeared in the actions of Louis Fray vs . Alfreda B. Fray and Carrie J. Miller vs . Albert E. Miller . In the Miller case the affidavit of the plaintiff states that her husband lives in Cleveland . Ohio , and the summons was served by publication . The time to answer in this case has not yet expired . The referee in the Tumblety case was appointed on Oct. 27. and in the Fray and Lindauer cases on Oct. 30 . George S. Billings was the referee in each instance . According to Mr. Billings 's statement , Zeimer , who appeared for the plaintiff in these cases . must have had several women who posed as co-respondents , and one of them answers the description of the woman Tompkins . Mr. Billings said yesterday that he was not satisfied with the evidence in the cases , and told Zeimer so . Maria Bartlett was the co-respondent in the Tumblety case , Mr. Billings said . She tallies in description with ' Mary Tompkins , and swore that she had lived with Tumblety as his wife . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man calling himself James H. Frank , and whose description tallies with the man Wilson now under arrest , swore to his intimacy with the woman defendant . He was corroborated by a woman who called herself Mary Davis . " I thought all of these cases rather strange , - said Mr. Billings , " and decided not to report favorably . I am glad / , ow that I acted as I did . " Mrs. Herrick is now in the House of Detention as a witness . Her statement made to the District Attorney that she paid Maison no money , but that her husband gave him $1 : 0 is borne out in part by Mrs. Anna Seeger , with whom Mrs. Herrick lived . Although Herrick was the defendant in the case , he furnished the money for his wife 's lawyer , and the latter , through Zeimer. got the woman Tompkins to pose as a co-defendant . Mrs. Herrick vas known in Brooklyn as Mrs. Downing , which name she assumed after her husband left her . According to Mrs. Seeger . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a consultation , and the payment of the money by Mr. Herrick . Maison said he would fix everything up all right , would procure the witnesses , and that the divorce would be granted in a short time . Mrs. Seeger says that Mrs. Herrick had no idea that there was anything wrong until the arrests were made . Chester L. Gardner , whose wife , Sadie L. Gardner , obtained a divorce from him through Zeimer 's efforts . is in business at 380 Court Street . Brooklyn . He stated frankly that he cared nothing about his wife or her divorce , and was only too well satisfied if she had obtained it . He says they were married ten years ago in Syracuse , and that thereafter on several occasions his wife left him . He then caused to be published a notice L  --  tating that he would not he responsible for her debts . Some time ago , he said , he received a summons and complaint in an action brought by his wife , and . although he asserts that he gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not contest . and , in fact . paid no attention to the matter The co-respondent in this case was Mamie Galway . who gave her address as 19 Kosciusko Street . and the corroborative evidence was given by one Frank Barrett of 234 Pacific Street . who swore that he had seen Gardner and the woman Galway in the Morton House . Gardner said that he had never known any such woman and had never been in the Morton House in his life . He added again . however , that he was satisfied to be free from his wife and had no idea where she was . EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION . The District Attorney has also evidence going to prove that the man defendant in a number of the cases , through collusion with the plaintiff and Maison and Zeimer , offered to furnish evidence on which . a divorce could be obtained against him . The most notable of these cases is that of Cecilia Hatch vs . Metcalf Hatch , which was tried before Francis P. Lowrey , as referee , in December last . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two men snore to having seen Hatch in a woman 's company , one being the keeper in a lodging house on East Thirteenth Street . A corroborating witness was Eugene Luce , who said he was janitor in the office building at 2.39 Broadway , where Maison arid Zeimer had offices . St. Luce , who is a negro , was seen at the building yesterday . He said that in December last Zeimer came to him ' one afternoon , and asked him if he would deliver a letter to a man named Wilson that night . St. Luce said he would , and met Zeimer at the Park Avenue Hotel . He received a letter addressed " Mr. Wilson , " and he and Zeimer then went up to a room in the hotel . Zeimer knocked on the door and said " Ice . " The door was at once opened by a man . There was a woman in the room . The man did not seem surprised or angry , but took the note and said " No answer " and closed the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said St Luce , " until I was summoned to appear before a referee in a divorce action of Hatch vs . Hatch . I identified Hatch as the man to whom I had delivered the note in the hotel , and they told me that what they had shown me was a photograph of Hatch . I also said that the woman in the room was not Mrs. Hatch , who was at the hearing . " As soon as I found out what kind of business Zeimer and Maison were engaged in I refused to have anything further to do with them . I also told my employers about the matter . I have nothing to conceal , and will go before the Grand Jury or the District Attorney and tell what I know . It is my opinion , however , that it had all been fixed up in advance that Hatch was to be there and that the word ' ice ' was a password agreed upon between Zeimer and Hatch . 1 also ' found out later that what I had given to Hatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suit against him . " St. Luce also made a statement which may be used by the authorities to prove why Maison did not appear in any of the cases . A tenant of the building , who suspected Maison , started an inquiry and claimed to have discovered that he had not filed a certificate which would allow him to practice in this State . A letter setting forth these facts was given to St. Luce and by him given to the owner of the office building . Nothing came of the matter , however , but an investigation along the same lines will be made by the District Attorney 's Office . A further Identification of Wilson was made yesterday by Charles M. Beattie , a lawyer with offices in the Morton Building , before whom . as referee , the ' prisoner had appeared in the case of Fredericka B. Johnson against Frederick M. Johnson , under the name of Joseph Barrett . Mr. Beattie ' went to the Tombs yesterday with Assistant District Attorney Gordon . He spoke to Wilson . but the latter turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson case the method of procedure was exactly the same as in the Hatch case , at least so far as Wilson or Barrett was concerned . He identified the defendant from a photograph , and swore that he had been asked by a stranger to take a letter to Johnson , in the New Amsterdam Hotel . The hotel clerk , he said , sent a bellboy up stairs with him , and when he knocked on the door Johnson opened it , looked at the letter , said " No answer , " and closed the door . Barret was asked whom he saw in the room . " I saw that woman there , " he replied , pointing to the co-respondent . The woman gave her name as Roselle Silver , her occupation as that of a dressmaker , and her address as 79 West Ninetyfirst Street . She swore that she was in the New Amsterdam Hotel with Johnson on June 22 last . She said that she had also been with him on other occasions . In this case the name " W. W. Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Beattie was suspicious of the case and held it back for some . time . He also directed the stenographer to have an extra copy of the testimony made for him , and this he now retains and has placed at the service of the District Attorney . He was finally compelled to report the matter , and on it a decree was granted to Mrs. Johnson . Mr. Beattie also had a look at the woman Tompkins in the House of Detention . He says that the woman who appeared before him as corespondent in the Johnson case was a different person . THE JUSTICES WILL ACT . The Justices of the Supreme Court are thoroughly aroused over the disclosures in the Zeimer case , and a number of them , including Justice Scott , said again yesterday that the Legislature would be asked to take action in the matter to the end that divorce actions may in the future be investigated by a regularly appointed officer of the court . It is impossible , " said Justice Scott , " for the Court to investigate the cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referee must be relied on in all cases . These referees are all reputable lawyers and can be imposed upon quite as easily as can the Court . They follow the law , and if the evidence is conclusive and no evidences of collusion are present they must so report to the Court . I know of a number of instances in which this fellow Zeimer 's cases were hung up , but in the end the referee was forced to report on the evidence adduced before him and a decree was granted . An officer appointed by the Appellate Division to investigate all cases would be the only safe way , and this , I am sure , will be asked for . " Speaking of the proposed plan to have an additiona.I Surrogate appointed who shall hear all divorce cases in open court , another of the Justices said yesterday that this would do away with referees altogether in such actions and would save the Court much time and worry . " As it is now , " he said , " divorce actions , with their various motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other class of actions . They gravitate from one part to another constantly . There are applications for alimony , orders are asked to have it reduced or increased , motions for orders of arrest for contempt , trials by jury and in equity , and for one day of each week the whole time of one part is taken up with undefended cases . The practice should be radically changed , and this appears to be the time to change it . "
