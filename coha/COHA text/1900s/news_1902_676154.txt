txt supposed that since the HENRY the Kaiser would see his way clear to avail himself of an opportunity to have an experience which would not only give him great pleasure but do him a great deal of good . It is difficult to imagine anything more edu- % eating to one of the Emperor 's training and temperament than to spend a few weeks in a prosperous and happy country where the traditions of royalty are unknown , and where the people manage to get along , very well without King or Court or ; nobility or a military establishment of burdensome magnitude or impoverishing cost , and where the favorite.amusement is lese majest6 in one form or another . That he could usefully apply what he would learn on such a trip in the discharge of his imperial duties and functions is not at all improbable . To broaden one 's horizon is always beneficial , and even as liberal and enlightened a monarch as WILLIAM would find himself the better for it if he could take a month off , and as C01 . HOHBNzoLLBRN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAXE , visit this country and have the kind of a time our people would give him in all hospitality and good-fellowship . Obviously , he could not come as King of Prussia or German Emperor and receive the kind of attention to which he is ac-customed at home . If as wise as his general intelligence would lead us to be-lieve , he would not want it . To dispense for a little while with the forms and ceremonies of his artificial life in his own kingdom would make him young again , fill his lungs with vitalizing air , clear his brain , and suggest a hundred schemes of benefit to his people , and , incidentally , his family . Should the Emperor find it consistent with his plans to arrange an American visit , we can at least promise him as good a time as he desires and a supply of new and durable impressions which he can not hope to gain in the circumscribed life of his own official circle or from the exchange of visits with royalty in or out of his own country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prince HENRY and the recounting of his experiences , we venture to say that the regret he expresses at the fact that his dream of an American tour is not likely to be realized is sincere and heartfelt . Kings and Emperors pay full prices for what they get in the way of satisfaction from royal or imperial state , in finding the things they really want to do impracticable for reasons which do not obtain in the lives of mortals not burdened with the cares and responsibilities attached to a crown . The German Emperor is not so constituted that he can take himself or his functions other than quite seriously , and the idea that he is entitled to a vacation if he wants it probably has not occurred to him . Should it do so , there is no country on earth to which he could go with the assurance of a warmer welcome  --  even though it might lack something in formality and be more like a protracted and peripatetic " coramers " than he has known since his student days .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
