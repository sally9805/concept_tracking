Scene : Sitting-room in Horace Cole 's house at Brixton . The room is cheaply furnished in genteel style . The window looks out on a row of little houses , all of the Cole pattern . The door leads into a narrow passage communicating at once with the front door . The fireplace has a fancy mantel border , and over it is an overmantel , decorated with many photographs and cheap ornaments . The sideboard , a small bookcase , a table , and a comfortable armchair , are the chief articles of furniture . The whole effect is modest , and quite unpleasing . Time : Late afternoon on a spring day in any year in the future . When the curtain rises , Mrs. Horace Cole is sitting in the comfortable armchair putting a button onto her husband 's coat . She is a pretty , fluffy little woman who could never be bad-tempered , but might be fretful . At this minute she is smiling indulgently , and rather irritatingly , at her sister Winifred , who is sitting by the fire when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . Winifred is a tall and distinguished-looking young woman with a cheerful , capable manner and an emphatic diction which betrays the public speaker . She wears the colours of the N.W.S.P.U. COLE Well , good-bye , Ethel . It 's a pity you wo n't believe me . I wanted to let you and Horace down gently , or I should n't be here . p. 3 COLE But you 're always prophesying these dreadful things , Winnie , and nothing ever happens . Do you remember the day when you tried to invade the House of Commons from submarine boats ? Oh , Horace did laugh when he saw in the papers that you had all been landed on the Hovis wharf by mistake ! " By accident , on purpose ! " Horace said . He could n't stop laughing all the evening . " What price your sister Winifred , " he said . " She asked for a vote , and they gave her bread . " He kept on  --  you ca n't think how funny he was about it ! COLE Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of humor is his strong point . Well , we must hope it will bear the strain that is going to be put on it today . Of course , when his female relations invade his house  --  all with the same story , " I 've come to be supported "  --  he may think it excruciatingly funny . One never knows . COLE Winnie , you 're only teasing me . They would never do such a thing . They must know we have only one spare bedroom , and that 's to be for a paying guest when we can afford to furnish it . COLE The servants ' bedroom will be empty . Do n't forget that all the domestic servants have joined the League and are going to strike , too . COLE Not ours , Winnie . Martha is simply devoted to me , and poor little Lily could n't leave . She has no home to go to . She would have to go to the workhouse . p. 4 COLE Exactly where she will go . All those women who have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , have instructions to go to the relieving officer . The number of female paupers who will pour through the workhouse gates tonight all over England will frighten the Guardians into blue fits . COLE Horace says you 'll never frighten the Government into giving you the vote . COLE It 's your husband , your dear Horace , and a million other dear Horaces who are going to do the frightening this time . By tomorrow , perhaps before , Horace will be marching to Westminster shouting out " Votes for Women ! " COLE Winnie , how absurd you are ! You know how often you 've tried to convert Horace and failed . Is it likely that he will become a Suffragette just because  --  COLE Just because  --  ? Go on , Ethel . COLE Well , you know  --  all this you 've been telling me about his relations coming here and asking him to support them . Of course I do n't believe it . Agatha , for instance , would never dream of giving up her situation . But if they did come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could he on 4 a week ? COLE How could he ! That 's the point ! He could n't , of course . That 's why he 'll want to get rid of them at any cost  --  even the cost of letting women have the Vote . That 's why he and the majority of men in this country should n't for years have kept alive the foolish superstition that all women are supported by men . For years we have told them it was a delusion , but they could not take our arguments seriously . Their method of answering us was exactly that of the little boy in the street who cries " Yah  --  Suffragette ! " when he sees my ribbon . p. 5 COLE I always wish you would n't wear it when you come here . . . . Horace does so dislike it . He thinks its unwomanly . COLE Oh ! does he ? Tomorrow he may want to borrow it  --  when he and the others have had their object-lesson . They would n't listen to argument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about woman 's place in the world in a very practical and sensible way . At this very minute working women of every grade in every part of England are ceasing work , and going to demand support and the necessities of life from their nearest male relatives , however distant the nearest relative may be . I hope , for your sake , Ethel , that Horace 's relatives are n't an exacting lot ! COLE There was n't a word about it in the Daily Mail this morning . COLE Never mind . The evening papers will make up for it . COLE What male relative are you going to , Winnie ? Uncle Joseph ? COLE Oh , I 'm in the fighting line , as usual , so our dear uncle will be spared . My work is with the great army of women who have no male belongings of any kind ! I shall be busy till midnight marshalling them to the workhouse . . . . This is perhaps the most important part of the strike . By this we shall hit men as ratepayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , either in a public capacity or a private one , will find himself face to face with the appalling problem of maintaining millions of women in idleness . Will the men take up the burden , d'ye think ? Not they ! ( Looks at her watch . ) Good heavens ! The strike began ages ago . I must be off . I 've wasted too much time here already . p. 6 COLE ( looking at the clock ) . I had no idea it was so late . I must see about Horace 's tea . He may be home any minute . ( Rings the bell L. ) COLE Poor Horace ! COLE ( annoyed ) . Why " poor Horace " ? I do n't think he has anything to complain of . ( Rings again . ) COLE I feel some pity at this minute for all the men . COLE What can have happened to Martha ? COLE She 's gone , my dear , that 's all . COLE Nonsense . She 's been with me ever since I was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter Lily , a shabby little maid-of-all-work , dressed for walking , the chief effect of the toilette being a very cheap and very smart hat . ) COLE Where 's Martha , Lily ? LILY She 's left , m 'm . COLE Left ! She never gave me notice . LILY No , m 'm , we was n't to give no notice , but at three o'clock we was to quit . p. 7 COLE But why ? Do n't be a silly little girl . And you must n't come in here in your hat . LILY I was just goin ' when you rang . That 's what I 've got me ' at on for . COLE Going ! Where ? It 's not your afternoon out . LILY I 'm goin ' back to the Union . There 's dozens of others goin ' with me . COLE But why  --  LILY Miss Christabel  --  she told us . She says to us : " Now look ' ere , all of yer  --  you who 've got no men to go to on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says ; " and the one who ' angs back "  --  and she looked at me , she did  --  " may be the person ' oo the ' ole strain of the movement is restin ' on , the traitor ' oo 's sailin ' under the ' ostile flag , " she says ; and I says , " That wo n't be me  --  not much ! " ( During this speech Winifred puts on a sandwich board which bears the inscription : " This way to the Work- COLE Well , Ethel , are you beginning to believe ? COLE Oh , I think it 's very unkind  --  very wicked . How am I to get Horace anything to eat with no servants ? COLE Cheer up , my dear . Horace and the others can end the strike when they choose . But they 're going to have a jolly bad time first . Good-bye . ( Exit Winnie , singing the " Marseillaise. " ) p. 8 LILY Wait a bit , Miss . I 'm comin ' with yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no . Oh , Lily , please do n't go , or at any rate bring up the kettle first , and the chops , and the frying-pan . Please ! Then I think I can manage . LILY ( coming back into the room and speaking impressively ) . There 's no ill-feeling . It 's an objick lesson  --  that 's all . ( Exit Lily . Ethel begins to cry weakly ; then lays the table ; gets bread , cruet , tea , cups , etc. , from the cupboard . Lily re-enters with a frying-pan , a kettle , and two raw chops . ) LILY ' Ere you are  --  it 's the best I can do . You see , mum , I 've got to be recognized by the State . I do n't think I 'm a criminal nor a lunatic , and I ought n't to be treated as sich . COLE You poor little simpleton . Do you suppose that , even if this absurd plan succeeds , you will get a vote ? LILY I may  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I 'm giving up work . It 's so as I sha n't stop them as ought to ' ave it . The ' ole strain 's on me , and I 'm goin ' to the Union  --  so good-bye , mum . ( Exit Lily. ) p. 9 COLE And I 've always been so kind to you ! Oh , you little brute ! What will Horace say ? ( looking out of the window ) . It ca n't be true . Everything looks the same as usual . Horace 's voice outside ) : We must have at least sixteen Dreadnoughts this year . ( Williams ' voice ) : You ca n't get ' em , old chap , unless you expect the blooming colonies to pay for ' em . Ah , here is Horace , and Gerald Williams with him . Oh , I hope Horace has n't asked him to tea ! ( She powders her nose at the glass , then pretends to be busy with the kettle . ) ( Enter Horace Cole  --  an English master in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man stiff with self-consciousness . ) COLE You 're back early , are n't you , Horry ? How do you do , Mr. Williams ? WILLIAMS How do you do , Mrs. Cole ? I just dropped in to fetch a book your husband 's promised to lend me . ( Horace rummages in book-shelves . ) COLE Had a good day , Horry ? COLE Oh , much as usual . Ah , here it is  --  ( reading out the title )  --  " Where 's the Wash-tub now ? " with a preface by Lord Curzon of Kedleston , published by the Men 's League for Opposing Women 's Suffrage . If that does n't settle your missus , nothing will . p. 10 COLE Is Mrs. Williams a Suffragette ? WILLIAMS Rather ; and whenever I say anything , all she can answer is , " You know nothing about it . " Thank you , old man . I 'll read it to her after tea . So long . Good-bye , Mrs. Cole . COLE Did Mrs. Williams tell you anything this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . WILLIAMS About Votes for Women , do you mean ? Oh , no . Not allowed at breakfast . In fact , not allowed at all . I tried to stop her going to these meetings where they fill the women 's heads with all sorts of rubbish , and she said she 'd give ' em up if I 'd give up my footer matches ; so we agreed to disagree . See you tomorrow , old chap . Good-bye , Mrs. Cole . ( Exit Gerald Williams . ) COLE You might have asked him to stop to tea . You made him very welcome  --  I do n't think . COLE I 'm sorry ; but I do n't think he 'd have stayed if I had asked him . COLE Very likely not , but one should always be hospitable . Tea ready ? COLE Not quite , dear . It will be in a minute . COLE What on earth is all this ! p. 11 COLE Oh , nothing . I only thought I would cook your chop for you up here today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethel , that so long as we can afford a servant , it 's rather unnecessary . COLE You know you 're always complaining of Martha 's cooking . I thought you would like me to try . COLE My dear child ! It 's very nice of you . But why not cook in the kitchen ? Raw meat in the sitting-room ! COLE Oh , Horry , do n't ! ( She puts her arms round his neck and sobs . The chop at the end of the toasting fork in her hand dangles in his face . ) COLE What on earth 's the matter ? Ethel , dear , do n't be hysterical . If you knew what it was to come home fagged to death and be worried like this . . . . I 'll ring for Martha and tell her to take away these beastly chops . They 're getting on my nerves . COLE Martha 's gone . COLE When ? Why ? Did you have a row ? I suppose you had to give her a month 's wages . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLE ( sobbing ) . It 's not you who afford it , anyhow . Do n't I pay Martha out of my own money ? p. 12 COLE Do you call it ladylike to throw that in my face . . . . COLE ( incoherently ) . I 'm not throwing it in your face . . . but as it happens I did n't pay her anything . She went off without a word . . . and Lily 's gone , too . ( She puts her head down on the table and cries . ) COLE Well , that 's a good riddance . I 'm sick of her dirty face and slovenly ways . If she ever does clean my boots , she makes them look worse than when I took them off . We must try and get a charwoman . COLE We sha n't be able to . Is n't it in the papers ? COLE What are you talking about ? COLE Winifred said it would be in the evening papers . COLE Winifred ! She 's been here , has she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be your sister I ca n't imagine . Of course she 's mixed up with this wildcat scheme . COLE Then you know about it ! COLE Oh , I saw something about " Suffragettes on Strike " on the posters on my way home . Who cares if they do strike ? They 're no use to anyone . Look at Winifred . What does she ever do except go round making speeches , and kicking up a row outside the House of Commons until she forces the police to arrest her . Then she goes to prison and poses as a martyr . Martyr ! We all know she could go home at once if she would promise the magistrate to behave herself . What they ought to do is to try all these hysterical women in camera and sentence them to be ducked  --  privately . Then they 'd soon give up advertising themselves . p. 13 COLE Winnie has a splendid answer to that , but I forget what it is . Oh , Horry , was there anything on the posters about the nearest male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't gone dotty , have you ? When you have quite done with my chair , I  --  ( He helps her out of the chair and sits down . ) Thank you . COLE Winnie said that not only are all the working women going to strike , but they are going to make their nearest male relatives support them . COLE Rot ! COLE I thought how dreadful it would be if Agatha came , or that cousin of yours on the stage whom you wo n't let me know , or your Aunt Lizzie ! Martha and Lily have gone to their male relatives ; at least , Lily 's gone to the workhouse  --  it 's all the same thing . Why should n't it be true ? Oh , look , Horace , there 's a cab  --  with luggage . Oh , what shall we do ? COLE Do n't fuss ! It 's stopping next door , not here at all . COLE No , no ; it 's here . ( She rushes out . ) COLE ( calling after her ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looks as if we did n't keep a servant . ( Re-enter Ethel , followed after a few seconds by Agatha . Agatha is a weary-looking woman of about thirty-five . She wears the National Union colours , and is dowdily dressed. ) p. 14 COLE It is Agatha  --  and such a big box . Where can we put it ? COLE ( mildly ) . How do you do , Horace . ( Kisses him . ) Dear Ethel ! ( Kisses her . ) You 're not looking so well as usual . Would you mind paying the cabman two shillings , Horace , and helping him with my box ? It 's rather heavy , but then it contains all my worldly belongings . COLE Agatha  --  you have n't lost your situation ! You have n't left the Lewises ? COLE Yes , Horace ; I left at three o'clock . COLE My dear Agatha  --  I 'm extremely sorry  --  but we ca n't put you up here . COLE Had n't you better pay the cab ? Two shillings so soon becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother does n't realize that I have some claim on him . COLE We thought you were so happy with the Lewises . COLE So were the slaves in America when they had kind masters . They did n't want to be free . COLE Horace said you always had late dinner with them when they had no company . Agatha . Oh , I have no complaint against my late employers . In fact , I was sorry to inconvenience them by leaving so suddenly . But I had a higher duty to perform than my duty to them . p. 15 COLE I do n't know what to do . It will worry Horace dreadfully . ( Re-enter Horace . ) COLE The cab was two-and-six , and I had to give a man twopence to help me in with that Noah 's ark . Now , Agatha , what does this mean ? Surely in your position it was very unwise to leave the Lewises . You ca n't stay here . We must make some arrangement . COLE Any arrangement you like , dear , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As my nearest male relative , I think you are obliged to do so . If you refuse , I must go to the workhouse . COLE But why ca n't you support yourself ? You 've done it for years . COLE Yes  --  ever since I was eighteen . Now I am going to give up work , until my work is recognized . Either my proper place is the home  --  the home provided for me by some dear father , brother , husband , cousin or uncle  --  or I am a self-supporting member of the State who ought not to be shut out from the rights of citizenship . COLE All this sounds as if you had become a Suffragette ! Oh , Agatha , I always thought you were a lady . p. 16 COLE Yes , I was a lady  --  such a lady that at eighteen I was thrown upon the world , penniless , with no training whatever which fitted me to earn my own living . When women become citizens I believe that daughters will be given the same chances as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . COLE Women are so illogical . What on earth has all this to do with your planting yourself on me in this inconsiderate way ? You put me in a most unpleasant position . You must see , Agatha , that I have n't the means to support a sister as well as a wife . Could n't you go to some friends until you find another situation ? COLE No , Horace . I 'm going to stay with you . COLE ( changing his tone and turning nasty ) . Oh , indeed ! And for how long  --  if I may ask ? COLE Until the Bill for the removal of the sex disability is passed . COLE ( impotently angry ) . Nonsense . I ca n't keep you , and I wo n't . I have always tried to do my duty by you . I think hardly a week passes that I do n't write to you . But now that you have deliberately thrown up an excellent situation as a governess and come here and threatened me  --  yes , threatened me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister or no sister , I will be master in my own house ! ( Enter Molly , a good-looking young girl of about twenty . She is dressed in well-cut , tailor-made clothes , wears a neat little hat , and carries some golf-clubs and a few books. ) p. 17 MOLLY How are you , Uncle Horace ? Is that Aunt Aggie ? How d'ye do ? I have n't seen you since I was a kid . COLE Well , what have you come for ? MOLLY There 's a charming welcome to give your only niece ! COLE You know perfectly well , Molly , that I disapprove of you in every way . I hear  --  I have never read it , of course  --  but I hear that you have written a most scandalous book . You live in lodgings by yourself , when if you chose you could afford some really nice and refined boarding-house . You have most undesirable acquaintances , and altogether  --  MOLLY Cheer up , Uncle . Now 's your chance of reforming me . I 've come to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time . COLE I never heard such impertinence ! I have always understood from you that you earn more than I do . MOLLY Ah , yes ; but you never liked my writing for money , did you ? You called me " sexless " once because I said that as long as I could support myself I did n't feel an irresistible temptation to marry that awful little bounder Weekes . COLE Reginald Weekes ! How can you call him a bounder ! He was at Oxford . p. 18 MOLLY Hullo , Auntie Ethel ! I did n't notice you . You 'll be glad to hear I have n't brought much luggage  --  only a night-gown and some golf-clubs . COLE I suppose this is a joke ! MOLLY Well , of course that 's one way of looking at it . I 'm not going to support myself any longer . I 'm going to be a perfect lady and depend on my Uncle Horace  --  my nearest male relative  --  for the necessities of life . ( A motor horn is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to write another scandalous book , or live in lodgings by myself ! COLE ( at the window ) . Horace ! Horace ! There 's someone getting out of a motor  --  a grand motor . Who can it be ? And there 's no one to answer the door . MOLLY That does n't matter . I found it open , and left it open to save trouble . COLE She 's got luggage , too ! The chauffeur 's bringing in a dressing-case . COLE I 'll turn her into the street  --  and the dressing-case , too . ( He goes fussily to the door and meets Madame Christine on the threshold . The lady is dressed smartly and tastefully . Age about forty , manners elegant , smile charming , speech resolute . She carries a jewel-case , and consults a legal document during her first remarks. ) p. 19 MADAME CHRISTINE You are Mr. Cole ? COLE No ! Certainly not ! ( wavering ) . At least , I was this morning , but  --  MADAME CHRISTINE Horace Cole , son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on the business of a  --  ( A motor horn sounds outside . ) COLE I beg your pardon , but my late father 's business has really nothing to do with this matter , and to a professional man it 's rather trying to have these things raked up against him . Excuse me , but do you want your motor to go ? MADAME CHRISTINE It 's not my motor any longer ; and  --  yes , I do want it to go , for I may be staying here some time . I think you had one sister Agatha , and one brother Samuel , now dead . Samuel was much older than you  --  COLE Why do n't you answer , Horace ? Yes , that 's perfectly correct . I am Agatha . MADAME CHRISTINE Oh , are you ? How d'ye do ? MOLLY And Samuel Cole was my father . MADAME CHRISTINE I 'm very glad to meet you . I did n't know I had such charming relations . Well , Mr. Cole , my father was John Hay Cole 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second cousin , and my nearest male relative . p. 20 COLE ( distractedly ) . If anyone calls me that again I shall go mad . MADAME CHRISTINE I am afraid you are n't quite pleased with the relationship ! COLE You must excuse me  --  but I do n't consider a second cousin exactly a relation . MADAME CHRISTINE Oh , it answers the purpose . I suddenly find myself destitute , and I want you to support me . I am sure you would not like a Cole to go to the workhouse . COLE I do n't care a damn where any of ' em go . COLE ( shocked ) . Horry ! How can you ! MADAME CHRISTINE That 's frank , at any rate ; but I am sure , Cousin Horace , that in spite of your manners , your heart 's in the right place . You wo n't refuse me board and lodging , until Parliament makes it possible for me to resume my work ? COLE My dear madam , do you realize that my salary is 3 10s. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luggage , much less you ? MADAME CHRISTINE Then you must agitate . Your female relatives have supported themselves up till now , and asked nothing from you . I myself , dear cousin , was , until this morning , running a profitable dressmaking business in Hanover Square . In my public capacity I am Madame Christine . p. 21 MOLLY I know ! I 've never been able to afford you . COLE And do you think , Madame Christine  --  MADAME CHRISTINE Cousin Susan , please . COLE Do you think that you are justified in coming to a poor clerk and asking him to support you  --  you could probably turn over my yearly income in a single week ! Did n't you come here in your own motor ? MADAME CHRISTINE At three o'clock that motor became the property of the Women 's Social and Political Union . All the rest of my property and all available cash have been divided equally between the National Union and the Women 's Freedom League . Money is the sinews of war , you know . COLE Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to the Suffragettes ! It 's a pity you have n't a husband . He 'd very soon stop your doing such foolish things . MADAME CHRISTINE I had a husband once . He liked me to do foolish things  --  for instance , to support him . After that unfortunate experience , Cousin Horace , you may imagine how glad I am to find a man who really is a man , and will support me instead . By the way , I should so much like some tea . Is the kettle boiling ? p. 22 COLE ( feebly ) . There are n't enough cups ! Oh , what shall I do ? COLE Never mind , Ethel ; I sha n't want any . I am going to dine in town and go to the theatre . I shall hope to find you all gone when I come back . If not , I shall send for the police . ( Enter Maudie Spark , a young woman with an aggressively cheerful manner , a voice raucous from much bellowing of music-hall songs , a hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) SPARK ' Ullo ! ' ullo ! who 's talking about the police ? Not my dear cousin Horry ! COLE How dare you come here ? SPARK Necessity , old dear . If I had a livelier male relative , you may bet I 'd have gone to him ! But you , Horace , are the only first cousin of this poor orphan . What are you in such a hurry for ? COLE Let me pass ! I 'm going to the theatre . SPARK Silly jay ! the theatres are all closed  --  and the halls too . The actresses have gone on strike  --  resting indefinitely . I 've done my little bit towards that . They wo n't get any more work out of Maudie Spark , Queen of Comdiennes , until the women have got the vote . Ladies and fellow-relatives , you 'll be pleased to hear the strike 's going fine . The big drapers ca n't open tomorrow . One man ca n't fill the place of fifteen young ladies at once , you see . The duchesses are out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kids . The City men are trying to get taxi-men in to do their typewriting . Every man , like Horry here , has his house full of females .

" A woman 's place is the home  --  I do n't think , I do n't think , I do n't think . " p. 23 COLE Even if this is not a plot against me personally , even if there are other women in London at this minute disgracing their sex  --  SPARK Here stop it  --  come off it ! If it comes to that , what are you doing  --  threatening your womankind with the police and the workhouse . COLE I was not addressing myself to you . COLE Why not , Horace ? She 's your cousin . She needs your protection just as much as we do . COLE I regard that woman as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's neither here nor there . I address myself to the more lady-like portion of this gathering , and I say that whatever is going on , the men will know what to do , and will do it with dignity and firmness . ( The impressiveness of this statement is marred by the fact that Horace 's hand , in emphasizing it , comes down heavily on the loaf of bread on the table . ) A few exhibitions of this kind wo n't frighten them . SPARK Oh , wo n't it ! I like that ! They 're being so firm and so dignified that they 're running down to the House of Commons like lunatics , and blackguarding the Government for not having given us the vote before ! ( Shouts outside of newsboys in the distance. ) p. 24 MOLLY Splendid ! Have they begun already ? MADAME CHRISTINE Get a paper , Cousin Horace . I know some men never believe anything till they see it in the paper . COLE The boys are shouting out something now . Listen . ( Shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women 's strike . Theatres closed . Extry special edition . Star ! News ! 6.30 edition ! " ) MOLLY You see . Since this morning Suffragettes have become women ! COLE ( at window ) . Here , boy , paper ! ( Cries go on . " Extry special Star . Men petition the Government . Votes for Women . Extry special . " ) Oh , heavens , here 's Aunt Lizzie ! ( As Ethel pronounces the name Horace dives under the table . Enter Aunt Lizzie leading a fat spaniel and carrying a birdcage with a parrot in it . Miss Elizabeth Wilkins is a comfortable , middle-aged body of a type well known to those who live in the less fashionable quarter of Bloomsbury . She looks as if she kept lodgers , and her looks do not belie her . She is not very well educated , but has a good deal of native intelligence . Her features are homely and her clothes about thirty years behind the times. ) p. 25 AUNT L Well , dears , all here ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well ; we can talk more freely . I 'm sorry I 'm late , but animals do so hate a move . It took a long time to make them understand the strike . But I think they will be very comfortable here . You love dogs , do n't you , Ethel ? COLE Not Ponto . He always growls at me . AUNT L Clever dog ! he knows you do n't sympathize with the cause . COLE But I do , Aunt ; only I have always said that as I was happily married I thought it had very little to do with me . AUNT L You 've changed your mind about that today , I should think ! What a day it 's been ! We never expected everything would go so smoothly . They say the Bill 's to be rushed through at once . No more broken promises , no more talking out ; deeds , not words , at last ! Seen the papers ? The press are not boycotting us today , my dears .

( Reading ) " Our special representative , on calling upon the Prime Minister with the object of ascertaining his views on the situation , was informed that the Right Honourable gentleman was unable to receive him , as he was actively engaged in making his bed with the assistance of the boot-boy and a Foreign Office messenger . " AUNT L Always unwilling to receive people , you see ! Well , he must be feeling sorry now that he never received us . Everyone 's putting the blame on to him . It 's extraordinary how many men  --  and newspapers , too  --  have suddenly found out that they have always been in favour of woman 's suffrage ! That 's the sensible attitude , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was not until we held a pistol to their heads that they changed their minds . Well , at this minute I would rather be the man who has been our ally all along than the one who has been our enemy . It 's not the popular thing to be an " anti " any more . Any man who tries to oppose us today is likely to be slung up to the nearest lamp-post. p. 27 COLE ( rushing wildly to the table ) . Oh , Horry ! my Horry ! ( Horace comes out from under the table . ) AUNT L Why , bless the boy , what are you doing there ? COLE Oh , nothing . I merely thought I might be less in the way here , that 's all . AUNT L You did n't hide when I came in by any chance ! COLE I hide from you ! Are n't you always welcome in this house ? AUNT L Well , I have n't noticed it particularly ; and I 'm not calling today , you understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beaten , begins to walk up and down the room , and consults Ethel . ) Well , well ! I wo n't deny it was a wrench to leave 118a , Upper Montagu Place , where I 've done my best for boarders , old and young , gents and ladies , for twenty-five years  --  and no complaints ! A home from home , they call it . All my ladies had left before I started out , on the same business as all of us  --  but what those poor boys will do for their dinner tonight I do n't know . They 're a helpless lot ! Well , it 's all over ; I 've given up my boarding-house , and I depend on you , Horace , to keep me until I am admitted to citizenship . It may take a long time . p. 28 COLE It must not take a long time . I sha n't allow it . It shall be done at once . Well , you need n't all look so surprised . I know I 've been against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought only a few howling dervishes wanted the vote ; but when I find that you  --  Aunt  --  Fancy a woman of your firmness of character , one who has always been so careful with her money , being declared incapable of voting ! The thing is absurd . SPARK Bravo ! Our Horry 's waking up . COLE ( looking at her scornfully ) . If there are a few women here and there who are incapable  --  I mention no names , mind  --  it does n't affect the position . What 's going to be done ? Who 's going to do it ? If this rotten Government think we 're going to maintain millions of women in idleness just because they do n't like the idea of my Aunt Lizzie making a scratch on a bit of paper and shoving it into a ballot-box once every five years , this Government have reckoned without the men  --  ( General cheering . ) I 'll show ' em what I 've got a vote for ! What do they expect ? You ca n't all marry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're earning your own living and paying taxes you ought to have a say ; it 's only fair . ( General cheering and a specially emphatic " Hear , hear " from Madame Christine . ) The Government are narrow-minded idiots ! ( Madame C. : Hear ! hear ! ) They talk as if all the women ought to stay at home washing and ironing . Well , before a woman has a wash-tub , she must have a home to put it in , must n't she ? And who 's going to give it her ? I 'd like them to tell me that . Do they expect me to do it ? ( Agatha : Yes , dear . ) I say if she can do it herself and keep herself , so much the better for everyone . Anyhow , who are the Government ? They 're only representing me , and being paid thousands a year by me for carrying out my wishes . ( Molly : Oh , er  --  what ho ! Horace turns on her angrily ) I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I was brought up ; but if she insists on having a vote  --  and apparently she does All : She does ! she does !  --  I do n't see why she should n't have it . Many a woman came in here at the last election and tried to wheedle me into voting for her particular candidate . If she has time to do that  --  and I never heard the member say then that she ought to be at home washing the baby  --  I do n't see why she has n't time to vote . It 's never taken up much of my time , or interfered with my work . I 've only voted once in my life  --  but that 's neither here nor there . I know what the vote does for me . It gives me a status ; that 's what you women want  --  a status . ( All : Yes , yes ; a status . ) I might even call it a locus standi . If I go now and tell these rotten Cabinet Ministers what I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That 's a good word.  --  that will force them to listen to me . Oh , I know . And , by gum ! I 'll give them a bit of my mind . They shall hear a few home truths for once . " Gentlemen , " I shall say  --  well , that wo n't be true of all of them to start with , but one must give ' em the benefit of the doubt  --  " gentlemen , the men of England are sick and tired of your policy . Who 's driven the women of England into this ? You  --  ( he turns round on Ethel , who jumps violently )  --  because you were too stupid to know that they meant business  --  because you could n't read the writing on the wall . ( Hear , hear . ) It may be nothing to you , gentlemen , that every industry in this country is paralyzed and every Englishman 's home turned into a howling wilderness  --  ( Molly : Draw it mild , Uncle . Horace : A howling wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's as plain as the nose on your face ; but I would have you know , gentlemen , that it is something to us . We are n't slaves . We never will be slaves  --  ( Agatha : Never , never ! )  --  and we insist on reform . Gentlemen , conditions have changed , and women have to work . Do n't men encourage them to work , invite them to work ? ( Agatha : Make them work . ) And women are placed in the battle of life on the same terms as we are , short of one thing , the locus standi of a vote . ( Maudie : Good old locus standi ! ) If you are n't going to give it them , gentlemen , and if they wo n't go back to their occupations without it , we ask you , how they 're going to live ? Who 's going to support them ? Perhaps you 're thinking of giving them all old age pensions and asking the country to pay the piper ! The country will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon the expression . It 's dawning upon us all that the women would never have taken such a step as this if they had n't been the victims of gross injustice . ( All : Never . ) Why should n't they have a voice in the laws which regulate the price of food and clothes ? Do n't they pay for their food and clothes ? ( Maudie : Paid for mine all my life . ) Why should n't they have a voice in the rate of wages and the hours of labour in certain industries ? Are n't they working at those industries ? If you had a particle of common sense or decent feeling , gentlemen  --  " ( Enter Gerald Williams like a souvenir of Mafeking night . He shouts incoherently and in a hoarse voice . He is utterly transformed from the meek , smug being of an hour before . He is wearing several ribbons and badges and carrying a banner bearing this inscription : " The men of Brixton demand votes for women this evening . " ) p. 29 WILLIAMS Cole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be late . The procession 's forming up at the town hall . There 's no time to lose . What are you slacking here for ? Perhaps this is n't good enough for you . I 've got twelve of them in my drawing-room . We shall be late for the procession if we do n't start at once . Hurry up ! Come on ! Votes for Women ! Where 's your banner ? Where 's your badge ? Down with the Government ! Rule Britannia ! Votes for Women ! D' you want to support a dozen women for the rest of your life , or do n't you ? . . . Every man in Brixton is going to Westminster . Borrow a ribbon and come along . Hurry up , now ! Hooray ! ( Rushes madly out crying " Votes for Women ! Rule Britannia ; Women , never , never shall be slaves ! Votes for Women ! " ) ( All the women who are wearing ribbons decorate Horace . ) COLE My hero ! ( She throws her arms round him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you  --  to see justice done . When you want a thing done , get a man to do it ! Votes for Women !
