Mr Taft 's speech at the dinner of the Commercial Club in Cincinnati last Thursday night was excellent The mixture of good humor , modesty , and serious purpose was admirably fitted to produce the right effect Mr. Taft said nothing new , nothing which he himself had not said many times during the campaign , but the reiteration , not by a candidate but by a President-elect , has great weight and hits the temper of the country perfectly People will be confident , after the election , that what they hoped before is true  --  namely , that the new President is a calm and sagacious man , who will preside with firmness , yet with intelligence and caution , over a nation facing a struggle back to normal conditions in industry and finance We believe that recovery was on the way , in any event Bryan 's election would probably have checked it for a time , how long it is impossible to say Yet there can be no doubt that Mr Taft 's success at the polls , with his reaffirmation of his determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honest enterprise , will help the natural process of restoration . Sentiment has so large a place even in business affairs ! If men fear that they are going to be ruined , often they are ruined On the other hand , if there is a general expectation of better times , the higher courage and the brighter hope will do much to make the times better It is in the light of these elementary truths that Mr Taft 's speech appears so reassuring Not the least gratifying feature of the election was the complete frustration of the hopes which Bryan pinned to the labor vote People express surprise that organized labor could not be " delivered " by Gompers et al , but when was it ever delivered " - The uniform history of attempts to make or break candidates at the word of command by labor leaders , shows that , in this country at least , the thing can not be done Rival leaders always jealously spring up to contest the right to speak for the organization , the members suspect personal motives or pecuniary corruption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Gompers ought to know , for he has tried the same plan before , against Mr Littlefield and other Congressmen , and abjectly tailed His pitch of arrogance this year was only preliminary to the deepest humiliation he has yet experienced He led Mr Bryan to think that 80 per cent of the labor vote would go to the Democratic candidate No precise figures can be had , but judging by this city , nothing like that proportion went to Bryan All of his grovelling before organized labor profited him nothing Judge Taft 's manly stand was both better morals and better politics Mr Hearst can not even claim to have defeated Bryan and Chanler , for the little fringe of votes which his personally conducted Independence League cast was negligible in the large result This is a severe blow to an impudent charlatan , who has been boasting about the irresistible political power of his newspapers He and his hirelings have talked as if , when his various newspapers spoke , 5,000,000 readers said amen , and 1,000,000 voters rushed to record their approval at the polls That humbug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the election any public utterance on the attempt to appeal to religious prejudice against Mr Taft in the campaign . This was a force subtly at work in many parts of the country , particularly in the Middle West , and if the result had been close , might easily have turned the balance against Mr Taft in critical States The fact was well known to newspaper correspondents and other sounders of public sentiment They found many acknowledged instances of pious Republicans who would not vote for Mr Taft because he was a Unitarian , and they suspected the existence of many more . Yet this was an issue which could hardly be much talked about while the campaign was in progress Openly to attack or rebuke the ignorance and intolerance which would transform a Presidential election into a test of orthodoxy , might only have made matters worse . Mr Taft 's complete silence on the subject was both dignified and well-advised It all along remained true , nevertheless , that one of the strongest grounds for the hopes of Mr Bryan 's friends lay in the appeal which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a devout Trinitarian There never was a more plausible or fetching campaign document than one which was circulated by the million in the West , and which dealt with Mr Bryan as " the squarest Christian I ever knew " One page had a picture of " the little church by the cornfield , " where gospel hymns were often sung to the leading of " Mr. Bryan 's clear baritone voice . " There was no mention of Mr Taft or of Unitarianism , but the appeal was all the more taking for merely showing how good a Presbyterian Mr Bryan was , and how good a Methodist his wife This document fell in admirably with the class feeling which it was sought to arouse in Mr Bryan 's interest , for in many Western towns and villages , a Unitarian is looked upon not only as an infidel , but an aristocrat This whole play upon religious prejudice was most artful ; and it is one cause more for rejoicing that Mr Bryan 's defeat was so overwhelming that no one can say a single State was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made In dismissing the matter as " an outrage , " the President seems certain that it is a " foul slander " to affirm that a Roman Catholic , otherwise well fitted for the Presidency , could not be elected We wish that the facts were so , but fear that they are not , as yet . Archbishop Ireland ought to be a good witness regarding anti-Catholic prejudice in politics , and he has recently testified on the other side It is an ideal state of things which President Roosevelt assumes , not the actual world of inherited and inveterate theological animosities They die hard We have lately seen their ugly survival in England And we strongly suspect that , if occasion arose in this country , we should see the unhappy spectacle repeated which Sydney Smith described , of politicians bawling that Protestantism was in danger , in order to get for themselves places and pensions Yet the  |p0-  salons which the President lays down are impregnable With no established church or religious tests in our government , a candidate 's or a President 's private belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged against him as a political argument . To prove this , Mr Roosevelt did not need to cite the miscellaneous religions represented in his Cabinet . It is clear that the President has the broadest and most comprehensive spirit , theologically We might well sigh , " Oh , Si sic omnes , " but the late campaign shows that all are not so , and that we have yet much to do in this country before religious suspicions and jealousies and intolerance are banished from our politics . By their votes on the divorce law referendum the citizens of South Dakota have materially helped to clear the American name of the disrepute into which " divorce mills " have brought it The scandalously lax statutes do not represent public opinion any more truly than the " jokers " in corporation laws do Like the latter , they have been foisted upon the public by interested parties . Once on the statute-books , only organized effort could expunge them . The evil had to cry out on the street in order to provoke its cure It has cried out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year in the State and present their cases only at regular terms of the court Although the new law seems to vary in some important details from the uniform statute drafted by the national divorce congress , it approaches the latter in spirit and effect . The first conspicuous result of the campaign against easygoing morality is surely not the last . We fear that Representative Fowler of New Jersey is not the Jack to kill the Giant Cannon A man of indisputable ability and of value in the House in matters financial , he can not be compared in personal popularity to the " Old Man , " as the Speaker is affectionately called Indeed , as matters stand now , it will take hard work to defeat Mr. Cannon His personal friends return to the House in troops , with the appeal , " Do not break the old man 's heart by turning him dowp . " It will be pointed out that his constituents rallied to him in extraordinary numbers , and 1-11 , , t tl-k a lc nrnh , , hly 1- , c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of the existing Congress in which to strengthen his fences Even Senator La Follette , who has campaigned openly against Cannon , and is pushing Congressman Cooper of Wisconsin for the Speakership , only ventures to prophesy that Mr Cooper will " eventually succeed Cannon . " Yet one part of Congressman Fowler 's letter asking for votes against Mr Cannon , has much force Another term of so narrow and reactionary a Speaker would surely endanger the next House In spite of the great sweep for Taft , the Republicans lost eight or ten Representatives ; and in the elections of 1910 , might easily lose control of the House entirely This would prevent Mr. Taft as President trom having a Congress in sympathy with him politically New York 's United States Senators have been such a public disgrace that no change can fail to be for the better Compared with Platt and Depew , Woodruff thinks that even he would appear a statesman This has been the danger , regarding the election of Platt 's successor As in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed is king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State in the Senate at Washington , there was a chance that some brainless product of machine politics might set himself up as a fit candidate , only because he was not so unspeakable as Platt . But the confident mention of Secretary Root 's name has already been taken , not only in the State , but throughout the country , as promising to end the intellectual and moral barrenness of New York 's representation in the Senate For sheer ability , no man stands higher in ' Washington The keenest foreign ministers are more impressed by his mental power than by that of any other member of the government . In two high offices  --  the War Department and the Department of State  --  he has displayed his qualities of broad comprehension and penetrating analysis , combined with an extraordinary business faculty In point of equipment for duties in the upper house  --  provided his health be firm ? Mr Root would overtop any Senator New York has had since Evarts The only questions to be raised are those respecting his political eligibility and his activities and affilia whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senatorial succession has done good . It has brought out the fact that the people are in no mind to see the Taft and Hughes victory in this State " tapered down to Tim , " or any other nonentity . The signs are bright now that New York will insist upon having a Senator who can hold his head up among his fellows , and enable her to hold her head up among her sister States The murder of ex-Senator Carmack because of editorial utterances displeasing to the murderer and his father , is but another illustration of that intolerance of criticism , free thought , and free speech which remains in the South as a heritage of slavery It is five years since Mr Gonzalez , editor of the Columbia , S C , State , was similarly butchered by Lieut - Gov . Tillman ; and since then there have been other cases , in which the principals were of lesser political or social importance . Sooner or later , the whole South must come to a realization of the injury such crimes do , for the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest murder shows , the road to enlightenment and tolerance is yet long and arduous . The newspapers of last Tuesday reported that twelve men had " met death in Birmingham , Alabama , by pistols within the last eight days " The county in which this city is situated is known to fame as having annually more murders than occur in a year in the entire British Isles . Of what use are courts and law officers if private vengeance is to be supreme ? The conviction of Charles W Morse and Alfred H. Curtis , on the charges of misappropriating funds and falsifying accounts in the National Bank of North America in this city , is a fit sequel to the panic of 1907 ; and the exemplary sentence of fifteen years ' imprisonment , for Morse , the chief offender , is severe but , we believe , salutary . The penalty has not been hastily imposed in the heat of excitement and anger aroused by the panic itself . A year has elapsed ; and the fury which is determined to find some scapegoat , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause the panic , in the sense that no such disaster would have occurred those exploits immediately precipitated the catastrophe there can be no dispute . His punishment should be a sharp warning , not only to speculating bank owners and officers , but to financial adventurers like those who on the witness stand last month confessed with cynical effrontery their participation in Morse 's speculations , at a time when every well-informed man knew how Morse had obtained the money for these ventures . We believe also that the conviction and sentence carry their warning to others than the group of stockjobbers who victimized this particular chain of banks , and shared in this particular gamble on the Stock Exchange Dur.ng seven years past , the public has had repeated evidence of use of fiduciary funds , directly or indirectly , to pi emote the reckless speculations of millionaire operators who control great institutions The diversion of life insurance surpluses to such base uses is an old story ; but it is not the only one We do not suppose that the officers of powerful banking institutions which equipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1906 resorted to the clumsy pi actices of Morse and Curtis , but the moral responsibility of these bankei s is much the same as that of the unlucky culprits in the Bank of North America , who transgressed the law and were caught . The death of ex-President Palma will not ripple the political waters in Cuba A man of mediocre ability , he was chosen President because he appeared to be safe and sane , and , owing to his long residence in the United States , free from party entanglements The collapse of his government in the autumn of 1906 was really pitiful It is only fair to say , however , that his life had been threatened by men now living in Havana , and that his Cabinet had proved treacheious to him Perfectly honest himself , he could not detect the dishonest even in his immediate neighborhood But as the work of reconstructing Cuba has gone on , the Americans who are in charge of it have been compelled to ask themselves whether the impossible was not demanded of Palma Certain it is that the reorganization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed most of all was modern laws under which the people might become accustomed to free institutions Now under Gov . Magoon the right laws have been drawn , but our troops are to leave in February before the American officials themselves have had a chance to see how the laws work in practice It will take a President of great force and ability to run the new machinery and keep the repaired ship of state afloat Whenever Europe is passing through a critical time , the Guildhall speech of the English Prime Minister is waited for with peculiar interest Mr Asquith 's remarks Monday night , at the inaugura ? tion of the new Lord Mayor of London , were distinctly reassuring He forecast the speedy rolling away of the war clouds in the Balkans With friendly words for Turkey and Austria , Russ , a and France , he did not fail to assume a conciliatory attitude towards Germany The Prime Minister bore testimony to the spirit of friendship which the Kaiser had shown on his visit to England a year ago , and also in all the diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was any movement in Europe to " solate " Germany This , however , will not prevent Germans from believing that they are isolated , diplomatically , and they will see fresh proof in th e significant sentence appended to the French note on the Casablanca affair , that Great Britain and Russia were aware of the contention of France , and cordially supported it All the sharper , therefore , have been the questions put to Prince Bulow in the Reichstag To the proceedings and speeches in that body , the attention of Europe is now transferred " I represent the better minority , the Germans who love peace , " declared the Kaiser in his famous interview in the London Telegraph . But his most devoted followers , the Conservative party , emphatically deny that he represents them at least He can not dismiss Baron Non Marteuffel 's stinging reproof as the malevolence of an enemy The men who have stood by the Kaiser through thick and thin " express the reverential wish that greater reserve be displayed in the future " in the Imperial utterances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult situation " And when in the Reichstag on Tuesday he was the general target for a fierce assault , the Chancellor was forced to reply that the Emperor would in future " exercise the reserve which , in the interest of a uniform policy and the authority of the crown , is indispensable . If this proves not to be so , neither I nor any one of my successors could take the responsibility . " The Kaiser seems temperamentally incapable of heeding this warning , but he can scarcely fail to perceive in it the drift of his people toward responsible parliamentarism If his meddling with foreign affairs is at last frightening even those who worship him as the appointed of God , the chances for a ministry responsible to the Reichstag have suddenly improved If that comes , the Kaiser may flatter himself that he did moi e than anybody else to accomplish such a result In dealing with the difficult question of the unemployed , careful investigation and thorough sifting of vague assertions are the beginning of wisdom This was well shown in the debate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unemployed Keir Hardie produced some astounding figures of the number of men out of work . By a system of deduction from reports of trades unions , he concluded that 750 , - 000 skilled men were out of employment But it could " safely be set down , " he said , that the number of unskilled workmen was twice as great , namely , 1,500.000 This calculation gave 2,250,000 men out of a job , and by a " very moderate estimate " of those dependent upon them , the appalling total of 6,750,000 as the real number of people involved But these figures were riddled in the reply by John Burns He showed that every test of statistics discredited Mr Hardie 's swollen statement , and contended that , to accede to the demands made in the name of humanity and the duty of the state , would " make for universal bankruptcy in the interest of universal loafers " Mr Balfour in-tervened in the debate to charge that the high percentage of the unemployed was " largely due to the want of confidence inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the figures were " much higher " in 1879 , under the Tory government of Lord Beaconsfield , and also in 1887 when Salisbury was Prime Minister .
