SCENE . The scene is that of the summer country ranch house of MRS . WILLIAMS , a friend of LAURA MURDOCK 'S , and a prominent society woman of Denver , perched on the side of Ute Pass , near Colorado Springs . The house is one of unusual pretentiousness , and , to a person not conversant with conditions as they exist in this part of Colorado , the idea might be that such magnificence could not obtain in such a locality . At the left of stage the house rises in the form of a turret , built of rough stone of a brown hue , two stories high , and projecting a quarter of the way out on the stage . The door leads to a small elliptical terrace built of stone , with heavy benches of Greek design , strewn cushions , while over the top of one part of this terrace is suspended a canopy made from a Navajo blanket . The terrace is supposed to extend almost to the right of stage , and here it stops . The stage must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the illusion that he is coming up a steep declivity or a long flight of stairs . There are chairs at right and left , and a small table at left . There are trailing vines around the balustrade of the terrace , and the whole setting must convey the idea of quiet wealth . Up stage is supposed to be the part of the terrace overlooking the caon , a sheer drop of two thousand feet , while over in the distance , as if across the caon , one can see the rolling foot-hills and lofty peaks of the Rockies , with Pike 's Peak in the distance , snow-capped and colossal . It is late in the afternoon , and , as the scene progresses , the quick twilight of a caon , beautiful in its tints of purple and amber , becomes later pitch black , and the curtain goes down on an absolutely black stage . The cyclorama , or semi-cyclorama , must give the perspective of greater distances , and be so painted that the various tints of twilight may be shown . AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balustrade of the porch and shielding her eyes with her hand from the late afternoon sun , as she seemingly looks up the Pass to the left , as if expecting the approach of someone . Her gown is simple , girlish and attractive , and made of summery , filmy stuff . Her hair is done up in the simplest fashion , with a part in the centre , and there is about her every indication of an effort to assume that girlishness of demeanour which has been her greatest asset through life . WILLARD BROCKTON enters ; he is a man six feet or more in height , stocky in build , clean-shaven and immaculately dressed . He is smoking a cigar , and upon entering takes one step forward and looks over toward LAURA in a semi-meditative manner . BROCKTON Blue ? p. 3 MURDOCK No . BROCKTON What 's up ? MURDOCK Nothing . BROCKTON A little preoccupied . MURDOCK Perhaps . BROCKTON What 's up that way ? MURDOCK Which way ? BROCKTON The way you are looking . MURDOCK The road from Manitou Springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that . You know I 've done a lot of business west of the Missouri . MURDOCK With a half-sigh . No , I did n't know it . BROCKTON Oh , yes ; south of here in the San Juan country . Spent a couple of years there once . MURDOCK Still without turning . That 's interesting . BROCKTON It was then . I made some money there . It 's always interesting when you make money . Still  --  MURDOCK Still leaning in an absent-minded attitude . Still what ? BROCKTON Ca n't make out why you have your eyes glued on that road . Someone coming ? p. 4 MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON One of Mrs. Williams ' friends , eh ? WILL crosses , and sits on seat . MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON Yours too ? MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON Man ? MURDOCK Yes , a real man . BROCKTON Catches the significance of this speech . He carelessly throws the cigar over the balustrade . He comes down and leans on chair with his back to LAURA . She has not moved more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean her head rather wearily against it , looking steadfastly up the Pass . A real man . By that you mean  --  MURDOCK Just that  --  a real man . BROCKTON Any difference from the many you have known ? MURDOCK Yes , from all I have known . BROCKTON So that is why you did n't come into Denver to meet me to-day , but left word for me to come out here ? MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON I thought that I was pretty decent to take a dusty ride half-way across the continent in order to keep you company on your way back to New York , and welcome you to our home ; but maybe I had the wrong idea . p. 5 MURDOCK Yes , I think you had the wrong idea . BROCKTON In love , eh ? MURDOCK Yes , just that ,  --  in love . BROCKTON A new sensation . MURDOCK No ; the first conviction . BROCKTON You have had that idea before . Every woman 's love is the real one when it comes . Crosses up to LAURA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady ? MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON For instance , what ? MURDOCK This man is poor  --  absolutely broke . He has n't even got a Crosses to armchair , leans over and draws with parasol on ground. good job . You know , Will , all the rest , including yourself , generally had some material inducement . BROCKTON What 's his business ? Crosses to table and sits looking at magazine . MURDOCK He 's a newspaper man . BROCKTON H'm-m . Romance ? MURDOCK Yes , if you want to call it that ,  --  romance . BROCKTON Do I know him ? p. 6 MURDOCK How could you ? You only came from New York to-day , and he has never been there . He regards her with a rather amused , indulgent , almost paternal expression , in contrast to his big , bluff , physical personality , with his iron-gray hair and his bulldog expression . LAURA looks more girlish than ever . This is imperative in order to thoroughly understand the character . BROCKTON How old is he ? MURDOCK Twenty-seven . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you about him ? Huh ? Crosses to WILL , placing parasol on seat . BROCKTON That depends . MURDOCK On what ? BROCKTON Yourself . MURDOCK In what way ? BROCKTON If it will interfere in the least with the plans I have made for you and for me . MURDOCK And have you made any particular plans for me that have anything particularly to do with you ? BROCKTON Yes , I have give up the lease of our apartment on West End Avenue , and I 've got a house on Riverside Drive . Everything will be quiet and decent , and it 'll be more comfortable for you . There 's a stable near by , and your horses and car can be kept over there . You 'll be your own mistress , and besides I 've fixed you up for a new part . p. 7 MURDOCK A new part ! What kind of a part ? BROCKTON One of Charlie Burgess 's shows , translated from some French fellow . It 's been running over in Paris , Berlin , and Vienna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and appears to be an awful hit . It 's going to cost a lot of money . I told Charlie he could put me down for a half interest , and I 'd give all the money providing you got an important rle . Great part , I 'm told . Kind of a cross between a musical comedy and an opera . Looks as if it might stay in New York all season . So that 's the change of plan . How does it strike you ? LAURA crosses to door , meditating ; pauses in thought . MURDOCK I do n't know . BROCKTON Feel like quitting ? Turns to her . MURDOCK I ca n't tell . BROCKTON It 's the newspaper man , eh ? MURDOCK That would be the only reason . BROCKTON You 've been on the square with me this summer , have n't you ? Crosses to table . MURDOCK Turns , looks at WILL . What do you mean by " on the square ? " BROCKTON Do n't evade . There 's only one meaning when I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal . But you understand where I draw the line . You 've not jumped that , have you , Laura ? p. 8 MURDOCK No , this has been such a wonderful summer , such a wonderfully different summer . Can you understand what I mean by that when I say " wonderfully different summer ? " Crossing to WILL . BROCKTON Well , he 's twenty-seven and broke , and you 're twentyfive and pretty ; and he evidently , being a newspaper man , has that peculiar gift of gab that we call romantic expression . So I guess I 'm not blind , and you both think you 've fallen in love . That it ? MURDOCK Yes , I think that 's about it ; only I do n't agree to the " gift of gab " and the " romantic " end of it . Crosses to table . He 's a man and I 'm a woman , and we both have had our experiences . I do n't think , Will , that there can be much of that element of what some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on lap ; selects candy . BROCKTON Then the Riverside Drive proposition and Burgess 's show is off , eh ? MURDOCK I did n't say that . BROCKTON And if you go back on the Overland Limited day after to-morrow , you 'd just as soon I 'd go to-morrow or wait until the day after you leave ? LAURA places candy-box back on table . MURDOCK I did n't say that , either . p. 9 BROCKTON What 's the game ? MURDOCK I ca n't tell you now . BROCKTON Waiting for him to come ? Crosses , sits on seat . MURDOCK Exactly . BROCKTON Think he is going to make a proposition , eh ? MURDOCK I know he is . BROCKTON Marriage ? MURDOCK Possibly . BROCKTON You 've tried that once , and taken the wrong end . Are you going to play the same game again ? MURDOCK Yes , but with a different card . Picks up magazine off table . BROCKTON What 's his name ? MURDOCK Madison  --  John Madison . Slowly turning pages of magazine . BROCKTON And his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live on ,  --  the extra editions ? MURDOCK No , we 're young , there 's plenty of time . I can work in the meantime , and so can he ; and then with his ability and my ability it will only be a matter of a year or two when things will shape themselves to make it possible . p. 10 BROCKTON Sounds well  --  a year off . MURDOCK If I thought you were going to make fun of me , Will , I should n't have talked to you . Throws down magazine , crosses to door of house . BROCKTON Crossing down in front of table . I do n't want to make fun of you , but you must realize that after two years it is n't an easy thing to be dumped with so little ceremony . Maybe you have never given me any credit for possessing the slightest feeling , but even I can receive shocks from other sources than a break in the market . MURDOCK Crosses to WILL . It is n't easy for me to do this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I went to you it was just with the understanding that we were to be pals . You reserved the right then to quit me whenever you felt like it , and you gave me the same privilege . Now , if some girl came along who really captivated you in the right way , and you wanted to marry , it would hurt me a little ,  --  maybe a lot ,  --  but I should never forget that agreement we made , a sort of two weeks ' notice clause , like people have in contracts . BROCKTON Is evidently very much moved . Walks up stage to right end of seat , looks over the caon . LAURA looks after him . WILL has his back to the audience . Long pause . I 'm not hedging , Laura . If that 's the way you want it to be , I 'll stand by just exactly what I said Turns to LAURA. , but I 'm fond of you , a damn sight fonder than I thought I was , now that I find you slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square LAURA crosses to WILL , taking his right hand. and he has youth and ability , and you 've been on the square with him , why , all right . Your life has n't had much in it to help you get a diploma from any celestial college , and if you can start out now and be a good girl , have a good husband , and maybe some day good children LAURA sighs. , why , I 'm not going to stand in the way . Only I do n't want you to make any of those mistakes that you made before . p. 11 MURDOCK I know , but somehow I feel that this time the real thing has come , and with it the real man . I ca n't tell you , Will , how much different it is , but everything I felt before seems so sort of earthly  --  and somehow this love that I have for this man is so different . It 's made me want to be truthful and sincere and humble for the first time in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared the least bit about , now that I look back , was your friendship . We have been good pals , have n't we ? Puts arms about WILL . BROCKTON Yes , it 's been a mighty good two years for me . I was always proud to take you around , because I think you one of the prettiest things in New York LAURA crosses and girlishly jumps into armchair. , and that helps some , and you 're always jolly , and you never complained . You always spent a lot of money , but it was a pleasure to see you spend it ; and then you never offended me . Most women offend men by coming around looking untidy and sort of unkempt , but somehow you always knew the value of your beauty , and you always dressed up . I always thought that maybe some day the fellow would come along , grab you , and make you happy in a nice way , but I thought that he 'd have to have a lot of money . You know you 've lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It wo n't be an easy job to come down to cases and suffer for the little dainty necessities you 've been used to . p. 12 MURDOCK I 've thought all about that , and I think I understand . Facing audience ; leaning elbows on lap . BROCKTON You know if you were working without anybody 's help , Laura , you might have a hard time getting a position . As an actress you 're only fair . MURDOCK You need n't remind me of that . That part of my life is my own . Crosses up to seat . I do n't want you to start now and make it harder for me to do the right thing . It is n't fair ; it is n't square ; and it is n't right . You 've got to let me go my own way . Crosses to WILL ; puts right hand on his shoulder . I 'm sorry to leave you , in a way , but I want you to know that if I go with John it changes the spelling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now please do n't talk any more . Crosses to post ; takes scarf off chair . BROCKTON Just a word . Is it settled ? MURDOCK Impatiently . I said I did n't know . I would know to-day  --  that 's what I 'm waiting for . Oh , I do n't see why he does n't come . WILL turns up to seat looking over Pass . BROCKTON Pointing up the Pass . Is that the fellow coming up here ? p. 13 MURDOCK Quickly running toward the balustrade of seat , saying as she goes : Where ? Kneels on seat . BROCKTON Pointing . Up the road there . On that yellow horse . MURDOCK Looking . Yes , that 's John . She waves her handkerchief , and putting one hand to her mouth cries : Hello ! MADISON Off stage with the effect as if he was on the road winding up toward the house . Hello yourself ! MURDOCK Same effect . Hurry up , you 're late . MADISON Same effect , a little louder . Better late than never . MURDOCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not with this horse . MURDOCK To WILL , with enthusiastic expression . Now , Will , does he look like a yellow reporter ? BROCKTON With a sort of sad smile . He is a good-looking chap . p. 14 MURDOCK Looking down again at JOHN . Oh , he 's just simply more than that . Turns quickly to WILL . Where 's Mrs. Williams ? BROCKTON Motioning with thumb toward left side of ranch house . Inside , I guess , up to her neck in bridge . MURDOCK Goes hurriedly over to door . Mrs. Williams ! Oh , Mrs. Williams ! MRS . WILLIAMS Heard off stage . What is it , my dear ? MURDOCK Mr. Madison is coming up the path . MRS . WILLIAMS Off stage . That 's good . MURDOCK Sha' n't you come and see him ? MRS . WILLIAMS Same . Lord , no ! I 'm six dollars and twenty cents out now , and up against an awful streak of luck . MURDOCK Shall I give him some tea ? MRS . WILLIAMS Same . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers when he thinks of me . In the meantime WILL has leaned over the balustrade , evidently surveying the young man , who is supposed to be coming up the path , with a great deal of interest . Underneath his stolid , businesslike demeanour of squareness , there is undoubtedly within his heart a very great affection for LAURA . He realizes that during her whole career he has been the only one who has influenced her absolutely . Since the time they lived together , he has always dominated , and he has always endeavoured to lead her along a path that meant the better things of a Bohemian existence . His coming all the way from New York to Denver to accompany LAURA home was simply another example of his keen interest in the woman , and he suddenly finds that she has drifted away from him in a manner to which he could not in the least object , and that she had been absolutely fair and square in her agreement with him . WILL is a man who , while rough and rugged in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , latent though they may be , and his meeting with JOHN ought , therefore , to show much significance , because on his impressions of the young man depend the entire justification of his attitude in the play . p. 15 MURDOCK Turning toward WILL and going to him , slipping her hand involuntarily through his arm , and looking eagerly with him over the balustrade in almost girlish enthusiasm . Do you like him ? BROCKTON Smiling . I do n't know him . MURDOCK Well , do you think you 'll like him ? BROCKTON Well , I hope I 'll like him . MURDOCK Well , if you hope you 'll like him you ought to think you like him . He 'll turn the corner of that rock in just a minute and then you can see him . Do you want to see him ? BROCKTON Almost amused at her girlish manner . Why , yes  --  do you ? MURDOCK Do I ? Why , I have n't seen him since last night ! There he is . Waves her hand . Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN . MADISON His voice very close now . Hello , girlie ! How 's everything ? MURDOCK Fine ! Do hurry . MADISON Just make this horse for a minute . Hurry is not in his dictionary . p. 16 MURDOCK I 'm coming down to meet you . MADISON All  --  right . MURDOCK Turns quickly to WILL . You do n't care . You 'll wait , wo n't you ? BROCKTON Surely . LAURA hurriedly exits . WILL goes down centre of the stage . After a short interval LAURA comes in , more like a sixteen-year-old girl than anything else , pulling JOHN after her . He is a tall , finely built type of Western manhood , a frank face , a quick , nervous energy , a mind that works like lightning , a prepossessing smile , and a personality that is wholly captivating . His clothes are a bit dusty from the ride , but are not in the least pretentious , and his leggins are of canvas and spurs of brass , such as are used in the Army . His hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , more like a great big boy than a man . His hair is a bit tumbled , and he shows every indication of having had a rather long and hard ride . MURDOCK Hello , John ! MADISON Hello , girlie ! Then she suddenly recovers herself and realizes the position she is in . Both men measure each other for a moment in silence , neither flinching the least bit . The smile has faded from JOHN 'S face , and the mouth droops into an expression of firm determination . LAURA for a moment loses her ingenuousness . She is the least bit frightened at finally placing the two men face to face , and in a voice that trembles slightly from apprehension : p. 17 MURDOCK Oh , I beg your pardon ! Mr. Madison , this is Mr. Brockton , a friend of mine from New York . You 've often heard me speak of him ; he came out here to keep me company when I go home . MADISON Comes forward , extends a hand , looking WILL right in the eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BROCKTON Thank you . MADISON I 've heard a great deal about you and your kindness to Miss Murdock . Anything that you have done for her in a spirit of friendliness I am sure all her friends must deeply appreciate , and I count myself in as one . BROCKTON In an easy manner that rather disarms the antagonistic attitude of JOHN . Then we have a good deal in common , Mr. Madison , for I also count Miss Murdock a friend , and when two friends of a friend have the pleasure of meeting , I dare say that 's a pretty good foundation for them to become friends too . MADISON Possibly . Whatever my opinion may have been of you , Mr. Brockton , before you arrived , now I have seen you  --  and I 'm a man who forms his conclusions right off the bat  --  I do n't mind telling you that you 've agreeably surprised me . That 's just a first impression , but they run kind o ' strong with me. p. 18 BROCKTON Well , young man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all things being equal , I think you 'll do . MURDOCK Radiantly . Shall I get the tea ? MADISON Tea ! MURDOCK Yes , tea . You know it must be tea  --  nothing stronger . Crosses to door . MADISON Looking at WILL rather comically . How strong are you for that tea , Mr. Brockton ? BROCKTON I 'll pass ; it 's your deal , Mr. Madison . MADISON Mine ! No , deal me out this hand . MURDOCK I do n't think you 're at all pleasant , but I 'll tell you one thing  --  it 's tea this deal or no game . Crosses up stage to seat , picks up magazine , turns pages . BROCKTON No game then Crosses to door. , and I 'm going to help Mrs. Williams ; maybe she 's lost nearly seven dollars by this time , and I 'm an awful dub when it comes to bridge . Exit . MURDOCK Tossing magazine on to seat , crosses quickly to JOHN , throws her arms around his neck in the most loving manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pass , and golden light streams across the lower hills and tops the snow-clad peaks . It becomes darker and darker , the lights fade to beautiful opalescent hues , until , when the curtain falls on the act , with JOHN and WILL on the scene , it is pitch dark , a faint glow coming out of the door . Nothing else can be seen but the glow of the ash on the end of each man 's cigar as he puffs it in silent meditation on their conversation . p. 19 MADISON Well , dear ? MURDOCK Are you going to be cross with me ? MADISON Why ? MURDOCK Because he came ? MADISON Brockton ? MURDOCK Yes . MADISON You did n't know , did you ? MURDOCK Yes , I did . MADISON That he was coming ? MURDOCK He wired me when he reached Kansas City . MADISON Does he know ? MURDOCK About us ? MADISON Yes . MURDOCK I 've told him . MADISON When ? MURDOCK To-day . MADISON Here ? MURDOCK Yes . MADISON With what result ? MURDOCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than I had any idea it would . MADISON I 'm sorry . Sits in armchair . p. 20 MURDOCK He cautioned me to be very careful and to be sure I knew my way . MADISON That was right . LAURA gets a cushion in each hand off seat ; crosses down to left of armchair , throws one cushion on ground , then the other on top of it , and kneels beside his chair . Piano in house playing a Chopin Nocturne . MURDOCK John . MADISON Yes . MURDOCK We 've been very happy all summer . MADISON Very . MURDOCK Rises , sits on left arm of chair , her arm over back . And this thing has gradually been growing on us ? MADISON That 's true . MURDOCK I did n't think that , when I came out here to Denver to play in a little stock company , it was going to bring me all this happiness , but it has , has n't it ? MADISON Yes . MURDOCK Changing her position , sits on his lap , arms around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing to keep me in Colorado , and I 've got to go back to New York to work . MADISON I know ; I 've been awake all night thinking about it . p. 21 MURDOCK Well ? MADISON Well ? MURDOCK What are we going to do ? MADISON Why , you 've got to go , I suppose . MURDOCK Is it good-bye ? MADISON For a while , I suppose  --  it 's good-bye . MURDOCK What do you mean by a while ? LAURA turns JOHN 'S face to her , looks at him searchingly . MADISON Until Piano plays crescendo , then softens down . I get money enough together , and am making enough to support you , then come and take you out of the show business and make you Mrs. Madison . LAURA tightens her arm around his neck , her cheek goes close to his own , and all the wealth of affection the woman is capable of at times is shown . She seems more like a dainty little kitten purring close to its master . Her whole thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she professes to love . MURDOCK John , that is what I want above everything else . MADISON But , Laura , we must come to some distinct understanding before we start to make our plans . We 're not children . p. 22 MURDOCK No , we 're not . MADISON Now in the first place LAURA rises , crosses to centre. we 'll discuss you , and in the second place we 'll discuss me . We 'll keep nothing from each other LAURA picks up cushions , places them on seat. , and we 'll start out on this campaign LAURA turns back to centre , facing audience. of decency and honour , fully understanding its responsibilities , without a chance of a come-back on either side . MURDOCK Becoming very serious . You mean that we should tell each other all about each other , so , no matter what 's ever said about us by other people , we 'll know it first ? MADISON Rising . That 's precisely what I 'm trying to get at . MURDOCK Well , John , there are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . It is n't easy for a woman to go back and dig up a lot of ugly memories and try to excuse them . Crosses to front of table , picks up magazine , places it on table . MADISON I 've known everything from the first ; how you came to San Francisco as a kid and got into the show business , and how you went wrong , and then how you married , still a kid , and how your husband did n't treat you exactly right , and then how , in a fit of drunkenness , he came home and shot himself . LAURA buries her head in her hands , making exclamations of horror . JOHN crosses to her as if sorry for hurting her ; touches her on shoulder . But that 's all past now , and we can forget that . And I know how you were up against it after that , how tough it was for you to get along . Then finally how you 've lived , and  --  and that you and this man Brockton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it all for months , and I 've watched you . Now , Laura , the habit of life is a hard thing to get away from . You 've lived in this way for a long time . If I ask you to be my wife you 'll have to give it up ; you 'll have to go back to New York and struggle on your own hook until I get enough to come for you . I do n't know how long that will be , but it will be . Do you love me enough to stick out for the right thing ? LAURA crosses to him , puts her arms around him , kisses him once very affectionately , looks at him very earnestly . p. 23 MURDOCK Yes . I think this is my one great chance . I do love you and I want to do just what you said . MADISON I think you will . I 'm going to make the same promise . Your life , dear girl , has been an angel 's compared with mine . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the time I could develop a thirst ; and ever since I 've been able to earn my own living I 've abused every natural gift God gave me . The women I 've associated with are n't good enough to touch the hem of your skirt , but they liked me , and JOHN crosses to armchair , turns up stage , then faces her. well  --  I must have liked them . My life has n't been exactly loose , it 's been all in pieces . I 've never done anything dishonest . I 've always gone wrong just for the fun of it , until I met you . Crosses to her , takes her in his arms . Somehow then I began to feel that I was making an awful waste of myself . MURDOCK John ! MADISON Some lovers place a woman on a pedestal and say , " She never has made a mistake . " Taking her by each arm he playfully shakes her . Well , we do n't need any pedestals . I just know you never will make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never make you take those words back . Arms around his neck . p. 24 MADISON That goes double . You 're going to cut out the cabs and cafs , and I 'm going to cut out the whiskey and all-night sessions LAURA releases him ; he backs slightly away. ; and you 're going to be somebody and I 'm going to be somebody , and if my hunch is worth the powder to blow it up , we 're going to show folks things they never thought were in us . Come on now , kiss me . She kisses him ; tears are in her eyes . He looks into her face with a quaint smile . MADISON You 're on , ai n't you , dear ? MURDOCK Yes , I 'm on . MADISON Then Points toward door with his left arm over her shoulder. call him . MURDOCK Brockton ? MADISON Yes , and tell him you go back to New York without any travelling companion this season . MURDOCK Now ? MADISON Sure . MURDOCK You want to hear me tell him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we ? I ought to be in on any important transaction like that , but it 's just as you say . MURDOCK I think it would be right you should . I 'll call him now . p. 25 MADISON All right . Crossing to stairway . LAURA crosses to door ; twilight is becoming very much more pronounced . MURDOCK At door . Mr. Brockton ! Oh , Mr. Brockton ! BROCKTON Off stage . Yes . MURDOCK Can you spare a moment to come out here ? BROCKTON Just a moment . MURDOCK You must come now . BROCKTON All right . She waits for him and after a reasonable interval he appears at door . Laura , it 's a shame to lure me away from that mad speculation in there . I thought I might make my fare back to New York if I played until next summer . What 's up ? MURDOCK Mr. Madison wants to talk to you , or rather I do , and I want him to listen . BROCKTON His manner changing to one of cold , stolid calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MURDOCK Will . BROCKTON Yes ? MURDOCK I 'm going home day after to-morrow on the Overland Limited . p. 26 BROCKTON I know . MURDOCK It 's awfully kind of you to come out here , but under the circumstances I 'd rather you 'd take an earlier or a later train . BROCKTON And may I ask what circumstances you refer to ? MURDOCK Mr. Madison and I are going to be married . Pause . He WILL looks inquiringly at JOHN. knows of your former friendship for me , and he has the idea that it must end . BROCKTON Then the Riverside Drive proposition , with Burgess 's show thrown in , is declared off , eh ? MURDOCK Yes ; everything is absolutely declared off . BROCKTON Ca n't even be friends any more , eh ? JOHN crosses , and , taking LAURA 's arm , passes her over to seat ; his back is partly to audience . MADISON You could hardly expect Miss Murdock to be friendly with you under the circumstances . You could hardly expect me to LAURA puts scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I understand your position , young man , and I perfectly agree with you , that is  --  if your plans come out successfully . p. 27 MADISON Thank you . MURDOCK Then everything is settled Crossing in front of JOHN and facing WILL , back to audience. just the way it ought to be  --  frankly and aboveboard ? BROCKTON Why , I guess so . If I was perfectly confident that this new arrangement was going to result happily for you both , I think it would be great , only I 'm somewhat doubtful , for when people become serious and then fail , I know how hard those things hit , having been hit once myself . MADISON So you think we 're making a wrong move and there is n't a chance of success ! BROCKTON No , I do n't make any such gloomy prophecy . If you make Laura a good husband , and she makes you a good wife , and together you win out , I 'll be mighty glad . As far as I am concerned I shall absolutely forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you 'd be just that way . Crosses to WILL , shakes hands . BROCKTON Rising . And now I must be off . Takes her by both hands and shakes them . Good-bye , girlie ! Madison , good luck . Crosses to JOHN . Shakes JOHN 's hands ; looks into his eyes . I think you 've got the stuff in you to succeed if your foot do n't slip . p. 28 MADISON What do you mean by my foot slipping , Mr. Brockton ? BROCKTON You want me to tell you ? MADISON I sure do . BROCKTON Turns to Laura . Laura , run into the house and see if Mrs. Williams has won another quarter . LAURA sinks fearfully into chair . Madison and I are going to smoke a cigar and have a friendly chat , and when we get through I think we 'll both be better off . MURDOCK You are sure that everything will be all right ? BROCKTON Sure . LAURA looks at JOHN for assurance , and exits ; he nods reassuringly . BROCKTON Have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADISON No , I 'll smoke my own . Crosses down right ; sits in armchair . BROCKTON What is your business ? Crosses up to seat centre ; sits . MADISON What 's yours ? BROCKTON I 'm a broker . MADISON I 'm a reporter , so I 've got something on you . p. 29 BROCKTON What kind ? MADISON General utility , dramatic critic on Sunday nights . BROCKTON Pay you well ? MADISON Turns , looking at WILL . That 's pretty fresh . What 's the idea ? BROCKTON I 'm interested . I 'm a plain man , Mr. Madison , and I do business in a plain way . Now , if I ask you a few questions and discuss this matter with you in a frank way , do n't get it in your head that I 'm jealous or sore , but simply I do n't want either of you people to make a move that 's going to cost you a lot of pain and trouble . If you want me to talk sense to you , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the answer ? MADISON I 'll take a chance , but before you start I want to tell you that the class of people that you belong to I have no use for  --  they do n't speak my language . You are what they call a manipulator of stocks ; that means that you 're living on the weaknesses of other people , and it almost means that you get your daily bread , yes , and your cake and your wine , too , from the production of others . You 're a " gambler under cover . " Show me a man who 's dealing bank , and he 's free and aboveboard . You can figure the percentage against you , and then , if you buck the tiger and get stung , you do it with your eyes open . With your financiers the game is crooked twelve months of the year , and , from a business point of view , I think you are a crook . Now I guess we understand each other . If you 've got anything to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down toward JOHN , showing anger in his tones . p. 30 BROCKTON We are not talking business now , but women . How much money do you earn ? Crosses to chair left of table ; gets it . MADISON Understand I do n't think it is any of your damn business , but I 'm going through with you on this proposition , just to see how the land lays . But take my tip , you be mighty careful how you speak about the girl if you 're not looking for trouble . BROCKTON All right , but how much did you say you made ? Crosses over to centre of stage , carrying chair ; sits . MADISON Thirty dollars a week . BROCKTON Do you know how much Laura could make if she just took a job on her own merits ? MADISON As I do n't intend to share in her salary , I never took the trouble to inquire . BROCKTON She 'd get about forty dollars . MADISON That laps me ten . BROCKTON How are you going to support her ? Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her week 's salary for an every-day walking-hat . She 's always had a maid ; her simplest gown flirts with a hundred-dollar note ; her manicurist and her hair-dresser will eat up as much as you pay for your board . She never walks when it 's stormy , and every afternoon there 's her ride in the park . She dines at the best places in New York , and one meal costs her more than you make in a day . Do you imagine for a moment that she 's going to sacrifice these luxuries for any great length of time ? p. 31 MADISON I intend to give them to her . BROCKTON On thirty dollars a week ? MADISON I propose to go out and make a lot of money . BROCKTON How ? MADISON I have n't decided yet , but you can bet your sweet life that if I ever try and make up my mind that it 's got to be , it 's got to be . BROCKTON Never have made it , have you ? MADISON I have never tried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 'm honest and energetic . If you can get great wealth the way you go along , I do n't see why I ca n't earn a little . BROCKTON There 's where you make a mistake . Money-getting does n't always come with brilliancy . I know a lot of fellows in New York who can paint a great picture , write a good play , and , when it comes to oratory , they 've got me lashed to a pole ; but they 're always in debt . They never get anything for what they do . In other words , young man , they are like a sky-rocket without a stick ,  --  plenty of brilliancy , but no direction , and they blow up and fizzle all over the ground . MADISON That 's New York . I 'm in Colorado , and I guess you know there is a difference . p. 32 BROCKTON I hope you 'll make your money , because I tell you frankly that 's the only way you can hold this girl . She 's full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to make up the third act of a play , but the minute she comes to darn her stockings , wash out her own handkerchiefs and dry them on the window , and send out for a pail of coffee and a sandwich for lunch , take it from me it will go Blah ! Rise , crosses to front of table with chair , places it with back to him , braces his back on it , facing JOHN . You 're in Colorado writing her letters once a day with no checks in them . That may be all right for some girl who has n't tasted the joy of easy living , full of the good things of life , but one who for ten years has been doing very well in the way these women do is not going to let up for any great length of time . So take my advice if you want to hold her . Get that money quick , and do n't be so damned particular how you get it either . JOHN 'S patience is evidently severely tried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course you know you 've got teh best of me . BROCKTON How ? MADISON We 're guests . BROCKTON No one 's listening . MADISON ' Tis n't that . If it was anywhere but here , if there was any way to avoid all the nasty scandal , I 'd come a shootin ' for you , and you know it . p. 33 BROCKTON Gun-fighter , eh ? MADISON Perhaps . Let me tell you this . I do n't know how you make your money , but I know what you do with it . You buy yourself a small circle of sycophants ; you pay them well for feeding your vanity ; and then you pose ,  --  pose with a certain frank admission of vice and degradation . And those who are n't quite as brazen as you call it manhood . Manhood ? Crossing slowly to armchair , sits . Why , you do n't know what the word means . It 's the attitude of a pup and a cur . BROCKTON Angrily . Wait a minute Crosses to JOHN. , young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men stand confronting each other for a moment with fists clenched . They are on the very verge of a personal encounter . Both seem to realize that they have gone too far . MADISON You 'll what ? BROCKTON Lose my temper and make a damn fool of myself . That 's something I 've not done for  --  let me see  --  why , it must be nearly twenty years  --  oh , yes , fully that . He smiles ; JOHN relaxes and takes one step back . MADISON Possibly it 's been about that length of time since you were human , eh ? p. 34 BROCKTON Possibly  --  but you see , Mr. Madison , after all , you 're at fault . MADISON Yes ? BROCKTON Yes , the very first thing you did was to lose your temper . Now people who always lose their temper will never make a lot of money , and you admit that that is a great necessity  --  I mean now  --  to you . MADISON I ca n't stand for the brutal way you talk . Crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down angrily on seat , and sits with elbow on balustrade . BROCKTON But you have got to stand it . The truth is never gentle . Crosses up and sits left of JOHN . Most conditions in life are unpleasant , and , if you want to meet them squarely , you have got to realize the unpleasant point of view . That 's the only way you can fight them and win . MADISON Turns to WILL . Still , I believe Laura means what she says , in spite of all you say and the disagreeable logic of it . I think she loves me . If she should ever want to go back to the old way of getting along , I think she 'd tell me so . So you see , Brockton , all your talk is wasted , and we 'll drop the subject . Crosses down and sits in armchair . BROCKTON And if she should ever go back and come to me , I am going to insist that she let you know all about it . It 'll be hard enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , but it would hurt a lot more to be double-crossed. p. 35 MADISON Sarcastically . That 's very kind . Thanks ! BROCKTON Do n't get sore . It 's common sense and it goes , does it not ? MADISON Turns to WILL . Just what goes ? BROCKTON If she leaves you first , you are to tell me , and if she comes to me I 'll make her let you know just when and why . JOHN is leaning on arm , facing WILL ; his hand shoots out in a gesture of warning to WILL . MADISON Look out ! BROCKTON I said common sense . MADISON All right . BROCKTON Agreed ? A pause . MADISON You 're on . By this time the stage is black and all that can be seen is the glow of the two cigars . Piano in the next room is heard . JOHN crosses slowly and deliberately to door , looks in , throws cigar away over the terrace , exits into house , closes doors , and , as WILL is seated on terrace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible , a slow curtain. @x SCENE . Six months have elapsed . The furnished room of LAURA MURDOCK , second story back of an ordinary , cheap theatrical lodging-house in the theatre district of New York . The house is evidently of a type of the old-fashioned brown-stone front , with high ceilings , dingy walls , and long , rather insecure windows . The woodwork is depressingly dark . The ceiling is cracked , the paper is old and spotted and in places loose . There is a door leading to the hallway . There is a large old-fashioned wardrobe in which are hung a few old clothes , most of them a good deal worn and shabby , showing that the owner  --  LAURA MURDOCK  --  has had a rather hard time of it since leaving Colorado in the first act . The doors of this wardrobe must be equipped with springs so they will open outward , and also furnished with wires so they can be controlled from the back . This is absolutely necessary , owing to " business " which is done during the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wardrobe is open at rise . This is filled with a lot of rumpled tissue-paper and other rubbish . An old pair of shoes is seen at the upper end of the wardrobe on the floor . There is an armchair over which is thrown an ordinary kimono , and on top of the wardrobe are a number of magazines and old books , and an unused parasol wrapped up in tissue paper . The dresser , which is upstage , against the wall , is in keeping with the general meanness , and its adornment consists of old postcards stuck in between the mirror and its frame , with some wellworn veils and ribbons hung on the side . On the dresser is a pincushion , a bottle of cheap perfume , purple in colour and nearly empty ; a common crockery match-holder , containing matches , which must be practicable ; a handkerchief-box , powder-box and puff , rouge-box and rouge paw , hand mirror , small alcohol curling-iron heater , which must also be practicable , as it is used in the " business " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a small cheap picture of JOHN MADISON ; a small work-box containing a thimble and thread ,  --  and stuck in the pincushion are a couple of needles , threaded . Directly to the left of the bureau , with the door to the outside closet intervening , is a broken-down washstand , on which is a basin half full of water , a bottle of tooth-powder , tooth brushes and holder , soap and soapdish , and other cheap toilet articles , and a small drinking-glass . Hung on the corner of the washstand is a soiled towel . Hung on the rack across the top of the washstand one can see a pair of stockings . On the floor in front of the washstand is a pitcher half full of water ; also a large waste-water jar of the cheapest type . Below the washstand , and with the head against the wall , is a three-quarter old wooden bed , also showing the general decay of the entire room . Tacked on the head of this bed is a large photo of JOHN MADISON , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covering the tack . Under the photo are arranged half a dozen cheap , artificial violets , in pitiful recognition of the girl 's love for her absent sweetheart . Under the mattress at the head of the bed is a heavy cardboard box , about thirty inches long , seven inches wide and four inches deep , containing about one hundred and twenty-five letters and eighty telegrams , tied in about eight bundles with dainty ribbon . One bundle must contain all practical letters of several closely written pages each , each letter having been opened . They must be written upon business paper and envelopes , such as are used in newspaper offices and by business men . Under the pillow at the head of the bed is carelessly thrown a woman 's night-dress . On the bed is an old book , open , with face downward , and beside it is an apple which some one has been nibbling . Across the foot of the bed is a soiled quilt , untidily folded . The pillows are hollow in the centre , as if having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small table , with soiled and ink-stained cover , upon which are a cheap pitcher , containing some withered carnations , and a desk-pad , with paper , pen , ink , and envelopes scattered around . Against the wall below the bed is an old mantel-piece and fireplace with iron grate , such as are used in houses of this type . On the mantel-piece are photos of actors and actresses , an old mantel clock in the centre , in front of which is a box of cheap peppermint candy in large pieces , and a plate with two apples upon it ; some cheap pieces of bric -- brac and a little vase containing joss-sticks , such as one might burn to improve the atmosphere of these dingy , damp houses . Below the mantel-piece is a thirty-six inch theatre trunk , with theatre labels on it , in the tray of which are articles of clothing , a small box of thread , and a bundle of eight pawn tickets . Behind the trunk is a large cardboard box . Hanging from the ceiling directly over the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turkey wish-bone . On the jet is a little wire arrangement to hold small articles for heating . Beside the table is a chair . Under the bed are a pair of bedroom slippers and a box . Between the bed and the mantel is a small tabourette on which are a book and a candle-stick with the candle half burned . On the floor in front of the door is a slipper ,  --  also another in front of the dresser ,  --  as if they had been thrown carelessly down . On the wardrobe door , on the down-stage side , is tacked another photo of JOHN MADISON . In an alcove off left is a table on which is a small oil stove , two cups , saucers and plates , a box of matches , tin coffee-box , and a small Japanese teapot . On a projection outside the window is a pint milk bottle , half filled with milk , and an empty benzine bottle , which is labelled . Both are covered with snow . The backing shows a street snow-covered . In arranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a box of Uneeda biscuits , with one end torn open . There is a door down right , opening inward , leading into the hallway . The window is at back , running from floor nearly to the ceiling . This window does not rise , but opens in the manner of the French or door window . On the outside of the window covering the same is an iron guard such as is used in New York on the lower back windows . The rods running up and down are about four inches apart . There is a projection outside the window such as would be formed by a storm door in the basement ; running the full length of the window and about thirty inches wide , raised about a foot from the floor in front and about nine inches in the back , there is opening inward a door at left back , leading into a small alcove , as has been mentioned before . The door is half glass , the glass part being the upper half , and is ajar when the curtain rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a chimney is in the wall which runs from left centre diagonally to left first entrance . AT RISE the stage is empty . After a pause LAURA enters , passes the dresser , places umbrella at the right , end of it against wall , crosses to back of armchair , removes gloves , lays them over back of chair , takes off coat and hat , hangs hat on end of wardrobe , and puts coat inside ; notices old slipper in front of dresser and one on the extreme right , and with impatience picks them up and puts them in the wardrobe drawer . Then crosses to dresser , gets needle and thread off pincushion , and mends small rip in glove , after which she puts gloves in top drawer of dresser , crosses to extreme end of dresser , and gets handkerchief out of box , takes up bottle containing purple perfume , holds it up so she can see there is only a small quantity left , sprinkles a drop on handkerchief carefully , so as not to use too much , looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places it on dresser ; goes to up-stage side of bed , kneels on head of the bed and looks lovingly at photo of JOHN MADISON , and finally pulls up the mattress , takes out box of letters , and opens it . She then sits down in Oriental fashion , with her feet under her , selects a bundle of letters , unties the ribbon , and takes out a letter such as has been hereinbefore described , glances it over , puts it down in her lap , and again takes a long look at the picture of JOHN MADISON . ANNIE is heard coming upstairs . LAURA looks quickly towards the door , puts the letters back in box , and hurriedly places box under mattress , and replaces pillow . ANNIE knocks on door . LAURA rises and crosses to door . MURDOCK Come in . ANNIE , a chocolate-colored negress , enters . She is slovenly in appearance , but must not in any way denote the " mammy . " She is the type one encounters in cheap theatrical lodging-houses . She has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded ,  --  and approaches LAURA . p. 37 MURDOCK Hello , Annie . ANNIE Heah 's yo ' mail , Miss Laura . MURDOCK Taking letter . Thank you ! She looks at the address and does not open it . ANNIE One like dat comes every mornin ' , do n't it ? Used to all be postmahked Denver . Must ' a ' moved . Trying to look over LAURA 'S shoulder ; LAURA turns and sees her ; ANNIE looks away . Where is dat place called Goldfield , Miss Laura ? MURDOCK In Nevada . ANNIE In Nevada ? MURDOCK Yes , Nevada . ANNIE Draws her jacket closer around her as if chilly . Must be mighty smaht to write yuh every day . De pos'man brings it ' leven o'clock mos ' always , sometimes twelve , and again sometimes tehn ; but it comes every day , do n't it ? MURDOCK I know . ANNIE Crosses to right of armchair , brushes it off and makes an effort to read letter , leaning across chair . Guess must be from yo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't any . p. 38 ANNIE Crossing to centre triumphantly . Dat 's what Ah tole Mis ' Farley when she was down talkin ' about you dis morning . She said if he all was yo ' husban ' he might do somethin ' to help you out . Ah told her Ah did n't think you had any husban ' . Den she says you ought to have one , you 're so pretty . MURDOCK Oh , Annie ! ANNIE Sees door open ; goes and bangs it shut . Der ai n't a decent door in dis old house . Mis ' Farley said yo ' might have mos ' any man you Hangs clean towel on washstand. wanted just for de askin ' , but Ah said yuh Takes newspaper and books off bed , and places them on table. was too particular about the man yo ' ' d want . Den she did a heap o'talking . MURDOCK About what ? Places letter open on table , looks at hem at of skirt , discovers a rip , rises , crosses up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; opens and takes thimble out ; closes lid of tray , sits on it , and sews skirt during scene . ANNIE At bed , fussing around , folds nightgown and places it under pillow . Well , you know , Mis ' Farley she 's been havin ' so much trouble wid her roomers . Yestuhday dat young lady on de second flo ' front , she lef ' . She 's goin ' wiv some troupe on the road . She owed her room for three weeks and jus ' had to leave her trunk . Crosses and fusses over table . My ! how Mis ' Farley did scold her . Mis ' Farley let on she could have paid dat money if she wanted to , but somehow Ah guess she could n't  --  Reads letter on table . p. 39 MURDOCK Sees her , angrily exclaims . Annie ! ANNIE In confusion , brushing off table.  --  for if she could she would n't have left her trunk , would she , Miss Laura ? Crosses to armchair , and picks up kimono off back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Farley say about me ? ANNIE Oh ! nothin ' much . Crosses left and stands . MURDOCK Well , what ? ANNIE She kinder say somethin ' ' bout yo ' being three weeks behind in yo ' room rent , and she said she t'ought it was ' bout time yuh handed her somethin ' , seein ' as how yuh must o'had some stylish friends when yuh come here . MURDOCK Who , for instance ? ANNIE Ah do n't know . Mis ' Farley said some of ' em might slip yo ' enough jest to help yuh out . Pause . Ai n't yo ' got nobody to take care of you at all , Miss Laura ? Hangs kimono over back of armchair . MURDOCK No ! No one . ANNIE Dat 's too bad . MURDOCK Why ? p. 40 ANNIE Crossing again . Mis ' Farley says yuh would n't have no trouble at all gettin ' any man to take care of yuh if yuh wanted to . MURDOCK With sorrowful shudder . Please Doors of wardrobe open very slowly. do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of tablecloth. dat calls on one of de ladies from the Hippodrome , in de big front room downstairs . He 's mighty nice , and he 's been askin ' ' bout you . MURDOCK Exasperated . Oh , shut up ! ANNIE Sees doors of wardrobe have swung open ; she crosses , slams them shut , turns to LAURA . Mis ' Farley says  --  Doors have swung open again ; they hit her in the back . She turns and bangs them to with all her strength . Damn dat door ! Crosses to washstand , grabs basin which is half full of water , empties same into waste-jar , puts baisn on washstand , and wipes it out with soiled towel . Mis ' Farley says if she do n't get someone in the house dat has reg'lar money soon , she 'll have to shut up and go to the po'house . MURDOCK I 'm sorry ; I 'll try again to-day . Rises , crosses up to mantel , gets desk-pad , &amp;c. , crosses to right of table , sits . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with towel . Ai n't yo'got any job at all ? MURDOCK No . ANNIE When yuh come here yuh had lots of money and yo ' was mighty good to me . You know Mr. Weston ? MURDOCK Jim Weston ? ANNIE Yassum , Mr. Weston what goes ahead o ' shows and lives on the top floor back ; he says nobody 's got jobs now . Dey 're so many actors and actoresses out o ' work . Mis ' Farley says she do n't know how she 's goin ' to live . She said you 'd been mighty nice up until three weeks ago , but yuh ai n't got much left , have you , Miss Laura ? MURDOCK Rising and going to the bureau . No . It 's all gone . ANNIE Mah sakes ! All dem rings and things ? You ai n't done sold them ? Sinks on bed . MURDOCK They 're pawned . What did Mrs. Farley say she was going to do ? ANNIE Guess maybe Ah 'd better not tell . Crosses to door hurriedly , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , left side . p. 42 ANNIE Yuh been so good to me , Miss Laura . Never was nobody in dis house what give me so much , and Ah ai n't been gettin ' much lately . And when Mis ' Farley said yuh must either pay yo ' rent or she would ask yuh for your room , Ah jest set right down on de back kitchen stairs and cried . Besides , Mis ' Farley do n't like me very well since you 've ben havin ' yo ' breakfasts and dinners brought up here . MURDOCK Why not ? Takes kimono off chair-back , crosses up to dresser , puts kimono in drawer , takes out purse . ANNIE She has a rule in dis house dat nobody can use huh chiny or fo'ks or spoons who ai n't boa'ding heah , and de odder day when yuh asked me to bring up a knife and fo'k she ketched me coming upstairs , and she says , " Where yuh goin ' wid all dose thing , Annie ? " Ah said , " Ah 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dat knife and fo'k . " Ah said , " Ah 'm goin ' up for nothin ' at all , Mis ' Farley , she jest wants to look at them , Ah guess . " She said , " She wants to eat huh dinner wid ' em , Ah guess . " Ah got real mad , and Ah told her if she 'd give me mah pay Ah 'd brush right out o'here ; dat 's what Ah 'd do , Ah 'd brush right out o'here . Violently shaking out towel . MURDOCK I 'm sorry , Annie , if I 've caused you any trouble . Never mind , I 'll be able to pay the rent to-morrow or next day anyway . She fumbles in purse , takes out a quarter , and turns to ANNIE . Here ! p. 43 ANNIE No , ma 'm , Ah don ' want dat . Making a show of reluctance . MURDOCK Please take it . ANNIE No , ma'am , Ah don ' want it . You need dat . Dat 's breakfast money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie . I might just as well get rid of this as anything else . ANNIE Takes it rather reluctantly . Yuh always was so good , Miss Laura . Sho ' yuh don ' want dis ? MURDOCK Sure . ANNIE Sho ' yo ' goin ' to get planty mo ' ? MRS . FARLEY Downstairs . Annie ! Annie ! ANNIE Going to door , opens it . Dat 's Mis ' Farley . To MRS . FARLEY . Yassum , Mis ' Farley . MRS . FARLEY Is Miss Murdock up there ? ANNIE Yassum , Mis ' Farley , yassum ! MRS . FARLEY Anything doin ' ? ANNIE Huh ? MRS . FARLEY Anything doin ' ? ANNIE At door . Ah  --  Ah  --  hai n't asked , Missy Farley . p. 44 MRS . FARLEY Then do it . MURDOCK Coming to the rescue at the door . To ANNIE . I 'll answer her . Out of door to MRS . FARLEY . What is it , Mrs. Farley ? MRS . FARLEY Her voice softened . Did ye have any luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise you faithfully to help you out this afternoon or to-morrow . MRS . FARLEY Sure ? Are you certain ? MURDOCK Absolutely . MRS . FARLEY Well , I must say these people expect me to keep  --  Door closed . LAURA quietly closes the door , and MRS . FARLEY 'S rather strident voice is heard indistinctly . LAURA sighs and walks toward table ; sits . ANNIE looks after her , and then slowly opens the door . ANNIE Yo ' sho ' dere ai n't nothin ' I can do fo ' yuh , Miss Laura ? MURDOCK Nothing . ANNIE . exits . LAURA sits down and looks at letter , opening it . It consists of several pages closely written . She reads some of them hurriedly , skims through the rest , and then turns to the last page without reading ; glances at it ; lays it on table ; rises . p. 45 MURDOCK Hope , just nothing but hope . She crosses to bed , falls face down upon it , burying her face in her hands . Her despondency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street starts to play a popular air . This arouses her and she rises , crosses to wardrobe , takes out box of crackers , opens window , gets bottle of milk off sill outside , places them on table , gets glass off washstand , at the same time humming the tune of the hurdy-gurdy , when a knock comes ; she crosses quickly to dresser ; powders her nose . The knock is timidly repeated . MURDOCK Without turning , and in a rather tired tone of voice . Come in . JIM WESTON , a rather shabby theatrical advance-agent of the old school , enters timidly , halting at the door and holding the knob in his hand . He is a man of about forty years old , dressed in an ordinary manner , of medium height , and in fact has the appearance of a once prosperous clerk who has been in hard luck . His relations with LAURA are those of pure friendship . They both live in the same lodging-place , and , both having been out of employment , they have naturally become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning . Hello , Jim Weston . He closes door and enters . Any luck ? p. 46 WESTON Lots of it . MURDOCK That 's good . Tell me . WESTON It 's bad luck . Guess you do n't want to hear . MURDOCK I 'm sorry . Where have you been ? WESTON I kind o'felt around up at Burgess 's office . I thought I might get a job there , but he put me off until to-morrow . Somehow those fellows always do business to-morrow . Hurdy-gurdy dies out . MURDOCK Yes , and there 's always to-day to look after . WESTON I 'm ready to give up . I 've tramped Broadway for nine weeks until every piece of flagstone gives me the laugh when it sees my feet coming . Got a letter from the missis this morning . The kids got to have some clothes , there 's measles in the town , and mumps in the next village . I 've just got to raise some money or get some work , or the first thing you 'll know I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a club . MURDOCK I know just how you feel . Sit down , Jim . JIM crosses and sits in chair right of table . It 's pretty tough for me Offers Jim glass of milk ; he refuses ; takes crackers. , but it must be a whole lot worse for you with a wife and kids . p. 47 WESTON Oh , if a man 's alone he can generally get along  --  turn his hand to anything ; but a woman  --  MURDOCK Worse , you think ? WESTON I was just thinking about you and what Burgess said ? MURDOCK What was that ? Crosses to bed ; sits on up-stage side , sipping milk . WESTON You know Burgess and I used to be in the circus business together . He took care of the grafters when I was boss canvas man . I never could see any good in shaking down the rubes for all the money they had and then taking part of it . He used to run the privilege car , you know . MURDOCK Privilege car ? WESTON Had charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em  --  sure-thing gamblers , and the like . Made him rich . I kept sort o ' on the level and I 'm broke . Guess it do n't pay to be honest  --  MURDOCK Turns to him and in a significant voice : You do n't really think that ? WESTON No , maybe not . Ever since I married the missis and the first kid come , we figured the only good money was the kind folks worked for and earned ; but when you ca n't get hold of that , it 's tough . p. 48 MURDOCK I know . WESTON Burgess do n't seem to be losing sleep over the tricks he 's turned . He 's happy and prosperous , but I guess he ai n't any better now than he was then . MURDOCK Maybe not . I 've been trying to get an engagement from him . There are half a dozen parts in his new attractions that I could do , but he has never absolutely said " no , " but yet somehow he 's never said " yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ? Rising , stands behind JIM 'S chair . WESTON I gave him my address and he seen it was yours , too . Asked if I lived in the same place . MURDOCK Was that all ? WESTON Wanted to know how you was getting on . I let him know you needed work , but I did n't tip my hand you was flat broke . He said something about you being a damned fool . MURDOCK Suddenly and interested . How ? She crosses . WESTON Well , Johnny Ensworth  --  you know he used to do the fights on the Evening Journal ; now he 's press-agent for Burgess ; nice fellow and way on the inside  --  he told me where you were in wrong . p. 49 MURDOCK What have I done ? Sits in armchair . WESTON Burgess do n't put up the money for any of them musical comedies  --  he just trails . Of course he 's got a lot of influence , and he 's always Johnny-on-the-Spot to turn any dirty trick that they want . There are four or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank-roll , providing he engages women who ai n't so very particular about the location of their residence , and who do n't hear a curfew ring at 11:30 every night . MURDOCK And he thinks I am too particular ? WESTON That 's what was slipped me . Seems that one of the richest men that is in on Mr. Burgess 's address-book is a fellow named Brockton from downtown some place . He 's got more money than the Shoe and Leather National Bank . He likes to play show business . MURDOCK Rises quickly . Oh ! Crosses to wardrobe , gets hat ; crosses to dresser , gets scissors with intention of curling feathers . WESTON I thought you knew him . I thought it was just as well to tell you where he and Burgess stand . They 're pals . MURDOCK Coming over to Jim and with emphasis crosses to downstage side of bed ; puts hat and scissors on bed . I do n't want you to talk about him or any of them . I just want you to know that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season without any more trouble . I 've pawned everything I 've got ; I 've cut every friend I knew . But where am I going to end ? That 's what I want to know  --  where am I going to end ? To bed and sits . Every place I look for a position something interferes . It 's almost as if I were blacklisted . I know I could get jobs all right if I wanted to pay the price , but I wo n't . I just want to tell you , I wo n't . No ! Rises , crosses to mantel , rests elbow. p. 50 WESTON That 's the way to talk . RisesI do n't know you very well , but I 've watched you close . I 'm just a common , ordinary showman who never had much money , and I 'm going out o ' date . I 've spent most of my time with nigger-minstrel shows and circuses , but I 've been on the square . That 's why I 'm broke . Rather sadly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do her acrobatic act , but she could n't do that , she 's grown so damn fat . Crosses to LAURA . Just you do n't mind . It 'll all come out right . MURDOCK It 's an awful tough game , is n't it ? WESTON During this speech LAURA gets cup , pours milk back into bottle , closes biscuit-box , puts milk on shed outside , and biscuits into wardrobe , cup in alcove . It 's hell forty ways from the Jack . It 's tough for me , but for a pretty woman with a lot o ' rich fools jumping out o ' their automobiles and hanging around stage doors , it must be something awful . I ai n't blaming the women . They say " self-preservation is the first law of nature , " and I guess that 's right ; but sometimes when the show is over and I see them fellows with their hair plastered back , smoking cigarettes in a LAURA cross to chair right of table and leans over back. holder long enough to reach from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pocket and turn my head , I feel as if I 'd like to get a gun and go a-shooting around this old town . p. 51 MURDOCK Jim ! WESTON Yes , I do  --  you bet . MURDOCK That would n't pay , would it ? WESTON No , they 're not worth the job of sitting on that throne in Sing Sing , and I 'm too poor to go to Matteawan . But all them fellows under nineteen and over fifty-nine ai n't much use to themselves or anyone else . MURDOCK Rather meditatively . Perhaps all of them are not so bad . WESTON Sits on bed . Yes , they are ,  --  angels and all . Last season I had one of them shows where a rich fellow backed it on account of a girl . We lost money and he lost his girl ; then we got stuck in Texas . I telegraphed : " Must have a thousand , or ca n't move . " He just answered : " Do n't move . " We did n't . MURDOCK But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year for some of them folks to get back to Broadway . Some of the girls never did , and I guess never will . MURDOCK Maybe they 're better off , Jim . Sits right of table . WESTON Could n't be worse . They 're still in Texas . To himself . Wish I knew how to do something else , being a plumber or a walking delegate ; they always have jobs . p. 52 MURDOCK Well , I wish I could do something else too , but I ca n't , and we 've got to make the best of it . WESTON I guess so . I 'll see you this evening . I hope you 'll have good news by that time . Starts to exit , about to open door ; then retreats a step , with hand on door-knob , crosses and in a voice meant to be kindly : If you 'd like to go to the theatre to-night , and take some other woman in the house , maybe I can get a couple of tickets for some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . MURDOCK No , thanks . I have n't anything to wear to the theatre , and I do n't  --  WESTON With a smile crosses to LAURA , puts arm around her . Now you just cheer up ! Something 's sure to turn up . It always has for me , and I 'm a lot older than you , both in years and in this business . There 's always a break in hard luck sometime  --  that 's sure . MURDOCK Smiling through her tears . I hope so . But things are looking pretty hopeless now , are n't they ? WESTON I 'll go down and give Mrs. F. a line o ' talk and try to square you for a couple of days more anyway . But I guess she 's laying pretty close to the cushion herself , poor woman . p. 53 MURDOCK Annie says a lot of people owe her . WESTON Well , you ca n't pay what you have n't got . And even if money was growing on trees , it 's winter now . JIM goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky day . So long ! MURDOCK Good-bye . WESTON Keep your nerve . Exit MURDOCK I will . She sits for a moment in deep thought , picks up the letter received , as if to read it , and then throws it down in anger . She buries her head in hands . I ca n't stand it  --  I just simply ca n't stand it . MRS . FARLEY Off stage . Miss Murdock  --  Miss Murdock . MURDOCK Brushing away tears , rises , goes to door , and opens it . What is it ? MRS . FARLEY There 's a lady down here to see you . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Off stage . Hello , dearie , can I come up ? MURDOCK Is that you , Elfie ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Yes ; shall I come up ? MURDOCK Why , certainly . She waits at the door for a moment , and ELFIE ST . CLAIR appears . She is gorgeously gowned in the rather extreme style affected by the usual New York woman who is cared for by a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matrimonial alliance . Her conduct is always exaggerated and her attitude vigorous . Her gown is of the latest design , and in every detail of dress she shows evidence of most extravagant expenditure . She carries a hand-bag of gold , upon which are attached such trifles as a gold cigarette-case , a gold powder-box , pencils , and the like . ELFIE throws her arms around LAURA , and both exchange kisses . p. 54 ELFIE ST . CLAIR Laura , you old dear Crossing to table . , I 've just found out where you 've been hiding , and came around to see you . MURDOCK Who is much brightened by ELFIE 'S appearance . Elfie , you 're looking bully . How are you , dear ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Fine . MURDOCK Come in and sit down . I have n't much to offer , but  --  ELFIE ST . CLAIR Oh , never mind . It 's such a grand day outside , and I 've come around in my car to take you out . Sits right of table . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go some . MURDOCK Sits on arm of chair . I am sorry , but I ca n't go out this afternoon , Elfie . ELFIE ST . CLAIR What 's the matter ? MURDOCK You see I 'm staying home a good deal nowadays . I have n't been feeling very well and I do n't go out much . ELFIE ST . CLAIR I should think not . I have n't seen you in Rector 's or Martin 's since you come back from Denver . Got a glimpse of you one day trailing up Broadway , but could n't get to you  --  you dived into some office or other . For the first time she surveys the room , rises , looks around critically , crossing to mantel . Gee ! Whatever made you come into a dump like this ? It 's the limit . p. 55 MURDOCK Crossing and standing back of the table . Oh , I know it is n't pleasant , but it 's my home , and after all  --  a home 's a home . ELFIE ST . CLAIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; spits it out on floor . Makes me think of the old days of Child 's sinkers and a hall bedroom . MURDOCK It 's comfortable . Leaning hands on table . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Not ! Sits on bed , trying bed with comedy effect.Say , is this here for an effect , or do you sleep on it ? MURDOCK I sleep on it . ELFIE ST . CLAIR No wonder you look tired . Say , listen , dearie . What else is the matter with you anyway ? MURDOCK Nothing . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Yes , there is . What happened between you and Brockton ? Notices faded flowers in vase on table ; takes them out , tosses them into fireplace , replaces them with gardenias which she wears . He 's not broke , because I saw him the other day . MURDOCK Where ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR In the park . Asked me out to luncheon , but I could n't go . You know , dearie , I 've got to be so careful . Jerry 's so awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see much of Jerry nowadays , Elfie ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Not any more than I can help and be nice . He gets on my nerves . Of course , I 've heard about your quitting Brockton . MURDOCK Then why do you ask ? Crosses around chair right of table ; stands . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Just wanted to hear from your own dear lips what the trouble was . Now tell me all about it . Can I smoke here ? Takes cigarette-case up , opens it , selecting cigarette . MURDOCK Surely . Gets matches off bureau , puts them on table . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Have one ? Offers case . MURDOCK No , thank you . Sits in chair right of table , facing ELFIE . ELFIE ST . CLAIR H'm-m , h'm-m , hah ! Lights cigarette . Now go ahead . Tell me all the scandal . I 'm just crazy to know . MURDOCK There 's nothing to tell . I have n't been able to find work , that is all , and I 'm short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , with cabs and all that sort of thing , when you 're not working . p. 57 ELFIE ST . CLAIR Yes , you can . I have n't worked in a year . MURDOCK But you do n't understand , dear . I  --  I  --  Well , you know I  --  well , you know  --  I ca n't say what I want . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Oh , yes , you can . You can say anything to me  --  everybody else does . We 've been pals . I know you got along a little faster in the business than I did . The chorus was my limit , and you went into the legitimate thing . But we got our living just the same way . I did n't suppose there was any secret between you and me about that . MURDOCK I know there was n't then , Elfie , but I tell you I 'm different now . I do n't want to do that sort of thing , and I 've been very unlucky . This has been a terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get an engagement . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well , you ca n't get on this way . Wo n't Pauses , knocking ashes off cigarette to cover hesitation . Brockton help you out ? MURDOCK What 's the use of talking to you Rises and crosses to fireplace . , Elfie ; you do n't understand . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Puffing deliberately on cigarette and crossing her legs in almost a masculine attitude . No ? Why do n't I understand ? p. 58 MURDOCK Because you ca n't ; you 've never felt as I have . ELFIE ST . CLAIR How do you know ? MURDOCK Turningimpatiently . Oh , what 's the use of explaining ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR You know , Laura , I 'm not much on giving advice , but you make me sick . I thought you 'd grown wise . A young girl just butting into this business might possibly make a fool of herself , but you ought to be on to the game and make the best of it . MURDOCK Going over to her angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk that sort of stuff to me , please do n't . I was West this summer . I met someone , a real man , who did me a whole lot of good ,  --  a man who opened my eyes to a different way of going along  --  a man who  --  Oh , well , what 's the use ? You do n't know  --  you do n't know . Sits on bed . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Throws cigarette into fireplace . I do n't know , do n't I ? I do n't know , I suppose , that when I came to this town from up state ,  --  a little burg named Oswego ,  --  and joined a chorus , that I did n't fall in love with just such a man . I suppose I do n't know that then I was the best-looking girl in New York , and everybody talked about me ? I suppose I do n't know that there were men , all ages and with all kinds of money , ready to give me anything for the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do it , did I ? For three years I stuck by this good man who was to lead me in a good way toward a good life . And all the time I was getting older , never quite so pretty one day as I had been the day before . I never knew then what it was to be tinkered with by hair-dressers and manicures or a hundred and one of those other people who make you look good . I did n't have to have them then . Rises , crosses to right of table , facing LAURA . Well , you know , Laura , what happened . p. 59 MURDOCK Was n't it partly your fault , Elfie ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Speaking across table angrily . Was it my fault that time made me older and I took on a lot of flesh ? Was it my fault that the work and the life took out the colour , and left the make-up ? Was it my fault that other pretty young girls came along , just as I 'd come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it my fault the cabs were n't waiting any more and people did n't talk about how pretty I was ? And was it my fault when he finally had me alone , and just because no one else wanted me , he got tired and threw me flat  --  cold flat Brings hand down on table.  --  and I 'd been on the dead level with him ! With almost a sob , crosses up to bureau , powders nose , comes down back of table . It almost broke my heart . Then I made up my mind to get even and get all I could out of the game . Jerry came along . He was a has-been and I was on the road to be . He wanted to be good to me , and I let him . That 's all . MURDOCK Still , I do n't see how you can live that way . Lies on bed ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well , you did , and you did n't kick . MURDOCK Yes , but things are different with me now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . p. 60 ELFIE ST . CLAIR No . I 've had all the romance I want , and I 'll stake you to all your love affairs . Crosses back of bed , touches picture over bed . I am out to gather in as much coin as I can in my own way , so when the old rainy day comes along I 'll have a little change to buy myself an umbrella . MURDOCK Rising and angrily crossing to armchair . What did you come here for ? Why ca n't you leave me alone when I 'm trying to get along ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Because I want to help you . MURDOCK During speech crosses to up-stage side of bed , angrily tosses quilt to floor and sits on bed in tears . You ca n't help me . I 'm all right  --  I tell you I am . What do you care anyway ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Sits on bed , crosses down stage to lower left side of bed , sits facing LAURA . But I do care . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlady and living up here on a side street with a lot of cheap burlesque people . Why , the room 's cold LAURA rises , crosses to window. , and there 's no hot water , and you 're beginning to look shabby . You have n't got a job  --  chances are you wo n't have one . What does Indicating picture on bed with thumb. this fellow out there do for you ? Send you long letters of condolences ? That 's what I used to get . When I wanted to buy a new pair of shoes or a silk petticoat , he told me how much he loved me ; so I had the other ones re-soled and turned the old petticoat . And look at you , you 're beginning to show it . She surveys her carefully . I do believe there are lines coming in your face LAURA crosses to dresser quickly , picks up hand mirror , and looks at herself. , and you hide in the house because you 've nothing new to wear . p. 61 MURDOCK Puts down mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got what you have n't got . I may have to hide my clothes , but I do n't have to hide my face . And you with that man  --  he 's old enough to be your father  --  a toddling dote hanging on your apron-strings . I do n't see how you dare show your face to a decent woman . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Rises . You do n't !  --  but you did once and I never caught you hanging your head . You say he 's old . I know he 's old , but he 's good to me . He 's making what 's left of my life pleasant . You think I like him . I do n't ,  --  sometimes I hate him  --  but he understands ; and you can bet your life his check is in my mail every Saturday night or there 's a new lock on the door Sunday morning . Crossing to fireplace . MURDOCK How can you say such things to me ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Crosses to left end of table . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lost all that precious virtue women gab about . When you 've got the name , I say get the game . MURDOCK You can go now , Elfie , and do n't come back . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Gathering up muff , &amp;c . All right , if that 's the way you want it to be , I 'm sorry . A knock on the door . p. 62 MURDOCK Controlling herself after a moment 's hesitation . Come in ANNIE enters with a note , crosses , and hands it to LAURA . ANNIE Mis ' Farley sent dis , Miss Laura . LAURA takes the note and reads it . She is palpably annoyed . MURDOCK There 's no answer . ANNIE She tol ' me not to leave until Ah got an answah . MURDOCK You must ask her to wait . ANNIE She wants an answah . MURDOCK Tell her I 'll be right down  --  that it will be all right . ANNIE But , Miss Laura , she tol ' me to get an answah . Exit reluctantly . MURDOCK Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of your being here . Standing near door . ELFIE ST . CLAIR How ? MURDOCK She wants money  --  three weeks ' room-rent . I presume she thought you 'd give it to me . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Huh ! Moves to left . p. 63 MURDOCK Crossing to table . Elfie , I 've been a little cross ; I did n't mean it . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well ? MURDOCK Could  --  could you lend me thirty-five dollars until I get to work ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Me ? MURDOCK Yes . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Lend you thirty-five dollars ? MURDOCK Yes ; you 've got plenty of money to spare . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well , you certainly have got a nerve . MURDOCK You might give it to me . I have n't a dollar in the world , and you pretend to be such a friend to me ! ELFIE ST . CLAIR Turning and angrily speaking across table . So that 's the kind of woman you are , eh ? A moment ago you were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent enough to associate with you . You know how I live . You know how I get my money  --  the same way you got most of yours . And now that you 've got this spasm of goodness I 'm not fit to be in your room ; but you 'll take my money to pay your debts . You 'll let me go out and do this sort of thing for your benefit , while you try to play the grand lady . I 've got your number now , Laura . Where in hell is your virtue anyway ? You can go to the devil  --  rich , poor , or any other way . I 'm off ! ELFIE rushes toward door ; for a moment LAURA stands speechless , then bursts into hysterics. p. 64 MURDOCK Elfie ! Elfie ! Do n't go now ! Do n't leave me now ! ELFIE hesitates with hand on door-knob . I ca n't stand it . I ca n't be alone . Do n't go , please ; do n't go . LAURA falls into ELFIE 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demeanour changes and she melts into the tenderest womanly sympathy , trying her best to express herself in her crude way . ELFIE ST . CLAIR There , old girl , do n't cry , do n't cry . You just sit down here and let me put my arms around you . ELFIE leads LAURA over to armchair , places muff , &amp;c. , in chair , and sits LAURA down in chair . ELFIE sits on right arm of chair with her left arm behind LAURA ; hugs LAURA to her . LAURA in tears and sobbing during scene . I 'm awful sorry  --  on the level , I am . I should n't have said it . I know that . But I 've got feelings too , even if folks do n't give me credit for it . MURDOCK I know , Elfie . I 've gone through about all I can stand . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well , I should say you have  --  and more than I would . Anyway a good cry never hurts any woman . I have one myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Perhaps what you said was true . p. 65 ELFIE ST . CLAIR We wo n't talk about it . Wiping LAURA 'S eyes and kissing her . MURDOCK With persistence . But perhaps it was true , and , Elfie  --  ELFIE ST . CLAIR Yes . MURDOCK I think I 've stood this just as long as I can . Every day is a living horror . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Looking around room . It 's the limit . MURDOCK I 've got to have money to pay the rent . I 've pawned everything I have , except the clothes on my back . ELFIE ST . CLAIR I 'll give you all the money you need , dearie . Great heavens , do n't worry about that . Do n't you care if I got sore and  --  and lost my head . MURDOCK No ; I ca n't let you do that . Rises ; crosses to table . You may have been mad ,  --  awfully mad ,  --  but what you said was the truth . I ca n't take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLAIR Oh , forget that . Rises , crosses to centre . MURDOCK Maybe  --  maybe if he knew all about it  --  the suffering  --  he would n't blame me. p. 66 ELFIE ST . CLAIR Who  --  the good man who wanted to lead you to the good life without even a bread-basket for an advance-agent ? Huh ! MURDOCK Still he does n't know how desperately poor I am . ELFIE ST . CLAIR He knows you 're out of work , do n't he ? MURDOCK Turning to ELFIE . Not exactly . I 've let him think that I 'm getting along all right . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Then you 're a chump . Has n't he sent you anything ? MURDOCK He has n't anything to send . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well , what does he think you 're going to live on ?  --  asphalt croquettes with conversation sauce ? MURDOCK I do n't know  --  I do n't know . Sobbing . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Crosses to LAURA , puts arms around her . Do n't be foolish , dearie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody who 'll be good to you and get you out of this mess . MURDOCK You mean Will Brockton ? Looking up . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Yes . MURDOCK Do you know where he is ? p. 67 ELFIE ST . CLAIR Yes . MURDOCK Well ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR You wo n't get sore again if I tell you , will you ? MURDOCK No  --  why ? Rises . ELFIE ST . CLAIR He 's downstairs  --  waiting in the car . I promised to tell him what you said . MURDOCK Then it was all planned , and  --  and  --  ELFIE ST . CLAIR Now , dearie , I knew you were up against it , and I wanted to bring you two together . He 's got half of the Burgess shows , and if you 'll only see him everything will be fixed . MURDOCK When does he want to see me ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Now . MURDOCK Here ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Yes . Shall I tell him to come up ? MURDOCK After a long pause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELFIE ST . CLAIR Suddenly become animated . Now you 're a sensible dear . I 'll bet he 's half frozen down there . Goes to door . I 'll send him up . Look at you , Laura , you 're a sight . Crosses to LAURA , takes her by hand , leads her up to washstand , takes towel and wipes LAURA 'S eyes . It 'll never do to have him see you looking like this ; come over here and let me fix your eyes . Now , Laura , I want you to promise me you wo n't do any more crying . Leads LAURA over to dresser , takes powder-puff and powders LAURA 'S face . Come over here and let me powder your nose . Now when he comes up you tell him he has got to blow us all off to a dinner to-night at Martin 's , seven-thirty . Let me look at you . Now you 're all right . After daubing LAURA 'S face with the rouge paw , ELFIE takes LAURA 'S face in her hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't forget . I 'll be there . Crosses to armchair , gathers up muff , &amp;c . So long . Exit . After ELFIE 'S exit LAURA crosses slowly to wardrobe , pulls off picture of JOHN ; crosses to dresser , takes picture of JOHN from there ; carries both pictures over to bed ; kneels on bed , pulls down picture at head of bed ; places all three pictures under pillow . WILL is heard coming upstairs , and knocks . p. 68 MURDOCK Come in . WILL enters . His dress is that of a man of business , the time being about February . He is well groomed and brings with him the impression of easy luxury . BROCKTON As he enters . Hello , Laura . There is an obvious embarrassment on the part of each of them . She rises , goes to him and extends her hand . MURDOCK I 'm  --  I 'm glad to see you , Will . BROCKTON Thank you . MURDOCK Wo n't you sit down ? BROCKTON Regaining his ease of manner . Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; removes overcoat and places it on back of armchair ; sits in armchair . MURDOCK Sits right of table . It 's rather cold out , is n't it ? BROCKTON Just a bit sharp . MURDOCK You came with Elfie in the car ? BROCKTON She picked me up at Martin 's ; we lunched there . MURDOCK By appointment ? BROCKTON I 'd asked her . p. 69 MURDOCK Well ? BROCKTON Well , Laura . MURDOCK She told you ? BROCKTON Not a great deal . What do you want to tell me ? MURDOCK Very simply , and avoiding his glance . Will , I 'm ready to come back . BROCKTON With an effort concealing his sense of triumph and satisfaction . Rises crosses to LAURA . I 'm mighty glad of that , Laura . I 've missed you like the very devil . MURDOCK Do we  --  do we have to talk it over much ? Crosses to left of table in front of bed . BROCKTON Not at all unless you want to . I understand  --  in fact , I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always did . I did n't Crosses and sits right of table . BROCKTON It will be just the same as it was before , you know . MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON I did n't think it was possible for me to miss anyone the way I have you . I 've been lonely . MURDOCK That 's nice in you to say that . p. 70 BROCKTON You 'll have to move out of here right away . Crossing to back of table , surveying room . This place is enough to give one the colly-wabbles . If you 'll be ready to-morrow I 'll send my man over to help you take care of the luggage . MURDOCK To-morrow will be all right , thank you . BROCKTON And you 'll need some money in the meantime . I 'll leave this here . He takes a roll of bills and places it on the bureau . MURDOCK You seem to have come prepared . Did Elfie and you plan this all out ? BROCKTON Not planned  --  just hoped . I think you 'd better go to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on up-stage side of bed . MURDOCK Will , we 'll always be frank . I said I was ready to go . It 's up to you  --  when and where . BROCKTON The hotel scheme is the best , but , Laura  --  MURDOCK Yes ? BROCKTON You 're quite sure this is in earnest . You do n't want to change ? You 've time enough now . MURDOCK I 've quite made up my mind . It 's final . BROCKTON If you want to work , Burgess has a nice part for you . I 'll telephone and arrange if you say so . p. 71 MURDOCK Thanks . Say I 'll see him in the morning . BROCKTON And , Laura , you know when we were in Denver , and  --  MURDOCK Rises hurriedly ; crosses right . Please , please , do n't speak of it . BROCKTON I 'm sorry , but I 've got to . I told Rises , and crosses to left . Madison LAURA turns her head.  --  pardon me , but I must do this  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the truth . Before we go any further I 'd like you to do that now . MURDOCK Say good-bye ? Turns to WILL . BROCKTON Just that . MURDOCK I would n't know how to begin . It will hurt him awfully deeply . BROCKTON It 'll be worse if you do n't . He 'll like you for telling him . It would be honest , and that is what he expects . MURDOCK Must I  --  now ? BROCKTON I think you should . MURDOCK Goes to table and sits down . How shall I begin , Will ? BROCKTON Standing back of table . You mean you do n't know what to say ? p. 72 MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON Then I 'll dictate . MURDOCK I 'll do just as you say . You 're the one to tell me now . BROCKTON Address it the way you want to . She complies . I 'm going to be pretty brutal . In the long run I think that is best , do n't you ? MURDOCK It 's up to you . BROCKTON Ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say can be expressed in one word , ' good-bye . ' I shall not tell you where I 've gone , but remind you of what Brockton told you the last time he saw you . He is here now Pause. , dictating this letter . What I am doing is voluntary  --  my own suggestion . Do n't grieve . Be happy and successful . I do not love you "  --  She puts pen down ; looks at him . MURDOCK Will  --  please . BROCKTON It has got to go just that way  --  " I do not love you . " Sign it " Laura . " She does it . Fold it , put it in an envelope  --  seal it  --  address it . Now shall I mail it ? MURDOCK No . If you do n't mind I 'd sooner . It 's a sort of a last  --  last message . p. 73 BROCKTON Crosses to armchair ; gets coat , puts it on . All right . You 're a little upset now , and I 'm going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-thirty . There 'll be a party . Of course you 'll come . Gets hat and cane . MURDOCK I do n't think I can . You see  --  BROCKTON I know . I guess there 's enough there Indicating money. for your immediate needs . Later you can straighten things up . Shall I send the car ? MURDOCK Yes , please . BROCKTON Good . It will be the first happy evening I 've had in a long , long time . You 'll be ready ? Approaches and bends over her as if to caress her . MURDOCK Shrinking away . Please do n't . Remember we do n't dine until seven-thirty . BROCKTON All right . Exit . For a moment LAURA sits silent , and then angrily rises , crosses up to dresser , gets alcohol lamp , crosses to table with lamp , lights same , and starts back to dresser . Knock at door . MURDOCK Come in . ANNIE enters , and stops . That you , Annie ? p. 74 ANNIE Yassum . MURDOCK Mrs. Farley wants her rent . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take it to her . ANNIE goes to the table , examines the roll of bills and is palpably surprised . ANNIE Dey ai n't nothin ' heah , Miss Laura , but five great big one hunderd dollah bills . MURDOCK Take two . And look in that upper drawer . You 'll find some pawn tickets there . ANNIE complies . ANNIE Yassum . Aside . Dat 's real money  --  dem 's yellowbacks sure . MURDOCK Take the two top ones and go get my lace gown and one of the hats . The ticket is for a hundred and ten dollars . Keep ten for yourself , and hurry . ANNIE Aside . Ten for myself  --  I never see so much money . To LAURA , her astonishment nearly overcoming her . Yassum , Miss Laura , yassum . She goes toward door , and then turns to LAURA . Ah 'm so mighty glad yo ' out all yo ' trouble , Miss Laura . I says to Mis ' Farley now  --  MURDOCK Snapping her off . Do n't  --  do n't . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANNIE turns sullenly and walks toward the door . At that moment LAURA sees the letter , which she has thrown on the table . Wait a minute . I want you to mail a letter . By this time her hair is half down , hanging loosely over her shoulders . Her waist is open at the throat , collar off , and she has the appearance of a woman 's untidiness when she is at that particular stage of her toilet . Hands letter to ANNIE , but snatches it away as ANNIE turns to go . She glances at the letter long and wistfully , and her nerve fails her . Never mind . p. 75 ANNIE exits . Slowly LAURA puts the letter over the flame of the alcohol lamp and it ignites . As it burns she holds it in her fingers , and when half consumed throws it into waste-jar , sits on side of bed watching letter burn , then lies down across bed on her elbows , her chin in her hands , facing audience . As the last flicker is seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scene is at BROCKTON 'S apartment in a hotel such as is not over particular concerning the relations of its tenants . There are a number of these hotels throughout the theatre district of New York , and as a rule , one will find them usually of the same type . The room in which this scene is placed is that of the general living-room in one of the handsomest apartments in the building . The prevailing colour is green , and there is nothing particularly gaudy about the general furnishings . They are in good taste , but without the variety of arrangement and ornamentation which would naturally obtain in a room occupied by people a bit more particular concerning their surroundings . Down stage is a table about three feet square which can be used not only as a general centre-table , but also for service while the occupants are eating . There is a breakfast service on this table , and also a tray and stand behind it . There is a chair at either side of the table , and at right coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five degrees , and this space is largely taken up by a large doorway . This is equipped with sliding-door and hung with green portires , which are handsome and in harmony with the general scheme of the furnishings of the room . This entrance is to the sleeping-room of the apartments . At the back of the stage is a large window or alcove . The window is on the ordinary plan , and the view through it shows the back of another building of New York , presumably a hotel of about the same character . Green partires are also hung on the windows . Down left is the entrance to the corridor of the hotel , and this must be so arranged that it works with a latch-key and opens upon a small hallway , which separates the apartment from the main hallway . This is necessary as the action calls for the slamming of a door , and later the opening of the direct and intimate door of the apartment with a latch-key . Left of centre is a sofa , and there is a general arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the right portire is hung , is a long , full-length mirror , such as women dress by . Against wall is a lady 's fancy dresser . To the immediate left of the sliding-doors , which go into the sleeping-apartment , is a lady 's small writing-desk , with a drawer on the right-hand side , in which is a pearl-handled 32-calibre revolver . The front of the desk is open at rise . On top of the desk is a desk lamp and a large box of candy ; inside the desk is writing material , &amp;c . In pigeon-hole left there is a small photo and frame , which ANNIE places on the table when she removes the breakfast set . In front of centre window in alcove is a small table on which is a parlour lamp , and some newspapers , including the " New York Sun . " On the floor running between the desk and table is a large fur rug . In front of the table is a small gilt chair ; in front of desk there is also a small gilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is a bundle of music-rolls . In place , ready to play , is a roll of a negro tune called " Bon-Bon Buddie , My Chocolate Drop . " On top of the piano , in addition to the music-rolls , are a fancy lamp , a large basket of chrysanthemums , and two photos in frames , at the upper corner . Standing on the floor is a large piano lamp . On the sofa are cushions , and thrown over its back is a lady 's opera-coat . On the sofa are also a fan and some small dinner favours . On the dresser are a lady 's silver toilet set , including power boxes , rouge boxes , manicuring implements , and a small plush black cat that might have been a favour at some time . Two little dolls hang on the side of the glass of the dresser , which also might have been favours . These are used later in the action , and are necessary . AT RISE . When the curtain rises on this scene it is noticeable that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , after having dined , not wisely , but too well . In the alcove is a man 's dress-coat and vest thrown on the cushions in a most careless manner ; a silk hat badly rumpled is near it . Over the top of sofa is an opera-cloak , and hung on the mirror is a huge hat , of the evening type , such as women would pay handsomely for . A pair of gloves is thrown on top of the pier-glass . The curtains in the bay-window are half drawn , and the light shades are half drawn down the windows , so that when the curtain goes up the place is in a rather dim light . On the table are the remains of a breakfast , which is served in a box-like tray such as is used in hotels . LAURA is discovered sitting at right of table , her hair a bit untidy . She has on a very expensive neglige gown . WILL , in a business suit , is at the other side of the table , and both have evidently just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sip their coffee . LAURA is intent in the scanning of her " Mornign Telegraph , " while WILL is deep in the market reports of the " Journal of Commerce , " and in each instance these things must be made apparent . WILL throws down the paper rather impatiently . BROCKTON Have you seen the Sun , Laura ? p. 77 MURDOCK No . BROCKTON Where is it ? MURDOCK I do n't know . BROCKTON In a loud voice . Annie , Annie ! A pause . Annie ! In an undertone , half directed to LAURA . Where the devil is that nigger ? MURDOCK Why , I suppose she 's at breakfast . BROCKTON Well , she ought to be here . MURDOCK Did it ever occur to you that she has got to eat just the same as you have ? BROCKTON She 's your servant , is n't she ? MURDOCK My maid . BROCKTON Well , what have you got her for ,  --  to eat or to wait on you ? Annie ! MURDOCK Do n't be so cross . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROCKTON pours out one half glass of water from bottle . MURDOCK I will get it for you . Rather wearily she gets up and goes to the table , where there are other morning papers ; she takes the " Sun , " hands it to him , goes back to her seat , re-opens the " Morning Telegraph . " There is a pause . ANNIE enters from the sleeping-room. p. 78 ANNIE Do yuh want me , suh ? BROCKTON Yes , I did want you , but do n't now . When I 'm at home I have a man to look after me , and I get what I want . MURDOCK For heaven 's sake , Will , have a little patience . If you like your man so well , you had better live at home , but do n't come around here with a grouch and bulldoze everybody . BROCKTON Do n't think for a moment that there 's much to come around here for . Annie , this room 's stuffy . ANNIE Yassuh . BROCKTON Draw those portires . Let those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a little light . Take away these clothes and hide them . Do n't you know that a man does n't want to see the next morning anything to remind him of the night before . Make the place look a little respectable . In the meantime ANNIE scurries around , picking up the coat and vest , opera-cloak , &amp;c. , as rapidly as possible , and throwing them over her arm without any idea of order . It is very apparent that she is rather fearful of the anger of WILL while he is in this mood . BROCKTON Looking at her . Be careful . You 're not taking the wash off the line . p. 79 ANNIE Yassuh . Exit in confusion . MURDOCK Laying down paper and looking at WILL . Well , I must say you 're rather amiable this morning . BROCKTON I feel like hell . MURDOCK Market unsatisfactory ? BROCKTON No ; head too big . He lights a cigar ; as he takes a puff he makes an awful face . Tastes like punk . Puts cigar into cup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut out those parties . I ca n't do those things any more . I 'm not as young as I was , and in the morning it makes me sick . How do you feel ? MURDOCK A little tired , that 's all . Rises , and crosses to bureau . BROCKTON You did n't touch anything ? MURDOCK No . BROCKTON I guess you 're on the safe side . It was a great old party , though , was n't it ? MURDOCK Did you think so ? BROCKTON Oh , for that sort of a blow-out . Not too rough , but just a little easy . I like them at night and I hate them in the morning . He picks up the paper and commences to glance it over in a casual manner , not interrupting his conversation . Were you bored ? p. 80 MURDOCK Yes ; always at things like that . BROCKTON Well , you do n't have to go . MURDOCK You asked me . BROCKTON Still , you could say no . LAURA picks up paper , puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you asked me . BROCKTON What did you go for if you did n't want to ? MURDOCK You wanted me to . BROCKTON I do n't quite get you . MURDOCK Well , Will , you have all my time when I 'm not in the theatre , and you can do with it just what you please . You pay for it . I 'm working for you . BROCKTON Is that all I 've got ,  --  just your time ? MURDOCK Wearily . That and the rest . LAURA crosses up to desk , gets " part , " crosses to sofa , turning pages of " part . " I guess you know . Crosses to sofa and sits . BROCKTON Looking at her curiously . Down in the mouth , eh ? I 'm sorry . MURDOCK No , only if you want me to be frank , I 'm a little tired . You may not believe it , but I work awfully hard over at the theatre . Burgess will tell you that . I know I 'm not so very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAURA lies down on sofa . I 'd like to succeed , myself . They 're very patient with me . Of course they 've got to be ,  --  that 's another thing you 're paying for , but I do n't seem to get along except this way . p. 81 BROCKTON Oh , do n't get sentimental . If you 're going to bring up that sort of talk , Laura , do it sometime when I have n't got a hang-over , and then do n't forget talk never does count for much . LAURA crosses up to mirror , picks up hat from box , puts it on , looks in mirror . She turns around and looks at him steadfastly for a minute . During this entire scene , from the time the curtain rises , she must in a way indicate a premonition of an approaching catastrophe , a feeling , vague but nevertheless palpable , that something is going to happen . She must hold this before her audience so that she can show to them , without showing to him , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-sacrifice during her struggle , and she has weakly surrendered and is unable to go back , but that brief period of self-abnegation has shown to her most clearly the rottenness of the other sort of living . There are enough sentimentality and emotion in her character to make it impossible for her to accept this manner of existence as ELFIE does . Hers is not a nature of careless candour , but of dreamy ideals and better living , warped , handicapped , disillusioned , and destroyed by a weakness that finds its principal force in vanity . WILL resumes his newspaper in a more attentive way . The girl looks at him and expresses in pantomine , by the slightest gesture or shrug of the shoulders , her growing distaste for him and his way of living . In the meantime WILL is reading the paper rather carefully . He stops suddenly and then looks at his watch . p. 82 MURDOCK What time is it ? BROCKTON After ten . MURDOCK Oh . WILL at this moment particularly reads some part of the paper , turns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then for a very short moment evidently settles in his mind a cross-examination . He has read in this paper a despatch from Chicago , which speaks of JOHN MADISON having arrived there as a representative of a big Western mining syndicate which is going to open large operations in the Nevada gold-fields , and representing MR . MADISON as being on his way to New York with sufficient capital to enlist more , and showing him to be now a man of means . The attitude of LAURA and the coincidence of the despatch bring back to WILL the scene in Denver , and later in New York , and with that subtle intuition of the man of the world he connects the two . BROCKTON I do n't suppose , Laura , that you 'd be interested now in knowing anything about that young fellow out in Colorado ? What was his name  --  Madison ? MURDOCK Do you know anything ? BROCKTON No , nothing particularly . I 've been rather curious to know how he came out . He was a pretty fresh young man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's doing and how he 's getting along . I do n't suppose by any chance you have ever heard from him ? p. 83 MURDOCK No , no ; I 've never heard . Crosses to bureau . BROCKTON I presume he never replied to that letter you wrote ? MURDOCK No . BROCKTON It would be rather queer , eh , if this young fellow should Looks at paper. happen to come across a lot of money  --  not that I think he ever could , but it would be funny , would n't it ? MURDOCK Yes , yes ; it would be unexpected . I hope he does . It might make him happy . BROCKTON Think he might take a trip East and see you act . You know you 've got quite a part now . MURDOCK Impatiently . I wish you would n't discuss this . Why do you mention it now ? Crossing to right of table . Is it because you were drinking last night and lost your sense of delicacy ? You once had some consideration for me . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all that I can . Please , please , do n't hurt me any more than you can help . That 's all I ask . Crossing up to mirror . Crosses back to right of table ; sits . BROCKTON Well , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean that , Laura . I guess I am feeling a little bad to-day . Really , I do n't want to hurt your feelings , my dear . He gets up , goes to her , puts his hands on her shoulders , and his cheek close to the back of her head . She bends forward and shudders a little bit . It is very easy to see that the life she is leading is becoming intolerable to her . p. 84 BROCKTON You know , dearie , I do a lot for you because you 've always been on the level with me . I 'm sorry I hurt you , but there was too much wine last night and I 'm all upset . Forgive me . LAURA , in order to avoid his caresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , and she is looking straight outward with a cold , impassive expression . WILL regards her silently for a moment . Really in the man 's heart there is an affection , and really he wants to try to comfort her ; but he seems to realize that she has slipped away from the old environment and conditions , and that he simply bought her back ; that he has n't any of her affection , even with his money ; that she evinces toward him none of the old camaraderie ; and it hurts him , as those things always hurt a selfish man , inclining him to be brutal and inconsiderate . WILL crosses to centre , and stands reading paper ; bell rings ; a pause and second bell . WILL seizes upon this excuse to go up-stage and over towards the door . BROCKTON After second bell . Damn that bell . He continues on his way ; he opens the door , leaves it open , and passes on to the outer door , which he opens . LAURA remains immovable and impassive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He comes in , slamming the outer door with effect , which one must have at this point of the play , because it is essential to a situation coming later . Enters the room , closes the door , and holds in his hand a telegram . Looks from newspaper to telegram . p. 85 BROCKTON A wire . MURDOCK For me ? BROCKTON Yes . MURDOCK From whom , I wonder . Perhaps Elfie with a luncheon engagement . BROCKTON Handing telegram to her . I do n't know . Here . Pause ; he faces her , looking at her . She opens it quickly . She reads it and , as she does , gasps quickly with an exclamation of fear and surprise . This is what the despatch says ( it is dated at Buffalo and addressed to LAURA ) : " I will be in New York before noon . I 'm coming to marry you and I 'm coming with a bank-roll . I wanted to keep it secret and have a big surprise for you , but I ca n't hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a new top . Do n't go out , and be ready for the big matrimonial thing . All my love . John . " BROCKTON No bad news , I hope ? MURDOCK Walking up stage rather hurriedly . No , no  --  not bad news . BROCKTON I thought you were startled . MURDOCK No , not at all . BROCKTON Looking at paper about where he had left off . From Elfie ? Crosses to , and sits in armchair . p. 86 MURDOCK No , just a friend . BROCKTON Oh ! He makes himself rather comfortable in the chair , and LAURA regards him for a moment form up stage as if trying to figure out how to get rid of him . MURDOCK Wo n't you be rather late getting down town , Will ? BROCKTON Does n't make any difference . I do n't feel much like the office now . Thought I might order the car and take a spin through the park . The cold air will do me a lot of good . Like to go ? MURDOCK No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said so last night . Crosses to sofa , and stands . BROCKTON No hurry . Do you  --  er  --  want to get rid of me ? MURDOCK Why should I ? BROCKTON Expecting someone ? MURDOCK No  --  not exactly . Crosses up to window . BROCKTON If you do n't mind , I 'll stay here . Lets curtain fly up . MURDOCK Just as you please . A pause . Crosses to piano ; plays . Will ? BROCKTON Yes . p. 87 MURDOCK How long does it take to come from Buffalo ? BROCKTON Depends on the train you take . MURDOCK About how long ? BROCKTON Between eight and ten hours , I think . Some one coming ? MURDOCK Do you know anything about the trains ? BROCKTON Not much . Why do n't you find out for yourself ? Have Annie get the time-table ? MURDOCK I will . Annie ! Annie ! Rises from piano . ANNIE appears at doorway . ANNIE Yassum ! MURDOCK Go ask one of the hall-boys to bring me a New York Central time-table . ANNIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAURA sits on left arm of sofa . BROCKTON Then you do expect someone , eh ? MURDOCK Only one of the girls who used to be in the same company with me . But I 'm not sure that she 's coming here . BROCKTON Then the wire was from her ? MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON Did she say what train she was coming on ? p. 88 MURDOCK No . BROCKTON Well , there are a lot of trains . About what time did you expect her in ? MURDOCK She did n't say . BROCKTON Do I know her ? MURDOCK I think not . I met her while I worked in ' Frisco . BROCKTON Oh ! Resumes his paper . ANNIE renters with a time-table and hands it to LAURA . MURDOCK Thanks ; take those breakfast things away , Annie . Sits on sofa . ANNIE complies ; takes them across stage , opens the door leading to the corridor , exits . LAURA in the meantime is studying the time-table . MURDOCK I ca n't make this out . BROCKTON Give it here ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of table , sits opposite WILL , and hands him the time-table . He takes it and handles it as if he were familiar with it . BROCKTON Where is she coming from ? MURDOCK The West ; the telegram was from Buffalo . I suppose she was on her way when she sent it . p. 89 BROCKTON There 's train comes in here at 9:30  --  that 's the Twentieth Century ,  --  that does n't carry passengers from Buffalo ; then there 's one at 11:41 ; one at 1:49 ; another at 3:45 ; another at 5:40 ; and another at 5:48  --  that 's the Lake Shore Limited , a fast train ; and all pass through Buffalo . Did you think of meeting her ? MURDOCK No . She 'll come here when she arrives . BROCKTON Knows where you live ? MURDOCK She has the address . BROCKTON Ever been to New York before ? MURDOCK I think not . BROCKTON Passing her the time-table . Well , that 's the best I can do for you . MURDOCK Thank you . Crosses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . LAURA looks at clock . By George , this is funny . MURDOCK What ? BROCKTON Speak of the devil , you know . MURDOCK Who ? BROCKTON Your old friend Madison . MURDOCK Utters a slight exclamation and makes an effort to control herself . What  --  what about him ? p. 90 BROCKTON He 's been in Chicago . MURDOCK How do you know ? BROCKTON Here 's a despatch about him . MURDOCK Coming quickly over to him , looks over his shoulder . What  --  where  --  what 's it about ? BROCKTON Well , I 'm damned if he has n't done what he said he 'd do  --  see ! Holds the paper so that she can see . LAURA takes paper . He 's been in Chicago , and is on his way to New York . He 's struck it rich in Nevada and is coming with a lot of money . Queer , is n't it ? LAURA puts paper on table . Did you know anything about it ? Lights cigarette . MURDOCK No , no ; nothing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? MURDOCK Yes , yes ; it 's very nice . BROCKTON Too bad he could n't get this a little sooner , eh , Laura ? MURDOCK Oh , I do n't know  --  I do n't think it 's too bad . What makes you ask ? BROCKTON Oh , nothing . I suppose he ought to be here to-day . Are you going to see him if he looks you up ? p. 91 MURDOCK No , no ; I do n't want to see him . You know that , do n't you , that I do n't want to see him ? What makes you ask these questions ? Crosses to sofa and sits . BROCKTON Just thought you might meet him , that 's all . Do n't get sore about it . MURDOCK I 'm not . She holds the telegram crumpled in one hand . WILL lays down the paper , and regards LAURA curiously . She sees the expression on his face and averts her head in order not to meet his eye . MURDOCK What are you looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was looking at you in any particular way  --  why ? MURDOCK Oh , nothing . I guess I 'm nervous , too . Lies on sofa . BROCKTON I dare say you are . A pause . MURDOCK Yes , I am . WILL crosses to LAURA . BROCKTON You know I do n't want to delve into a lot of past history at this time , but I 've got to talk to you for a moment . MURDOCK Why do n't you do it some other time ? I do n't want to be talked to now . Rises and crosses a little to left . p. 92 BROCKTON But I 've got to do it just the same . MURDOCK Trying to affect an attitude of resigned patience and resignation . Well , what is it ? Resuming seat on sofa BROCKTON You 've always been on the square with me , Laura . That 's why I 've liked you a lot better than the other women . MURDOCK Are you going into all that again now , this morning ? I thought we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow I think that maybe we do n't quite understand each other . MURDOCK In what way ? Turns to WILL . BROCKTON Looking her straight in the eye . That letter I dictated to you the day that you came back to me , and left it for you to mail  --  did you mail it ? MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON You 're quite sure ? MURDOCK Yes , I 'm quite sure . I would n't say so if I was n't . BROCKTON And you did n't know Madison was coming East until you read about it in that newspaper ? MURDOCK No  --  no , I did n't know . p. 93 BROCKTON Have you heard from him ? MURDOCK No  --  no  --  I have n't heard from him . Do n't talk to me about this thing . Why ca n't you leave me alone ? I 'm miserable enough as it is . Crossing to extreme right . BROCKTON Crossing to table . But I 've got to talk to you . Laura , you 're lying to me . MURDOCK What ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're lying to me , and you 've been lying to me , and I 've trusted you . Show me that telegram ! MURDOCK No . BROCKTON Going over towards her . Show me that telegram ! LAURA crosses up to doors leading into bedroom . MURDOCK Tears telegram in half . You 've no right to ask me . BROCKTON Are you going to make me take it away LAURA crosses to window. from you ? I 've Crosses to sofa. never laid my hands on you yet . MURDOCK It 's my business . Crossing to left of sofa , around it on down-stage side . p. 94 BROCKTON Yes , and it 's mine . During scene . Backing away from WILL , who is following her , LAURA backs against bureau . WILL grabs her and attempts to take telegram from her . She has put it in the front of her waist . She slowly draws it out . BROCKTON That telegram 's from Madison . Give it here ! MURDOCK No . BROCKTON I 'm going to find out where I stand . Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you . MURDOCK No . BROCKTON Come on ! MURDOCK I 'll give it to you . Takes telegram out of waist , and hands it to him . He takes it slowly , looking her squarely in the eye . WILL crosses to centre , and does not glance away while he slowly smoothes it out so that it can be read ; when he finally takes it in both hands to read it she staggers back a step or two weakly . BROCKTON Reads the telegram aloud . " I will be in New York before noon . I 'm coming to marry you , and I 'm coming with a bank-roll . I wanted to keep it a secret and have a big surprise for you , but I ca n't hold it any longer , because I feel just like a kid with a new top . Do n't go out , and be ready for the big matrimonial thing . All my love . John . " Then you knew ? p. 95 MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON But you did n't know he was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mail the letter Tossing telegram on table , did you ? MURDOCK No . BROCKTON What did you do with it ? MURDOCK I  --  I burned it . BROCKTON Why ? LAURA is completely overcome and unable to answer . BROCKTON Why ? MURDOCK I  --  I could n't help it  --  I simply could n't help it . BROCKTON So you 've been corresponding all this time . MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON And he does n't know With a gesture around the room , indicating the condition in which they live. about us ? MURDOCK No . BROCKTON Taking a step towards her . By God , I never beat a woman in my life , but I feel as though I could wring your neck . MURDOCK Why do n't you ? You 've done everything else . Why do n't you ? p. 96 BROCKTON Do n't you know that I gave Madison my word that if you came back to me I 'd let him know ? Do n't you know that I like that young fellow , and I wanted to protect him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do you know what you 've done to me ? You 've made me out a liar  --  you 've made me lie to a man  --  a man  --  you understand . What are you going to do now ? Tell me  --  what are you going to do now ? Do n't stand there as if you 've lost your voice  --  how are you going to square me ? MURDOCK I 'm not thinking about squaring you . What am I going to do for him ? BROCKTON Not what you are going to do for him  --  what am I going to do for him . Why , I could n't have that young fellow think that I tricked him into this thing for your or all the rest of the women of your kind on earth . God ! I might have known that you , and the others like you , could n't be square . The girl looks at him dumbly . He glances at his watch , walks up stage , looks out of the window , comes down again , goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've made a nice mess of it , have n't you ? MURDOCK Weakly . There is n't any mess . Please go away . He 'll be here soon . Please let me see him  --  please do that . BROCKTON No , I 'll wait . This time I 'm going to tell him myself , and I do n't care how tough it is. p. 97 MURDOCK Immediately regaining all her vitality . No , you must n't do that . Crossing back of table to centre . Oh , Will , I 'm not offering any excuse . I 'm not saying anything , but I 'm telling you the truth . I could n't give him up  --  I could n't do it . I love him . BROCKTON Huh . Grins ; crosses to front of sofa . MURDOCK Do n't you think so ? I know you ca n't see what I see , but I do . And why ca n't you go away ? Why ca n't you leave me this ? It 's all I ever had . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll take him away . It 's the best for him  --  It 's the best for me . Please go . BROCKTON Why  --  do you think that I 'm going to let you trip him the way you tripped me ? Crosses and sits in armchair . No . I 'm going to stay right here until that young man arrives , and I 'm going to tell him that it was n't my fault . You were to blame . MURDOCK Then you are going to let him know . You 're not going to give me a single , solitary chance ? BROCKTON I 'll give you every chance that you deserve when he knows . Then he can do as he pleases , but there must be no more deception , that 's flat . LAURA crosses and kneels beside WILL 's chair . p. 98 MURDOCK Then you must let me tell him  --  WILL turns away impatiently.  --  yes , you must . If I did n't tell him before , I 'll do it now . you must go . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had any affection  --  if you ever had any friendship , please let me do this now . I want you to go  --  you can come back . Then you 'll see  --  you 'll know  --  only I want to try to make him understand that  --  that maybe if I am weak I 'm not vicious . I want to let him know that I did n't want to do it , but I could n't help it . Just give me the chance to be as good as I can be . WILL gives her a look . Oh , I promise you , I will tell him , and then  --  then I do n't care what happens  --  only he must learn everything from me  --  please  --  please  --  let me do this  --  it 's the last favour I shall ever  --  ever ask of you . Wo n't you ? LAURA breaks down and weeps . BROCKTON Rising , looks at her a moment as if mentally debating the best thing to do . Crosses in front of table ; stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't be unkind . I 'll be back early this afternoon , and just remember , this is the time you 'll have to go right through to the end . Understand ? MURDOCK Yes , I 'll do it ,  --  all of it . Wo n't you please go  --  now ? Crosses ; sits in armchair . p. 99 BROCKTON All right . He exits into the bedroom and immediately enters again with overcoat on his arm and hat in hand ; he goes centre , and turns . I am sorry for you , Laura , but remember you 've got to tell the truth . MURDOCK Who is sitting in a chair looking straight in front of her with a set expression . Please go . WILL exits . LAURA sits in a chair in a state of almost stupefaction , holding this attitude as long as possible . ANNIE enters , and in a characteristic manner begins her task of tidying up the room ; LAURA , without changing her attitude , and staring straight in front of her , her elbows between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie ! ANNIE Yassum . MURDOCK Do you remember in the boarding-house  --  when we finally packed up  --  what you did with everything ? ANNIE Yassum . MURDOCK You remember that I used to keep a pistol ? ANNIE Yo ' all mean dat one yo ' say dat gemman out West gave yuh once ? MURDOCK Yes . ANNIE Yassum , Ah ' membuh it . p. 100 MURDOCK Where is it now ? ANNIE Crosses to writing-desk . Last Ah saw of it was in dis heah draw ' in de writin ' - desk . This speech takes her across to desk ; she opens the drawer , fumbles among a lot of old papers , letters , &amp;c. , and finally produces a small thirty-two calibre , and gingerly crosses to LAURA . Is dis it ? MURDOCK Slowly turns around and looks at it . Yes . Put it back . I thought perhaps it was lost . ANNIE complies , when the bell rings . LAURA starts suddenly , involuntarily gathering her neglige gown closer to her figure , and at once she is under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to such an extent that she is obliged to put one hand out on to the table to maintain her balance . When she speaks , it is with a certain difficulty of articulation . See  --  who  --  that is  --  and let me know . ANNIE Turning . Yassum . Crosses , opens the first door , and afterwards opens the second door . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Off stage . Hello , Annie ,  --  folks home ? ANNIE Yassum , she 's in . LAURA immediately evinces her tremendous relief , and ELFIE , without waiting for a reply , has shoved ANNIE aside and enters , ANNIE following and closing the door . ELFIE is beautifully gowned in a morning dress with an overabundance of fur trimmings and all the furbelows that would accompany the extravagant raiment generally affected by a woman of that type . ELFIE approaching effusively. p. 101 ELFIE ST . CLAIR Hello , dearie . MURDOCK Hello , Elfie . LAURA crosses and sits on sofa . ELFIE puts muff , &amp;c. , on table . ELFIE ST . CLAIR It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking in mirror . I 've been shopping all morning long ; just blew myself until I 'm broke , that 's all . My goodness , do n't you ever get dressed ? Listen . Crosses left of table to centre . Talk about cinches . I copped out a gown , all ready made , and fits me like the paper on the wall , for $37.80 . Looks like it might have cost $200 . Anyway I had them charge $200 on the bill , and I kept the change . There are two or three more down town there , and I want you to go down and look them over . Models , you know , being sold out . I do n't blame you for not getting up earlier . She sits at the table , not noticing LAURA . That was some party last night . I know you did n't drink a great deal , but gee ! what an awful tide Will had on . How do you feel ? Looks at her critically . What 's the matter , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is this  --  put on your duds and go out for an hour . It 's a perfectly grand day out . My Gaud ! how the sun does shine ! Clear and cold . A pause . Well , much obliged for the conversation . Do n't I get a " Good-morning , " or a " How-dy-do , " or a something of that sort ? p. 102 MURDOCK I 'm tired , Elfie , and blue  --  terribly blue . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Rises ; crosses to LAURA . Well now , you just brace up and cut out all that emotional stuff . I came down to take you for a drive . You 'd like it ; just through the park . Will you go ? MURDOCK Going up stage . Not this morning , dear ; I 'm expecting somebody . ELFIE ST . CLAIR A man ? MURDOCK Finding it almost impossible to suppress a smileNo , a gentleman . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Same thing . Do I know him ? MURDOCK You 've heard of him . At desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't be so mysterious . Who is he ? MURDOCK What is your time , Elfie ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Looks at her watch . Five minutes past eleven . MURDOCK Oh , I 'm slow . I did n't know it was so late . Just excuse me , wo n't you , while I get some clothes on . He may be here any moment . Annie ! She goes up stage towards portires. p. 103 ELFIE ST . CLAIR Who ? MURDOCK I 'll tell you when I get dressed . Make yourself at home , wo n't you , dear ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR I 'd sooner hear . What is the scandal anyway ? MURDOCK As she goes out . I 'll tell you in a moment . Just as soon as Annie gets throuh with me . Exit . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Gets candy-box off desk , crosses , sits on arm of sofa , selecting candy . In a louder voice . Do you know , Laura , I think I 'll go back on the stage . MURDOCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm afraid I 'll have to . I think I need a sort of a boost to my popularity . MURDOCK How a boost , Elfie ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR I think Jerry is getting cold feet . He 's seeing a little too much of me Places candy-box on sofa. nowadays . MURDOCK What makes you think that ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR I think he is getting a relapse of that front-row habit . There 's no use in talking , Laura , it 's a great thing for a girl 's credit when a man like Jerry can take two or three friends to the theatre , and when you make your entrance delicately point to you with his forefinger and say , " The third one from the front on the left belongs to muh . " The old fool 's hanging around some of these musical comedies lately , and I 'm getting a little nervous every time rent day comes . p. 104 MURDOCK Oh , I guess you 'll get along all right , Elfie . ELFIE ST . CLAIR With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; crosses to table , looking in dresser mirror at herself , and giving her hat and hair little touches. , but I like to leave well enough alone , and if I had to make a change right now it would require a whole lot of thought and attention , to say nothing of the inconvenience , and I 'm so nicely settled in my flat . She sees the pianola . Say , dearie , when did you get the piano-player ? I got one of them phonographs Crosses to pianola , tries the levers , &amp;c. , but this has got that beat a city block . How does it work ? What did it cost ? MURDOCK I do n't know . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well , Jerry 's got to stake me to one of these . Looks over the rolls on top . Mumbles to herself . " Tannhauser , William Tell , Chopin . " Then louder . Listen , dear . Ai n't you got anything else except all this high-brow stuff ? MURDOCK What do you want ? ELFIE ST . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks at empty box on pianola . . Oh , here 's one ; just watch me tear this off . The roll is the tune of " Bon-Bon Buddie , My Chocolate Drop . " She starts to play and moves the lever marked " Swell " wide open , increases the tempo , and is pumping with all the delight and enthusiasm of a child . Ai n't it grand ? p. 105 MURDOCK Gracious , Elfie , do n't play so loud . What 's the matter ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR I shoved over that thing marked " Swell . " Stops and turns . Rises ; crosses to centre and stands . I sure will have to speak to Jerry about this . I 'm stuck on that swell thing . Hurry up . LAURA appears . Gee ! you look pale . And then in a tone of sympathy : I 'll just bet you and Will have had a fight , and he always gets the best of you , does n't he , dearie ? LAURA crosses to dresser , and busies herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him trained ? I almost threw Jerry down the stairs the other night and he came right back with a lot of American beauties and a check . I told him if he did n't look out I 'd throw him down-stairs every night . He 's getting too damned independent and it 's got me nervous . Oh , dear , I s'pose I will have to go back on the stage . Sits in armchair . MURDOCK In the chorus ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well , I should say not . I 'm going to give up my musical career . Charlie Burgess is putting on a new play , and he says he has a part in it for me if I want to go back . It is n't much , but very important ,  --  sort of a pantomime part . A lot of people talk about me , and just at the right time I walk across the stage and make an awful hit . I told Jerry that if I went LAURA crosses to sofa , picks up candy-box , puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre. on he 'd have to come across with one of those Irish crochet lace gowns . He fell for it . Do you know , dearie , I think he 'd sell out his business just to have me back on the stage for a couple of weeks , just to give box-parties every night for my en-trance and ex-its. p. 106 MURDOCK Seriously . Elfie ! LAURA takes ELFIE by the hand , and leads her over to sofa . LAURA sits , ELFIE standing . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Yes , dear . MURDOCK Come over here and sit down . ELFIE ST . CLAIR What 's up ? MURDOCK Do you know what I 'm going to ask of you ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR If it 's a touch , you 'll have to wait until next week . Sits opposite LAURA . MURDOCK No : just a little advice . ELFIE ST . CLAIR With a smile . Well , that 's cheap , and Lord knows you need it . What 's happened ? LAURA takes the crumpled and torn telegram that WILL has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The later puts the two pieces together , reads it very carefully , looks up at LAURA about middle of telegram , and lays it down . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well ? MURDOCK Will suspected . There was something in the paper about Mr. Madison  --  the telegram came  --  then we had a row . p. 107 ELFIE ST . CLAIR Serious ? MURDOCK Yes . Do you remember what I told you about that letter  --  the one Will made me write  --  I mean to John  --  telling him what I had done ? ELFIE ST . CLAIR Yes , you burned it . MURDOCK I tried to lie to Will  --  he would n't have it that way . He seemed to know . He was furious . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Did he hit you ? MURDOCK No ; he made me admit that John did n't know , and then he said he 'd stay here and tell himself that I 'd made him lie , and then he said something about liking the other man and wanting to save him . ELFIE ST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MURDOCK I told him if he 'd only go I 'd  --  tell John myself when he came , and now you see I 'm waiting  --  and I 've got to tell  --  and  --  and I do n't know how to begin  --  and  --  and I thought you could help me  --  you seem so sort of resourceful , and it means  --  it means so much to me . If John turned on me now I could n't go back to Will , and , Elfie ,  --  I do n't think I 'd care to  --  stay here any more . ELFIE ST . CLAIR What ! In an awestruck tone , taking LAURA in her arms impulsively . Dearie , get that nonsense out of your head and be sensible . I 'd just like to see any two men who could make me think about  --  well  --  what you seem to have in your mind . p. 108 MURDOCK But I do n't know ; do n't you see , Elfie , I do n't know . If I do n't tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I know John and maybe  --  Elfie , do you know , I think John would kill him . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well , do n't you think anything about that . Now let 's get Rises , crosses to armchair , draws it over a little , sits on left arm. down to cases , and we have n't much time . Business is business , and love is love . You 're long on love and I 'm long on business , and between the two of us we ought to straighten this thing out . Now , evidently John is coming on here to marry you . MURDOCK Yes . ELFIE ST . CLAIR And you love him ? MURDOCK Yes . ELFIE ST . CLAIR And as far as you know the moment that he comes in here it 's quick to the Justice and a big matrimonial thing . MURDOCK Yes , but you see how impossible it is  --  ELFIE ST . CLAIR I do n't see anything impossible . From all you 've said to me about this fellow there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELFIE ST . CLAIR Yes  --  get married quick . You say he has the money and you have the love , and you 're sick of Brockton , and you want to switch and do it in the decent , respectable , conventional way , and he 's going to take you away . Have n't you got sense enough to know that , once you 're married to Mr. Madison , Will Brockton would n't dare go to him , and if he did Madison would n't believe him ? A man will believe a whole lot about his girl , but nothing about his wife . p. 109 MURDOCK Turns and looks at her . There is a long pause . Elfie Rises ; crosses to right of table.  --  I  --  I do n't think I could do like that to John . I do n't think  --  I could deceive him . ELFIE ST . CLAIR You make me sick . The thing to do is to lie to all men . Rises ; pushes chair to table.  --  they all lie to you . Protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this . Now do it . Listen . Touches LAURA to make her sit down ; LAURA sits right of table ; ELFIE sits on right arm of chair left of table , with elbows on table . Do n't you realize that you and me , and all the girls that are shoved into this life , are practically the common prey of any man who happens to come along ? Do n't you know that they 've got about as much consideration for us as they have for any pet animal around the house , and the only way that we 've got it on the animal is that we 've got brains ? This is a game , Laura , not a sentiment . Do you suppose this Madison LAURA turns to ELFIE.  --  now do n't get sore  --  has n't turned these tricks himself before he met you , and I 'll gamble he 's done it since ! A man 's natural trade is a heartbreaking business . Do n't tell me about women breaking men 's hearts . The only thing they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not Will 's business ; he has no right to interfere . You 've been with him  --  yes , and he 's been nice to you ; but I do n't think that he 's given you any the best of it . Now if you want to leave and go your own way and marry any Tom , Dick , or Harry that you want , it 's nobody 's affair but yours . p. 110 MURDOCK But you do n't understand  --  it 's John . I ca n't lie to him . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well , that 's too bad about you . I used to have that truthful habit myself , and the best I ever got was the worst of it . All this talk about love and loyalty and constancy is fine and dandy in a book , but when a girl has to look out for herself , take it from me , whenever you 've got that trump card up your sleeve just play it and rake in the pot . Takes LAURA 'S hand affectionately . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the world I love . MURDOCK Elfie ! ELFIE ST . CLAIR Since I broke away from the folks up state and they 've heard things , there ai n't any more letters coming to me with an Oswego postmark . Ma 's gone , and the rest do n't care . You 're all I 've got in the world , Laura , and what I 'm asking you to do is because I want to see you happy . I was afraid this thing was coming off , and the thing to do now is to grab your happiness , no matter how you get it nor where it comes from . There ai n't a whole lot of joy in this world for you and me and the others we know , and what little you get you 've got to take when you 're young , because , when those gray hairs begin to come , and the make-up is n't going to hide the wrinkles , unless you 're well fixed , it 's going to be hell . You know what a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll love you just the same and you 'll love him . As for Brockton , let him get another girl ; there 're plenty ' round . Why , if this chance came to me I 'd tie a can to Jerry so quick that you could hear it rattle all the way down Broadway . Rises , crosses back of table to LAURA , leans over back of chair , and puts arms around her neck very tenderly . Dearie , promise me that you wo n't be a damn fool . The bell rings ; both start . p. 111 MURDOCK Rises . Maybe that 's John . ELFIE brushes a tear quickly from her eye . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Oh ! And you 'll promise me , Laura ? MURDOCK I 'll try . ANNIE enters up stage from the adjoining room and crosses to the door . If that 's Mr. Madison , Annie , tell him to come in . LAURA stands near the table , almost rigid . Instinctively ELFIE goes to the mirror and re-arranges her gown and hair as ANNIE exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellow when I see him , watch me and I 'll tip you the wink . Kisses LAURA ; up stage puts on coat . She goes up stage to centre ; LAURA remains in her position . The doors are heard to open , and in a moment JOHN enters . He is dressed very neatly in a business suit , and his face is tanned and weather-beaten . After he enters , he stands still for a moment . The emotion that both he and LAURA go through is such that each is trying to control it , LAURA from the agony of her position , and JOHN from the mere hurt of his affection . He sees ELFIE and forces a smile . MADISON Quietly . Hello , Laura ! I 'm on time . LAURA smiles , quickly crosses the stage , and holds out her hand . p. 112 MURDOCK Oh , John , I 'm so glad  --  so glad to see you . They hold this position for a moment , looking into each other 's eyes . ELFIE moves so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much pleased with his appearance . She coughs slightly . LAURA takes a step back with a smile . Oh , pardon me , John  --  one of my dearest friends , Miss Sinclair ; she 's heard a lot about you . ELFIE , with a slight gush , in her most captivating manner , goes over and holds out her gloved hand laden with bracelets , and with her sweetest smile crosses to centre . ELFIE ST . CLAIR How do you do ? MADISON I 'm glad to meet you , I 'm sure . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Still holding JOHN 'S hand . Yes , I 'm sure you are  --  particularly just at this time . To LAURA . You know that old stuff about two 's company and three LAURA smiles. is a crowd . Here 's where I vamoose . Crosses to door . MURDOCK As ELFIE goes toward door . Do n't hurry , dear . ELFIE ST . CLAIR With a grin . No , I suppose not ; just fall down stairs and get out of the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Madison , I 'm awfully glad to have met you , and I want to congratulate you . They tell me you 're rich . p. 113 MADISON Oh , no ; not rich . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Well , I do n't believe you  --  anyway I 'm going . Ta-ta , dearie . Good-bye , Mr. Madison . MADISON Good-bye . JOHN crosses up to back of sofa ; removes coat , puts it on sofa . ELFIE ST . CLAIR Goes to the door , opens it and turns . JOHN 'S back is partly toward her and she gives a long wink at LAURA , snapping fingers to attract LAURA 'S attention . I must say , Laura , that when it comes to picking live ones , you certainly can go some . After this remark both turn toward her and both smile . Exit . After ELFIE exits , JOHN turns to LAURA with a pleasant smile , and jerks his head towards the door where ELFIE has gone out . MADISON I bet she 's a character . MURDOCK She 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crossing to centre . MURDOCK She 's been a very great friend to me . MADISON That 's good , but do n't I get a " how-dy-do , " or a handshake , or a little kiss ? You know I 've come a long way . LAURA goes to him and places herself in his arms ; he kisses her affectionately . During all this scene between them the tenderness of the man is very apparent . As she releases herself from his embrace he takes her face in his hands and holds it up towards his . p. 114 MADISON I 'm not much on the love-making business , Laura , but I never thought I 'd be as happy as I am now . JOHN and LAURA cross to centre . LAURA kneels in armchair with back to audience , JOHN stands left of her . I 've been counting mile-posts ever since I left Chicago , and it seemed like as if I had to go ' round the world before I got here . MURDOCK You never told me about your good fortune . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were coming . MADISON I did n't want you to . I 'd made up my mind to sort of drop in here and give you a great big surprise ,  --  a happy one , I knew ,  --  but the papers made such a fuss in Chicago that I thought you might have read about it  --  did you ? MURDOCK No . MADISON Gee ! fixed up kind o ' scrumptious , ai n't you ? Crosses in front of sofa , around behind it , surveying rooms . Maybe you 've been almost as prosperous as I have . MURDOCK You can get a lot of gilt and cushions in New York at half price , and besides , I 've got a pretty good part now . MADISON Of course I know that , but I did n't think it would make you quite so comfortable . Great , ai n't it ? p. 115 MURDOCK Yes . MADISON Standing beside her chair , with a smile . Well , are you ready ? MURDOCK For what , dear ? Looking up at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MURDOCK Yes . Leans her head affectionately on his shoulder . MADISON Well , I meant it . MURDOCK I know . MADISON I 've got to get back JOHN looks around ; crosses behind table to chair right of table , and sits facing her across it . , Laura , just as soon as ever I can . There 's a lot of work to be done out in Nevada and I stole away to come to New York . I want to take you back . Can you go ? MURDOCK Yes  --  when ? MADISON This afternoon . We 'll take the eighteen-hour train to Chicago , late this afternoon , and connect at Chicago with the Overland , and I 'll soon have you in a home . Pause . And here 's another secret . MURDOCK What , dear ? MADISON I 've got that home all bought and furnished , and while you could n't call it a Fifth Avenue residence , still it has got something on any other one in town . p. 116 MURDOCK But , John , you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me a single , solitary thing about your good luck . MADISON I 've planned to take you out and show you all that . MURDOCK You should have told me ,  --  I 've been so anxious . MADISON I waited until it was a dead-sure thing . You know it 's been pretty tough sledding out there in the mining country , and it did look as if I never would make a strike ; but your spirit was with me and luck was with me , and I knew if I could only hold out that something would come my way . I had two pals , both of them miners ,  --  they had the knowledge and I had the luck ,  --  and one day , clearing away a little snow to build a fire , I poked my toe into the dirt , and there was somethin ' there , dearie , that looked suspicious . I called Jim ,  --  that 's one of the men ,  --  and in less time than it takes to tell you there were three maniacs scratching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We staked our claims in two weeks , and I came to Reno to raise enough money for me to come East . Now things are all fixed and it 's just a matter of time . Taking LAURA 'S hand . MURDOCK So you 're very , very rich , dear ? MADISON Oh , not rich Releasing her hand , he leans back in his chair. , just heeled . I 'm not going down to the Wall Street bargain counter and buy the Union Pacific , or anything like that ; but we wo n't have to take the trip on tourists ' tickets , and there 's enough money to make us comfortable all the rest of our lives . p. 117 MURDOCK How hard you must have worked and suffered . MADISON Nobody else ever accused me of that , but I sure will have to plead guilty to you . Rises ; stands at upper side of table . Why , dear , since the day you came into my life , hell-raising took a sneak out the back door and God poked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think He 's been coming a little closer to me . Crossing over . I used to be a fellow without much faith , and kidded everybody who had it , and I used to say to those who prayed and believed , " You may be right , but show me a message . " You came along and you brought that little document in your sweet face and your dear love . Laura , you turned the trick for me , and I think I 'm almost a regular man now . LAURA Turns away in pain ; the realization of all she is to JOHN weighs heavily upon her . She almost loses her nerve , and is on the verge of not going through with her determination to get her happiness at any price . MURDOCK John , please , do n't . I 'm not worth it . Rises , crosses to right . MADISON With a light air . Not worth it ? Why , you 're worth Crossing behind table , stands behind LAURA. that and a whole lot more . And see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never could get along in your profession , but I knew you could . Crosses back of LAURA , takes her by the shoulders , shakes her playfully . I knew what you had in you , and here you are . You see , if my foot had n't slipped on the right ground and kicked up pay-dirt , you 'd been all right . You succeeded and I succeeded , but I 'm going to take you away ; and after a while , when things sort of smooth out , and it 's all clear where the money 's Crosses to sofa and sits. coming from , we 're going to move back here , and go to Europe , and just have a great time , like a couple of good pals . p. 118 MURDOCK Slowly crosses to JOHN . But if I had n't succeeded and if things  --  things were n't just as they seem  --  would it make any difference to you , John ? MADISON Not the least in the world . He takes her in his arms and kisses her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you get blue . I should not have surprised you this way . It 's taken you off your feet . He looks at his watch , rises , crosses behind sofa , gets overcoat . But we 've not any time to lose . How soon can you get ready ? MURDOCK Kneeling on sofa , leaning over back . You mean to go ? MADISON Nothing else . MURDOCK Take all my things ? MADISON All your duds . MURDOCK Why , dear , I can get ready most any time . MADISON Looking off into bedroom . That your maid ? MURDOCK Yes ,  --  Annie . MADISON Well , you and she can pack everything you want to take ; the rest can follow later . Puts coat on . I planned it all out . There 's a couple of the boys working down town ,  --  newspaper men on Park Row . Telephoned them when I got in and they 're waiting for me . I 'll just get down there as soon as I can . I wo n't be gone long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know just how long , but we 'll make that train . I 'll get the license . We 'll be married and we 'll be off on our honeymoon this afternoon . Can you do it ? LAURA goes up to him , puts her hands in his , and they confront each other . MURDOCK Yes , dear , I could do anything for you . He takes her in his arms and kisses her again . Looks at her tenderly . MADISON That 's good . Hurry now . I wo n't be long . Good-bye . MURDOCK Hurry back , John . MADISON Yes . I wo n't be long . Exit . MURDOCK Stands for a moment looking after him ; then she suddenly recovers herself and walks rapidly over to the dresser , picks up large jewel-case , takes doll that is hanging on dresser , puts them on her left arm , takes black cat in her right hand and uses it in emphasizing her words in talking to ANNIE . Places them all on table . Annie , Annie , come here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie , I 'm going away , and I 've got to hurry . p. 120 ANNIE Goin ' away ? MURDOCK Yes . I want you to bring both my trunks out here ,  --  I 'll help you ,  --  and start to pack . We ca n't take everything ANNIE throws fur rug from across doorway into bedroom. , but bring all the clothes out and we 'll hurry asfastaswecan . Comeon . Exit LAURA with ANNIE . In a very short interval she re-appears , and both are carrying a large trunk between them . They put it down , pushing sofa back . ANNIE Look out for your toes , Miss Laura . MURDOCK I can take two . ANNIE Golly , such excitement . Crosses to table ; pushes it over further , also armchair . Wheah yuh goin ' , Miss Laura ? MURDOCK Never mind where I 'm going . I have n't any time to waste now talking . I 'll tell you later . This is one time , Annie , that you 've got to move . Hurry up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way and re-appear with a smaller trunk . ANNIE Look out fo ' your dress , Miss Laura . These trunks are of the same type as those in Act II . When the trunks are put down LAURA opens one and commences to throw things out . ANNIE stands watching her . LAURA kneels in front of trunk , working and humming " Bon-Bon Buddie. " p. 121 ANNIE Ah nevah see you so happy , Miss Laura . MURDOCK I never was so happy . For heaven 's sake , go get something . Do n't stand there looking at me . I want you to hurry . ANNIE I 'll bring out all de fluffy ones first . MURDOCK Yes , everything . ANNIE enters with armful of dresses and hat-box of tissue-paper ; dumps tissue-paper on floor , puts dresses in trunk . ANNIE Goes out again . Outside . You goin ' to take dat opera-cloak ? Enters with more dresses , puts them on sofa , takes opera-cloak , spreads it on top of dresses on trunk . My , but dat 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exit . MURDOCK Annie , you put the best dresses on the foot of the bed and I 'll get them myself . You heard what I said ? ANNIE Off stage . Yassum . ANNIE hangs dresses across bed in alcove . LAURA continues busily arranging the contents of the trunk , placing some garments here and some there , as if she were sorting them out . WILL quietly enters and stands at the door , looking at her . He holds this position as long as possible , and when he speaks it is in a very quiet tone . p. 122 BROCKTON Going away ? MURDOCK Starts , rises , and confronts him . Yes . BROCKTON In somewhat of a hurry , I should say . MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON What 's the plan ? MURDOCK I 'm just going , that 's all . BROCKTON Madison been here ? MURDOCK He 's just left . BROCKTON Of course you are going with him ? MURDOCK Yes . BROCKTON West ? MURDOCK To Nevada . BROCKTON Going  --  er  --  to get married ? MURDOCK Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? MURDOCK What do you mean when you say " he did n't care " ? BROCKTON Of course you told him about the letter , and how it was burned up , and all that sort of thing , did n't you ? MURDOCK Why , yes . BROCKTON And he said it did n't make any difference ? p. 123 MURDOCK He  --  he did n't say anything . We 're just going to be married , that 's all . BROCKTON Did you mention my name and say that we 'd been rather companionable for the last two months ? MURDOCK I told him you 'd been a very good friend to me . During this scene LAURA answers WILL with difficulty , and to a man of the world it is quite apparent that she is not telling the truth . WILL looks over toward her in an almost threatening way . BROCKTON How soon do you expect him back ? Crossing to centre . MURDOCK Quite soon . I do n't know just exactly how long he 'll be . BROCKTON And you mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth ? Crossing to trunk . MURDOCK I  --  I  --  Then with defiance . What business have you got to ask me that ? What business have you got to interfere anyway ? Crossing up to bed in alcove , gets dresses off foot , and puts them on sofa . BROCKTON Quietly . Then you 've lied again . You lied to him , and you just tried to lie to me now . I must say , Laura , that you 're not particularly clever at it , although I do n't doubt but that you 've had considerable practice . Gives her a searching look and slowly walks over to the chair at the table and sits down , still holding his hat in his hand and without removing his overcoat . LAURA sees BROCKTON sitting , stops and turns on him , laying dresses down . p. 124 MURDOCK What are you going to do ? BROCKTON Sit down here and rest a few moments ; maybe longer . MURDOCK You ca n't do that . BROCKTON I do n't see why not . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that he 'll come back here soon and find you here ? BROCKTON That 's just exactly what I want him to do . MURDOCK With suppressed emotion , almost on the verge of hysteria . I want to tell you this . If you do this thing you 'll ruin my life . You 've done enough to it already . Now I want you to go . You 've got to go . I do n't think you 've got any right to come here now , in this way , and take this happiness from me . I 've given you everything I 've got , and now I want to live right and decent , and he wants me to , and we love each other . Now , Will Brockton , it 's come to this . You 've got to leave this place , do you hear ? You 've got to leave this place . Please get out . Crossing to trunk . BROCKTON Rises and comes to her . Do you think I 'm going to let a woman make a liar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I like that boy , and I 'm not going to let you put him to the bad . p. 125 MURDOCK I want you to go . Slams trunk lid down , crosses to dresser , opens drawer to get stuff out . BROCKTON And I tell you I wo n't go . I 'm going to show you up . I 'm going to tell him the truth . It is n't you I care for  --  he 's got to know . MURDOCK Slams drawer shut , loses her temper , and is almost tiger-like in her anger . You do n't care for me ? BROCKTON No . MURDOCK It is n't me you 're thinking of ? BROCKTON No . MURDOCK Who 's the liar now ? BROCKTON Liar ? MURDOCK Yes , liar . You are . You do n't care for this man , and you know it . BROCKTON You 're foolish . MURDOCK Yes , I am foolish and I 've been foolish all my life , but I 'm getting a little sense now . Kneels in armchair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . All my life , since the day you first took me away , you 've planned and planned and planned to keep me , and to trick me and bring me down with you . When you came to me I was happy . I did n't have much , just a little salary and some hard work . p. 126 BROCKTON But like all the rest you found that would n't keep you , did n't you ? MURDOCK You say I 'm bad , but who 's made me so ? Who took me out night after night ? Who showed me what these luxuries were ? Who put me in the habit of buying something I could n't afford ? You did . BROCKTON Well , you liked it , did n't you ? MURDOCK Who got me in debt , and then , when I would n't do what you wanted me to , who had me discharged from the company , so I had no means of living ? Who followed me from one place to another ? Who , always entreating , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know any better ? BROCKTON You did n't know any better ? MURDOCK I knew it was wrong  --  yes ; but you told me everybody in this business did that sort of thing , and I was just as good as anyone else . Finally you got me and you kept me . Then , when I went away to Denver , and for the first time found a gleam of happiness , for the first time in my life  --  BROCKTON You 're crazy . MURDOCK Yes , I am crazy . Rises angrily , crosses and sweeps table-cover off table ; crosses to dresser , knocks bottles , &amp;c. , off upper end ; turns , faces him , almost screaming . You 've made me crazy . You followed me to Denver , and then when I got back you bribed me again . You pulled me down , and you did the same old thing until this happened . Now I want you to get out , you understand ? I want you to get out . p. 127 BROCKTON Laura , you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Screaming , crossing to WILL ; she attempts to push him . No , you wo n't ; you wo n't stay here . You 're not going to do this thing again . I tell you I 'm going to be happy . I tell you I 'm going to be married . He does n't resist her very strongly . Her anger and her rage are entirely new to him . He is surprised and can not understand . You wo n't see him ; I tell you , you wo n't tell him . You 've got no business to . I hate you . I 've hated you for months . I hate the sight of your face . I 've wanted to go , and now I 'm going . You 've got to go , do you hear ? You 've got to get out  --  get out . Pushes him again . BROCKTON Throwing her off ; LAURA staggers to armchair , rises , crosses left . What the hell is the use of fussing with a woman . Exit . MURDOCK Hysterically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be married , I 'm going to be happy . Sinks down in exhausted state in front of trunk. @x SCENE . The same scene as Act III . It is about two o'clock in the afternoon . AT RISE . When the curtain rises , there are two big trunks and one small one up stage . These are marked in the usual theatrical fashion . There are grips packed , umbrellas , and the usual paraphernalia that accompanies a woman when she is making a permanent departure from her place of living . All the bric -- brac , &amp;c. , has been removed from dresser . On down-stage end of dresser is a small alligator bag containing night-dress , toilet articles , and bunch of keys . The dresser drawers are some of them half open , and old pieces of tissue-paper and ribbons are hanging out . The writing-desk has had all materials removed and is open , showing scraps of torn-up letters , and in one pigeonhole is a New York Central time-table ; between desk and bay-window is a lady 's hat-trunk containing huge picture hat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ANNIE is working when curtain rises . Under desk are two old millinery boxes , around which are scattered old tissue-paper , a pair of old slippers , a woman 's shabby hat , old ribbon , &amp;c . In front of window at end of pianola is thrown a lot of old empty boxes , such as are used for stocking and shirtwaist boxes . The picture-frame and basket of flowers have been removed from pianola . The stool is on top of pianola , upside down . There is an empty White Rock bottle , with glass turned over it , standing between the legs of the stool . The big trunk is in front of sofa , and packed , and it has a swing tray under which is packed a fancy evening gown ; the lid is down . On top of lid are an umbrella , lady 's travelling-coat , hat and gloves . On left end of sofa are a large Gladstone bag , packed and fastened , a smaller trunk ( thirty-four inch ) , tray with lid . In tray are articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped in tissue-paper . Trunk is closed , and supposed to be locked . Tossed across left arm of armchair are couple of violet cords . Down stage centre is a large piece of wide tan ribbon . The room has the general appearance of having been stripped of all personal belongings . There are old magazines and tissuepaper all over the place . A bearskin rug is thrown up against table in low window , the furniture is all on stage as used in Act III . At rise LAURA is sitting on trunk with clock in hand . ANNIE is on floor behind table , fastening suit-case . LAURA is pale and perturbed . ANNIE Ai n't yuh goin ' to let me come to yuh at all , Miss Laura ? p. 129 MURDOCK I do n't know yet , Annie . I do n't even know what the place is like that we 're going to . Mr. Madison has n't said much . There has n't been time . ANNIE Why , Ah 've done ma best for yuh , Miss Laura , yes , Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma time , an ' Places suit-case on table ; crosses to centre . Ah worked for yuh an ' Ah loved yuh , an ' Ah doan ' wan ' to be left ' ere all alone in dis town ' ere New York . LAURA turns to door ; ANNIE stoops , grabs up ribbon , hides it behind her back . Ah ai n't the kind of cullud lady knows many people . Ca n't yuh take me along wid yuh , Miss Laura ?  --  yuh all been so good to me . MURDOCK Why , I told you to Crosses to door , looks out , returns disappointed. stay here and get your things together ANNIE hides ribbon in front of her waist. , and then Mr. Brockton will probably want you to do something . Later , I think he 'll have you pack up , just as soon as he finds I 'm gone . I 've got the address that you gave me . I 'll let you know if you can come on . ANNIE Suddenly . Ai n't yuh goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuh by ? Ah 've been so honest  --  MURDOCK Honest ? p. 130 ANNIE Honest , Ah have . MURDOCK You 've been about as honest as most coloured Crosses to table ; gets suit-case ; crosses to sofa and puts suit-case on it. girls are who work for women in the position that I am in . You have n't stolen enough to make me discharge you , but I 've seen what you 've taken . Sits on end of sofa facing left . ANNIE Now , Miss Laura . MURDOCK Do n't try to fool me . What you 've got you 're welcome to , but for heaven 's sake do n't prate around here about loyalty and honesty . I 'm sick of it . ANNIE Ai n't yuh goin ' to give me no recommendation ? MURDOCK Impatiently looking around the room . What good would my recommendation do ? You can always go and get another position with people who 've lived the way I 've lived , and my recommendation to the other kind would n't amount to much . ANNIE Sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' ,  --  back to dat boa'din ' - house in 38th Street fo ' me . Crying . MURDOCK Now shut your noise . I do n't want to hear any more . I 've given you twenty-five dollars for a present . I think that 's enough . ANNIE assumes a most aggrieved appearance . p. 131 ANNIE Ah know , but twenty-five dollars ai n't a home , and I 'm Rises , crosses to rubbish heap , picks up old slippers and hat , puts hat on head as she goes out , looks into pier-glass. losin ' my home . Dat 's jest my luck  --  every time I save enough money to buy my weddin ' clothes to get married I lose my job . Exit . MURDOCK I wonder where John is . We 'll never be able to make that train . She crosses to window , then to desk , takes out time-table , crosses to armchair and spreads time-table on back , studies it , crosses impatiently to trunk , and sits nervously kicking her feet . After a few seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That must be he ,  --  Annie  --  go quick . ANNIE crosses and opens the door in the usual manner . WESTON Outside . Is Miss Murdock in ? ANNIE Yassuh , she 's in . LAURA is up stage and turns to receive visitor . JIM enters . He is nicely dressed in black and has an appearance of prosperity about him , but in other respects he retains the old drollness of enunciation and manner . He crosses to LAURA in a cordial way and holds out his hand . ANNIE crosses , after closing the door , and exits through the portires into the sleeping-apartment. p. 132 WESTON How-dy-do , Miss Laura ? MURDOCK Jim Weston , I 'm mighty glad to see you . WESTON Looks like as if you were going to move ? MURDOCK Yes , I am going to move , and a long ways , too . How well you 're looking ,  --  as fit as a fiddle . WESTON Yes ; I am feelin ' fine . Where yer goin ' ? Troupin ' ? MURDOCK No , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's comin ' off now ? Takes off coat , puts coat and hat on trunk . MURDOCK Very simply . I 'm going to be married this afternoon . WESTON Married ? MURDOCK And then I 'm going West . WESTON Leaving the trunk , walking toward her and holding out his hands . Now I 'm just glad to hear that . Ye know when I heard how  --  how things was breakin ' for ye  --  well , I ai n't knockin ' or anythin ' like that , but me and the missis have talked ye over a lot . I never did think this feller was goin ' to do the right thing by yer . Brockton never looked to me like a fellow would marry anybody , but now that he 's goin ' through just to make you a nice , respectable wife , I guess everything must have happened for the best . LAURA averts her eyes . Both sit on trunk , JIM left of LAURA . Y ' see I wanted to thank you for what you did a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I could go ahead of one of his big shows if I wanted to come back , and offering me considerable money . He mentioned your name , Miss Laura , and I talked it over with the missis , and  --  well , I can tell ye now when I could n't if ye were n't to be hooked up  --  we decided that I would n't take that job , comin ' as it did from you Slowly. and the way I knew it was framed up . p. 133 MURDOCK Why not ? WESTON Embarrassed . Well , ye see , there are three kids and they 're all growing up , all of them in school , and the missis , she 's just about forgot show business and she 's playing a star part in the kitchen , juggling dishes and doing flip-flaps with pancakes ; and we figgered that as we 'd always gone along kinder clean-like , it would n't be good for the kids to take a job comin ' from Brockton because you  --  you  --  well  --  you  --  MURDOCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . You thought it was n't decent . Is that it ? WESTON Oh , not exactly , only  --  well , you see I 'm gettin ' along pretty Rises ; crosses to LAURA. good now . I got a little one-night-stand theatre out in Ohio  --  manager of it , too . The town is called Gallipolis . With a smile . MURDOCK Gallipolis ? WESTON Oh , that ai n't a disease . It is the name of a town . Maybe you do n't know much about Gallipolis , or where it is . MURDOCK No . WESTON Well , it looks just like it sounds . We got a little house , and the old lady is happy , and I feel so good that I can even stand her cookin ' . Of course we ai n't makin ' much money , but I guess I 'm gettin ' a little old-fashioned around theatres anyway . The fellows from newspapers and colleges have got it on me . Last time I asked a man for a job he asked me what I knew about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know the Greeks had a theatre in New York he slipped me a laugh and told me to come in again on some rainy Tuesday . Then Gallipolis showed on the map , and I beat it for the West . JIM notices by this time the pain he has caused LAURA , and is embarrassed . Sorry if I hurt ye  --  did n't mean to ; and now that yer goin ' to be Mrs. Brockton , well , I take back all I said , and , while I do n't think I want to change my position , I would n't turn it down for  --  for that other reason , that 's all . p. 134 MURDOCK With a tone of defiance in her voice . But , Mr. Weston , I 'm not going to be Mrs. Brockton . WESTON No ? Crosses left a little . MURDOCK No . WESTON Oh  --  oh  --  MURDOCK I 'm going to marry another man , and a good man . WESTON The hell you are ! LAURA rises and puts hand on JIM 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . I know what you meant when you said about the missis and the kids , and that 's what I want  --  just a little home , just a little peace , just a little comfort , and  --  and the man has come who 's going to give it to me . You do n't want me to say any more , do you ? Crosses to door , opens it , and looks out ; closes it and crosses to JIM . WESTON Emphatically , and with a tone of hearty approval . No , I do n't , and now I 'm just going to put my mit out and shake yours and be real glad . I want to tell ye it 's the only way to go along . I ai n't never been a rival to Rockefeller , nor I ai n't never made Morgan jealous , but since the day my old woman took her make-up off for the last time , and walked out of that stage-door to give me a little help and bring my kids into the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you 're goin ' to take that road , by Jiminy , I 'm glad of it , for you sure do deserve it . I wish yer luck . p. 135 MURDOCK Thank you . WESTON I 'm mighty glad you side-stepped Brockton . You 're young LAURA sits on trunk. , and you 're pretty , and you 're sweet , and if you 've got the right kind of a feller there ai n't no reason on earth why you should n't jest forgit the whole business and see nothin ' but laughs and a good time comin ' to you , and the sun sort o ' shinin ' every twenty-four hours in the day . You know the missis feels just as if she knew you , after I told her about them hard times we had at Farley 's boarding-house , so I feel that it 's paid me to come to New York Picks up pin ; puts it in lapel of coat. even if I did n't book anything but " East Lynne " and " Uncle Tom 's Cabin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . Do n't forget Gallipolis 's LAURA helps him on with his coat. the name , and sometimes the mail does get there . I 'd be awful glad if you wrote the missis a little note tellin ' us how you 're gettin ' along , and if you ever have to ride on the Kanawha and Michigan , just look out of the window when the train passes our town , because that is about the best you 'll get . MURDOCK Why ? WESTON They only stop there on signal . And make up your mind that the Weston family is with you forty ways from the Jack day and night . Good-bye , and God bless you . p. 136 MURDOCK Good-bye , Jim . I 'm so glad to know you 're happy , for it is good to be happy . Kisses him . WESTON You bet . Moves toward the door . She follows him after they have shaken hands . Never mind , I can get out all right . Opens the door , and at the door : Good-bye again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . She stands motionless until she hears the outer door slam . I wonder why he does n't come . She goes up and looks out of the window and turns down stage , crosses right , counting trunks ; as she counts suitcase on table , bell rings ; she crosses hurriedly to trunk centre . Hurry , Annie , and see who that is . ANNIE enters , crosses , opens door , exits , and opens the outer door . ANNIE She 's waitin ' for yer , Mr. Madison . LAURA hurries down to the centre of stage . JOHN enters , hat in hand and his overcoat on arm , followed by ANNIE . He stops just as he enters and looks at LAURA long and searchingly . LAURA instinctively feels that something has happened . She shudders and remains firm . ANNIE crosses and exits . Closes doors . p. 137 MURDOCK With a little effort . JOHN places hat and coat on trunk . Are n't you a little late , dear ? MADISON I  --  I was detained down town a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our plan all right . MURDOCK After a pause . Has anything happened ? MADISON I 've made all the arrangements . The men will be here in a few minutes for your trunks . Crosses to coat ; feels in pocket . I 've got the railroad tickets and everything else , but  --  MURDOCK But what , John ? He goes over to her . She intuitively understands that she is about to go through an ordeal . She seems to feel that JOHN has become acquainted with something which might interfere with their plan . He looks at her long and searchingly . Evidently he too is much wrought up , but when he speaks to her it is with a calm dignity and force which show the character of the man . MADISON Laura . MURDOCK Yes ? MADISON You know when I went down town I said I was going to call on two or three of my friends in Park Row . MURDOCK I know . p. 138 MADISON I told them who I was going to marry . MURDOCK Well ? MADISON They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd said too much , but not quite enough . MURDOCK What did they say ? MADISON Just that  --  too much and not quite enough . There 's a minister waiting for us over on Madison Avenue . You see , then you 'll be my wife . That 's pretty serious business , and all I want now from you is the truth . MURDOCK Well ? MADISON Just tell me that what they said was just an echo of the past  --  that it came from what had been going on before that wonderful day out in Colorado . Tell me that you 've been on the level . I do n't want their word , Laura  --  I just want yours . LAURA summons all her courage , looks up into his loving eyes , shrinks a moment before his anxious face , and speaks as simply as she can . MURDOCK Yes , John , I have been on the level . MADISON Very tenderly . I knew that , dear , I knew it . He takes her in his arms and kisses her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner is changed to one of almost boyish happiness . Well , now everything 's all ready , let 's get on the job . We have n't a great deal of time . Get your duds on . p. 139 MURDOCK When do we go ? MADISON Right away . The great idea is to get away . MURDOCK All right . Gets hat off trunk , crosses to bureau , puts it on . MADISON Laura , you 've got trunks enough , have n't you ? One might think we 're moving a whole colony . Turns to her with a smile . And , by the way , to me you are a whole colony  --  anyway you 're the only one I ever wanted to settle with . MURDOCK That 's good . Takes bag off bureau , crosses to trunk , gets purse , coat , umbrella , as if ready to leave . She hurriedly gathers her things together , adjusting her hat and the like , and almost to herself in a low tone : I 'm so excited . Continues preparations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get his hat and coat , and while the preparations are about to be completed and LAURA has said " Come on , " she is transfixed by the noise of the slamming of the outer door . She stops as if she had been tremendously shocked , and a moment later the rattling of a latch-key in the inner door also stops JOHN from going any further . His coat is half on . LAURA looks toward the door , paralyzed with fright , and JOHN looks at her with an expression of great apprehension . Slowly the door opens , and BROCKTON enters with coat and hat on . As he turns to close the door after him , LAURA , pitifully and terribly afraid , retreats two or three steps , and lays coat , bag , purse and umbrella down in armchair , standing dased . BROCKTON enters leisurely , paying no attention to anyone , while JOHN becomes as rigid as a statue , and follows with his eyes every move BROCKTON makes . The latter walks leisurely across the stage , and afterwards into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second . No one moves . BROCKTON finally renters with coat and hat off , and throws back the portires in such a manner as to reveal the bed and his intimate familiarity with the outer room . He goes down stage in the same leisurely manner and sits in a chair opposite JOHN , crossing his legs . p. 140 BROCKTON Hello , Madison , when did you get in ? Slowly JOHN seems to recover himself . His right hand starts up toward the lapel of his coat and slowly he pulls his Colt revolver from the holster under his armpit . There is a deadly determination and deliberation in every movement that he makes . WILL jumps to his feet and looks at him . The revolver is uplifted in the air , as a Western man handles a gun , so that when it is snapped down with a jerk the deadly shot can be fired . LAURA is terrorstricken , but before the shot is fired she takes a step forward and extends one hand in a gesture of entreaty . MURDOCK In a husky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gun remains uplifted for a moment . JOHN is evidently wavering in his determination to kill . Slowly his whole frame relaxes . He lowers the pistol in his hand in a manner which clearly indicates that he is not going to shoot . He quietly puts it back in the holster , and WILL is obviously relieved , although he stood his ground like a man . MADISON Slowly . Thank you . You said that just in time . A pause . BROCKTON Recovering and in a light tone . Well , you see , Madison , that what I said when I was  --  p. 141 MADISON Threateningly . Look out , Brockton , I do n't want to talk to you . The men confront . BROCKTON All right . MADISON To LAURA . Now get that man out of here . MURDOCK John , I  --  MADISON Get him out . Get him out before I lose my temper or they 'll take him out without his help . MURDOCK To WILL . Go  --  go . Please go . BROCKTON Deliberately . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing . Exit WILL into the sleeping-apartment . LAURA and JOHN stand facing each other . He enters again with hat and coat on , and passes over toward the door . LAURA and JOHN do not move . When he gets just a little to the left of the centre of the stage LAURA steps forward and stops him with her speech . MURDOCK Now before you go , and to you both , I want to tell you how I 've learned to despise him . John , I know you do n't believe me , but it 's true  --  it 's true . I do n't love anyone in the world but just you . I know you do n't think that it can be explained  --  maybe there is n't any explanation . I could n't help it . I was so poor , and I had to live , and he would n't let me work , and he 's only let me live one way , and I was hungry . Do you know what that means ? I was hungry and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oh , John , I tried so hard to do the other thing ,  --  the right thing ,  --  but I couldn't. p. 142 MADISON I  --  I know I could n't help much , and perhaps I could have forgiven you if you had n't lied to me . That 's what hurt . Turning to WILL and approaching until he can look him in the eyes . I expected you to lie , you 're that kind of a man . You left me with a shake of the hand , and you gave me your word , and you did n't keep it . Why should you keep it ? Why should anything make any difference with you ? Why , you pup , you 've no right to live in the same world with decent folks . Now you make yourself scarce , or take it from me , I 'll just kill you , that 's all . BROCKTON I 'll leave , Madison , but I 'm not going to let you think that I did n't do the right thing with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to come back . I told you that , when I was in Colorado , and you did n't believe me , and I told you that when she did this sort of thing I 'd let you know . I dictated a letter to her to send to you , and I left it sealed and stamped in her hands to mail . She did n't do it . If there 's been a lie , she told it . I did n't . JOHN turns to her . She hangs her head and averts her eyes in a mute acknowledgment of guilt . The revelation hits JOHN so hard that he sinks on the trunk centre , his head fallen to his breast . He is utterly limp and whipped . There is a moment 's silence . BROCKTON Crosses to JOHN . You see ! Why , my boy , whatever you think of me or the life I lead , I would n't have had this come to you for anything in the world . JOHN makes an impatient gesture . No , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me because I do n't take them seriously . I wish I had the faith and the youth to feel the way you do . You 're all in and broken up , but I wish I could be broken up just once . I did what I thought was best for you because I did n't think she could ever go through the way you wanted her to . I 'm sorry it 's all turned out bad . Pause . Good-bye . He looks at JOHN for a moment as if he was going to speak . JOHN remains motionless . The blow has hit him harder than he thought . WILL exits . The first door closes . In a moment the second door is slammed . JOHN and LAURA look at each other for a moment . He gives her no chance to speak . The hurt in his heart and his accusation are shown by his broken manner . A great grief has come into his life and he does n't quite understand it . He seems to be feeling around for something to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . With a pitiful gesture of the hand he looks at her in all his sorrow . p. 143 MADISON Well ? Rises . MURDOCK John , I  --  Takes off hat and places it on table . MADISON I 'd be careful what I said . Do n't try to make excuses . I understand . MURDOCK It 's not excuses . I want to tell you what 's in my heart , but I ca n't ; it wo n't speak , and you do n't believe my voice . MADISON You 'd better leave it unsaid . MURDOCK But I must tell . I ca n't let you go like this . She goes over to him and makes a weak attempt to put her arms around him . He takes her arms and puts them back to her side . I love you . I  --  how can I tell you  --  but I do , I do , and you wo n't believe me . He remains silent for a moment and then takes her by the hand , leads her over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do as far as you are able ; but , Laura , I guess you do n't know what a decent sentiment is . He gathers himself together . His tone is very gentle and very firm , but it carries a tremendous conviction , even with his grief ringing through his speech . Laura , you 're not immoral , you 're just unmoral , kind o ' all out of shape , and I 'm afraid there is n't a particle of hope for you . When we met neither of us had any reason to be proud , but I thought that you thought that it was the chance of salvation which sometimes comes to a man and a woman fixed as we were then . What had been had been . It was all in the great to-be for us , and now , how you 've kept your word ! What little that promise meant , when I thought you handed me a new lease of life ! p. 144 MURDOCK In a voice that is changed and metallic . She is literally being nailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . MADISON Do n't make such a mistake . In a month you 'll recover . There will be days when you will think of me , just for a moment , and then it will be all over . With you it is the easy way , and it always will be . You 'll go on and on until you 're finally left a wreck , just the type of the common woman . And you 'll sink until you 're down to the very bed-rock of depravity . I pity you . MURDOCK Still in the same metallic tone of voice . You 'll never leave me to do that . I 'll kill myself . MADISON Perhaps that 's the only thing left for you to do , but you 'll not do it . It 's easier to live . Crosses , gets hat and coat , turns and looks at her , LAURA rising at the same time . MURDOCK John , I said I 'd kill myself , and I mean it . If it 's the only thing to do , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your very eyes . She crosses quickly , gets keys out of satchel , opens trunk , takes gun out of trunk , stands facing JOHN  --  waiting a moment . You understand that when your hand touches that door I 'm going to shoot myself . I will , so help me God ! p. 145 MADISON Stops and looks at her . Kill yourself ? Pause . Before me ? Pause . All right . Raising his voice . Annie , Annie ! ANNIE Enters . Yes , sir . MADISON LAURA looks at JOHN in bewilderment . You see your mistress there has a pistol in her hand ? ANNIE Frightened . Yassuh  --  MADISON She wants to kill herself . I just called you to witness that the act is entirely voluntary on her part . Now , Laura , go ahead . MURDOCK Nearly collapsing , drops the pistol to the floor . John , I  --  ca n't  --  MADISON Annie , she 's evidently changed her mind . You may go . ANNIE But , Miss Laura , Ah  --  MADISON Peremptorily . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the portires . In that same gentle tone , but carrying with it an almost frigid conviction . You did n't have the nerve . I knew you would n't . For a moment you thought the only decent thing for you to do was to die , and yet you could n't go through . I am sorry for you ,  --  more sorry than I can tell . He takes a step towards the door . p. 146 MURDOCK You 're going  --  you 're going ? MADISON Yes . MURDOCK And  --  and  --  you never thought that perhaps I 'm frail , and weak , and a woman , and that now , maybe , I need your strength , and you might give it to me , and it might be better . I want to lean on you ,  --  lean on you , John . I know I need someone . Are n't you going to let me ? Wo n't you give me another chance ? MADISON I gave you your chance , Laura . MURDOCK Throws arms around his neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Good-bye . He pulls away and goes out , slamming both doors . MURDOCK Screaming . John  --  John  --  I  --  She sits on trunk , weeping in loud and tearful manner ; rises in a dazed fashion , starts to cross , sees gun , utters loud cry of mingled despair and anger , grabs up gun , crossing to bureau , opens up-stage drawer , throws gun in , slams drawer shut , calling : Annie ! Annie ! ANNIE Appears through the portires . Ai n't yuh goin away , Miss Laura ? MURDOCK Suddenly arousing herself , and with a defiant voice . No , I 'm not . I 'm going to stay right here . ANNIE crosses and opens trunk , takes out handsome dress , hangs it over back of armchair , crosses up to hat-trunk , takes out hat . LAURA takes it from her , crosses to trunk left , starts to unpack it . Open these trunks , take out those clothes , get me my prettiest dress . Hurry up . She goes before the mirror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint up my face . It 's all they 've left of me . To herself . They 've taken my soul away with them . p. 147 ANNIE In a happy voice . Yassum , yassum . MURDOCK Who is arranging her hair . Doll me up , Annie . ANNIE Yuh goin ' out , Miss Laura ? MURDOCK Yes . I 'm going to Rector 's to make a hit , and to hell with the rest ! At this moment the hurdy-gurdy in the street , presumably immediately under her window , begins to play the tune of " Bon-Bon Buddie , My Chocolate Drop . " There is something in this ragtime melody which is particularly and peculiarly suggestive of the low life , the criminality and prostitution that constitute the night excitement of that section of New York City known as the Tenderloin . The tune ,  --  its association ,  --  is like spreading before LAURA 'S eyes a panorama of the inevitable depravity that awaits her . She is torn from every ideal that she so weakly endeavoured to grasp , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when her emancipation seems to be assured . The woman , with her flashy dress in one arm and her equally exaggerated type of picture hat in the other , is nearly prostrated by the tune and the realization of the future as it is terrifically conveyed to her . The negress , in the happiness of serving LAURA in her questionable career , picks up the melody and hums it as she unpacks the finery that has been put away in the trunk . p. 148 MURDOCK With infinite grief , resignation , and hopelessness . O God  --  O my God . She turns and totters toward the bedroom . The hurdy-gurdy continues , with the negress accompanying it .
