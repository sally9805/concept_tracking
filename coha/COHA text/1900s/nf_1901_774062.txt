txt 6o A B C OF THE TELEPHONE . resistance 4 ohms , it follows that the current strength is 2 amperes . Now taking these figures as the basis of equations , instead of the unit-names , as above , we have : Water Currents and Electrical Currents .  --  In many points the behavior of water currents is comparable to that of electrical currents . The three elements ? pressure , resistance , efficient force per second ? are also present . Thus , if we have a body of water confined in a convenient tank , or other receptacle , so that a constant stream may escape through an orifice one inch square , under the pressure of six inches ? this is measured from the bottom of the tank to the surface of the water ? we have the equivalent of what is known as the " miner 's inch , " an exact analogy to the ampere . Taking the pressure of the column of water in the tank , which increases directly with its height and the dimensions of the orifice through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch is , first place , a measure of rate or velocity , a time measure , giving inch-seconds . Thus the water flows at the rate of so many miner 's inches , just as electricity flows at the rate of so many amperes , both in direct proportion to the initial pressure . In the water current the size of the orifice of escape measures the resistance ; in the electrical current it is the size , or diameter , of the wire , as we have seen , provided it be compared with another wire of the same metal . Thus it is that in neither case do we have a reference to time . An " ampere per second " is a simple repetition , and means no more than an " ampere . " Thus , in speaking of a current of , say , ten amperes , we do not refer to the current passing in ten seconds , but to that passing in one second . The Coulomb , the Unit of Electrical Quantity. ? This brings us to another unit of electrical measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " coulomb , " and it is equiva lent to the efficient quantity of electrical energy passed by a current of one ampere intensity in one second . It is , in fact , the " ampere-second . " Experimentally it has been found to equal the decomposition of .0936 milligrams of water , by elec trolysis , or the deposition of 1.11815 milligrams of silver by electro-plating . In both cases , of course , the actuating current is equivalent to one ampere , and the initial pressure , to one volt . The Watt , the Unit of Electrical Activity . ? A fourth unit is the " watt , " which is the practical unit of elec trical activity .. It is the rate of energy or of work represented by a current of one ampere urged by one volt of electromotive force . It is , in fact , the volt-ampere , or the pro-duct of the pressure and the current . Applying the principles of Ohm 's law , given above , we find that it is , further , the pro-duct of resistance multiplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the square of the voltage divided by the resist ance . If , then , we have a circuit with a voltage of 8 , an ohmage of 4 , and a current of 2 , we may compute the wattage as follows : ( voltage ) 8 X ( current ) 2 = ( wattage ) 16. ( resistance ) 4 X ( square of current ) 4 = wattage to . ( square of the voltage ) 64 = ( resistance ) 4 = wattage 16 . The Equivalent of the Watt. ? The wattage of a given active circuit is equivalent to the product of the voltage and the amperage , because , as is evident on reflection , the efficiency of any current for the accomplishment of work depends upon the pressure that impels it . For example , the energy furnished per 6 2 A B C OF THE TELEPHONE . second by a current of ro amperes supplied at a pressure of 2,000 volts is exactly the same as that furnished per second by a current of 400 amperes supplied at a pressure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watts . Watts and Horse Power. ? Approximately 746 watts is equal to one electrical horse power . A watt-hour is the expression for a power of one watt exerted by a current during the space of one hour . The watt-minute represents the same power exerted during one minute . The watt-second is equivalent to the product of the volts and the coulombs of a given circuit , and is also known as the volt-coulomb . While the measurements of electrical quantity and activity have no bearing on telephony , except in the questions connected with the use of charging dynamos and central energy units now coming into use more and more in up-to-date exchanges , it is essential that we include them in this brief survey of the system of electrical measurements , in order to give a good foundation for future and more extended study of practical telephone matters . Electrical Condensers. ? One consid-eration of importance , both in telephony and in other branches of electrical industry , is that of condensers . The condenser , or accumulator , is an instrument capable of holding a charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a shock or momentary current . More correctly , it is a device capable of being so affected by a primary electrical source that its internal potential is raised proportionately , and will electrically affect any body of lower potential . The simplest form of condenser is the Leyden jar , a glass jat , coated within and without with tin foil . A more practical // variation of the same principle is the ordinary telegraphic condenser , which consists of a number of sheets of tin foil , each two separated by a sheet of paraffined paper or mica . The tin foil sheets are connected to the poles of the primary battery , the first , third , fifth , and all odd numbers being connected together by a wire leading to one pole , and the second , fourth , sixth , and all even numbers , by a wire leading to the other pole . This arrangement is shown diagramatically in Fig. 53 . Construction of Practical Storage Batteries .  --  The form of device used largely in electric lighting , and also in central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage battery , " and depends for operation on chemical action . One of the earlier forms of this device was the Plante secondary battery . It consisted of pairs of lead plates , arranged in the order described for the ordinary condenser . They were placed close together , but not touching , in a solution of sulphuric acid . The battery was then " formed " by the action of an electro-lyzing current in one direction . By this process the surface of one plate is largely converted into lead binoxide . By frequent repetitions of the process of alternately charging and discharging this secondary battery , both plates are considerably attacked , one of them , however , being maintained in a state of oxidation . Later forms of the secondary cell have the lead plates or " grids " perforated , as shown in Fig. 54 , and these perfora-tions are filled with some substance suitable to enable the grid to act at once as either positive or negative electrode , as the // case may be , thus giving a good depth of matela for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of " forming , " in order to prepare the cell for practical use . The Chloride Storage CeII . ? Fig. 55 gives a good general idea of a type of storage cell much used in central energy telephone exchanges . It is charged in the same manner as the Plante cell , " after formation " but is much superior in construction and efficiency . As will be seen in the figure , the alternate grids have square or round perforations . The former are the negative and the latter the positive electrodes . The positive grids are composed of an alloy of lead and antimony cast into shape with the required number of round perforations . Each of these holes is filled with a button made by rolling a crimped lead ribbon in the form of a spiral and of a size to fit it tightly . The plates are then treated electro-chemically in order to pro-duce the proper lead oxide . The negative grids are made by casting the proper shape , under heavy pressure , around a num ber of square blocks of fused chloride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus completed the zinc is chemically removed , leaving the contents of each perforation pure spongy // lead . To assemble the cell , the grids , positive and negative , are hung alternately in the tank or box , being held apart by sheets or washers of hard rubber . A solution of sulphuric acid , about five parts water to one part acid , is then poured into the tank , and acts as the electrolyte , after the full charge has been given from a dynamo . Action of a Storage Cell. ? The action of the cell consists , first , in the oxidation of the spongy lead of the negative plates . The hydrogen set free in this process is transferred electrolytiGaily to the positive plate , where it reduces the lead dioxide ( Pb O ' ) to lead protoxide or monoxide ( Pb 0 ' ) . The oxides are then converted into sulphates by the action of the electrolytic solution . In the process of charging the conditions are reversed under the action of the electrical current from the dynamo , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate to metallic lead , and that on the other to lead binoxide , or dioxide . As soon as this process is completed the storage battery is said to be " charged , " and is once more in condition to give forth a current . Although the storage , or secondary , battery differs radically from the electrical condenser , despite the popular identification of the two , is is proper to regard it // as a form of accumulator ? since a certain amount of current is required to " form , " or charge it , as we have seen ? and to measure its power in terms of electrical capacity and quantity . The Farad , the Unit of Electrical Capacity. ? The theoretical unit of electrical capacity , as applied to condensers and accumulators , is the farad , which represents the capacity of a conductor which can retain one coulomb of electrical energy at a potential of one volt . The quantity of electricity charged upon a conducting surface , however , raises its potential , so that a condenser of one farad capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coulombs at three volts . Every Line a Condenser. ? In practical computations the microfarad , or one-millionth of a farad , is used . The faradical capacity of the earth is estimated as of a farad . As has been well said : " Every line is practically a condenser , the surface of the wire being one plate , the earth the other , and the air or covering of the wire the insulating layer between the two . Before a current can reach its full strength at the distant end of the line this condenser must be fully charged ; and when reversed currents are used it must be discharged and charged again at each reversal . This explains why a high capacity is so detrimental to telephone working , as the rapid changes and reversals of the telephonic current are deadened and flattened out if they have to charge much capacity before reaching the receiving instrument . " The Use of Electrical Units. ? Electrical units , while computed on the basis of the metric , or decimal system , are usually expressed in fractional forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ) , indicating the one-millionth part of a given unit , as micro-farad ; or , similarly , with the prefix mega ( Greek , megas , great ) , as indicating one million times that unit , as megohm , etc . The practical units used in computation are usually fractions of those given . But , as the exact description of the system belongs to a more extended treatment of the subject than is here necessary , it will be omitted . CHAPTER FIVE . HISTORY OF THE SPEAKING TELEPHONE . When we are told that the steam engine was invented by James Watt , or the steamboat by Robert Fulton , or the steam locomotive by George Stephenson , or the telegraph by S. F. B. Morse , or the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell , we are very apt to suppose that each of them originated both the idea and the contrivances embodied in their several inventions , and that no one ever thought of any such things before . As a matter of fact , however , these and all the other great inventions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds working during many years , although the man who finally completed the labor gets all the credit . Almost from the time when electricity began to be of practical worth in the world there were some people who were at work on the idea of perfecting contrivances for the electrical transmission of speech and other sounds . And in this department of endeavor , as in others , we find that the final and perfect instrument is the simplest . Reis 's Telephone. ? One of the earliest experimenters to realize successful results was Philip Reis , Instructor in Natural Sciences at Prof. Garnier 's Institute , a select school for boys , at Friedrichsdorf , near Homburg , Germany . His principle has frequently been described as " making and breaking " an electric circuit , in somewhat the same fashion as the electric telegraph transmits messages ; but Prof. Sylnanus P. Thompson , in a paper on Reis 's invention , read before the Naturalists ' Society of Bristol , England , in 1883 , declares that it was rather the " employment of a loose or imperfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the pressure and resistance might be varied by differing stress . 67 // On the occasion of reading this paper he exhibited a model of Reis 's original transmitter , which was shaped like the human ear , and was designed to work on the same lines . Fig. 56 shows a section of this instrument . Here we have an opening , A , corresponding to the meatus of the ear , and closed at the " inner " end with a membrane , B , corresponding to the tympanum , or drum . Immediately against this membrane rested the lower end of a curved lever of platinum wire , C ' , which represented the " hammer bone . " It was attached to the membrane with a drop of sealing wax , and was left free to move , as the membrane vibrated , by being soldered to a short cross-wire , serving as an axis , as shown in Fig. 57 . The upper end of the lever , D , rested against the end of a vertical spring , E , which bore on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , G. The contact of the spring could be varied , as occasion demanded , by the screw , H. The electrical connec tions were made by the wires , F and K , the former hearing a current to the lower end of the lever , through its connection at the center of the diaphragm , and the latter transferring to // the line the sound-impulses caused by varying the pressure of the lever on the strip of platinum , G , as it moved with greater or less force in obedience to the vibrations of the diaphragm , according to the motions of sound waves . A later form of the Reis transmitter was a box having two openings , one at the side for the mouthpiece , and the other at the top , closed by a diaphragm made from the smaller intestine of a pig . At the center of this membrane was cemented a strip of platinum in loose contact ? some say not touching ? with the point of a platinum wire held in position above it by a leaf spring , as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reis system was a steel knitting-needle wrapped around with a coil of insulated wire . It was , in fact , a form of electro-magnet , and was mounted on a violin or resonant box , which served as a sounding-board , and to this was later added a cover against which the ear was pressed to receive the sounds transferred along the wire from the transmitter . By the Reis system musical sounds could be transmitted with all the variations of pitch and loudness , although without timbre ? probably resembling somewhat the sound of a xylophone , or wooden piano ? and less perfectly , also , the sounds of the human voice ; the consonants being readily represented , but the vowels less distinctly , if at all . Prof. Reis anticipated many of the later features of the practical telephone , particularly the transmission of sound by the variation of pressure in an electrical circuit , and also made his receiver on the plan at first adopted by Prof. Bell ? an electro-magnet and a resonant diaphragm . His instruments attracted wide attention in that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of commercial usefulness , most probably because the transmission of speech was too imperfect , even if the social and business conditions had created a demand for such a contrivance . During the next sixteen years little was heard of the subject of transmitting speech by electricity , and when , in 1876 , Prof. Bell exhibited his imperfect instru70 A B C OF THE TELEPHONE . ments at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia , there was another sensation among scientists . House 's Telephone. ? Meantime , however , the musical tele-phone was much improved , and several independent experi-menters actually made some progress toward a practical speak-ing apparatus . Among the latter was Royal E. House , of Binghamton , N. Y. , who in 1868 invented and patented a device which he called the " electro-phonetic telegraph . " Its general construction included a sounding-chamber , open at the front end and closed at the rear by a diaphragm of varnished pine wood , to the center of which was attached a bar , with the object of imparting the vibrations of the diaphragm to the upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two instruments of this pattern at either extremity of a circuit , which includes a battery cell , can act alternately as transmitter and receiver , and actually convey spoken and musical sounds . Mr. House , however , seems to have had no conception of the value of his invention ; so he rested content with local celebrity , leaving the fame and rewards coming from the successful telephone to be gathered by another man eight years later . // Gray 's Telephone. ? Prof. Elisha Gray was also conducting experiments in telephony , and , strangely enough , entered an application for a transmitter very like Bell 's in general theory on the very day a patent was issued to the latter . Drawbaugh 's Claims. ? In 1884 , in a suit for infringement of patent by the Bell Telephone Co. against a concern known as the People 's Telephone Co. , brought to light the claims of one Daniel Drawbaugh , a machinist , of Eberly 's Mills , Penn. , to having invented a complete and successful telephone apparatus at least ten years before the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims by the testimony of 145 witnesses , who swore that they had seen the machines in operation in his shop or heard them spoken of by others between the years 1867 and 1876 . He also exhibited a series of models , the earliest of which he claimed was made in 1866 , and the latest about ten years after . His transmitters were constructed on the principle of the carbon granule instruments subsequently adopted by Hunnings and others , and his receivers were of the magnet type , now in use on all lines . His claims , if true , certainly present a strange case of almost perfect coincidence . But it was this fact , as much as any other , that moved the decision of the United States courts against him . In one of his experimental model receivers , dated about 1866 , the diaphragm is connected to the armature of an electromagnet by a taut string , a device adopted by Preece as late as 1879 . A still later one ( 1867-68 ) has the armature of the magnet on the diaphragm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in 1876 . About 187o he claimed to have devised a double-pole permanent magnet telephone , identical with that later patented by Bell , and to have further improved it by the use of spiral magnets , with a single-pole contact , as in some of the more modern forms of receiver . His case certainly deserves a passing mention . Bell 's Early Instruments. ? Prof. Bell seems to have made a large number of experiments with almost as many different // combinations before he finally hit upon the wonderfully simple instrument patented in 1876 . One of the earliest of his experimental instruments is shown in Fig. 59 . It consists of an elongated type of permanent horseshoe magnet , on each pole of which is attached a harp of rods , like those used in the familiar mechanical music boxes , each rod in the comb-like contrivance being cut to a length suitable to giving forth its own note . Now , when one sang near this instrument , he effected a vibration in the key corresponding to the note sounded by his voice , thus producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplitude , " proportioned to that uttered . This would produce an agitation in the field of the electro-magnet , in which a magnetically induced current was at once set up . The current , or series of currents , thus induced , traveled on the line wire to the coils of the other electro-magnet , which , in turn , attracted the corresponding key of the harp , with the same strength and shape of wave as that which left the " transmitter , " thus reproducing the sound by reversing the process . The theory of operation has been briefly expressed as follows : " The strength of the induced currents is determined by the amplitude of the disturbing vibration , and the amplitude of the vibration at the receiving end depends upon the strength of the induced currents . " It would seem , from the description of this instrument , that it presented the same difficulty as Reis 's ? imperfect transmission of the vowel // sounds . It was also impractical from the vast expense of manufacture . It is of interest , however , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his next experimental instrument Prof. Bell discarded the permanent magnet and induced currents , and adopted as his transmitter the type of instrument shown in Fig. 6o ? an electro-magnet mounted on a post by an adjusting screw , so that it may be approached to the vibrating diaphragm . This diaphragm is made of goldbeater 's skin , and bears at its center nearest the magnet a small piece of soft iron to act as an armature . This diaphragm , when vibrated by a sound , produced a variation of the current in the coils of the magnet by disturbing the field of force . This process enabled the current to transmit variations in the strength and amplitude of its vibratious to the receiver which could retransform them into waves of sound . The receiver was another electro-magnet , in this instance con sisting of a wire coiled about an iron tube . About this was an iron sheath , which was closed at its upper end by a thin plate of sheet iron lightly laid upon it , so that when no current was passing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vibrating current was able so to act on this diaphragm that the sounds varying the current in the receiver would be produced by similar currents , alternately attracting and releasing it . Such were the instruments exhibited at the Centennial Exposi tion in 1876 . Bell 's First Permanent Magnet Receiver. ? Later in the same year Bell discarded the elect ro-magnet and battery , and // returned to his original idea of a permanent magnet and induced currents resulting from disturbances in its field by the vibration of a metal diaphragm . What such disturbances of the magnetic field of force are capable of accomplishing we have already seen . Bell 's magnet telephone is , in fact , a miniature dynamo , and the sound-vibrations of its diaphragm transmitted along a line wire by the current they generate affect the receiver , which is precisely similar in construction , as a commercial current affects an electric motor . The receiver is thus , for a time , a motor , and when itself employed as a transmitter it becomes a dynamo . Bell 's final experimental instrument consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which was attached a bobbin carrying a coil of fine insulated wire . Directly in front of these coils is the diaphragm ? a thin iron disc supported in a wooden frame in such a manner that it can vibrate freely in obedience to the sounds uttered against its face through the mouthpiece . The relative distance of the diaphragm and magnet may be varied by clamps . He also used a bar magnet , and opposed but one pole to the diaphragm . In this instrument the final form of the Bell telephone was reached . It only remained to make a suitable case for it , as shown in Fig. 61 , and this need was supplied by the ingenuity of Prof. Pierce , of Brown University , Providence , R. I. In this figure , M is the bar magnet , B the wire-wound // bobbin , L and L the line wires carrying the speech-bearing current through the binding-posts , C and C ; D is the iron diaphragm , and F , the mouthpiece of the case . The present type of magnet telephone differs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the mouthpiece is now screwed to the head of the case by engaging a thread on the periphery , as will be noted in some of the figures of modern instruments given in the next chapter . Superiority of the Permanent Magnet. ? The permanent magnet is superior to the electro-magnet in a telephone instru. ment ; first , because it dispenses with the battery cell in the circuit , and second , because in the use of an electro-magnet the magnetic force and the stress due to the periodic vibrations ? contacts and withdrawals ? of the diaphragm vary in proportion , so as to compel the diaphragm to execute double vibrations in the production of any one sound . The double vibrations , while not observable , would have the distinct effect of rendering the reproduction of speech in the receiver less distinct . This was the case in the Bell instruments based on electro-magnets . Simplicity of the it was not thought of sooner , particularly when we learn that the principle on which it works was recognized years before Bell ever dreamed of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1837 a Dr. Page , of Salem , Mass. , first demonstrated the principle , that if a bar of iron be wound with wire , through which a current is passed , a distinct series // of sounds will be emitted by it every time it is magnetized or demagnetized . This is the basis of all receivers , from Reis to Bell . Page and his contemporaries attributed the sounds thus made to " molecular disturbances , whereby the bar was lengthened . " Somewhat later a Mr. Farrar , residing in New Hampshire , devised a receiving instrument , consisting of an electro-magnet whose armature vibrated in the center of an elastic disc or diaphragm , and thus received musical sounds ? he never thought of speech ? from a distant transmitter , constructed on the plan of Bell 's original experimental instrument , the several reeds or rods being set in vibration by a keyboard , at the same time opening or closing a circuit . Prof. Dolbear , of Tufts College , Mass. , has described this instrument in a lecture in 1882 , and compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tuning-forks , later devised to accomplish the same result by their vibrations , or to some of the harmonic devices now employed in quadruplex telegraphy ? the method of sending four messages over the same wire at the same time . The principle of harmonic vibrations , whereby , as we have previously seen , one string or bell of a certain note may call forth vibrations from another of the same note by merely sounding in its vicinity , is the one on which the modern system of " wireless telegraphy " is based . Prof. Bourseul 's Prophecy. ? In 1854 Charles Bourseul , a French scientist , published a paper on the possibility of transmitting speech by electricity , in which he says : " Suppose a man speaks near a movable disc , sufficiently pliable to lose none of the vibrations of the voice , and that this disc alternately makes and breaks a current from a battery ; you may have at a distance another disc , which will at the same time execute the same variations . * * * * It is certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transmitted by electricity . I have made experiments in this direction ; they are delicate , and demand time and patience , but the approximaHISTORY // Lions obtained promise a favorable result . " This favorable result was not achieved by Bourseul , however , but was delayed for twenty-two years , until Alexander Graham Bell perfected the telephone with the simplest possible electrical contrivance which could embody the principles laid down by the Frenchman . Sensitiveness of the Magnet Telephone. ? Not only is the Bell instrument a model of simplicity , but its degree of delicacy is simply amazing . This fact has been shown by a number of experiments described by Preece , the noted English telephonist . Siemens ' Experiment. ? The first mentioned was by I ) r . Werner Siemens , of Berlin . Ile took a Bell telephone , the pole of whose magnet was wound by Boo turns , or convolutions , of insulated copper wire , one millimeter ( .03937 inch ) in diameter , and of r ro ohms resistance , and placed it in the circuit of one Daniell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mechanical commutator , placed in the circuit , the current from the cell was reversed 200 times per second , thus giving a series of impulses which produced a loud crackling noise in the telephone instrument . By use of Ohm 's Law , previously explained , we find that a current of 1. o8 volt passing through a resistance of fro ohms is equal to .00981 amperes , or , approximately , . or ( 1b , r ) ampere . In other words , it is such a current as would deposit about .0000033 grams ( about **27;195;TOOLONG of a cubic centimeter , or about two-ten-millionths of a cubic inch ) of pure copper in one second , by the process of electro-plating . Such a current has an intensity of almost unimaginable minuteness , but Dr. Siemens further modified it by inserting a resistance of 50,000,000 ohms , and placing the primary winding of an induction coil in the battery circuit , the secondary winding being attached to the telephone . This added resistance must certainly have reduced the current strength to a point about equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity . But the induced current was capable of maintaining a loud noise in the instrument , which still continued audible even // when the secondary coil was pushed out clear to the end of the primary , thus reducing the inductive action of the primary coil to the minimum , and placing it beyond the reach of measurement . Preece 's Experiment. ? Mr. Preece himself determined by a somewhat similar line of experiments that the Bell instrument will reproduce a sound actuated by a current equal to .000,000,000,000,6 ( or six-ten-trillionths ) of an ampere in intensity , or such a current as could deposit about .000 , coo , 000,000,03 ( or **29;224;TOOLONG ) of a cubic inch of pure copper in each second of time . Similarly , by using an electrical condenser of one microfarad capacity , which was discharged through the circuit of a Bell telephone 16o times per second , a French electrician , Pellatt , calculated that , with a voltage of .0005 , representing the difference in potential , or electrostatic capacity , between the two terminals , an audible sound could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electro motive force would be of sufficient strength , as may be found by calculation , to produce one gramme-degree of heat in ten thou-sand years . That is to say , it would take ten thousand years for such a force to raise one gram , or cubic centimeter , of // distilled water from zero , Centigrade , to one degree above , provided that the water retained every atom of heat imparted to it in the meantime . Still another interesting experiment is recorded in Houston and Kennelly 's work , " The Electric Telephone . " These authors lay down the rule that the sensitiveness of the Bell instrument to feeble alternating currents has been estimated as best determined with a current of 64o alternations per second . This number corresponds , approximately , to the frequency of vibrations of the E note in the second octave below " middle C " in the piano scale . At this frequency , an alternating current strength of .000,000,044 ( or forty-four one-billionths ) ampere has been found able to produce distinctly audible sounds . Whether this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force required to maintain this current strength through the resistance of the usual telephone receiver , which is about 75 ohms , is so exceedingly small that the work done in raising a weight of thirteen ounces through a vertical distance of one foot , would suffice to keep an audible sound in the instrument for 240,000 years . Such figures prove , either that the Bell telephone is the " most beautiful illustration of the equilibrium and unity of natural forces in existence , " or else , that the standards of electrical measurements are on an entirely wrong basis . They are , however , of interest as illustrating the curious facts regarding the perfection of this simple contrivance , although of little account in the questions connected with practical telephony . CIIAPTER SIX . ! LATER MODIFICATIONS OF THE MAGNET TELEPHONE , In the experiments just recorded , for testing the marvelous sensitiveness of the magnet telephone , we have found that the best results were obtained with alternating currents ? those that are made to flow first one way and then the other ? and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than as a dynamo . The difference , as we have . een , depends on whether the instrument is used as a trans-mitter or as a receiver , since the motor differs from the dynamo only in the fact that it is made to move by the currents which the latter produces . Agitation of the magnetic field of force by t lie steady shifting of the armature produces a current , which , 1l n turn , may agitate another magnetic field and thus cause the armature to move in the same way . Conditions for Transmitting Speech. ? In order to improve the practical telephone to the highest point of efficiency two things are necessary , as we may readily understand : First , that the currents bearing articulate sounds should be , as far as possible , of the alternating type ? such has been found most effective for distinct transmission ; and second , that the mag-etic field in the receiving instrument should be as strong as possible , with every point of its available space utilized . The rst of these needs has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mounted with a voltaic circuit and induction coil . The second has been almost as well supplied by the numerous improvements in magnetic receivers , although in general practice the original pattern instrument , of ither one or two-pole contact , is still in common use . Magnet telephones are most often used only as receivers , on account of heir extreme delicacy ; and the carbon microphone has attained // almost universal use as transmitter , on account of its great power in this capacity , and the various devices used with it to produce a strong alternating current of varying pressure . Methods of Strengthening Magnet Receivers. ? We may say that there are three ways in which inventors have sought to raise the efficiency of the magnet receiver : first , by strength ening the magnet ; second , by increasing the number of the pole contacts ; third , by increasing the mass of the armature . By far the greater number of new variations fall under the first head ? strengthening the magnets . This result may be accomplished in two ways : either by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact with the diaphragm ; or , by " compounding " the magnet , or building it up by using a number of magnetized steel bars , in single or double-pole con-tact . Fig. 66 shows a compound bar magnet of the variety now most often employed in common receivers instead of the single rod at first used , as shown in Fig. 6i . Compounding the magnet is a method we may compare to harnessing a number of horses to a heavy wagon , and works with the same effect of combined strength . It is also preferable to employing single bar magnets of the same degree of power ; both because it is cheaper , and also because the several separate bars act on one another to prevent the magnetism from becoming exhausted as soon as it would be in any one of them used alone . Methods of Adjusting the Receiver .  --  Another problem which a number of inventors and manufacturers have sought to solve is one of construction : how to obviate the effects of the differing ratios of expansion and contraction , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber of the shell and the steel of the magnet . Because this difficulty had not been met , the earlier forms of Bell instruments were often rendered useless , for the time being , by sudden changes of temperature . The first inventors to attack this problem sought to regulate the distance between the diaphragm and the pole pieces by an adjust-ing screw , passing through the bottom of the case so as to push the magnet forward or draw it back . In such instruments the magnet was secured at the end furthest from the diaphragm . In more modern types the adjustment is effected by securing both magnet and pole pieces to a brass plate or cup , which is part of a rigid system including the diaphragm . The Siemens Telephone Receiver. ? Among the best-known types of magnet telephone is the Siemens instrument , which is widely used in Germany . In general the case , made of sheet-iron , is so constructed that it can stand upright on a table or a shelf , and this was the invariable rule with a variety in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an armature made to rotate between the two legs of the magnet and turned by a small crank in the side of the case precisely like the ordinary magneto-generator , to be described in a later chapter . The rotation of this arma-ture induces a current in the magnet coils causing the attraction of the diaphragm , in both transmitting and receiving instruments . A small ball laid upon the hori-zontal diaphragm supplies the means for making an audible signal under such stress . The magnet , made of a rather broad and thin strip of steel , is secured to the tail of the case by a screw . The pole pieces consist of two very small oblong // coils brought very close together , and attached to the ends of the magnet by two thin steel plates carrying the soft iron cores . The instrument is a very powerful one , and , in practice , is frequently used as both transmitter and receiver . The Neumayer Receiver. ? Another good instrument , also a German invention , is the Neumayer receiver , a section of which is shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other instruments . The magnet consists of five cylindrical rods , which touch at the " south , " or negative poles , and are held in position around the core of the armature coil by the brass ring , F. The coil is wound on a wooden spool , and through its center runs a thin brass tube , within which is soldered the core , consisting of a number of fine iron wires , of the kind used by florists to bunch together the stems of flowers . By this device it is believed that a greater inductive action is obtained , on the principle applied in the construction of induc tion coils , that this " lamination " of the core reduces the effects of the induced E M F due to the rapid variations of the magnetic flux passing through it , hence overcoming the danger of induced secondary currents and lowering the magnetic resistance . With the high frequency telephonic currents this is a consideration of vital importance . The core , moreover , is in constant contact with the magnet bars , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is contained in a brass box , X , on the top of which is screwed the cover , clamping the diaphragm in place . The wires are attached to the binding-screws at S and S , and the magnet is contained in a wooden sheath , which is secured to the brass head box . Defects of Early Receivers. ? Most of the earlier types of magnet receivers had either one of two grave defects in con-struction : either the adjustment of the magnet was made by a screw passing up through the tail of the case , as in Fig. 62 , or a screw near the poles engaged a thread in the inside of the case . In both cases the adjustment was uncertain , particularly in the hands of inexperienced persons , who would frequently damage instruments affected by sudden changes in temperature . // Boxed Coil Receivers. ? In the most improved makes of instrument the brass box for containing the magnet coils , on about the same plan as that employed in the Neumayer receiver , is rapidly being adopted . It is an arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a hard rubber shell , because , as has been ascertained , the " coefficient , " or ' ratio of expansion or contraction , under heat or cold , is about the same for brass and steel , and an adjustment between the core of the magnet and the diaphragm , once established , is likely to be maintained under all temperatures . Telephone Magnets. ? The magnets of the better class of telephone receivers are made of the hardest tempered steel and magnetized to a degree that will enable any one of them to lift a mass of iron weighing at least four ? some even as high as fifMODIFICATIONS // teen ? pounds . In practice the general experience seems to endorse the opinion that by improving the quality of the steel the power of the magnet may be best increased . Watchcase Receivers. ? In addition to the ordinary longmagnet receiver there is another variety of a much more compact and convenient shape , which , from its general form , is called the " watchcase " receiver . One of the earliest patterns of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole of which was placed the usual pole piece , directly under the diaphragm , the whole being enclosed in a case about the size and shape of the old-fashioned " turnip " watch . Later exam ples of this variety of receiver have either the arrangement of the Gower telephone ? a semi-circular magnet with two pole coils ? or a polarized ring magnet , the two coils being attached on the diameter . Watchcase receivers are most often used , with the head-gear attachments , by telephone operators at switchboard stations . The D'Arsonval Receiver. ? An interesting variation of the magnet receiver , in which the greater part of the strength of the magnet is supposed to be directly utilized in the operation of // the instrument , is the D'Arsonval receiver , widely used in France and other European countries . The inventor 's contention is that the only really useful part of the field of a telephone magnet is the part situated directly between the two poles ; the portion of each coil outside of this area being almost completely lost , and only furnishes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , he constructed the instrument shown in Fig. 78 . The permanent magnet is spiral-shaped , one pole ending directly under the center of the diaphragm and bearing the core of the pole-coil ; the other entering at the side of the wooden receiver case , and having at its end an iron cylinder which completely envelopes the coil , thus surrounding it com-pletely in a magnetic field of great intensity . The diaphragm is clamped in place in the usual fashion , and the conducting cords enter at the side of the case opposite the negative pole , MODIFICATIONS OF 1HE RECEIVER . $C connections being made inside . The instrument has given excellent results , although it has failed of a very wide use . The Phelps Crown Receivers .. ? The multiple contact receivers are less numerous , although worthy a passing notice . The earliest types were the Phelps " crown " receivers , designed in 1878 . The " single crown " type is shown in Fig. 76 . Here the magnets , bent double , are arranged around a common cen-ter , the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate coil , and the negative poles ending at the rim of the diaphragm . The " double crown " receiver , shown in Fig. 77 , is somewhat // different in construction , being really two single crown instruments , with two diaphragms separated by a common vocalizing chamber , in which was also introduced a cone-shaped piece of non-conducting material . Both these instruments gave good results and loud , distinct articulation , but the expense of making them prevented their general adoption . The Goloubitzky Receiver. ? An instrument of somewhat similar appearance is the Goloubitzky receiver , as shown in Fig. 79 . It consists of two circular magnets , to the four poles of which are attached the usual cores and coils ; these being wound in series , or the wire from the positive coil running over to , and around , the next negative coil , so that there is a negative con-tact at one terminal and a positive at the other . Goloubitzky observed that when the same message was delivered to several receivers at a station at once the sound was equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that to increase the number of contacts in one instrument ? really combining two or more instruments in one ? would increase the power of that instrument . The results , however , although good , hardly war-ranted the added expense and care required to get perfect receivers of this type . // The Ader Receiver. ? The last theory of improving the magnet telephone is that of strengthening the armature . The best known type of this construction is the Ader receiver , as shown in Fig. 80 . It consists of a single magnet , bent into almost circular form , and carrying a coil on each pole , after the fashion of all double-pole instruments . The magnet is generally nickel-plated , to serve as a handle . The special feature of this receiver is the small ring of iron , R , encircling the inner end of the mouthpiece , as shown . This ring , which is called the " super-exciter , " acts to render the field of magnetic force more intense , and is doubtless one cause of the remarkable efficiency of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the intensifying effect would be increased , in both this instrument and the D'Arsonval , if the whole mouth-piece were made of soft iron . There is a large number of receivers of patterns different from those described , in one point or another , but all combine the essential features of a permanent magnet , or magnets , bearing coils on the poles , and an iron diaphragm to receive and turn back into sound-waves the impulses brought along the line from the transmitting instrument at the far-away station occupied by the party with whom the conversation is being held . The instruments described are almost all in practical use , or have been , and an understanding of their theories gives a fair idea of the progress of telephony in several countries . CHAPTER SEVEN . THE CARBON MICROPHONE TRANSMITTER . Conditions for Good Transmission. ? As we have seen ; the earliest form of the Bell telephone circuit was simply two lines of wire ending at the poles of two magnet instruments , with no battery . This arrangement is very satisfactory for short lines , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the danger of meeting with unexpected objects that will impede or deflect the current . To meet such obstacles , and at the same time transmit a clear and distinct message , a stronger current is needed than the magnetic field of a Bell instrument can generate . As we have seen , also , the effect of an alternating current and varying resistance is another necessity for getting distinct utterances at a distance . The Theory of Varying Pressure. ? The need of a varying pressure to perfectly modulate the current was met in the Reis transmitter , but the light contact between the electrodes , as we have described it , created the constant danger of breaking the circuit and thus interfering with the perfect transmission of sounds . Conseqently , shortly after the introduction of the magnet telephone , a number of inventors began working on the problem of a practical transmitter , which should embody the principle set forth by the French scientist , Du Moncel , that , " if the pressure between two conducting bodies forming part of an electric circuit be increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished , and if the pressure be decreased , there will be an increase in the resistance . " Berliner 's Transmitter. ? One of the earliest attempts to make a variant pressure transmitter is shown in the instrument invented by Emile Berliner in 1877 . It consisted of a vibrating // metal diaphragm of exactly the kind used in the magnet receiver , and against the center of this was a metal knob , or button , held in place by a thumb-screw . One electrode was attached to the diaphragm and the other to the metal ball . By speaking against the diaphragm we cause it to vibrate , and hence alternately press hard and gently on the button , thus varying the pressure of the current supplied by a battery . Its working was not satisfactory . Edison 's Carbon Disc Transmitter. ? After an extended course of experiments to determine the most suitable substance for a varying pressure transmitter , Mr. Edison designed the carbon disc instrument , which embodies the theory on which transmitters have been constructed up to the present time . His first pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a small platinum disc and secured to the diaphragm by an adjusting screw . Later he modified his plan , and designed the instrument shown in Fig. 82 . Here the carbon button , C , made of compressed lampblack , is placed between two discs of platinum foil , F , and attached to the // enlarged end of the adjusting screw , S. In front of the forward disc of platinum rests a plate of glass , G , to which is attached a rounded button of bone or ivory , A , resting against the center of the diaphragm , D. This was a more practical instrument than was Berliner 's , but , as was later shown by Prof. David B. Hughes , of England , the carbon transmitter requires , not only a variant pressure , but , also , a loose contact of the electrodes at the start . In the theory of loose contact we see a memory of Reis 's instrument . Hughes 's Microphone. ? Hughes based his theory on a device invented by him , known as the microphone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 84 . Here we have a circuit of wire , including a voltaic cell and a telephone receiver , and having as terminals two steel wire nails . The circuit is closed by laying a third nail across the other two . If , now , a sound , as of the ticking of a watch , be made near the nails , it may be distinctly heard in the telephone receiver , although a considerable distance intervene . A more perfect form of micro-phone made on the same principle , consists of a pencil of battery carbon , sharpened at both ends , and loosely attached in sockets hollowed in two carbon blocks , which form the electrodes of the instrument . The whole , mounted on a reso-nant sounding-board , is extremely sensitive to minute sounds ? being literally , as its name indicates , to small sounds what the microscope is to small objects . // - runnings ' Dust Transmitter . Following up this theory of loose contact , Henry Hunnings , in 1881 , devised the original carbon grain transmitter , thus making a distinct departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevailing form of instrument , particularly in America . Fig. 83 shows a sectional view of this instrument . It is a circular wooden block in which a shallow cavity has been hollowed out . In this cavity is set a metal disc , making one electrode connection , and over it are a number of carbon granules , generally coke ; the whole being capped by the metal diaphragm , which forms the other electrode , and is clamped in place by the mouthpiece . The effect of the numerous granules of carbon is to give a multitude of contacts to transmit the varying stress of the diaphragm by the electric current . The result , in point of clear and loud transmission , is similariy increased , a fact which has caused the granule or " dust " system to be so widely adopted . The principal trouble , however , is that , in the simpler forms of this pattern , the granules are apt to pack under the oft-repeated stress on the diaphragm , and the efficiency of the instrument is thus impaired . The Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country and England is the Blake transmitter , shown in Fig. 85 . Here , M is the diaphragm , behind which is screwed an iron ring , carrying the two projecting pieces , B and D. Upon the upper projection , B , // is fixed the angle-piece , C , by means of the flexible brass strip , H with its lower angle abutting against the adjusting screw , IV , which is fitted into D. It is by this screw that the instrument may be adjusted whenever its working becomes defective . The diaphragm , an iron disc , is surrounded by a rubber ring , R , which is secured behind the mouthpiece by two " damping " springs , one of which presses on the rubber ring and the other on the diaphragm . On the upper arm of the angle-piece , C , are fixed two springs , F and G , the former of which is insulated from the metal of C by a clamp of hard rubber , or other suitable non-conducting material , L. The latter , G , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , F , carries on its extremity a short section of platinum wire , L , which rests directly against the center of the diaphragm , on one side , and against the carbon button , K , fastened in the brass cup , P , at the end of the spring , G. The motion of the diaphragm varies the pressure between the platinum point , L , and the carbon button , K , and thus varies the current which passes from the battery through the iron frame ring , thence through B , IT , C , G , P , K , L , F , and out again from the contact , Z , of the spring , F. The rather complicated series of springs and levers is intended to hold the contact pieces in position , so that no variation of the sound may be lost , either through a too loose contact or the wearing of the carbon disc . Varieties of Carbon Transmitters. ? Both the Hunnings and the Blake types of transmitter are constructed on the principle of the microphone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , susceptible of varying pressure , according to the movements of a thin metal disc , moved by the stress of the voice . There are three general types of carbon transmitter , all embodying these same principles : i . Carbon pencil transmitters . 2 . Carbon granule transmitters . 3 . Ball or button transmitters . Of these three kinds , the first is most like in pattern to the original Hughes microphone , consisting of two or more carbon pencils arranged in carbon sockets in a variety of // orders around the center of a wooden diaphragm . The idea of thus varying the arrangement is that the sound impulses , striking the diaphragm , spread in various directions and should be met by appropriately arranged carbon pencils . The D'Arsonval transmitter is among the most elaborate , each pencil being covered with a cylinder of sheet iron and a permanent horseshoe magnet being mounted behind the row of pencils , to provide an added means for producing a variable pressure , as it attracts the iron covers and holds them so long as the stress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitters are common in France and other European countries , but have gained no favor in America . Carbon Ball Transmitters. ? The ball , or button , trans-mitters are equally interesting and various , although the principle of their construction is only a type of the same kind of instrument as the pencil transmitter . Fig. 86 shows a form of this instrument , which consists of three parts : a carbon dia-phragm , a carbon block , or plate , having a number of round // cavities , and the same number of carbon balls , of a size to fit loosely into the cavities and be held in place when the carbon plate carrying them is fastened into a frame with the diaphragm . Another form of this instrument has one large ball , fitting into a cup of carbon or metal and held against a carbon diaphragm in the same manner . Berliner 's Universal Transmitter . Several types of modern dust transmitters employ , as the back electrode , a block of carbon with a series of cones or concentric circles , as shown in Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a carbon or metal diaphragm by a quantity of carbon granules , which are evenly distributed in the spaces between the cones or circles . thus preventing packing at any one point and distributing t'ie pressure . Of this type is the well-known Berliner Universal Transmitter , depicted in Fig. 87 . Here we see the peculiarities of its construction , which renders it desirable to place the carbon diaphragm in a horizontal position and allow the bark electrode , the circular-grooved carbon plate , to rest upon is . The grooved plate , C , surrounded by a cover of felt , F , which touches the diaphragm about its circumference , is held just above the diaphragm by a quantity of carbon granules to give // the variable resistance . On the center of the diaphragm rests a short rubber tube , held in place by the micrometer screw , E , thus serving to damp or modify the vibrations of the diaphragm . The same screw holds the carbon block in position and also holds the back electrode . The other electrode is at the brass ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back Transmitter. ? A form of carbon trans mitter most often used in the United States is shown in Fig. 89 . It is called the " solid back , " or White transmitter , and is one of the most efficient in use . The back electrode is a metal case , W , secured by an adjusting screw to the supporting bracket , I ' . It is lined on the inside with white paper , to serve for insulation . Inside , against the rear wall , fits the small brass disc , B , which carries a pin on its center to attach it to the sup-port , and on its face carries a button or plate of carbon . In front of and around this carbon disc is a quantity of granules , which rest on the other side against another carbon disc , carried on the brass button , E , from whose center projects the screw-threaded bars , R and Q. Over these fit the mica washer , M , the nut , U , and the cap , C , which is screwed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the vibrating diaphragm , I- ) , and is held in position by the nuts , T and T , which act as dampers . I00 A B C OF THE TELEPHONE . Improved Transmitters. ? The number of new transmitters constantly being put upon the market by various manufacturers is simply immense . Many of the features embodied are undoubtedly excellent , and many marked improvements have been made , both in efficiency and durability . Where carbon grain is used the principal problem has been how to prevent packing , or solidifying , which inevitably results in disabling the transmitter by destroying the loose contact . The Century Transmitter. ? The improved transmitter of the Century Telephone Construction Co. , shown in Fig. 90 , presents many points of excellence that are worthy consideration . It is one of the best of the several improved forms of the " solid-back " transmitter , just described . Here , D is the hard rubber mouthpiece ; A , the cup containing the electrodes ; B , the cover , secured to the bridge-piece , C , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge-piece is one of the features of this instrument , securing , as it does , perfect rigidity , and obviating all danger of warping or " buckling , " as must frequently occur in ill-constructed instruments . In the center THE CARBON TRANSMITTER . IOI of the bridge is screwed the brass cup , F ' , which contains a button of compressed carbon , . I. ' , and forms the back electrode . A similar cup , F ' , is screwed to the diaphragm , as shown , and forms the front electrode . The two are separated by the mica washers , H and H , and the felt washer , G , which form a chamber , L , to be filled with carbon granules . As will be seen , the chamber thus formed is enlarged into pockets at top and bottom , and into the lower one the carbon granules , having a tendency to pack , will settle out of the path of the current . Rapid and accurate adjustment may be obtained by turning the screw at F ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning wide favor is shown in Fig. 91 . It is manu factured in Sweden , and imported by the Ericsson Telephone Co. , of New York City . The principal features claimed for it are high efficiency and distinct transmission , with small battery power . The carbon granules used are prepared by a secret process ? a fact that has enabled the instrument to maintain its high reputation for many years . Reference to the figure will show that the general construction is much like that of the Ber liner Universal Transmitter , already described . Here , D is the diaphragm of ferrotype iron , to the rear side of which is secured a gold-plated disc , forming the front electrode . To the outer face of the diaphragm is cemented a cover of oiled silk , which proves an effectual protection from moisture . The // grooved carbon block , C , forming the second electrode , is secured to the rear of the case , from which it is properly insulated , and connection is made by the screw protruding at the end . Two double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . A ring of felt , FE , surrounds the rear carbon block , and , bearing against the diaphragm , serves to retain the carbon granules . Another ring of felt at the center of the block surrounds a small coiled spring , which still further damps the diaphragm , and prevents harshness of tone in speaking . CHAPTER EIGHT . THE CIRCUITS OF A TELEPHONE APPARATUS . Electrical Source of the Transmitter. ? As we have seen , the Bell magnet telephone , and the numerous variations of it , operates by a current produced by the agitation of a magnetic field , somewhat after the manner of a dynamo . We have also learned that , while it is immensely sensitive to small currents , it can not produce currents of sufficient pressure to successfully operate on long lines of wire , an alternating current of high voltage and variant pressure being best adapted to transmit the sounds of the voice and produce effects on the diaphragm of the receiving instrument . In the various types of transmitters we have described , we have seen that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two carbon contacts , or one carbon and one metal contact , but in this arrangement there is no provision for producing a current , as in the magnet telephone . The transmitter can only vary a current , consequently there must be some other source of electrical activity . This is supplied by a commercial voltaic cell , or battery of several cells , and in general usage we have the type of cell known as the " open circuit . " Open Circuit Batteries. ? The open circuit cell is so called because it has the power of recuperating its strength , or " depolarizing , " whenever the circuit is left open or is not in use . The closed circuit cell works best when in constant use , and has the power of constantly depolarizing itself . It is used where a strong current is constantly needed , as in telegraphy . The condition known as " polarization " is , briefly , due to the collection of minute bubbles of hydrogen gas on the face of the negative plate , which interferes with the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 103 // hence increasing the internal resistance of the cell . This effect is remedied in closed circuit batteries by a substance , known as the " depolarizer , " which in process of electrolysis constantly releases oxygen gas to combine with the free hydrogen . In the ordinary blue-stone Daniell cell the depolarizing agent is the sulphate of copper ( " blue vitriol " ) , which constantly releases oxygen and causes a deposit of metallic copper on the face of the copper electrode . The process of depolarization is , thus , dependent on the continuity of the current , and ceases with it . For this , among other reasons , this type of cell rapidly deteriorates when not in use . In the open-circuit cell , on the contrary , the most common and efficient type of which is the Leclanche , so named from its inventor , a celebrated French electrician , the depolarizer is dioxide of manganese , which surrounds the carbon plate When the circuit is open and current has ceased to flow , the oxygen is constantly given off from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manganese then absorbs a fresh supply from the air . Thus the battery is in best condition after a season of rest , and is not capable of continuous work , like the cells of the other type . This is the reason that open-circuit cells are used in telephone practice on short lines , although in long-distance telephony , where strong currents are required for long periods , the closed circuit cells are coming into more extended use . Fig. 92 shows a section of a common type of the Leclanche cell . In this figure the carbon plate is inserted in a porous cup and surrounded with a quantity of granulated carbon and manganese oxide . The zinc electrode is a pencil at the side of the porous cup , both being immersed in a solution of sal ammoniac . Dry Cell Batteries. ? Instead of the type of cell just described " dry cells " are frequently used in connection with the 7IIE TELEPHONE APPARATUS . I05 station telephone apparatus . These are in all respects like the ordinary cells , except that the liquid solutions are rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxychloride , gelatinous silica , or powdered gypsum . The advantage of this arrangement is that there are no liquids to spill and cause damage . Strength of Current Required. ? According to the principle that the variation in the strength of the current passing through the transmitter is the most important thing next to the consideration that the resistance should be as low as possible , so that the slightest variation should be effective , it would seem to follow that the stronger the current the more efficient the transmission of the voice . This is , however , not the case , as after a certain point the current tends to heat the carbon contacts , and thus destroy the transmitter in time . For this reason , a low resistance , low voltage battery , like the Leclanche , is the best for most short-distance transmission . In long-distance work there is needed a special form of transmitter if the use of the line is constant . Then a strong constant-current battery may be placed in circuit . The Induction Coil. ? During the first five years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always placed in one circuit . This was also true after the carbon transmitter had come into general use . In practice , however , it was soon found that practical results could not be obtained with the instruments in direct connection , since the changes produced in the total line resistance by the varying pressure of the transmitter electrodes were so minute in comparison as to be scarcely perceptible in the receiver at the other terminal of the circuit . In 1881 Mr. Edison devised a most effective method for remedying this difficulty ; connecting the two terminals of the circuit , including the transmitter and galvanic cell , with the primary winding of the induction coil , the secondary winding of which was connected direct to line . By this arrangement of the circuits ? which was really Professor Gray 's idea , and had // been used by him in connection with his harmonic telegraph as early as 1875 ? not only was the pressure of the line current increased in a ratio of about ten to one , but a rapidly alternating current was obtained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Action of the Induction Coil. ? As we have already seen in the section on induction , the inductive influence of one circuit on another becomes perceptible on two occasions : either when the circuit is made or closed , and again when it is broken ; or , in the same way , when the strength of the current is increased , either by adding to the voltage or diminishing the resistance , and again when it is similarly diminished . Thus each distinct roundnd , as it affects the diaphragm of the transmitter , decreases : Le resistance in the primary circuit of the induction coil , and aduces a momentary current in the secondary winding in the opposite direction to that in which itself is moving . Each sucessive reaction of the diaphragm and the variable pressure e1ectrodes at the completion of every successive sound induces momentary current in the same direction as that in which the primary current is moving . Thus the full effect of current alternation is obtained . Size of Telephone Coils. ? The dimensions of telephone induction coils , suitable for given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which questions regarding the size of the primary and secondary winding-wires and the length of the line must be carefully considered . Coils r long-distance work are longer and of greater inductive capacity than those used on shorter lines . One of the most efficient makes of induction coil for ordinary service is constructed as follows : The core is composed of about 500 lengths of wire of size 24 , B. &; S. ( American Wire Gauge , or Brown &; Sharpe ) , each wire in the bundle having a diameter of about two one-hundredths of an inch , or so . loo mils . The bobbin is four inches in length , and the core nine-sixteenths inch in diameter . The primary winding consists of about 200 turns of No. 20 I08 A B C OF THE TELEPHONE . wire , silk-covered , the diameter being about three one-hun-dredths of an inch , or 31.961 mils , and is two layers deep . The secondary winding consists of about 1,400 double turns ( two wires being wound side by side ) of No. 34 wire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch , or 6.403 mils . In a circuit including this coil it has been found that the pri-mary winding has a resistance of thirty-eight one-hundredths of an ohm , and the secondary about seventy-five ohms . It is necessary that the resistance of the primary circuit be as low as possible , in order that the minutest change in the resistance at the carbon electrodes may exert the greatest possible change in its circuit . The effect of the induction coil is to increase the electromotive force going upon the line in about the ratio that exists between the turns of the two windings . Thus , if the pri-mary winding consists of 100 turns , and the secondary of 2,500 , the ratio in electromotive force between the two will be about i to 25 . With this increase in the pressure comes a corresponding increase in the strength and amplitude of the impulses gener-ated in the trans utter , by the variation of the stress at the carbon contacts . This increase it the pressure of the current on line permits the transmission of the same impulses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have occu-pied themselves with the problem of making a transmitter that shall produce a true alternating current independent of the undu-lations of pressure that produce this effect through an induction coil . One of the most successful instruments of this type is the one invented by G. F. Payne and William D. Gharky , two telephonists of Philadelphia . Fig. 94 shows a section of this instrument , in which A represents the mouthpiece of the trans-mitter , enclosing one side of the diaphragm , D. B represents a closed cylindrical box , within which are five piston-shaped electrodes , three of them , X , Y , Z , being fixed , and two others , M and N , arranged to slide back and forth as impelled by a piston-rod attached to the center of the diaphragm by a screw // piercing its center . Each electrode bears plates of carbon , shown at C , C , C , C , C. The spaces between the electrodes are Idled with granular carbon , which is prevented from leaking out into other compartments by the felt washers , F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so attached that the movable electrodes , ill and AT , form the two terminals of the circuit . The three stationary electrodes , X , Y , Z , are connected , as shown , with the primary winding of the induction coil . The method of operation is as follows : When the sounds of the voice strike the diaphragm they produce the changes characteristic of sound waves , causing the diaphragm and the piston attached to it to vibrate , first inward and then outward . As a result of this action and reaction , in varying degrees of force , the electrodes M and AT are first brought into electrical contact with the electrodes Yand Z , and then , with X and Y. Thus , by the first motion , the circuit is closed by the wires at the right and center , leading into the primary of the induction coil ; by the second motion , by wires at the left and center . So the center wire is alternately positive and negative , and the left and right ones , in turn , form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through the primary of the induction coil , flows first in one way and then in the other . The effects , 1 alternation are thus vastly increased // The Magneto-Generator Bell Call. ? Before explaining the circuit arrangements of a telephone apparatus , it will be necessary to deal with just one more contrivance ? the bell call . As we have already seen , this consists of two gongs that are rung by the current generated in a magneto-electrical machine by turning a crank handle at the side of the box mounted at the top of the telephone back board . As constructed by the various manufacturers , this instrument consists of two , three , four , or even five , large horseshoe permanent magnets , so arranged that an armature mounted on the spindle of the crank can turn between the poles of the magnets . It will be seen that it is a dynamo-electrical machine in all respects except that permanent magnets are used instead of electro-magnets . Fig. 95 shows the armature core and Fig. 96 the method of winding on the insulated wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting . This wire , thus wound , acts to all purposes like the single loop armature shown in Fig. 28 , except that the large number of its turns permits a variation in the number of the lines of magnetic force that pass through it in its various posi tions . When it is horizontal these are fewest ; when vertical , in the greatest number . On this account , when the movement is from the horizontal to the vertical , the current generated flows through the coil in one direction , say , from right to left , as the generator stands in its box in the telephone apparatus ; when the movement is from vertical to horizontal , the number of magTHE // netic lines constantly decreasing , the current flows from left to right through the coils . The magneto-generator , from its very construction , is , accordingly , an alternating current dynamo . Strength of the Current Generated by the Magneto Call Generator. ? The current generated is a high pressure one , sufficient to carry the electrical impulses along an extended line wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or operate the switchboard drop , in the manner to be subsequently ex plained . Although on short private lines the ordinary voltaic cell and electric bell , such as is used in houses , is attached to the telephone apparatus , an arrangement of this kind is alto gether too weak to suit the needs of commercial , central station lines . On these lines , as in the " bridging " system of mounting telephones , the apparatus must often ring through a resistance of several thousand ohms , sometimes io , 000 ohms , which is a point of pressure far beyond the capacity of the strongest battery of voltaic cells practicable in connection with telephone systems of the usual type . I I 2 A B C OF THE TELEPHONE . The Bell Magnet. ? The current generated thus rings the bell , in both the calling and the receiving apparatus , by energizing the coils of an electro-magnet of the double-pole type , and causing it to attract its armature , to which is attached the clapper of the bell gongs . The construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen , the rod of the ringing clapper is attached to a bar of iron which is pivoted at the center . The pivot-pin is inserted in a piece which is fixed parallel to the axes of the magnet coils , so as to allow the armature to sway from side to side as it is attracted , first by one pole and then by the other . This pivot-post is an U-shaped permanent magnet , and its function in the apparatus is to act as a " polarizer . " That is to say , its duty is to magnetize by induction the pivoted armature and the cores of the electro-magnet . Thus , if the two cores of the magnet coils acquire a polarity of a positive quality , the armature will be negative , and , as a result , will be attracted to the one pole or the other of the electro-magnet . Since the coils are oppositely wound , a current passing through them will tend to strengthen one pole and weaken the other ; hence causing the armature to sway toward the pole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the generator is an alternating one , flowing in one direction and then in another , the armature is attracted by each pole succesTHE // lively , with the result that the rod , or clapper , vibrates with treat rapidity , striking first one gong and then the other , according as the currents cause the armature to be attracted to the poles . Resistance of the Generator. ? The armature of an ordi nary hand generator is usually wound to an internal resistance of at least 300 ohms , and in some cases as high as 700 . The resistance of the common type of ringer coil is between 75 and o0 ohms , although , when intended for use in bridging instru lnents , it is sometimes wound as high as i , 000 ohms . The purpose of inserting this high resistance , and impedence , in circuit , will be explained later . The telephone ringing appa ratus is one of the most efficient instruments of its kind in the market , and the delicate adjustment of its parts , the result of years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device it is , providing a thoroughly practical calling apparatus for even the longest lines and the noisiest stations . In order to avoid a rather natural misapprehension , it would be well to mention here that when , in telephone par-lance , one speaks of a generator of so many thousand ohms , reference is not made to the internal resistance of the armature winding , but to the output-power in E M F of the generator . Thus by a generator of 50,000 ohms we mean one that can ring its own bell through a line of that resistance . CHAPTER NINE . THE SWITCH HOOK AND ITS FUNCTION IN THE TELEPHONE APPARATUS . The Automatic Cut-out. ? From the descriptions so far given it may be readily seen that in a telephone apparatus there are two distinct circuits ? the calling circuit and the speaking circuit . Even a novice can understand that both can not be included in the line at one time ; since it is evident that the great resistance to the current offered by the generator and bell magnet coils would materially interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a perfect system by which either of these apparatus is cut out of circuit while the other is in use . The result is accomplished by the device known as the switch hook , the working of which has been described in Chapter One . The Attachment of the Switch Hook. ? One form of hook switch is shown in Fig. lea . While differing in some details of construction from the types produced by other manufacturers , it possesses all the essential features we need to understand . These are , briefly , the three points of electrical contact ? two below and one above the shank of the hook lever . As the hook in this cut is up that is , relieved of the weight of the receiver , which , as we have seen , is intended to hang upon it ? we see that the contact of the shank is with the two springs below . When the hook is down , or has the receiver hanging on it , the contact with the lower terminals is broken , and connection is made with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook when the telephone apparatus is not in use , and the receiver is hung . Then , by the arrangement of the wires ending at the lower and the upper contacts , the transmitter and receiver are cut out of circuit , and the calling apparatus is connected direct to line . Similarly when the receiver is removed 114 // from the hook , and it is allowed to spring up by the tension of the leaf spring which bears on the shank , as shown in the cut , the circuit of the transmitter battery is made , and messages spoken into the transmitter at another station may be heard in the receiver . This is the reason why the crank of the call-bell generator is always turned before the receiver is lifted from the hook . After one has taken down the receiver it is useless to continue ringing the call bell , as he merely makes a noise in his own office without in the slightest degree attracting the attention of the central station , or of the man at the other end of the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 102 shows , in diagram , how the switch hook operates to open and close the circuits of the telephone apparatus . The first section of the figure shows the conditions at " hook down " ; the second sec tion at " hook up . " The dotted lines indicate the wires not in use on either occasion . As may be understood , with very little study , a current entering the apparatus along the line wire , when the hook is down , will pass through or around the mag neto-generator , by means of an automatic " shunt , " to be pres ently explained ; thence through the coils of the call bells , causing them to ring ; afterward along the wire to the lower 1 16 A B C OF THE TELEPHONE . contact of the switch hook , through the shank and fulcrum of the hook lever , and out by the return line wire , in case it is a metallic circuit , or to ground , in case it is a grounded return circuit . As soon as the hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver , the circuit of the magneto and call bell is broken , and that of the talking instruments thrown in , by the contact of the hook shank with the two terminals , as shown in the cut . Then a spoken message entering the apparatus along the line wire , as before , passes through the coil of the receiver , to be delivered at the diaphragm ; or , a message spoken against the diaphragm of the transmitter , passes out by the same wire , by means of the primary and secondary windings of the induc tion coil , through the two contacts of the hook switch . Generator Cut-outs and Shunts. ? In the practical work ing of a telephone line it would be extremely undesirable to // allow the current entering the apparatus , for the purpose of sounding the call bell , to pass through the high resistance coil of the magneto-generator . Such a thing would greatly decrease the power of the current to ring the call bells . Thus , while it is desirable to have the circuits of the magneto so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally necessary to have it shunted , or bridged out when not in use . To accomplish this result a number of ingenious devices have been adopted , and are manufactured in connection with the apparatus of the several makers of telephones . The object of all is to furnish a line of lower resistance than the coil of the generator , and , by this means , to shunt the incoming current around the armature , and thence to the magnets of the call bells . Familiar Shunting Devices. ? Two of the most typical forms of automatic cut-out are shown in Figs . I03 and 104 . Fig . I03 shows the form of shunt used by the Bell Telephone 1 18 A P C OF THE TELEPHONE . Company . Its construction and theory are simple and effective . The gear wheel , A , is mounted on the crank-shaft , B , in such a way as to allow it some small freedom in turning . The shaft , B , bears a spiral spring , C , which is held against the terminal post , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result being that the point , F , of the crank is held in contact with the leaf-spring , G Thus an electric current entering the apparatus through the wire , H , passes through the spring , G , along the shaft , B , and thence to the coils of the call bell through the wire , IF . This is the arrangement which exists when the magneto is out of use , and the call bell free to be rung by currents coming from without . So soon as it is desired to operate the generator , this shunt is broken by the mere act of turning the crank handle . Turning the handle moves the pin , J , out of its slot , in the hub of the gear wheel , causing the binding collar , E , to compress the spring , C , against the post , D , and thus to release the point , F , from its contact with the spring , G. Because the spring , G , is // attached to the terminal post by an insulating block , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the generator is thrown in . This cut-out is a true shunt , affording a path of the lowest resistance in place of the long fine wire of the armature coil . The Post Cut-out. ? Fig. 104 shows the Post cut-out , socalled from its designer . Its operation depends upon centrifugal force instead of a pull spring . Here A is the shaft of the armature shuttle , which is turned by the pinion , B , worked by the gear wheel of the crank shaft . One end of the armature winding coil is attached to the shaft by the pin , C , and the other to the pin , D , which is insulated from the metal of the shaft , as shown by the shaded parts around it , and leads the current to the terminal connection through an insulated path . This pin has a platinum head , which , when the apparatus is at rest , is in contact with the bob , E , carried on the end of the light leaf spring , F , which , in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screw , G. So soon as the shuttle is revolved by turning the crank , the end of the spring , F , naturally flies outward , impelled by centrifugal force , until the bob , E , comes into contact with the stop , H. Thus the shunt circuit is broken , and the coil of the armature is thrown into action . It is necessary that the shunt be broken ; otherwise the generator would be short-circuited through the spring , F , and no current could emerge to ring the bells . I20 A B C OF TILE TELEPHONE . The Holtzer-Cabot Shunt. ? Like all appliances for telephones , the automatic shunting devices are manifold in number . One of the simplest and most effective of the more recent contrivances is shown in Fig. io5 . It is manufactured by the Holtzer-Cabot Electric Co. , of Boston , Mass . On the end of the armature shaft is mounted a small cylindrical brass box , in metallic contact with the spindle , and partly filled with copper granules , or short sections of copper wire , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical contact . So long as the armature is at rest , a circuit of the smallest possible resistance is established between the end of the spindle shank and the sides of the box . The slightest move ment of the armature disturbs this ; and , as soon as it begins to revolve , the metallic granules are thrown outward , by centrifu gal force , thus effectually breaking the shunt . Fig. io6 shows a generator furnished with a centrifugal shunt of this descrip tion . CHAPTER TEN . THE SWITCHBOARD AND THE APPLIANCES OF THE CENTRAL STATION . Telephone Systems , Large and Small. ? As we have seen , each telephone apparatus includes a transmitting and a receiving instrument ? the one to talk into , the other to receive the messages from some other telephone apparatus . It follows , therefore , that between any two apparatus there must be a line of wire suitable to convey the electric current bearing spoken messages . In a small system , with but few instruments , as in a country town or in a large manufactory , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every other , so that one telephonist may call up any other in the system by simply manipulating a switch attached to his own apparatus . Such small systems are known as " party lines " and inter-communicating systems , and their operation and appliances will be fully explained in another section . At present we are concerned only with the most familiar method of connecting the talking circuits of telephones . It is known as the " central station , " or exchange , system . Grounded and Metallic Circuits. ? It is hardly necessary to explain to any one that if an inter-communicating system were adopted in connection with any number of telephone stations above ten or twenty , or in any town of size and business activity , the amount of wiring necessary to complete the circuits would be beyond the possibilities of commercial expenditure . I t is positively essential that , in all but the smallest systems , each apparatus have but one circuit ? an incoming and an outgoing wire , or an incoming wire and a ground return . The " ground return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraphy . Here , as we know , the wire carrying the mes-I2I I 2 2 A B C OF THE TELEPHONE . sage current is strung on poles , or buried in cables , and the return current , that completes the circuit , flows through short lengths of wire to the ground , and thence back to the sending station . The attachment in the ground is made either by water mains or sewers , or by sheets of metal buried at the required depth . This system is impracticable in cities , where the ground is filled with pipe lines and other obstacles that would immensely weaken any current , or subject it to outside interferences ? sneak currents and contact with other circuits ? and most often destroy its power to transmit articulate sounds . To reduce these interferences to a minimum , metallic circuits , consisting of two distinct lines of wire , of the same size and material , are most commonly adopted . All lines are then carried to a central station , where are installed devices suitable for connecting , as desired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operation. ? For the purpose of making these connections a device known as a switchboard is employed . Fig. 107 gives an idea of the general appearance and construction of a common form of this apparatus . As may be seen , it consists of two distinct parts : a series of upright panels carrying drop shutters and round apertures under the annunciator numbers ; and a horizontal board or table , upon which appear a number of upright instruments , and in front of them a row of short levers . The panel apparatus thus consists of a number of small instruments such as are used on a hotel annunciator , which are known as " drops , " and of another series of instruments , fixed behind the round holes on the front of the panel , which are called " jacks , " or spring jacks . The upright instruments , that stand in rows below the panel-boards , are the " plugs " ; and each of them is secured at the end of a flexible cord , passing through a hole in the switchboard table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next figure , and held in place by pulley weights . The object of these plugs is to close the circuits between any two subscribers ' lines , one of a given pair being inserted in the // " jack " corresponding to the calling station , and another in that corresponding to the called station , connection being made between the two lines by means of the flexible conducting cords . The row of small levers at the front of the table are the operator 's " listening and ringing keys . " // Making a Telephonic Connection. ? The method of operating the switchboard is as follows : When any subscriber desires to have communication with any other , he will , as we have seen , operate the magneto of his instrument , thus sending a current along the line wire , which causes the shutter of the // drop to which his wire is connected to fall , thus giving his number to the operator , who sits in front of the switchboard table . Since each subscriber 's circuit is completed at the drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of causing the shutter to drop by thinking of the operation of the ordinary burglar alarm , or of a hotel teleseme . As soon as the drop shutter falls , the operator lifts the inner , or " answering , " plug of the two immediately under the row of drops in which this particular one happens to be , and inserts it in the hole of the jack bearing the corresponding number . Then , by moving the listening key in the row immediately in front of the drop and plug in question , she throws her own telephone set into circuit , and is thus able to communicate with the subscriber calling . Having learned the number of the subscriber with whom he wishes to speak , she takes the forward plug of the two immediately below the drop of the calling subscriber , and inserts it in the jack of the number corresponding to that of the subscriber called . This done , she moves the ringing key in the first subscriber 's row , so as to sound the call bell of the one called ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand magneto-generator attached to her section of the switchboard , as shown in Fig. ' o8 , or else by thus throwing into circuit the wire leading to and from a power-driven dynamo attached to the exchange . The latter is the plan adopted in all large exchanges . The Clearing-out Drop. ? As soon as the operator has attracted the attention of the called subscriber , she again shifts the key , thus throwing the two into one circuit , and enabling them to have their conversation . As soon as this is finished each hangs up his receiver and turns the crank of the magneto of his apparatus , thus causing to fall another drop , usually placed at the base of the panels , which is known as the " clearingout " drop . On receiving this signal , the operator restores the keys to their first position and removes the plugs from the jacks , allowing them to be drawn down by weights attached to their cords , to their place in front of the panel , as shown in the figure . I26 A B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As one might easily guess , the switchboard , like the telephone apparatus already described , is a combination of several different circuits , each of which works only when the others are cut out of line . When the telephone apparatus is at rest the call bells are in circuit , so , in the switchboard , the drop is normally ready to respond to the impulses sent along the line when the magneto-generator is set in motion . Just as the removal of the receiver from the switch hook makes the talking circuit of the telephone appaTHE // ratus , so the insertion of the plug in the switchboard jack cuts out the drop circuit and makes the talking connections . Grounded Line Switchboards. ? So far as concerns the construction of the line , jack and plug , there are two kinds of : itchboards : those for grounded circuits and those for metallic ircuits Fig. zio shows the details of a grounded circuit switchboard drop and jack . Here the current from the generator of the subscriber 's apparatus enters the switchboard apparatus at a ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jack belonging to that particular subscriber ; through the contact screw , c , which is insulated from the metal of the jack , as shown ; through the wire leading from it to the coil of the electromagnet , a The result is that the magnet attracts the armature , e , raising the attached lever , f , and thus freeing the hinged drop shutter , g , which falls , attracting the attention of the operator , and disclosing the number of the calling subscriber . The condition of the drop apparatus , before it is affected by the current , is shown in Figs. 116-117 . Here we see that the armature , e , of the magnet , not being attracted , holds the position shown by the weight of the bar , f , which , by the hook at its end , retains the shutter , g , in its normal position . Circuits of a Grounded Line. ? Immediately on noticing the drop number the operator thus closes the shutter and inserts the plug in the jack . By this act , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces the spring out of contact with the point , thus cutting out the drop from line , and , aking a new circuit through the conducting cord attached to e plug , as shown in the figure . The current , then , no longer goes to earth by the ground wire , but tlrough the grounded connections of the two communicating t .. ephones , when their lines have been joined by the two plugs and cords standing in the row just beneath the drop of the calling subscriber . It is essential that the two plugs , used to make connection between any two subscribers , should belong to the same pair ; since each pair is connected through the conducting cords with one set of I ? $ ABC OF THE TELEPHONE . listening and ringing keys , which play the parts already described . To attempt a connection with any two plugs not in the same pair would mean failure to make a circuit between the two subscribers ' apparatus . // Switchboard Plugs . The plugs used in switchboards having a grounded circuit consist simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conducting cord by suitable screw connections . In a switchboard of a metallic circuit the plugs are made with double connections , in order to maintain the lines of the two wires , the line and the return , throughout . Their construction will be explained later . Grounded Switchboard : Operator 's Circuits . The circuits of a grounded line switchboard are also indicated in diagram in Fig. i io . Each of the plugs , A and R , is connected by its flexible conducting cord with the apparatus of the ringing keys , C and D , respectively . As will be seen from this diagram , which uses the simplest forms of listening and ringing devices , each of these keys has two contacts , i and 2 , so as to enable it to stand in line with either of two circuits . Upon perceiving that a drop bearing a number , say , lo , has fallen , the operator inserts plug A in the same numbered jack , and at the same time pushes down upon the listening key , L , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R and T , thus enabling her to converse direct with subscriber number to , the circuit being established from the ground connection of his apparatus , through the outgoing line wire , the spring jack of the switchboard , the plug , A , and its cord , to contact i of key C , and thence through key L , to the section talking apparatus , which is provided with receiver , transmitter , battery and induction coil , in precisely the same manner as the subscriber 's apparatus , and ending the circuit in the ground connection . Grounded Switchboard : Line Circuits. ? On ascertaining that io desires to converse with 84 , for example , she inserts plug h in jack 84 , at the same time pressing key D to its contact , 2 , thus throwing into circuit the magneto-generator , G , which is operated either by hand or on a " bus wire " from a power driven dynamo in the exchange . A circuit is thus made from ground in the exchange , through the generator , G , contact 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 84 , line wire 84 , apparatus ISO A B C OF THE TELEPHONE . 84 , to ground ; thence back again , causing the bell of 84 to ring . This done , the operator restores key D to its normal position in connection with its contact , i , thus throwing to and 84 into a circuit which is bridged across by the clearing-out drop . This is constructed precisely like an ordinary line drop , although generally of a higher resistance  --  between 50o and 1,000 ohms . This high resistance and self-induction is used in order that these drops , permanently bridged across the circuit , may not shunt the telephonic current . They are also enclosed in soft iron tubes , for the purpose of increasing the electro-magnetic effect , and also to prevent induction from other drops and lines . After the two subscribers have been connected in the manner indicated , the operator may keep her listening key depressed in order to find out whether connection has been made , if 84 has answered the call . She then breaks circuit with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised position . So soon as the conversation is ended the subscribers hang their THE TELEI'HONE SWITCHBOARD . ICI receivers on their switch hooks , and turn the cranks of their magneto-generators , thus sending along the line a current of sufficient strength to operate the clearing-out drop , the talking current being too weak for that purpose . As soon as the operator sees the shutter fall , she knows that the conversation is ended , and removes the plugs from the jacks . Metallic Circuit Switchboards : Plug and Jack. ? The apparatus of a metallic circuit switchboard is arranged to accomplish the same results , although differing in numerous details of construction . As , however , metallic circuits are almost universal in present-day telephone practice , it will be necessary to examine such apparatus in detail . Fig. iii represents the construction of a metallic switchboard jack . As will be seen at once , its principal point of difference is that it has three points of circuit connection  --  A , B , and C. This is a feature common to all its various forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be readily seen that they are the same as those in a grounded circuit jack . The third wire is connected to the binding screw at C , and separated from the other two by the insulating blocks of hard rubber , D I 32 A I ? C OF THE TELEPHONE . and E. When the telephone circuits are not in use , the leaf spring , F , connected to the terminal , A , is in contact with the point , G , insulated from the tube of the drop by the hard rub-ber piece , 1f , and in electrical connection with the terminal wire , B , so that a current coming from the generator of a sub-scriber 's apparatus through the wire , A , passes entirely around the jack into the coil of the drop , as in the form of switchboard just described . The plug used in a metallic circuit board is similarly compound , having two metallic contacts , insulated from one another , instead of the one used in the grounded cir-cuit board . Fig. 112 snows the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball-pointed tip , A , as in the other type of plug , for the purpose of engaging the leaf spring ' THE TELEPHONE SWITCHBOARD . T 33 of the jack , and cutting out the circuit of the drop coil . A is enclosed in a hard rubber tube , E , which acts as a bushing to insulate it from the other contact metal part , the sleeve , C , which , in turn , is enclosed in the rubber handle , F. The contact , A , is attached to one wire , G , of the conducting cord by a screw at B , and the other contact , C , is similarly attached to the second cord wire , H , at D. Circuits of a Metallic Switchboard. ? When the double contact plug is inserted in the jack of a metallic circuit switchboard , it closes a circuit having one terminal at F , in connection with the wire , A , in Fig. 111 , and the other in the tube of the jack , at f , through the wire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screw , as is shown . Thus the speech-bearing current enters at A , and returns to line at C , the current being continued through the two wires of the plug cord , and completed in the operator 's table apparatus , her talking set , or the line and apparatus of another subscriber , in a manner similar to the system previously described . Metallic Switchboard : Operator 's Circuits. ? The cir cuits of a metallic circuit switchboard are shown in Figs. 118-119 . Here , as in the former figure , the inner is the " answering plug , " to be inserted in the jack of the calling subscriber , and the outer the " calling plug , " which is intended to be inserted in the jack of the subscriber who is called for . As // may be seen , there are two wires from each plug , corresponding to the double contacts , tip and sleeve , of each plug . They may be traced through the flexible cords , which are held down by // the pulley weights , when not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the combined " listening and ringing key , " as shown in Fig. 119 , The construction of this and other switchboard keys will be explained later , but it is intended to accomplish the self-same results as are accomplished by the three keys , C , I ) and L , in Fig. rio of the grounded circuit board . Operation of the Switch Key. ? By the use of the lever of this key , the circuits of the two plugs , or of either of them , may be changed , as in the other type of board , and , by the use of the two press keys , on either side of the lever , the ringing generator may be thrown into the circuits in precisely similar fashion . These results are accomplished , as may be readily understood , by the fact that the circuits of the ringing generator , of the operator 's telephone set and of the clearing-out drop , also terminate in the key , as indicated . This mechanism enables the same program to be followed as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been inserted in the jack of the calling subscriber , to wit : I. The cutting-out of the drop ; 2 . The throwing-in of the operator 's talking set ; 3 . The insertion of the calling plug in the jack of the called subscriber ; 4 . The making of the ringing circuit with the apparatus of the called subscriber ; 5 . The connection of the two lines with the clearing-out drop bridged on their circuit . The difference to be constantly borne in mind , in comparing the metallic with the grounded circuit switchboard , is that the latter must be so wired as to permit of all circuits made ending in a grounded connection , either at the exchange or at the subscriber 's apparatus ; the former is so constructed that all circuits , short or long , are composed of two metallic lines throughout , permitting every current used to emerge from and return to its source direct . CHAPTER ELEVEN . THE OPERATOR 'S SWITCH KEYS AND TELEPHONE SET . Combined Listening and Ringing Keys. ? Since , in order to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the operator must perform no less than seven distinct acts in the way of shifting and changing circuits , it has been the constant effort of inventors and manufacturers to produce devices to simplify her work , by allowing the greatest number of results to be accomplished with the fewest movements of her hands and arms . The object is , not only to save the operator 's strength , but also to economize time in the " rush hours " at an exchange . Thus it is that a great variety of keys has been devised , on almost as many different principles ; and attachments for making the operator 's listening and ringing circuits have also been combined with the plugs and jacks . It has been found , however , that an experienced operator can do the necessary work with the ordinary devices , quite as readily and easily as with some others intended to save her work . The Cook Switch Key. ? The key shown in Fig. 120 is of the form known as the Cook key , invented by Frank B. Cook , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interior view of this kind of key is shown in Fig. i 21 , which also shows its details and operation . Its mechanism consists of five pairs of metallic spring contacts , a hard rubber insulating partition running in the length of the case , serving to divide it into duplicate halves ? that is to say , one of each pair of springs is set on either side of the partition . The arrangement may be understood from the exterior view of the key . 136 // Its Constl ? uction. ? Turning , now , to consider the details shown in Fig. 121 , we find that the lever , A , ends in a cam , B , turning on its pivot , and so shaped as to work on the two springs , C and D , as shown . This cam extends through the hard rubber partition , so that the changes effected on one side are also effected on the other ; thus , in studying its operations , we must bear in mind that there are two springs C , two D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each pair , one spring being on each side of the partition , forming the terminals of some particular circuit . The pair of springs , E , terminate in the tip and sleeve of the answering plug ; the pair F , in the tip and sleeve of the calling plug , the pair C , in the coil of the clearing-out drop ; the pair G , in the magneto-generator . The operator 's desk telephone set is connected with the springs , D D , opposite to C C. The pair B , and the pair F , being always in contact with the pair of double springs , H , which are connected together , as shown by the upper dotted line in the diagrams , and make a permanent circuit between the tips and sleeves of the two switchboard // plugs . The lever being pressed all the way to the left , the coil of the clearing-out drop is bridged into the plug circuit , as is the case when two subscribers are conversing . Thus at the completion of any conversation the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its Operation. ? When a subscriber calls , the operator inserts the answering plug connected with the pair of springs , E , into the jack , and by moving the lever into the position shown in the first diagram of Fig. 121 , bridges in her speaking set , so as to make a circuit with the apparatus of the calling subscriber , through the jack , from the tip and back again to the sleeve of the plug . Having learned the number of the sub-scriber desired , she inserts the plug connected with springs , F , in his jack , and presses key , A ' , thus forcing the pair , F , out of their normal contact with the double pair , H , and into contact with the pair , G , thus throwing in the ringing generator , which // sends a current along the line to his apparatus , through the conducting cord , plug , jack , line wire , his ringing apparatus , and hack to the switchboard generator . This done , she releases the key , K , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with the springs , II , and breaking the generator circuit ; at the same time bringing the lever , A , to the opposite position , as shown in the second diagram of Fig. 121 , thus making a circuit between the apparatus of the two subscribers , and bridging in the clearing-out drop , connected to the pair , C. As soon as she has ascertained that connection has been es tablished , she moves the lever to the position of diagram one , its normal position , thus cutting out her set , and leaving the two subscribers to continue their conversation . If , at any time , she wishes to " listen in , " in order to find whether they are done talking , she can do so by bringing the lever to the opposite position , as shown in the first diagram of Fig. 121 . Whenever
