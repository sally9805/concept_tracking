txt The disclosure of the civil list proposals of the Government by The Times yesterday has created a flutter . Mr. Balfour , when asked about the matter in Parliament , said the documents were private and confidential , and he regarded the disclosure as in the highest degree deplorable and discreditable to the channel through which they had been communicated to the press . He seemed to insinuate that a member of the Civil List Committee was guilty of the disclosure . It is believed , however , that this was not the case . To-day a question will be asked in the Commons with a view to endeavoring to bring The Times under the penal law against improper disclosure of official documents . PATENT LIFEBOAT UPSETS .

The men had pulled the boat but a short distance down the slip when the craft suddenly tilted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A large crowd had gathered to watch the experiment , and immediately there was great excitement among the people on the pier . Nearly all of the men , who had been thrown out of the boat could swim , but there were three or four of them who had been caught under the boat , and they struggled desperately to get free . Andrew Peterson , thirty-four years old , a carpenter , who lived at 51 ' 7 ) Thirteenth Street , Brooklyn , was the one man drowned . He sank before a rope could be thrown to him . His body was recovered . Peterson leaves a wife and four children , and a collection was taken up among the employes of the pier for the benefit of his family . Coroner Burger will hold an inquest .
