Argument : Joe Brooks , attributing his failure of advancement to injustice instead of to his lack of ability , misappropriates funds which he believes he can recoup by gambling . Detected in his wrong-doing and panic-stricken at the imminence of punishment , he asks his wife to intercede with his employer by trading on her charms . What sort of a bargain the young woman will propose , the terms that the employer will exact , and the future relations of Joe with the girl who married him for love remain to be solved . The discontent of Joe Brooks usually finds free expression when he is helping his wife wash the dishes in their little Harlem flat . He is a rather good-looking fellow , twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old . He has become disgusted with his position as a collector for the Latin-American Steamship Company . When he married Emma Harris he confidently expected that the influence of her father , who was general manager of the company , would insure his advancement , but Mr. Harris died soon after their marriage and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother and younger sister , Beth , regard her struggle as nothing short of martyrdom . As he clears the dining-room table with a gingham apron tied about him , Joe 's bitterness is uppermost . He has just been denied an increase of salary to which he believes himself entitled . At the same time some of the other employees have received increases in pay , among them Jim Smith , or " Jimsy , " who was a close competitor for Emma 's hand until her romantic nature asserted itself unmistakably . Emma begs Joe not to keep asking if she does n't feel that she made a mistake ; she married for love and wishes he would leave unsaid the things that might make her regret it . The housework is scarcely done when Jimsy calls . Joe continues his complaint in the presence of their friend . More than half the money of the line passes through his hands , he says , and yet he slaves for a miserable living . He calls Captain Williams , the owner of the line , a niggardly beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he says . Of course he is n't going to , but when he asks for a raise not only he does n't get it but Captain Williams comes around with his mother-in-law as if for the express purpose of adding insult to injury . Emma thinks Captain Williams means well . JOE BROOKS ironically . That 's it , he means well . He meant well when he was a South Pacific trader . He meant well when he treated his crew like dogs . He meant well when he 'd kill a sailor with as much thought as a spider kills a fly . He meant well when he cheated natives , murdered men , smuggled Chinamen into this country , sunk vessels for insurance ; he meant well when he came East , bought the Latin-American Company and put your father out of business , and now  --  now that he has his money , his millions , he means well when he refuses to give his men a fair share of what they produce . Means well  --  yes , he does  --  not ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the matter ? JIMSY Well , there 's a whole lot of truth in what Joe said . You see Williams did start out as a captain of a South Pacific trader , but like most of them fellows I guess he stole a good deal more than he traded . He had the reputation of being the strongest man on the coast or in the tropics  --  he could break a man 's arm with as much ease as you 'd snap a straw . He 's harsh , Williams is  --  harsh . When he came East he got control of the Latin-American . He loved money and he got it  --  most any way he could . Yes , Joe ought to have more , that 's sure . He ought to have more.Captain Williams often takes Emma 's mother and sister motoring , and , as it happens , brings them around this evening . Joe goes out the back way when they are announced . Captain Williams finds the flat very cozy , but Beth calls it a little bit of a stuffed-up place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that perhaps she will . Mrs. Harris says quite plainly that she ca n't see how Emma stands the drudgery . Captain Williams , as if feeling bound to justify himself , declares that he is not close ; business is business . If he has money nobody gave it to him . MRS . HARRIS And that 's right . I believe in men getting money . My late husband was one of those soft-hearted men who never made the best of his opportunities  --  always trying to be fair and square with other men , and what was the result ? His will was a disappointment . p. 4 EMMA Mother , please  --  MRS . HARRIS It 's true . If he had n't been that way do you suppose you 'd be here , doing your own work ? EMMA Mother , I insist  --  you must not  --  BETH Mother is perfectly right . Emma , you do n't deserve this kind of life . EMMA But have I complained ? Why do you say such things ? MRS . HARRIS half to herself . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting yourself . Tied up to the house all the time  --  and everybody , all my friends , know just how you are fixed . You 're never invited anywhere any more . BETH Completely forgotten . EMMA Please do n't  --  it 's my affair  --  and besides , before people  --  MRS . HARRIS Oh , well , you might say the Captain 's one of the family since your father died . I knew you never should have married Joe . That he could n't take care of you the way you ought  --  Joe comes in . He throws down his hat and faces them all . Emma gets up and Jimsy also rises . Joe turns to Captain Williams . JOE BROOKS I 'll tell you why  --  you damned slave driver . p. 5 EMMA Joe ! JIMSY placing his hands on JOE 'S shoulder . Steady , Joe , boy  --  JOE BROOKS No , leave me alone . Shakes him off . It 's because that man  --  points to the captain  --  is n't on the square . EMMA Joe ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair . As Joe proceeds to denounce him his eyes narrow to mere slits , his mouth compressed , consumed by a mighty rage . JOE BROOKS He began cheating by murdering niggers who worked for him aboard his rotten trading ships . Then after he got through with the belaying pin , after he 'd got his money , he picked up the salary list for a club , and now he maims and murders with that . Goes nearer the Captain . My wife here is only one of hundreds , and she suffers ? To MRS . HARRIS and BETH . It is too bad she married me . It is too bad she 's got to do her own work ; it is too bad that she 's got to wash and scrub in the heat , but that man 's to blame . To the Captain . If you gave me a fair share of what I produce , if you did n't grind down , oppress , and pinch she would n't have to  --  I 've worked for you for five years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been grinding me down , down , and thousands of others , thousands  --  and now  --  p. 6 EMMA Joe ! JOE BROOKS Oh , you all know  --  all of you ! To the Captain . You 've piled up your money on the blood and sweat and misery of others . That 's the kind of man you are , and you might as well know it  --  to hell with you  --  to hell with you ! Captain Williams arises and gathers all the tremendous strength he possesses . The alarm of all is manifest . The expression of his face is one of evil malignancy . Joe shrinks back , but his wife stands firm , then rushes between them . Jimsy takes a step forward . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS advancing a step . There ai n't no one ever said them things to me and got away with it . He takes another step . It is evident he is going to crush JOE . EMMA standing between them . Please  --  please  --  Captain , for my sake  --  JOE BROOKS shrinking back in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on  --  Captain Williams looks at Emma . His attitude changes . His muscles relax and a faint smile twitches the corner of his mouth . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS All right , Mrs. Brooks  --  I almost forgot  --  I apologize . p. 7 EMMA Joe ! Joe ! You know it 's our home . JOE BROOKS sulkily . I  --  I  --  forgot  --  Excuse me ! Jimsy tries to smooth things over . Mrs. Harris and Beth leave hastily . Joe and the Captain have resumed their seats , Joe keeping his eye on the Captain . Then Joe rises , tries to speak , comes near crying , and goes out , slamming the door . Captain Williams expresses regret at what has happened . He says he may have been a little hard , but he has had a hard life with hard men since the day he shipped before the mast in a North Pacific sealer . He learned that the only thing that stands between blows , rotten grub and scurvy on the one hand , and comfort and decency on the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy an apartment in a semi-fashionable hotel . Emma wears very pretty gowns , and is radiant with the happiness brought by a great change in material circumstances . To her the best thing of all is that Joe has succeeded . She tells Beth that she will never forget the night when Joe came home with the news that his salary has been nearly tripled , and that he had also received three months back pay at the new rate . Captain Williams has gone to South America and taken Jimsy with him . It is not known when they will return . Emma says that Joe seems worried , and she supposes it is because he is anxious to succeed in his new position . It appears that Joe is greatly interested in the races but declares he never bets on them . Emma , her mother , sister , and Joe are together when the telephone rings . Emma answers it and then says that she has a surprise to announce . Jimsy has come back , six weeks before he was expected . Mrs. Harris hopes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma . She wants to thank him for Joe 's raise . Joe tells Emma sharply she must do nothing of the kind . He wants them all to understand that his business is his business . He does n't want it discussed with either Smith or Williams . What he 's got he 's got , and it 's nobody 's affair but his . If any one of them has anything to say about him or what he does he tells them to say it now or shut up . Mrs. Harris is very indignant at being spoken to in such a manner . Jimsy puts them off when they ask about the Captain . He tells a long story about an incipient revolution in Guatemala before finally admitting that he supposes Captain Williams is on the way home . Mrs. Harris and Beth go into another room to put on their hats and Emma accompanies them . Then Jimsy tells Joe flatly that he has been found out . p. 8 JOE BROOKS jumping up . How found out ? JIMSY The money you 've taken . JOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've taken money , you 're a liar ! JIMSY rises . Joe , Joe , this ai n't no time to four flush with me . I 'm your friend , boy , and you need one now , besides , there 's Emma to think of . JOE BROOKS choking . I do n't know what you mean . JIMSY Williams has been home three days . He has had the books looked over at night . Joe turns pale . Jimsy says the Captain seemed to know what Joe was doing from the time he took the first dollar ; apparently he went away to give Joe a free rein and thereby get even for what Joe said that night in the flat . He says the situation is very bad , but that he is going to stick by him . Detectives are on the watch and Joe ca n't run away . Mrs. Harris and Beth are going to the theatre , and Joe starts with them to escort them . Jimsy is left with Emma , and he undertakes to prepare her mind for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells her something of his own origin in Colorado . It is rather uncertain , and the fact is that not knowing his father 's name he took that of Smith . Other fellows sometimes are unfortunate , he says , in having a hereditary fault , a weakness that grows on them and never can be stopped . They think they are doing the best they can at the very time when they are going to the bad . She thinks that paradoxical . p. 9 JIMSY No  --  for instance  --  out in Denver I knew a fellow married a girl who 'd always had pretty much what she wanted , but he 'd been in hard luck . It was a love match all right , both parties being clean foolish over each other . Well , he did n't get on and she had to work pretty hard . Finally he thought her health and spirits were about busted up on account of the work and he commenced appropriating other folks money  --  got way in and the harder he tried to get out the deeper he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a thief . Now what do you think about him , Emma ? D'ye think because he was long on love and short on honor he was all bad , eh ? EMMA Well , I 've always hated a thief and a liar . I know there 's an awful lot of dishonesty  --  in business , but father declared that a man to drink or gamble and dissipate might be weak , but a man who stole or lied to injure people was vicious  --  somehow I think that , too . JIMSY Well , maybe you 're right , but I wondered if you 'd been in his wife 's place if you would n't have sort of forgiven the man , and helped him get right . Pause . Well , you did n't blame me for what I could n't help  --  so why should you blame him ? Captain Williams is announced . Jimsy gets no further . Captain Williams says he has come to see Joe and will wait for him to return . Emma tells him that Joe seems a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility of his new position . The Captain declares he shall have a chance to make good , and very soon at that . Now that it 's out , Emma thanks him for the raise and six months back pay . The Captain wants to know if Joe told her that . Jimsy puts in that of course Joe did , and tells Emma not to let the Captain fool her . p. 10 CAPTAIN WILLIAMS Well , I must be a real nice little fellow ! EMMA Oh , you do n't know how happy it 's made us all  --  I feel like a new woman , and mother appreciates it , too . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS Well , seems that I done all these things  --  The door opens and Joe enters . He is startled at finding himself face to face with the Captain . Emma explains how she happened to thank Captain Williams for the raise . Joe asks stammeringly if they are trying to make fun of him . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS Now , now , now  --  Brooks  --  you sure are nervous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys your new income . There is a moment of embarrassment . The Captain surveys the room . You sure are fixed up mighty snug here , Mrs. Brooks . He says he is glad to see her so happy . He never did know before what a little money means to a woman . He asks Joe to get down to the office early the next morning . He is afraid that now Joe is prosperous he may oversleep . He takes his leave . Jimsy gets a chance to warn Joe not to tell Emma yet , but Joe has gone to pieces and blurts out a confession . He says the money they have been living on he stole from the company , and the Captain knows . Jimsy for once is at a loss what to say . Emma does n't realize what it all means at first . p. 11 EMMA slowly in a suppressed voice . Joe  --  you mean , that you  --  JOE BROOKS brokenly . I 'm a thief . They know it . Detectives are downstairs now . To-morrow I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma takes a step toward Joe . JIMSY You see , Emma , Joe here ai n't so much to blame , he  --  EMMA No , Jimsy . Please go . I  --  want to be with Joe  --  alone . JIMSY Just as you say , Emma . Just as you say . I 'll do all I can to-night and let you know  --  maybe it 'll be all right . EMMA I know , Jimsy  --  good-night . Jimsy goes out and Emma stands for a moment looking at Joe , and then goes to him and places both hands on his shoulders . EMMA in a broken voice . Oh , Joe  --  my boy , how could you do it  --  did n't you know sooner or later you 'd be found out ? Now I know why you 've been interested in the races  --  you 've been betting on the horses . JOE BROOKS I wanted to get the money back . EMMA But did n't you know you could n't ? Oh , why did n't you leave things as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Why did we come here and try to live in all this  --  this happiness with money that you stole ? p. 12 JOE BROOKS pushing her away . That 's right  --  you call me a thief ! If there was one person in the world I thought I could depend on it 's you  --  and you turn on me . EMMA Joe , you must n't say that ; I have n't turned on you . Only I ca n't help but think  --  JOE BROOKS rises . What ? That Williams drove me to taking the money . EMMA Drove you ? JOE BROOKS Yes , he did . It was a trap . I expected you to stand by me . Do you realize the hole I 'm in ?  --  There are three Central Office men down there , watching . If I make a move I 'll be nabbed . He walks about wildly as he talks . It 's all very well for you to stop and preach  --  you always were so damned saintly , but what of me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what of me ? EMMA If I thought you were yourself , I 'd never forgive you for saying that to me . JOE BROOKS I 'm not asking your forgiveness , nor your mother 's nor your sister 's . Sits at the table . What I want is some one to help me out  --  I do n't want to go to jail  --  it would kill me. p. 13 EMMA Do you think I want you to go to jail ? Do you think I want the disgrace ? JOE BROOKS rises . The disgrace  --  that 's it . There 's always some one to hammer that into a fellow when he 's down . EMMA I 'm not trying to hammer anything into you  --  what I want to know is what can be done . JOE BROOKS I do n't know . Emma suggests getting help from Jimsy , but Joe says the amount of money is too large . Besides , he thinks Williams means business and would n't take the money . She says if she had only known when Captain Williams was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe says it is not too late to do that . She ca n't telephone , but Joe says she can go to see him ; she can square the thing , and she is the only one who can . EMMA I can ? JOE BROOKS Yes , you  --  and no one but you  --  you ! you ! EMMA Why , what can I do ? JOE BROOKS He likes you . She looks at him , startled . He grasps her arm . Yes , he does , he always did . Women are his weak point . He 's liked you for years , that 's why he hangs around . I 've seen it , and you heard what he said to-night about what he 'd do for a girl like you . He meant that , Emma  --  he 'll do anything you ask him if  --  EMMA begins to understand . If you go to him right . He 's home now . You can go .  --  No one will know but just Williams , you and me . She rises slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 14 EMMA Do I understand what you mean ? JOE BROOKS No one will know the difference  --  you can handle him all right  --  besides , you know how far you can let a man go with safety  --  all women know that . There is a pause . Well ? Then you wo n't do it ?  --  You wo n't come to the front ? I suppose you do n't think I ought to ask . Why should n't I ? Who did I steal the money for  --  I did it because you made me . EMMA That 's not true . JOE BROOKS It 's the truth and you know it . When I married you , your father was to help me , but he died and then you had to do your own work and you whined and complained . EMMA That 's a lie ! JOE BROOKS Oh , not in so many words , but I saw it .  --  For four years around the house I saw you sighing and moping because you did n't have enough to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they never stopped . You tried to make yourself a martyr . Every moment of your life was a mute protest against our poverty . EMMA That 's another lie ! JOE BROOKS Yes , it was , and you know it . Do you remember that night when you said you could n't go to the theatre because you did n't have the clothes ? That was the first time I took money . That 's when I began . p. 15 EMMA You know I would n't have gone if I 'd known . JOE BROOKS But you did go  --  you kept on going and I kept on stealing for you  --  for you . For the clothes on your back ! God ! how I 've suffered ! For you  --  now I 'm going to jail . I 'm going up there on the river for years because you wo n't do your part . EMMA I ca n't . JOE BROOKS Why ca n't you ? Other women have for less reason  --  one right here in this town to get control of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . If you go there to-night I wo n't go to jail  --  I wo n't be hauled into court , no one will know , but the three of us . I 've gone through to the limit for you . It 's up to you to go through for me . EMMA Now that I see you in all your contemptible meanness  --  JOE rises  --  I wonder how I ever made the mistake of thinking you even half a man . JOE BROOKS Oh , you ca n't dodge the responsibility with fine speeches . I 've done this for you . Now , what are you going to do ? Be square with me and take this chance  --  you know you 're safe . EMMA Then you mean that if you go to jail I have sent you there ? p. 16 JOE BROOKS Yes , and down in your heart you know you have . EMMA Now , whatever I do , if I do anything at all , I do it simply because you blame me . JOE BROOKS attempts to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMMA Do n't ! Do n't make the mistake of thinking I care for you  --  whatever I felt for you , and I thought it was love  --  you 've killed it in the last ten minutes , but I do n't want you to go to jail pointing a finger of accusation at me . JOE BROOKS Then you 'll be square , you 'll help ? You 'll go  --  you 'll  --  EMMA You understand that if I bargain with Captain Williams for your freedom I make the bargain  --  JOE BROOKS Yes , I know  --  I 'll never ask . EMMA It will be my business alone . JOE BROOKS Yes , just yours . EMMA Is he home ? JOE BROOKS Yes . He must be . EMMA standing by the table rigidly and cold as ice . Telephone and ask if he can see me  --  now  --  alone  --  Joe looks at her hesitatingly , cringing a bit , and takes down the receiver . He keeps his eye on her as he thrusts his handkerchief into the mouthpiece . Captain William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Southern Pacific , shields , spears , a ship 's wheel and capstan and models of several ships . The room has the appearance of being ill-cared for . The Captain 's Japanese servant is willing enough , but the Captain dislikes to have things disturbed . Captain Williams comes in and answers the telephone . Mrs. Brooks is at the other end of the line , and he tells her that he is at home and will wait to see her . Then he dismisses his servant , advising him to take a very long walk and not to be in any hurry about coming back . He writes a short note , lays it on the capstan head , which serves as a table , and waits . The servant has hardly gone when Jimsy enters . Captain Williams informs him bluntly he is expecting an important visitor and he must make his business short . Jimsy recounts how Brooks lost his nerve and told his wife everything . He wants to know how much Brooks has taken . The Captain says it was sixteen thousand eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain Williams does n't see where Jimsy comes into the affair , and Jimsy returns that that is none of the Captain 's business . The Captain refuses . He is going to open negotiations with another party , Mrs. Brooks herself , he says , and perhaps they shall come to some mutually pleasant arrangement that will keep Brooks out of jail . Also , this plain speaking is a hint that Jimsy had better be on his way . p. 17 JIMSY going toward the door . I 've known Emma  --  Mrs. Brooks ever since she was in short clothes and used to come down to the office to go home with her daddy  --  CAPTAIN WILLIAMS So I 've heard . JIMSY She 's always been able to look up into my face with them big brown eyes o ' hers and smile . When I get back from Boston I 'm going to make it my business to see her  --  CAPTAIN WILLIAMS All right JIMSY And if she should n't be able to look up into my face and smile , I 'm coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heeled . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS What particular style o ' heel are you wearing now , Smith ? JIMSY Well , if you should consult the particular shoe-maker who furnishes ' em , he 'd describe that heel as a .45 Colt . When Mrs. Brooks comes the Captain is very sociable . He insists on spinning yarns and wo n't let her come to Joe 's trouble . He urges her to drink a little something , as it is a warm evening , but she sticks to the point . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS There you go , talking business again . Mrs. Brooks , I so seldom have the pleasure of your company that this " business thing " knocks all the romance out of your visit . p. 18 EMMA I did n't intend there should be any romance in it , Captain Williams . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS Mrs. Brooks , a sailor man always finds romance in an evening spent with a pretty woman . She tells him that she has come to plead with him to save Joe and herself from disgrace . She says he must have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can find some way out of the difficulty . She has n't the money , and has no suggestion to make . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS Your husband sent you here , did n't he ?  --  What did he say to you ? EMMA He told me that I might have some influence with you . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS Put the blame on you for stealing the money , did n't he ? EMMA astonished . How did you know that ? CAPTAIN WILLIAMS I know the man ! Did n't he ? EMMA Yes . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS Told you , did n't he , that you could fix it up to call everything off ? EMMA Yes , that 's what he said . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS Um , and that if you did n't come you 'd have to take the blame for him going to the penitentiary ? p. 19 EMMA Yes  --  it  --  it  --  was something like that . She asks if there is n't some way that she can help Joe honorably . CAPTAIN WILLIAMS What if I make the proposition that 's in your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yours when he sent you over to me to see if I 'd make the price sixteen thousand dollars ? What would you do then , eh ? What if I looked you over and was pleased and thought you cheap at that figure ? Eh ? You say I 've killed men ? Yes , I have . I 've wrung their necks with this hand like you 'd sling a chicken in the air . I said you was the first lady to come in here . Maybe I made a mistake , but if I did I 'll find it out before you leave this room . I 've talked  --  now you talk . Emma says that now she knows the Captain is everything people say he is , but she is not afraid of him . Her husband can offer her for sale and the Captain can stand there ready to buy her , but she has something to say about it . EMMA Even if I wanted to place myself on the market I could n't . But I 'm not afraid of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're alone  --  you can lock that door . I wo n't scream nor cry . So you 've killed men , have you ? Well , now , Captain Williams , is your first chance to kill a woman , for that 's just exactly what you 'll have to do . p. 20 CAPTAIN WILLIAMS I knew you were that kind of a woman . I banked on you being good , and you are good . I know women . I 've bought mine all over the world , from Hindoos to Chinese , but I paid for ' em and they was always willing to sell . There ai n't but two kinds , the good and the bad . There 's ai n't but two kinds , the good and the bad . There 's no half way . When they 're bad they 're bad through and through , ca n't be good , and when they 're good they 're all good  --  and next to heaven .

For I 'd fight for you , and do n't you forget I 'd fight hard . Emma is bewildered . She staggers slightly and grasps a chair for support . The Captain tells her he has been watching her husband for a long time and always knew that sooner or later he would go to the bad and try to take her with him . He reads her the note that he has written and laid on the capstan . It says : " Your resignation is accepted . I wish to thank you for your services and to assure you that your accounts with the Latin-American Steamship Company have been audited and found to be correct . " The Captain tells Emma that if she had acted otherwise than as she did she would n't have had that note . He says it is worth what it has cost him and a whole lot more for him to know a good woman . Jimsy comes back and is pleased at the smile that Emma gives him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to pay a whole lot of attention to Jimsy . When they have left , he says : p. 21 CAPTAIN WILLIAMS Damned if it ai n't good to be decent ! Joe Brooks has been in a fever of suspense during his wife 's absence and has reached the depths of despondency by the time she returns . Meanwhile , Mrs. Harris and Beth come back and scold him for not taking them home from the theatre . He had forgotten all about it . They are surprised to find that Emma has gone out alone and have a good deal to say about their disapproval . Finally Emma enters , followed by Jimsy . She looks haggard and nearly exhausted . Joe 's anxiety immediately increases . She does n't even notice him . She asks her mother and Beth to go , and again Jimsy comes in handy as an escort . Emma and Joe are left together . He thinks that she has failed in her mission , and for a moment is so overcome that he is unable to speak . He goes up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He flings himself in a chair despairingly .

She pushes him gently away and tells him that she is going to her mother 's ; that it is impossible for her to live with him any longer . He declares she ca n't go that way , without explanation , and asks how she induced Williams to agree . EMMA You 've no right to ask that . The price I paid for that letter is none of your business . p. 22 JOE BROOKS It is my business . I want to know and I will know .

JOE BROOKS closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should leave here and now , and that is Williams . Are you going back to him ? Emma steps back from him with an expression of disdain . She says that the thought he had sunk as low as he could when he sent her to Williams , but that now she sees she was mistaken . He insists that he will not let her leave until she tells the truth about Williams . She tells him that he was the only person who had her degradation in mind . Since he insists on frankness , she wants him to try to appreciate the truth as well as he is able . She is the only person , she says , who did n't realize how worthless he is . When they were married she thought she loved him . Now it seems utterly beyond belief . She sees that he has always been dishonest at heart .
