 | THE Indian Appropriation Act for the fiscal year beginning with July 1 , 1906 , and ending with June 30 , 1907 , has passed both chambers of Congress and is at the present writing in the hands of the joint committee of conference , where it will undergo its finishing touches before being presented once more to the two houses for consideration in its permanent form . When last heard from , the members of the conference had agreed to accept an amendment adopted by the Senate , reading as follows : Mission schools on an Indian reservation may , under rules and regulations prescribed by the Commissioner o Indian Affairs , receive for such Indian children duly enrolled therein , the rations of food and clothing to which said children would be entitled under treaty stipulations if such children were living with their parents . Two years ago an item was incorporated into the Appropriation Act which , according to its authors , was intended to convey the same idea , but which couched . it in this form : No part of the moneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended unless expended without regard to the attendance of any beneficiary at any school other than a Government school . For one , I am extremely glad to see the change of phraseology . The new seems to me more wholesome , more dignified , in every way more worthy of the great body of American lawmakers than the old . The only objection I have heard raised to it was that it was likely to revive the old controversy about Government support of sectarian institutions . It may , but it has not yet ; indeed , a Senate supposed to be very susceptible to such controversial influences voted its approval without so much as raising a question on the floor . So much for  | candor and plain speaking , as opposed to mystery and involution of language . As to the intrinsic merits of such legislation , I , for one , ask the privilege of standing up and being counted in its favor ; and in order that the readers of The Outlook may understand the subject and form their own opinions , favorable or adverse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a few lines of explanation . Some of the treaty provisions under which the Government still issues rations to sundry Indian tribes are so framed that if the head of a family stubbornly refuses to educate his children , the rations which would otherwise be given to him may be cut off . If the children go to school , they are supposed to be cared for there , and their rations are deducted from the family 's total supply . If they attend a Government school , the Government simply , in effect , transfers their rations from the family to the school , so that the children get the benefit of them ; but if they go to any other school than one supported by the Government , it has been held that they were not entitled to such benefit , so that no rations could be given , without special legislation , to a non-Government school . Under this ruling , which , however just as a legal interpretation , has borne with great severity upon certain very worthy mission schools , more than one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to me as if this condition of things tended to defeat , rather than foster , the main end which the Government itself has had in view ? the education of the rising generation of Indians . Among white citizens , not the most stringent of our compulsory education laws draws any hard and fast line against private or sectarian schools as distinguished from public schools ; the only question the State asks is whether every child is getting an education somewhere . So , as I look at it , we should ask the same question regarding the Indian child , and stop there . It is perfectly competent , of course , for Congress to say , if it wishes to , that no part of the money raised by popular taxation shall be used for the maintenance of private institutions ; but if the lawmakers of any community were to say that the children who go to private schools should be deprived of any of the privileges universally enjoyed by other children simply as children , we should consider it a pretty harsh decree . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it goes to a Government school , or if it has a good reason for staying at home , will get its share of the common tribal benefits , shall be stripped of those benefits simply because it goes to a school not run by the Government , seems to me dangerously like laying a penalty on education because that education does not wear a particular brand . Perhaps I am wrong ; but if I am , I shall be glad to be shown wherein . A great deal of newspaper space has been given to the discussion of another subject in connection with the Indian sectarian school question , concerning which many misunderstandings have been rife . The President , in a letter addressed to the Secretary of the Interior in February . 1905 , announced that certain Indian tribal funds would continue to be used till further notice , unless Congress or the courts forbade , for the support of such schools as the Indians themselves preferred , premising only that no Indian should be permitted to dedicate to this purpose more than his own pro rata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuance of this order , I prepared a code of rules to govern the division of the tribal funds among the members of the tribes concerned , so as to determine the amount of the pro rata share of each Indian , which he was free to give away . These rules were published in my Annual Report for 1905 . Later in the season the President decided that he preferred a somewhat different method of determining the amount of the pro rata shares . My plan was to set apart , first , the sum which would be necessary to support the Government schools , and divide the rest among the whole number of Indians concerned . His plan was to divide the entire amount without making any such preliminary deduction . This last mode of division , of course , made the pro rata share of each Indian somewhat larger than it would have been  | under my plan . The objection which I foresaw would be raised against it was that the shares of all the Indians in a tribe would be affected to a greater or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income to the support of a sectarian school . Petitions were prepared which would enable each Indian in the several tribes concerned to indicate whether he wished his pro rata share of the money to be drawn upon for a sectarian school or for a Government school . These were placed in the hands of the several agents , with explicit instructions as to the safeguards to be observed for assuring the authenticity of the signatures , and particularly for having the whole business conducted with the utmost candor and publicity . In one letter , for example , occurred the following passage : Some question . . . has been raised as to the extent to which the signer of a petition is liable to reduce by his own act the amount of money coming to him and his family during the fiscal year . The truth is that the Government guarantees to every Indian child a chance to get a common school education somewhere , and that it maintains a large and expensive educational establishment , only part of which is supported from the tribal funds , the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exempt by statutory prohibition from drafts for sectarian school purposes . Hence , any diversion of tribal money to the support of mission schools is bound to reduce to some extent the total balance which would eventually be divided per capita in some form among the tribe . It maybe a very small percentage of reduction if the tribal fund is large , or a large one if the tribal fund is small ; but it will be a reduction of some sort , and , under the President 's latest orders , will be suffered more or less by all members of the tribe . A good deal of other material was sent , explanatory of the process of handling the business . My surprise was great , therefore , when , one day , toward the close of a stretch of some twelve consecutive hours of work ten of them without a pause for food ? it became necessary for me to answer a telegram of inquiry on a point which seemed to me perfectly clear . The answer was prepared for me by a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was tired out physically and mentally , and ran my eye over the answer very hastily ; and all I was looking for and all I saw in it was the certainty that it set forth three things on which I was bound that no Indian should be misled by any one . These were : 1 . That the treaty as well as the trust funds would be used . 2 . That no petitioner would be permitted to sign away more than his own share and the shares of his family . 3 . That under the existing system the shares of all the members of the tribe would suffer some diminution . I signed it without stopping to criticise its very crude and unsatisfactory form , assuming that it would be read in the light of all that had gone before . It was addressed to the Agent at Pine Ridge , South Dakota , who had made the inquiry , and ran as follows : Payment for contract will be made out of all trust and treaty funds named in petition to the extent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of which will be deducted from the total amount of said funds whenever a distribution is made , thus reducing by such amount the shares of all Indians . The next day , still more to my surprise , came from the Rosebud Agent a similar telegraphic request for particulars . The same form of answer was laid before me , and then I began to think that some one was behind all this interrogation with a purpose to draw me into some vulnerable statement . So I edited the despatch somewhat , and sent it off in a form which seemed to me a trifle clearer for the use of the two words I have here italicized : Payment for contract will be made out of all trust and treaty funds named in petition to the extent of the shares of the petitioners and petitioners ' children , the total of which will be deducted from the total amount of said funds whenever a distribution is made , thus reducing to such degree the shares of all Rosebud Indians . For the lameness of the expressions used I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was working at the time and the single purpose of absolute candor which absorbed my mind . Now that I am able , through the completion of the petitions , the calculation of the pro rata shares , and the application thereof to their destined objects , to strike an approximate balance-sheet , let us see how the plan  | works out in actual operation , and whether my prophecy was or was not correct . There were four sectarian school contracts at issue . The first was for the Holy Rosary Mission School on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota . There are 6,703 Indians on the Pine Ridge roll , each of whom would be entitled to $49.67 from the tribal income for the year . Of these 801 are represented on the petition , standing for a total of $39,785.67 . They have asked that $21,600 of their money be given to the mission school . The rest of the tribe , numbering 5,902 Indians and entitled to $293,152.34 , are counted as preferring the Government schools , which this year cost $81,886 . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or $35.79 each ; while to the petitioners is credited a balance of only $18,185.67 , or $22.70 each . If there had been no diversion of money to the mission school , there would have been $251,052.01 to be divided between 6,703 Indians , entitling each to $37.45 ; so that , though the great burden of the mission school diversion falls upon the petitioners , who give away $14.75 each , the share of each non-petitioner suffers to the extent of $1.66 . On the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota are 4,986 Indians , each of whom is entitled to $50.15 from the tribal income of the year . Of these , 669 are represented on a petition for a contract with St. Francis ' Mission School , involving $27,000 . The shares of the petitioners would make a total of $33,550.35 , so that they will have a balance to their credit of $6,550.35 , or $9.79 apiece . The non-petitioners number 4,317 , controlling an aggregate of $216,497.55 , and the Government schools cost this year $76,836 , which will leave them a balance of $139,661.55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money to the mission school , there would have been $173,211.90 to be divided between 4,986 Indians , at the rate of $34.73 each ; so that the petitioners will be credited with $24.94 less , each , than they would have been but for their petition , while the shares of the non-petitioners suffer a deduction of $2.38 . Crow Creek Reservation contains 1,009 Indians , whose pro rata shares amount to $50.24 . The request made here was for a contract with the Immaculate Conception Mission School for the education and care of 65 pupils at $108 a year , or $7,020 . The petition , however , fell short of the mark aimed at , the signatures representing only 81 shares , or a total of $4,069.44 . The shares of the 928 non-petitioners aggregate $46 , - 622.72 . The Government schools cost this year $21,410 , leaving a balance of $25,212.72 to be credited to the nonpetitioners , or $27.16 to each ; whereas the petitioners have nothing left , all their shares having been given by them to the mission school . Their total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 65 . Had there been no diversion of money to the mission school , there would have been $29,282.16 to be credited to the whole 1,009 Indians , or $29.02 to each ; so that the shares of the non-petitioners suffer to the extent of $1.86 . On the Tongue River Reservation in Montana are 1,412 Indians , entitled to $39.63 apiece . A petition for the care and education of 60 pupils at St. Labre 's Mission School ? involving an expenditure of $6,480 ? contains signatures representing 108 shares , or $4,280.04 . Hence the contract can be made for only 39 pupils instead of 60 , and this wipes out the shares of the petitioners altogether . The non-petitioners number 1,304 , and their combined shares amount to $51,677.52 ; so that the deduction of the cost of the Government schools , $15,000 , leaves them a balance of $36 , - 677.52 , or $28.12 each . If there had been no diversion for the mission school , there would have been $40,957.56 to be credited to the whole body of Indians , or $29 each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each nonpetitioner is 88 cents . I have gone thus into detail for two reasons : first , because , in any matter in which the public evince so much interest , I am always glad to give a prompt account of my stewardship as soon as the necessary figures are at hand ; in the second place , I feel that this showing justifies my much-discussed despatches to the agents at Pine Ridge and Rose- bud reservations , at least in the light in which I had a right to expect those despatches to be read . The story would not be complete , however , if I did not add that , by the President 's orders , the use of the treaty funds , as described above , is to cease with June 30 , 1906 . Almost as I was writing the last paragraph I was served with the preliminary writ in a suit to enjoin any money payment under the contract for St. Francis ' School on the Rosebud Reservation . The suit is brought by three Indians as nominal complainants , but actually by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile spirit , but merely for the purpose of testing the law . I welcome it heartily , as I have done my best ever since this matter first arose to procure an authoritative settlement of the legal phases of the whole tribal fund question , raising the points myself , but thus far in vain . If , as I hope , the case proves to have enough vitality to carry it to the court of last resort , the decision will take its place side by side with that in the Lone Wolf injunction suit and other epoch-making definitions of the law of the land regarding the Indian .
