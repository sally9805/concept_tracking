 |p1049  THE editor of THE INDEPENDENT asks me to be personal . I will be so and state that I was a clergyman in a small liberal church in the Far West . I became converted to the Great Hope . The Church seemed to me a rich man 's tomb in which was buried a crucified Christ . I believed there would be a resurrection , but not from inside the tomb . I believed ? I believe now ? that a Power from without and from above must roll away the stone . I left the Church to preach Socialism . I went into Socialist politics and succeeded . All through the West and on occasional campaigns in the East I harangued and preached , usually to large audiences , sometimes in opera houses or ordinarily in lecture rooms , small or great , frequently in churches , more than once in halls of legislature , repeatedly in schools and colleges , once in a Hebrew synagog . I had a ready hearing . I was the Wandering Light . I certainly wandered , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Those years ? they were more than ten ? were my wanderjahre . I did not end them because I failed . I became to an extent a master workman in words , words , words . I could talk more times a day than I could eat . It was cheaper . I made many converts . And by very strenuous work I kept myself and my small family out of need . But notice this effect upon myself and upon others . I was , in every sense , except that of thought , uprooted . I had a deep thought-root , going back through Karl Marx to Moses and to Plato and to " Lord Christ . " But I had no other earth-root . I had no economic root . I paid my bills and my family 's bills ? that is more than all Socialists can say ? but I had to do it by continual change of base . The Socialist lecturer must ever away and away " to fresh woods and pastures new . " He plays usually at one-night stands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecturer . And this , unfortunately , was the least evil . Socialism is not a scheme , but a philosophy ; yet it gives birth to a thousand schemes ? nay , to as many schemes as there are Socialists . There were cast last year in the United States 408,230 Socialist votes . There are probably half a million Socialist schemes hatched in the United States each year . This is a conservative estimate , because it does not sufficiently allow for the women . Socialists ' wives usually spend their lives restraining their husbands from risking all the family living upon these schemes . Man , not woman , is the creator . Woman is the destroyer of Utopias . Nevertheless , the true Socialist , man or woman , will scheme . Now most of these schemes are of necessity schemes for making money . This is not so much for self as for the cause , the party , the family ( often put third ) . The Socialist is a born optimist . But he is rarely a horn opportunist . Most of his schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure for his bad schemes is more schemes . Consequently change of base , if one has no economic root , means almost inevitable change of scheme . To the Socialist lecturer who has not inherited , made or married money this is a necessity of the situation . I changed my plans , not because I was fickle , but of compulsion . To most of them I held on too long . When head winds blow he who would reach his destination must con : tinually tack . The Socialist usually sails against the wind and therefore changes  |p1050  his course . The easy people who sail with the wind do not change their course and win the reputation of being steadfast . Most rich men and comfortable people are very steadfast . I won the name of being changeable . I doubt if many of those who criticised the changes have stuck to their main end more steadily than I. Not many have sailed closer to the wind . But lack of economic base was not all . I had no home base . My home was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The world was my home ; to do good was my religion ; but I had no chimney-corner for a rainy night . I owned no plot of ground recognized as mine , save one little bit of earth , three feet by two , in a field where they bury strangers . Nor had I a family root . My wife upheld my theories , criticised my schemes and consented to my practice ; but most of the time I was away from her . They who live to talk must talk to live . Often through those ten years I had to speak thirty nights a month in order to pay board bills for thirty days . I did it , but habitually I was away from my family . One day my little daughter said to her mother : " Mamma , we have a husband , but nobody would ever know it . " That was the beginning of the end of my lecturing . I had no professional root . Talking in a hall and then passing the hat ? something like the monkey which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets ? can scarcely be called a profession , tho it is quite as honest as the man who gets $5,00o per year for talking in a chair , or $50,000 for talking in a pulpit , or $500,000 for talking to a bench . Still it is not recognized as professional . Almost above all else , I had no deed root . What could I do ? What can any Socialist lecturer do ? I could not nationalize the railroads . I could not municipalize gas . I could not employ the unemployed . I could scarcely render help . Even my charity had to be talk . I could not start a co-operative colony . Nor did I desire to . I have not at least that sin upon my shoulders . Socialism is not the dragging of enthusiasts out of the ordinary life into doubtful experiments . Socialism is the development of the communal life of communities as they are . Colonies , at the best , are but cooperative individualism . What could I do ? How could I " go do great deeds , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underrating the power of words . Many a man 's words are as good and as useful as his deeds . A true word bravely spoken may be a veriest deed . The Socialist lecturers of the world are making history and changing the course of empires . Nevertheless , deep within me has grown the belief that he who speaks must practice what he speaks , that the power of a speaker 's words are measured first and foremost and invariably by his life , and that while the deed is not the life , the deed must spring from the life or the life be void ; that he does not live nor teach who does not at least make some symbol of his heart 's faith . I longed to be back in the ordinary ranks , doing something well in the ordinary run , making something ? I cared little whether it was shoes or sermons . But I had been trained to be a sermon maker , not a shoemaker . So I determined to stick to my last and become " ordinary . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pastor . I said " Yes , " and here I am an ordinary ? very ordinary ? minister . Even as a city man , if country bred , will sometimes late in life return to the country , and weary of the hurry and turmoil and artificiality of his city life , will , it may be , stretching himself upon the green grass , stoop down and kiss the sward over the red soil ? mother earth ? so I , through with my harder jaunt , came back to mother Church . For let us not forget that , after all , for most of us , be we socialist or individualist , orthodox or freethinker ? for most of us the Church is mother of us all . Certainly she is the mother of Socialism . She is world 's first Great International ? aye that , even tho money crazed she has driven out some of her children , or tho grief-frenzied many of them have thrown stones at the old home . And now in the old homestead am I able to practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of being more one with the great mass , one with the whole , doing my daily work and helping on as best I can the development of the communal life .
