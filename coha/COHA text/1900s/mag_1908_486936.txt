The present month opened with de  --  mand loans in Wall Street at about 1 per cent. , and rates for three months ' loans on stock collateral , below 3 per cent . For December , these are unusual figures . This month is normally a pe  --  riod of active money and falling bank reserves , when currency flows in the largest volume of the year into the channels of hand-to-hand circulation , and when the credit facilities of great banking institutions , here and abroad , are strained to provide simultaneously for the heavy commercial trade and for the large fiscal operations which mark the so-called turn of the year . " How exceptionally low these present rates for money are , may be judged by the fact that in December , 19e call money on the New York market touched 25 per cent ; in 1906 , 29 ; 1905 , 125 ; 1904 ( when trade reaction and abundant bank re  --  serves had been , as in the present year , the order of the day ) , 5 ; 1903 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900 , 6% ; 1899 , 186 ; 1898 , 6 ; and 1897 , 5% . It is possible , no doubt , that the money market , later in the present month , will reach higher fig  --  ures than this week 's ; but the rate for call money has nevertheless been lower than in any December since 1896 , and that for time money lower than in this month of any year since 1898 On near  --  ly all the larger foreign money mar  --  kets , the case is similar . Low rates for money , an indication of idle capital , would on their face sug  --  gest the probability of free use of cred  --  it , both in speculation and in promo  --  tion of enterprise . The first result has certainly been witnessed . The Stock Exchange , for a week or more , has been deserted by the outside investing pub  --  lic because of high prices , but neverthe  --  less , the quotatiOns have been so jacked up by professional speculators that , in a score of active shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the public was driven out . At the same time , powerful borrowers have ap  --  peared with applications for new capi tal . When the bids for $12,500,000 in New York city bonds were opened on Mon  --  day of last week , it was found that the total applied for was $157,000,000 . This oversubscription caused frequent in  --  quiry in banking circles , as to why the railways do not at once take advantage of so favorable an opportunity for rais  --  ing ' large sums . Industrial corporations seem to be doing so ; the American Tele  --  phone Company has this week offered $50,000,000 bonds , and the United States Rubber Company $20,000,000 . It was the railways , however , of which James J. Hill declared , in 1906 , that $1,100,000,000 new capital for improvements every year , for the five ensuing years , was ab  --  solutely indispensable . Two weeks ago , the Illinois Central sold bonds to the amount of $20,000,000 ; last week the Erie applied for authority to issue $30 , ? 000,000 , and the Denver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three cases the primary object was to pay off floating debts . There has been no important sale of bonds by railways since last June , when the Union Pacific brought out its $50,000,000 first and re  --  funding 4s . During the eighteen months preceding the Union Pacific issue , the roads , in most cases , could raise money only through short term high interest bearing notes . Why do they not come into the market now ? The floating debts of a pressing na  --  ture have now been pretty generally ex  --  tinguished . But this brings up a mat  --  ter concerning which much was said in 1906 ? the problem of additions and improvements , lack of provision for which was then declared to be throt  --  tling industry . Are the railways to do nothing in that direction now , and if so , why ? Two important railway officers have lately answered the question In his annual report of last October , Presi  --  dent Ripley of the Atchison said : The recession of business found your company engaged in extensive construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced that it could not be sus pended without great loss Such work therefore was vigorously pushed and sub stantially completed Other construction and improvement work , although highly de  --  sirable from the standpoint of economy of operation and good service to the public , was suspended and will not be taken up again until conditions improve . When asked , last week , if there would not now be a rapid increase on the part of the railroads in orders for materials , James J. Hill replied : Conditions are improving undoubtedly , but we the Great Northern Railway have fifty locomotives stored away which have never had steam in them Until they are put in use , I do not think that we will place orders for new ones . That - Mr Hill 's explanation of the case does not apply to one railway only , was sufficiently proved by a recent Railway Association report on the car supply . In the middle of November , idle cars were 300,000 less in number than in the mid  --  dle of April , but 109,500 nevertheless re  --  mained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply was 44,800 short of immediate requirements , Yet even these explanations leave the questions open first , whether the rail  --  ways will not once more enter the mo ? ney market on an enormous scale if trade activity does return to normal and idle cars are all in use ; second , what effect such a new demand for capital would produce on the market . " King Cotton , " by James L. Watkins ( New York : Published by the author ) , adds another reference book to the already long list of those annually published for the benefit of the cotton trade . But here an effort has been made to give more than the usual compilations and statistics of crops , prices , exports , etc . The author has gone exhaustively into the history of cotton in each of the cotton States
