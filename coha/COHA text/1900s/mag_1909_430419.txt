THE history of the exploration of East Central Africa is , of course , of great interest not only to Great Britain , but to the United States , because it was not only Britishers who revealed the features of the geography of this region , but Americans also have left their names among these records of exploration . Among such have been Col. Chaille Long , Mr Chanler , and Dr Donaldson Smith . Col. Chaille Long was the first resident in the kingdom of Uganda , and was sent there by General Gordon . He was chief of General Gordon 's staff , and is living in Washington at the present time . The great Sir Henry Stanley might perhaps be equally claimed by Great Britain and America . Joseph Thomson was the first to reach the Victoria Nyanza , coming direct from the east coast of Africa . Previously explorers had approached the Victoria Nyanza by a circuitous route from the south and west in order to avoid the Masai tribes . But Joseph Thomson , who was a man with a wonderful gift for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to be the first of all white men to go right through the Masai belt and reach the Victoria Nyanza from the east . And when he finished his wonderful journey he became the real founder of British East Africa . He died at the age of only thirty-seven , after carrying out some of the most remarkable journeys ever made in Africa ? remarkable because he never fired a rifle at a native . I traveled immediately afterwards in some of Thomson 's tracks and got on splendidly , because my name was so like his that I was taken for his brother , and I was careful not to undeceive the people . I imagine that President Roosevelt will make his starting point Monihasa , and that from Mombasa he will probably travel a certain distance on the Uganda Railroad , and then strike off toward the north and see what he can find there in the way of interesting big game . Before we go up in imagination with him along the routes he may follow , it might be well to realize how this country came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there of the original pioneers . ARABS AND PERSIANS CAME THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO Lamu is an important place some distance to the north of Mombasa . To  | Lamu there came undoubtedly natives from Arabia long before the days of Islam ? perhaps three thousand years ago -- and in time there followed a large immigration from Persia . A number of Persians left Shiras and Bashis , and found their way to East Africa , in consequence of some internal troubles in Persia at a period in history difficult to fix at this time . Men and women of Lamu show signs in their physiognomy of an intermixture between Persian and negro . When I first visited Lamu in 1884 there were beautiful specimens of ancient pottery to be obtained there , either from the houses of the natives or from old tombs . There were old tombs all around the city , in the masonry or cement of which exquisite Persian plates were fixed . I did not avail myself of the opportunity to get any of these specimens , but people came later who were less scrupulous , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pottery and other beautiful examples of ancient art . An examination of the tombs threw very interesting light on the history of East Africa , because they contained a good many examples of Chinese pottery , and even Chinese coins . Following the Arabs and Persians came the Portuguese . When Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope he traveled rapidly with the aid of the north monsoon , reached the Swahihi coast , and built the commemorative column of Malindi , which exists to this day some distance to the north of Mombasa . The Portuguese held for a time Lannu , and for something like two centuries the port of Mombasa , the fortifications of which remain to this day as a signal example of the wonderful energy of the Portuguese at that period . The Portuguese were expelled from this country by an Arab uprising in the middle of the eighteenth century . Some of the women whom President Roosevelt will see at Mombasa are rather extensively clothed , compared to the people of the far interior . They also wear nose rings and other ornaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great many East Indian settlers at Mombasa and the other Swahihi ports . The people who inhabit the country in the vicinity of Tana River , north of Mombasa , and thence north through the lands of the Baran Gala , are a very interesting type , obviously not negro , but perhaps more Caucasian ; only darkened by some old intermixture with the negro races . They often have European features . Their language is very interesting , because it , together with Lamato and other Hamitic tongues , is related to the language of the ancient Egyptians . Now we will imagine we have landed at Mombasa and have taken the railroad . The President will have noticed that the coast belt has a very dense vege- tation , owing to the heavy rainfall . Then he will travel through a more arid country of thorn bushes and Euphorbias , until he reaches a plateau region of plains , mountain ridges , and stream valleys with fine forests . Then the railway descends into the Great Rift Valley , which is a depression twenty to forty miles broad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Red Sea . It is as though some convulsion of the earth had caused a section of the plateau to slip down about 3,000 feet below the general level . On looking at a relief map of northeast Africa it almost suggests the idea that nature had been considering whether she would not cut off another slice of Africa in addition to Madagascar . Madagascar may have been originally separated from Africa in that way . In this curious depression of the " Rift Valley " is a series of lakes , salt in some instances and fresh in others . Particularly noteworthy is a salt lake named Lake Hannington , after a missionary bishop murdered by the natives . ( This commemoration was rather inappropriate because he was killed at a distance of nearly four hundred miles from this place . ) ? Lake Hannington is visited at the present day by tourists who come to see the great number of flamingoes which make their home here . A WONDERFUL COLONY OF FLAMINGOES On Lake Hannington it is no exaggeration to say that there must be close upon a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the lake and on . the submerged banks which break up the deep bluegreen of its still surface . The shores where they cluster , and these banks in the middle of the lake where they are above the water 's edge , are dazzling white with the birds ' guano . These flamingoes breed on a flat plain of mud about a mile broad at the north end of Lake Hannington , where their nests , in the form of little mounds of mud with feathers plastered on the hollowed top , appear like innumerable mole-hills . The birds , having hitherto been absolutely unmolested by man , are quite tame . They belong to a rosy species ( Phrniconais minor ) which is slightly smaller than the Mediterranean flamingo. but exquisitely beautiful in plumage . The adult bird has a body and neck of rosy pink , the color of sunset clouds . The beak is scarlet and purple ; the legs are deep rose-pink inclining to scarlet . Underneath the black-pinioned wings the larger feathers are scarlet-crimson , while beautiful crimson crescents tip the tertiaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mature plumage is not reached until the birds are about three years old . The younger flamingoes very soon attain the  | same size as the rosy adults , but their plumage when they are full grown is first gray-white and then the color of a pale tea-rose before it attains its full sunset glory . On the north coast of the lake the belt of flamingoes must be nearly a mile broad from the edge of the lake outwards . Seen from above , this mass of birds on its shoreward side is graywhite , then becomes white in the middle , and has a lakeward ring of the most exquisite rose-pink , the reason being that the birds on the outer edge of the semicircle arc the young ones , while those farthest out into the lake are the oldest . It is not easy to make the birds take to flight . When they do so suddenly and the shallow water is stirred , the stench which arises is sickening . The noise of these birds can be heard from nearly a mile distant . The kronkkronk-kronk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashings and the swish-swish-swish of those who are starting on flight , combine to make a tumult of sound in the presence of which one has to shout to one 's companions in order to be heard . It is curious to watch the ungainly motions of these birds when they wish to rise in the air . Their flight has to be preceded by an absurd gallop through the mud before they can lift themselves on their wings . When I arrived at Lake Hannington they were so tame that I was able to go as far as I could wade in the water with my camera and photograph them at quite a short distance . QUEER HABITS OT THE NATIVES The human inhabitants of this part of East Africa mainly belong to the fine , handsome Masai race and the peoples of Nandi and Suk stock ( closely allied in racial origin to the Masai ) , while in the coast regions bordering the Victoria Nyanza there are a few Nilotic and Bantu negroes . The Suk natives of the northern part of the Rift Valley , southwest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to their hair . It is thought an unwomanly thing for the Suk women to have hair on the head . The men , however , encourage the hair to grow . When the father of a family dies his head-hair is divided among his sons , and each one weaves his portion into a chignon . In this chignon is a hollow bag in which is put all a man 's portable possessions that he prizes most ? his snuff box , ornaments , etc . The Karamojo people who dwell to the west of Lake Rudolf do not go in so much for chignons , but their favorite ornament is to make a hole through the lower lip and to wear in it the cone of some crystal . Among the dense forests , the gamehaunted wildernesses , and unfrequented plateaux , wanders a mongrel nomad race , the Andorobo , who represent a mixture of Nandi , Masai , and some antecedent negro race of dwarfish , Bushman stock . These Andorobo reproduce in a most striking manner the life which we may suppose to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stone Ages . They lead , in fact , very much the life that , the most primitive types of man led in Great Britain and France in the farback days of big animals , possibly before the coming of the glacial periods . They live entirely by the chase , often consuming the flesh of birds and beasts uncooked . Though they commit considerable devastations among the game of the province , they are a picturesque feature when encountered , and a striking illustration , handed down through the ages , of the life of primitive man not long after he had attained the status of humanity and had acquired a knowledge of the simplest weapons . THE MASAI PEOPLE Lake Naivasha , one of the lakes of the Rift Valley , is probably the center of a district where President Roosevelt will spend some time , because there are some very interesting things to be seen and possibly some remarkable animals to be obtained there . The western side of Lake Naivasha has picturesque moun- tains , which have to be ascended by the Uganda Railway , further north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here the railroad is carried to an altitude of 8,300 feet before it begins to descend the western slope of the plateau . Lake Naivasha is almost in the middle of the western Masai country . The dwellings of the cattle-keeping Masai are small flat-roofed structures . The Masai women are scrupulously clothed , originally in dressed skin , but today often in cloth . They are sharply distinguished from their husbands and brothers , who very ostentatiously wear no clothing for purposes of decency . The Masai have attracted a great deal of attention ever since Joseph Thomson , the explorer , together with Dr F'ischer ( an equally distinguished explorer of German nationality ) , laid bare to us Masailand . The Masai have been the occasion of terrible havoc throughout East Africa by the attacks they made on all settled peoples . At some unknown period in their racial career a very great part of the Masai decided they would not till the fields any longer , but that they would take away the cattle of other tribes not strong enough to resist them . This is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present day are absolutely devoid of human inhabitants except a few European settlers who have come there . It was not that the negroes objected to the climate ; they simply wiped one another out . This process has occurred over and over again in many parts of Africa . No one has ever been so cruel to the negro as the negro himself . The Masai are now great cultivators . Their towns are surrounded by belts of tall trees , mainly acacias , some of which must be considerably over a hundred feet in height , with green boughs and trunks and ever-present flaky films of pinnated foliage . In the rainy time of the year these trees are loaded with tiny golden balls of flowers , like tassels of floss. silk , which exhale a most delicious perfume of honey . In the plains between the villages Grevy 's zebra and a few oryx antelopes scamper about , while golden and black jackals hunt for small prey in broad daylight , with a constant whimpering . Enormous baboons sit in the branches of the huge trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vigilance on the part of the boy guardians . Large herds of cattle and troops of isabella-colored donkeys , with broad black shoulderstripes , go out in the morning to graze , and return through a faint cloud of dust , which is turned golden by the setting sun in the mellow evening , the cattle lowing and occasionally fighting , the asses kicking , plunging , and biting one another . THEIR DEAD ARE DEVOURED BY HYENAS After sunset , as the dusk rapidly thickens into night , forms like misshapen , ghostly wolves will come from no one knows where , and trot about the waste outside the village trees . They are the spotted hyenas , tolerated by the Masai because they are the living sepulchres of their dead relations . When man , woman , or child dies among the Masai , agricultural or pastoral , the corpse is placed on the outskirts of the settlement for the hyenas to devour at nights . The cry of the hyena is not a laugh , as people make out , but a long-drawn falsetto wail ending in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine to be the mocking cry of a ghoul ; and but for the fact that we now find that the ghoul myth has a very solid human origin ( since there are depraved people all o'er Africa at the present day who have a mania for eating corpse-flesh , and this trait may also have cropped out in pre-Mohammedan days in Arabia and Persia ) , one might very well imagine that the idea of the ghoul arose from the hyena , as that of the harpy probably did from the vulture . All these people are alike in their love of blood as an article of food . They periodically bleed their cattle and drink the blood hot , or else mix it with porridge . The women of these tribes do not eat fowls , and neither men nor women eat eggs . As among most negro races , the men feed alone , and the women eat after the men have done .  | Honey is a most important article of diet of all the natives in this region . In some districts they semi-domesticate the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build in . From honey is made an intoxicating mead . They also make a wine from the sap of the wild date palm . Beer is made from the grain of eleusine and sorghum . As a general rule fermented liquors are never drunk by the young unmarried women or the young men . Both sexes and people of all ages use tobacco in one form or another . The fighting men take snuff , the old married men chew tobacco , and the old women smoke it . The Lumbwa people make tobacco juice by keeping macerated tobacco leaves soaked in water in a goat horn slung round the neck . Closing one nostril with a finger , they tilt the head on one side , and then pour the liquid tobacco juice out of the horn into the other nostril . Both nostrils are then pinched for a few minutes , after which the liquid is allowed to trickle out . POISONED ARROWS The nomad Andorobo people , besides killing innumerable colobus monkeys in the dense woods of the Mau and Nandi plateaux ( with poisoned arrows ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or range over the opposite heights following up the elephant , and attacking and slaying most of the big antelope . They kill the elephant very often by shooting into its leg at close quarters a harpoon with a detachable and strongly poisoned head . The powerful arrow poison used by the Andorobo and Masai is made from the leaves and branches of Acocanthcra sclziinperi . The leaves and branches of this small tree are broken up and boiled for about six hours . The liquid is then strained and cleared of the fragments of leaves and bark . They continue to boil the poisoned water until it is thick and viscid , by which time it has a pitch-like appearance . The poison is kept until it is wanted on sheets of bark . After they have finished preparing the poison they carefully rub their hands and bodies free from any trace of it with the fleshy , juicy leaves of a kind of sage . The poison is always kept high up on the forks of trees out of the reach of children , and the poisoned arrows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowed away in branches . When a beast has been shot with these arrows , it dies very quickly . The flesh just around the arrowhead is then cut out and thrown away , but all the rest of the beast is eaten and its blood is drunk . All these peoples use dogs in hunting , and before starting for the chase they are said to give their dogs a drug which makes them fierce . They also catch birds with bird-lime . The Nandi go out in large numbers to hunt , surround a herd of game in a circle , and then approach the animals near enough to kill them with arrows and spears . The people who inhabit the eastern fringe of the plateau develop the fashion of the earring to a considerable extent . They begin when children to pierce a hole in the lobe of the ear through which they first pass a stick of wood the size of a match . This is increased in thickness until they succeed in stretching the lobe in the course of years into a huge loop . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian accounts of the Land of Punt ( which we take to be somewhere near Somaliland , in northeast Africa ) , they mentioned people with ears that hung down to their shoulders . Obviously they are describing the people of Somaliland as they existed 3,000 or 4,000 years ago . Some of them have a physiognomy rather similar to the Hamitic people of the north , not altogether negroes . GRAND SCENERY OP THE RIFT VALLEY The hills of the termites , or " white ants , " are not only familiar in their general outline to all who have visited tropical Africa , but even to the untraveled reader of books describing African exploration . Therefore even the uninitiated would be struck by the extraordinary height and formation of the termite hills round about the Baringo district . This  | peculiar shape of ant-hill commences as soon as one has descended from the tipper part of the Rift Valley to the level of Lake Baringo , and I believe continues northward toward Abyssinia. * The scenery of the Rift Valley is very grand , especially when seen from above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the Elgeyo escarpment and looked down a sheer 5,000 feet on to a gleaming river which threaded its way through a lake and numerous pools . Here , coming from the north , begin those splendid forests of conifers ( two species of juniper and a yew ) so characteristic of this plateau region . Away to the west toward the great blue mass of Elgon , the country is of noble appearance ; splendid rolling downs of short rich grass , patches of woodland , acacia forests , and vegetation of more tropical appearance along the valleys of the watercourses . For the most part the downs , over which one 's gaze can stretch 5o or 6o miles as they gently slope toward the north or toward Victoria Nyanza , are clothed with soft , silky grass , which takes a pale pink , mauve , gray , or russet sheen as the wind bends the flowering stems before it . HERDS OF GIRAFFES Over this plateau ( where the ' traveler must beware of following any presumed native path , since it is only a cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden with sticks and cut grass ) roam countless wild animals at the present day , and I earnestly pray may continue to roam there , completely protected from the British sportsman and his ofttimes insensate ravages . The nomad natives who make these game-pits secure too small a proportion of the antelopes to be taken into much account . Here may be seen large herds of giraffes as one might see cattle peacefully standing about in an English park . These giraffes are the finest development we yet know of the northern form ? of that species of giraffe which extends all over northern Central Africa from east to west , with the exception of Somaliland , where a peculiarly colored species is developed . In color the adult males and females become so dark on the upper part of the body that , seen from a distance , they seem to  | be black or purple with white bellies , and are therefore most striking objects , especially when they stand , as they often do , on the tops of low ant-hills , from which they survey with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giraffe is thus poised on a mound like a sentinel he is absolutely rigid , and moves his head so little that the appearance of immobility , coupled with the extraordinary shape ? the short body and the enormously long tapering neck ? give the traveler the fixed impression that he is looking at an unbranched tree-trunk which has been blasted by lightning or a forest fire . But giraffes are not the only large game on these glorious downs . Elephants may be seen in great herds close by , but they affect rather more the scattered forest than the open plains . Where you see the giraffes you see also numerous rhinos in couples , male and female , or a female alone with her snub-nosed calf . The rhino looks a purple-black or a whitish-gray as he moves through the long grass , according as the light strikes him . AMAZING SWARMS OF GAME It is a glorious sight , say an hour after the sun has risen and the shadows are beginning to shorten , to traverse this grass country and see this zoological garden turned loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in face of the sunlight become a changing procession of silver and gold , the sleek coat of the zebras in the level sunlight mingling their black stripes and snowy intervals into a uniform silver-gray , while the coats of the hartebeests are simply red-gold . Dotted about on the outskirts of this throng are jet-black cock ostriches with white wings , a white bobtail , and long pink necks . Red and silver jackals slink and snap ; grotesque wart-hogs of a dirty gray , with whitish bristles and erect tails terminating in a drooping tassel , scurry before the traveler till they can bolt into some burrow of the ant bear . Males of the noble waterbuck , strangely like the English red deer , appear at a distance , browsing with their hornless , doe-like females , or gazing at the approaching traveler with head erect and the maned neck and splendid carriage of Landseer 's stags . Gray-yellow reedbuck bend their lissom bodies into such a bounding gallop that the spine seems to become concave as the animal 's rear is flung high into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a coat of red , mauve , black , and yellow satin bordered with cream color , stands at gaze , his coat like watered silk as the sunlight follows the wavy growth of the glistening hair . Once black buffalo would have borne a part in this assemblage , but now , alas ! they have all been destroyed by the rinderpest . The eland still lingers in this region , but seems to prefer the scattered woodland to the open plains . Lions and leopards may both be seen frequently in broad daylight , hanging about these herds of game , though apparently causing no dismay to the browsing antelopes . LIKE AN ENGLISH LANDSCAPE On the different plateaus between the Victoria Nyanza and the Rift Valley you travel through a beautiful country , with a climate like an English June all the year round , with beautiful forests and land obviously fitted for grain cultivation . There is much country of this style in western East Africa , with no sign of human habitation , all the natives having been exterminated at one time and another by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmen , Boers , and possibly a few Italians . The scenery between 7,000 and 10,000 feet in altitude reminds me so much of the land I live in ( the south of England ) , and the resemblance is not even entirely superficial , because you have there so many familiar wild flowers , not perhaps of the same species as in England , but certainly of the same genus . Of course , to anybody who has been a long way from home in tropical Africa , with the prospects of a tedious 7,000-mile sea voyage between him and home ,  | it makes one feel sadly happy to see such familiar friends as violets , buttercups , and the like one is familiar with in Europe . THE COLOBUS MONKEY The forests which clothe the eastern descent of the Nandi Plateau are extremely dense , full of magnificent timber , with a mingling of conifers , yews , witch-hazels , and some of the timber and vegetation more characteristic of equatorial regions ? a combination , in short , of the tropical forest with the temperate . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a European to penetrate without a pioneering party to cut a way , but which are nevertheless the hunting ground of the nomad Andorobo , the two most characteristic creatures are the colobus monkey and a large species of tragelaphus antelope , which resembles in some respects the nyala of South Africa and in others the broad-horned tragelaph of the Gaboon . The presence of this tragelaphus is often made known by its peculiar bark , but , although well known to the Andorobo , it has very seldom been seen by Europeans . But the colobus monkey ( which is found throughout the Uganda protectorate and much else of tropical Africa , wherever the forest is dense enough , no matter whether it be cold of climate or always hot ) is a far more common sight . The Andorobo who lurk in these forests live mainly on the flesh of this creature , which they shoot from below with poisoned arrows . Having satisfied their hunger on its flesh , they sell the skin , with its long , silky , black and white hair , and its tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Masai or other warlike races , who make it into head-dresses or capes , or else to the European or Swahili trader . As the Andorobo are rapidly bringing the extermination of the colobus within view , its destruction and the sale of its skin are now prohibited , though it will be a long time before the prohibition is understood and obeyed by these wild meh of the woods . LITTLE-KNOWN ANIMALS WHICH PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT MAY FIND These magnificent forests are remarkable in that they are vestiges of the ancient forest belt of Africa that stretched from sea to sea undoubtedly from the Indian to the Atlantic Oceans ; and a remarkable feature at the present clay is that many of the forest birds , beasts , spiders , and scorpions of extreme West Africa are more closely allied to the forms of eastern India and Malaysia than they are to those of eastern Africa or western India . In the forests of Mount Kenia and in the Mau , Sotik , and Nandi forests we meet with many creatures that had heretofore been associated only with West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have the magnificent Bongo tragelaph ( misnamed " antelope " ) , which is brilliant orange red with broad white stripes , and also the giant black forest pig , which was only quite recently discovered ; and it is probable that if President Roosevelt ransacks these East African forests in thorough-going fashion he may find some other beasts and birds as yet unknown to science . Take , for encouragement , the case of the okapi . That animal was absolutely unknown to us a few years ago . The first hint of it was derived from Stanley . When I was going out to Uganda and East Africa , in 1899 , Stanley , who was an old and dear friend of mine , gave me a farewell dinner at his house in London and talked over the things I might discover . He said that there were two creatures he should like to know more about among the animals of the great forests . One . seemed to be like a donkey ; the natives had told him they used to catch a wild donkey in pitfalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that a donkey should exist there . I also believe I saw a pig bigger than any of the swine known to us at the present day . It was once when I was stumbling along through the forest when a large black pig rushed across my path and nearly knocked me over , but when I had recovered my wits .  | it had escaped into the almost impenetrable forest . " Now this giant pig was actually discovered first of all in Stanley 's Ituri forest by N. E. Copeland . Afterward a different species was brought to light in East Africa jointly and simultaneously by a civilian , Mr. Hobley , and an army officer , Captain Meinertzhager . Then it was rediscovered again by Baron Maurice de Rothschild in the Nandi forests . Finally a third species was found by Mr George L. Bates in the Kameruns . I believe President Roosevelt is anxious to secure for science an undoubted specimen of the white or square-lipped rhinoceros , which has been reported to exist in the northwestern parts of British East Africa . The white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its distribution to Africa south of the Zambesi , but where , owing to the somewhat reckless slaughter of wild game in the years before we appreciated the value of them , had become nearly if not quite extinct . A few , however , still linger in Zululand , perhaps in the vicinity of the upper Zambesi . It is interesting now to know that this creature has been found in western Uganda and on the White Nile . There is an intimate connection between the fauna of extreme south Africa and that of the regions of the Nile Valley . And of course there is a still more interesting connection between the fauna of today in eastern Africa and the pliocene and early pleistocene fauna of Europe as far north as southern England , in days when man was already man and hunted these creatures such as you would see them being hunted today by negro hunters . Among the species of rhinoceros inhabiting Europe in the pleistocene were probably representatives of the pointed-lipped form and of the square-lipped species . PICTURESQUE NATIVES AROUND LAKE VICTORIA The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year or so still a source of amusement to the excursionists whom the Uganda railway will bring from the east coast of Africa to the Victoria Nyanza ; for they will see before them coal-black , handsomely formed negroes and negresses without a shred of clothing , though with many adornments in the way of hippopotamus teeth , bead necklaces , earrings , and leglets of brass . They are very picturesque as they strut about the streets in their innocent nudity , decked with barbaric ornaments . The men wear not one earring , but fifteen ! Holes are pierced all round the outer edge of the ear , and in these are inserted brass fillets , like melon seeds in shape , to which are attached coarse blue beads of large size and dull appearance . These beads the knowing tourist should collect while they can be purchased , as they are of mysterious origin and great interest . They are not , as he might imagine at first sight , of European manufacture , but have apparently reached this part of the world from Nubia in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper Nile . As the figures thus exhibited are usually models for a sculptor , this nudity is blameless and not to be discouraged ; moreover , it characterizes the most moral people in the Uganda protectorate . This ebon statuary lives in pretty little villages , which are clusters of straw huts ( glistening gold in the sun 's rays ) , encircled with fences of aloes , which have red , green , and white mottled leaves , and beautiful columns and clusters of coral-red stalks and flowers . There are a few shady trees that from their appearance might very well be elms but are not , and some extraordinary euphorbias , which grow upright with the trunk of a respectable tree and burst into uncounted sickly green spidery branches . Herds of parti-colored goats and sheep , and cattle that are black and white and fawn color , diversify these surroundings with their abrupt patches of light and color . They belong to the better class of Bantu negroes , of that immense group of African peoples which has dominated the whole southern third of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyanza to the Upper Congo , Kamerun , Zanzibar , and Zululand . This great Bantu family is noted for the beauty and relative simplicity of their languages . The Bantu languages form a most interesting subject of study , because they are obviously of quite recent origin and constitute a refreshing contrast to the linguistic conditions existing in all that vast Sudan and in western Guinea , where nearly every tribe speaks a language differing radically from that of the next tribe . Once you cross the Bantu border to the south you come to a family of languages almost as closely interrelated in its members as is the Aryan group of Eurasia , so that when once you master one Bantu language it is relatively easy to pass on to another . This gives us extraordinary facilities for entering into direct communication with the people of the southern third of Africa . THE LARGEST KNOWN VOLCANO IN THE WORLD The crater of Mount Elgon , on whose slopes it is probable the President will also do some hunting , is about 14,200 feet above sealevel . I believe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcano in the world . The superficies of the whole mass of Elgon is about equal to the area of Switzerland . It is almost as though Switzerland were concentrated into a single huge mountain mass . The crater is perhaps 30 miles across . Many caves are found around the circumference of Mount Elgon at an average altitude of 8,000 feet and at the bottom of abrupt terraces . I think the caves were formed originally by the action of water , but undoubtedly they have been enlarged by the work of man . They have been inhabited for a period of unknown length . In fact , there are vague indications that Elgon was a great trading resort in quite ancient times ; that between Hamites and negroes Egyptian trade goods coming from the Land of Punt ' reached Mount Elgon , where they were exchanged for the products of the forest negroes . We have also evidence that the blue beads that have been dug up there , and which are sought for as great rarefies , are of ancient Egyptian origin . These waterfalls are a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid cascades , and in nearly every case they mask a cave . I am inclined to think that the cave represents the original channel of a stream which has been blocked by lava rock and the stream eventually flowed over its closed canon . Passing under a Zoo-foot cascade of water we find the entrance to a dry , comfortable cavern . Thus the entrance to the cave-man 's home is completely masked from the outside by a stream of water . In several cases the entrance to the cave has been defended by a rude stockade , with huge stones piled on top of branching boughs . There are remains in France and other parts of Europe showing that the cave-men of prehistoric times adopted almost the same method of restricting and defending the access to their caverns . One fascinating aspect of the study of backward parts of Africa is like mounting Mr Wells ' time machine and traveling backward to vanished phases of European life in the stone age . Paleolithic man still lived on in Tasmania till 1871 . In negro Africa you can find existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors passed in Britain and in other parts of Europe . Giant bamboos are found on the East African elevated plateaus above 7,000 feet , growing in some places to about 100 feet in height . A native beau of this region dresses his hair into little balls with red clay and mutton fat and decorates his ears with white flakes cut from the large Achatina snail shells . THE REMARKABLE KINGDOM OF ' UGANDA The people of Uganda present a very striking contrast after having traveled , five hundred miles through a land of absolute nudity and finally reach a people who make it an offense to go about insufficiently clothed .  | is from end to end one beautiful garden , where the staple food of the people grows almost without labor , and almost everything else can be grown better and easier than anywhere else. * The administrative capital of Uganda , where the headquarters of the protectorate administration are established , is remarkable for its lovely scenery . This is situated at Entebbe , on the long , indented peninsula of that name which stretches many arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the native language " a throne . " There are lofty green downs on this peninsula , which command a splendid view over the coasts and islands of the northwestern part of the lake . It is round the foot of these downs , on their southern aspect , that the European settlement is built . The eastern side of Entebbe is tropical forest of exceptional magnificence , which has been cleverly transformed by Mr. Alexander Whyte into botanical gardens , some day to become notable for their beauty . One prominent feature in the landscape of Entebbe , and in fact of much of southern Uganda , is the lofty incensetrees ( Pachy lobus ) . These grow to a great height and are perennially covered with a rich green pinnate foliage . The rugose trunk of thick girth sweats a whitish gum , which , scraped off and burnt on hot coals , produces the smoke of fragrant incense . These trees produce at certain seasons of the year enormous quantities of blue-black plums , which are the favorite food of gray parrots , violet plantain-eaters , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , there is one of these trees growing those who live in the neighborhood may enjoy all day long the contemplation of the gorgeous plumage of these birds , the antics and cries of the parrots , and the wild gambols . of the monkeys . THE NATIVE CAPITAL OE UGANDA . The native capital of Uganda is , perhaps , best styled Mengo , that being the name of the king 's quarter . Mengo is like ancient Rome ? only much more so a city of seven hills , as any one living there and obliged to move about knows to his cost . Each suburb or portion of the straggling town of some 77,000 souls is a hill or a hillock in itself , with an ascent or descent so steep as often not to be compassed on horseback . In between these hills or mounds there are bottoms of marsh , or there are marshy streams which slowly percolate through dense vegetation . Yet sections of the town inhabited by the little king and his court , the native gentry , and the common people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar to Uganda , which , by the interlacing reeds , exhibit a bold pattern enclose the ground on either side of the broad red road . Behind these reed fences are numerous courtyards in which bananas grow , and at the end of each series of yards is the closely thatched residence of some family or household . Everything bears a neat , swept-up appearance , and the handsome trees and general richness of vegetation round the dwellings make it a city of gardens . Along some of the roads there must be straight perspectives of one or more miles in length , and the breadth of the avenues has about it something royal and suggestive of a capital . Mission buildings , with cathedrals in brick and stone , or in humbler materials of cane , thatch , and palm poles , rise from three of the great hills . A MOST HOSPITABLE AND KINDLY PEOPLE . The people are extremely hospitable . On my journey through the kingdom , the local chiefs had sent out to hundreds of their people , and each came in bearing at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought cows , goats , a sheep , or anything that they could think of that would gratify the white man . They are the most naturally cultivated of any of the African natives with whom I came in contact . How they acquired this native civilization is not yet clearly known . A more charming people you could not meet in Africa . Their tact is really remarkable . They would send spies into my camp to find out my tastes  | and idiosyncrasies . Thus they learned that I was especially fond of tea between five and six o'clock in the afternoon . Then they would say to themselves , " He will start at such and such a time . " So they would arrange a resting place near the road , set a table , and lay it with a clean cloth . Then they would have the kettle boiling at the right time , so that just as I reached the top of some hill the tea would be poured out and handed to me in a shady arbor . THESE PEOPLE ARE RELATED TO THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Bahima , in their features and traditions suggest a far-off affinity with ancient Egypt . They must have penetrated further and further south , and wherever they went they were received , as demi-gods by the forest negroes . The actual word for demigod , " spirit , " is the same as the appellation of these aristocrats ( Bachwezi ) at the present day . They have an almost Caucasian profile , but they have acquired typically negro hair . The Bahima are the cause of the hallucination existing fifty or sixty years ago at Zanzibar , that there was a white , race living on the Mountains of the Moon . It was the infusion of this Gala or Hamitic blood into the races of Uganda ( which consisted mainly of the ordinary black Negro stock grafted on to a preceding dwarfish race like the Congo Pygmies ) that built up dynasties and kingdoms which in comparison with most Negro states were powerful , well organized , and endowed with some degree of indigenous civilization . This infusion raised the peoples of Uganda , and the countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of comfort and refinement a good deal superior to the life led by the naked folk to the east and north of that lake , many of whom were still leading an existence no higher in culture than that of predatory carnivorous man in the lowest Stone Age . The people of Uganda can recall their kings of a period as far distant as the fifteenth century . The genealogy of the Uganda sovereigns includes thirty-six names ( prior to the present king ) ; and if the greater part of the earlier names are not myths , this genealogy , reckoning an average fifteen years ' reign to each monarch , would take us back to the middle of the fourteenth century . Though the Uganda dynasty , no doubt , in its origin is Hamitic and of the same race from which most of the earlier inhabitants of Egypt proceeded , nevertheless , as for several hundred years it has married negro women of the indigenous race , its modern representatives are merely negroes , with larger , clearer eyes , and slightly paler skins . When these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost knowledge of the outer world seems to have been a very vague perception that there was an Abyssinia , or a country to the northeast , which was a powerful kingdom inhabited by people of palish complexion : while in other directions their geography was bounded by the marshes of the Nile , the Congo Forest , Tanganyika , the steppes of Masailand , the cold Plateau of Nandi , and the mass of Mount Elgon . ATTEMPTS TO TRAIN A WILD ELEPHANT One day a baby elephant was presented to me by an Uganda chief . It is a sad thing to relate , but three men were killed in attempting to capture the first elephant . I had expressed a wish one day for some elephants to experiment with in domestication , and the natives , with their usual desire to please me , were so ardent in their determination to gratify my wish and so determined in their pursuit of the young elephant that the mother elephant knocked over and killed three of them . But finally they succeeded in their object , capturing the calf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Wien . This little creature was at the time only four feet high . In two days it had become perfectly tame , and would follow a human being as readily as his own  | mother . It was easy enough to feed him with milk , because all that was required was a bottle with a long neck . This Pottle was filled with cow 's milk diluted with water , and poured down the elephant 's throat . Soon all that one had to do was to place the neck of the bottle in the elephant 's mouth , and the intelligent creature wound its trunk around the neck of the bottle , tilted it up , and absorbed the contents . For several weeks the elephant throve and became a most delightful pet . It would allow any one to ride on its back , and seemed to take pleasure and amusement in this exercise . It would find its way through diverse passages into my sitting-room , not upsetting or injuring anything , but deftly smelling and examining objects of curiosity with its trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young zebra , which was also to be the pioneer of a domesticated striped horse . These two orphans , the elephant and the zebra , became greatly attached to each other , though perhaps there was more enthusiastic affection on the part of the elephant , the zebra at times getting a little bored with constant embraces . Alas and alack ! both elephant and zebra died eventually from the unwholesomeness , to them , of cow 's milk . Several other elephants of the same age ? that is to say , about four to six months old ? were delivered into my hands , but all eventually died . Cow 's milk appears to give these creatures eventually an incurable diarrhea , while all attempts at that early age to substitute for milk farinaceous substances have also resulted in a similar disease . I do not say that it is impossible to rear young elephants by hand for we have not made a sufficient number of experiments , but it is very difficult . I therefore favor the plan of attempting to catch elephants of perhaps a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an exclusive diet . One specimen of this age was caught and was readily tamed , and for aught I know is still alive in captivity . ( See also page 252 . ) GIGANTIC PAPYRUS There is a remarkable similarity about all the landscapes in Uganda . There are rolling , green downs rising in places almost into the mountains , and every valley in between is a marsh . This marsh is often concealed by splendid tropical forest . Sometimes , however , it is open to the sky , and the water is hidden from sight by dense-growing papyrus . The broad native roads make as straight as possible for their mark , like the roads of the Romans , and , to the tired traveler , seem to pick out preferentially the highest and steepest hills , which they ascend perpendicularly and without compromise . The road is as broad as an English country road , quite different from the ordinary African path ( which is barely the breadth of the space occupied by men walking in single life ) . On either side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven or eight feet , but it is interspersed with gayer-flowering plants and shrubs . The road ascends a steep hill through this country of luxuriant grass . The hilltop reached and the descent begun , the traveler sees before him a broad marsh in the valley below . The descent to this marsh is possibly so abrupt that it is deemed wiser to get off the horse or mule and leave that beast to slither down sideways . Looking on either side as the marsh is being crossed , the traveler will notice first of all the gigantic papyrus , which may ' be growing as high as fifteen feet above the water and interspersed amongst papyrus roots are quantities of fern , of amaranth , or " love-lies-a-bleeding , " and the gorgeous red-purple Dissotis flowers , a yellow composite like a malformed daisy , and large masses of pink or lavender-colored Pentas . There are also sages and mints which smell strongly of peppermint , and a rather handsome plant with large white bracts and small mauve flowers . In - and out of this marsh vegetation flit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them is particularly beautiful , with a body of black , white , and dove color and a crimson back . The new ascent of the inevitable hill which succeeds the marsh may lead one through a more wooded country , where , among many other flowering shrubs , grows a species of mallow ( Abutilon ) , with blush-pink flowers in clusters , like dogroses in general appearance . The forests and marshes of Uganda abound in remarkable monkeys and brilliantly-colored birds to a degree not common elsewhere in tropical Africa ; but the Kingdom of Uganda , as may be imagined from its relatively dense population ? a population once much thicker than today ? has been to a great extent denuded of its big game , and it is unlikely the President will spend much time there . GORGEOUS DISPLAYS OF FLOWERS Some of the forest trees of Uganda offer magnificent displays of flowers . There is one , the Spathodea , with crimson-scarlet flowers larger than a breakfast cup and not very dissimilar in shape . These flowers grow in bunches like large bouquets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red light is a magnificent spectacle . Other trees present at certain seasons of the year a uniform mass of lilac-white flowerets , as though they had been powdered from above with a lavender-colored snow . The india-rubber trees and lianas have white flowers , large and small , with yellow centers exhaling a delicious scent like jasmine , but the blossom of one of these rubber trees is vivid scarlet . The Lonchocarpus trees have flowers in color and shape like the Wistaria ; from the branches of the lofty eriodendrons depend , on thread-like stalks , huge dull crimson flowers composed of innumerable stamens surrounded by thick carmine petals . The Ern , thrina trees on the edge of the forest seldom bear leaves and flowers at the same time . When in a leafless state they break out into a crimson-scarlet efflorescence of dazzling beauty . The Pterocarpus trees have large flowers of sulphur-yellow . Many creepers have blossoms of orange , of greenish-white , pink , and mauve . Some trees or creepers ( Combretuna racemnosum ) are like the Bougainvillia , throwing out wreaths and veils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the color is given by bracts , the flower itself being crimson and of small size . Blue alone appears to be missing from this gamut of color in the forest flowers , though it is frequently present among herbaceous shrubs or plants growing close to the ground , and , so far as the trees are concerned , is often supplied by the beautiful species of turaco that particularly affect the forest , and by large high-flying butterflies . Whatever may be the case in the Congo basin , where the forests often appear sadly lifeless , the woodlands of Uganda are full of color and noise from the birds , beasts , and insects frequenting them . Monkeys are singularly bold and frequently show themselves . There is the black-white colobus with the long plume-tail which has been already described ; there is a large greenish-black Cercopithecus , and another species of the same genus which is known as the White-nosed monkey . This is a charming creature of bright colors ? chestnut , blue-black , yellow-green , and gray , with a snow-white tip to its nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turacos are even more abundant in these Uganda forests , and there are green and red love-birds , gray parrots with scarlet tails , and the usual barbets , hornbills , shrikes , fly-catchers , bee-eaters , rollers ? all of them birds of bright plumage or strange form . ENORMOUS BUT SLUGGISH PYTHONS AND PUFF-ADDERS There are other forest creatures that are not harmless sources of gratification to the eye . Lying among the dead leaves on the path may be the dreaded puffadder , with its beautiful carpet-pattern of pinkish gray , black , lemon-yellow , and slaty blue , and with its awful head containing poison glands more rapidly fatal than those perhaps of any other viper.  | Numerous pythons , from fifteen to twenty feet in length ( generally disinclined to attack human beings , however ) , are coiled on the branches of the trees , or hang by their tails like a pendent branch , swaying to and fro irr the wind . Their checkered patterns of brown and white are rendered very beautiful sometimes by the bloom of iridescence which imparts rainbow colors into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think nothing of laying hold of the wild python , who may perhaps have coiled himself up in some hole , and however much the snake hisses and protests , it seldom seems to bite . Yet these snakes could crush a man between their folds , and do crush and devour numbers of sheep and goats . They seem , however , very loath to attack mankind and will allow extraordinary liberties to be taken with them . The vividly-painted puff-adders are as common as the pythons , and although their bite is absolutely deadly , they , too , seem too sluggish to attack unless by some blunder you tread on them and wait to see the consequences . Therefore the snakes are far less an annoyance or an impediment to the exploration of these forests than the biting ants . These creatures are a veritable plague in moist , hot regions where there is abundant vegetation . I suppose they are sometimes at home and resident in their underground labyrinths , but they are a restless folk , forever seemingly on the line of march . They traverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worn in the soil by the passage of their thousands . When you come across one of these armies of ants in motion , on either side of the main stream , which is perhaps only half an inch broad , there may be a couple of feet of biting warriors in a swarming mass on either side of the rapidly marching army of workers carrying pupae . Sentinels are out far and wide in all directions , and if you pause anywhere within a few feet of this marching body of ants you will very soon feel the consequences in a series of painful nips as though from red-hot pincers . These warrior ants know no fear . They attack any creature which comes near their line of march , burying their powerful mandibles in the flesh , and will then let the head be torn from the body sooner than give way . THE BANANA GROVES . A description of Uganda would not be complete without a reference to the banana groves , which , from an agricultural point of view , form the distinguishing feature of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa in its origin . I believe botanists consider that it first diverged from wild forms of Musa in Eastern Asia , and , like all the other food products cultivated by the negro , traveled to tropical Africa from India at some prehistoric period . I , too , held this opinion once , but I can not indorse it so heartily now , on reflection . I believe there is no record of the banana having been known to the ancient Egyptians . It would , in any case . be difficult to make a native of today believe that his beloved food substance , which . provides him with a mass of nourishing vegetable pulp , with a dessert fruit , with sweet beer and heady spirit , with soap , plates , dishes , napkins , and materials for footbridges , was not always indigeneous to the land he dwells in and of which it has become the distinguishing feature . THE GORILLA AND OTHER STRANGE ANIMALS In western Uganda beyond the Semliki River , the traveler can walk with a reasonable degree of comfort between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a height of 200 feet above the ground almost completely shuts out the sky . This is said to be the region more favored by the okapi than the districts of dense undergrowth . In the depths of these mysterious forests the natives assert that there are other strange animals besides the okapi . A creature which they described as like a pig , only about six feet  | long and very stoutly built , may be the little forest-haunting Liberian hippopot. amus . There are also stories of a large antelope , with a few white spots or markings , which has very disproportionately small horns in the male . There is a great deal of talk about a huge manlike ape , but this apparently is nothing more remarkable than the gorilla . The range of the gorilla extends to within a few days ' journey of the Semliki River , and specimens which have been killed by natives and photographed by Belgian officers ( the photographs were shown to me ) are nothing but gorillas , so far as I can judge . The hair of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt from age . The leopards in this forest are exceedingly dreaded by the natives , and the stories of their man-eating habits are innumerable . WILL THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT BECOME EXTINCT ? The elephant inhabits these forests in large numbers , but he appears to frequent with equal relish the savannahs and open grassy plains of the Semliki River and at the south end of Ruwenzori . On our return journey through the Congo forests we halted at the edge of a picturesque gorge , a small river . Though but a small stream , it had in course of time widened for itself a profound gorge that would be large enough for a Hudson and deep enough for a Colorado . Gazing across this gorge one evening ; we saw an immense herd of elephants coming toward us , seeming in the distance very black in color against the pale straw-yellow of the dry , short grass of the plains , but with white gleaming tusks , each elephant looking extraordinarily like the Eastern carvings of black ebony elephants with ivory tusks that are to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precipitous descent to the gorge , I thought to see them turn back , but with great ease they slid and scrambled down the steep sides , rushing with shrill trumpetings to the reed beds which marked the invisible watercourse . We shot two males out of this great herd , having permission to do so from the Congo Free State authorities . When the first rifle shots rang out , it was a touching sight to see the baby elephants run to their mothers ( it was one of those large mixed herds that one so often sees with females and young accompanied by young full-grown males ) , and the mother separate her front legs as widely as possible to receive the little one under the protection of her body , ceasing her fierce trumpetings every few minutes to caress the frightened little one with her trunk . After the shots which laid low these two young males , the frightened animals in their panic tore up and down the gorge through the dense vegetation , not , however , attempting to charge us , though at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp . These breeding males appear to be quite young for elephants , say twenty to thirty years old ) , with relatively small ( fifty-pound ) tusks . So long as the British government can determinedly enforce the game regulations by a small annual expenditure , and protect female and immature male elephants from being killed by natives or Europeans , there will not be much danger of the African elephant becoming extinct in a territory so large as British East Africa , where Nature has reserved vast marshes and leagues of forest for shelter of this beast . Provided the most religious care ? such care is effectual in India ? was taken of the females and young , there is no reason why a certain number of male elephants should not be killed yearly by designated agents of the government , and their ivory be sold to merchants as part of the Protectorate revenues . I see no reason whatever now why the female African elephant should not be tamed and used as a transport animal . For this purpose it might eventually prove advisable to import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young captured Africans . ( See also page 242 . ) If after many years of trial the African elephant is pronounced to be hopeless as a domestic animal ( and it should  | be remembered that most male African elephants in captivity have shown themselves to be hopelessly savage ) , then at least for its magnificent ivory the creature is worth preserving as an asset to the state . If the Indian elephant shows himself to be more docile than the African elephant , it must be remembered , on the other hand , that he is of very little value for his ivory . THE MOST DREADED OE AFRICAN BEASTS I am afraid that blustering creature , the rhinoceros , can be turned to no useful purpose in the future of Africa , but he is such a grotesque survival from the great mammalian epoch that he should be steadily preserved from extinction . The rhinoceros , however , is a handful , to use a colloquialism . All along the route of the Uganda Railway game is being carefully protected , with the agreeable result that antelopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as fearless of man as if they were in an English park . Much the same condition may be observed in parts of the Protectorate off the beaten track , where British sportsmen have not had an opportunity to harry and destroy . But in all these countries the rhinoceros is not tamed by this tolerance , but is apt to become a dangerous nuisance by charging at all and everything at a moment 's notice when it is playful or out of temper . Thus among a people like the Masai it is much dreaded . The Masai do not eat , and therefore do not kill , game . They fear no wild beast but the rhinoceros , because all other creatures , if they are let alone , seem to experience , as a rule , no desire to attack human beings . The rhinoceros , however , makes absolutely unprovoked charges and occasionally gores a man before he has time to get out of the way . Fortunately these huge beasts are very stupid and very blind . They probably can see little or nothing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are guided entirely by their sense of smell , which , however , is extraordinarily keen . The rhinoceros of which a picture is here given ( page 229 ) is the ordinary pointed-lipped , black rhinoceros of Africa , which ranges , or used to range , from Cape Colony to Abyssinia and Nubia , and thence , perhaps , across Africa westward to Lake Chad and Eastern Nigeria . So far as I am aware , the rhinoceros has not been found to exist in Africa west of the Central Niger , if , indeed , it gets much farther west than Lake Chad. * This is curious , if true , because the other big beasts of the African fauna , though , like the rhinoceros , they mostly avoid the Congo and West African forests , stretch in their distribution right across Africa , from Abyssinia to Senegal . The two exceptions , however , to this rule seem to be the zebra and the rhinoceros . Not infrequently the East Africa rhinoceroses produce horns of extraordinary length . The record , I believe , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFRICA WHERE ROOSEVELT WILL HUNT IS PROBABLY THE MOST INTERESTING REGION GEOGRAPHICALLY IN THE WORLD That portion of the British sphere in East Africa where Roosevelt will hunt contains , within an area of some 150,000 square miles , nearly all the wonders , most of the extremes , the most signal beauties , and some of the horrors of the Dark Continent . Portions of the surface are endowed with the healthiest climate to be found anywhere in tropical Africa , yet there are also some districts of extreme insalubrity . It offers to the naturalist the most remarkable known forms among the African mammals , birds , fish , butterflies , and earth-worms , one of which is as large as a snake and is colored a brilliant verditer-blue . In this Protectorate there are forests of a tropical luxuriance only to be matched in parts of the Congo Free  | State and in the Kameruns . Probably in no part of Africa are there such vast woods of conifers . There are other districts as hideously desert and void of any form of vegetation as the worst part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marsh to be met with in any part of Africa , and perhaps also the most considerable area of tableland and mountains rising continuously above 6,000 feet . Here is reached the highest point on the whole of the African continent ; here is the largest lake in Africa , which gives birth to the main branch of the longest river in that continent . There may be seen here perhaps the biggest extinct volcano in the world ? Elgon . Though lying on either side of the Equator , it contains over a hundred square miles of perpetual snow and ice ; it also contains a few spots in the relatively low-lying valley of the Nile , where the average daily heat is perhaps higher than in any other part of Africa . Within the limits of this region are to be found specimens of nearly all the most marked types of African man ? Congo pygmies and the low , ape-like types of the Elgon and Semliki forests , the handsome Bahima , who are negroids as much related to the ancient Egyptians as to the average negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Appollo-like Masai , the naked Nile tribes , and the scrupulously clothed people of Uganda . These last again are enthusiastic , casuistic Christians , while other tribes of the Nile province are fanatical Muhammadans . The Bahima are , or were , ardent believers in witchcraft ; the Basoga polytheists are burdened with a multiplicity of minor deities , while the Masai and kindred races have practically no religion at all . Cannibalism lingers in the western corners of the Protectorate , while the natives of other parts are importing tinned apricots or are printing and publishing in their own language summaries of their past history . This is the country of the okapi , the whale-headed stork , the chimpanzee , and the five-horned giraffe , the rhinoceroses with the longest horns , and the elephants with the biggest tusks . A GREAT BOOM IN EAST AFRICA Great changes are taking place day by day in British East Africa , owing to the completion of the Uganda railway , which will prove to be , I think , one of the mightiest factors yet introduced into Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one at any rate attaining to the civilization of settled India . I have had the privilege of seeing this country just in time ? just before the advent of the railway changed the Rift Valley , the Nandi Plateau , the Masai countries , from the condition at which they were at the time of Joseph Thomson ( 1882 ) to one which day by day becomes increasingly different . On grassy wastes , where no human being but a slinking Andorobo or a few Masai warriors met the eye ; where grazed Grant 's gazelle , with his magnificent horns , and the smaller but more gaily colored Gazelha thomsoni ; where hartebeests moved in thousands , zebras in hundreds , ostriches in dozens , and rhinoceroses in couples ; where , in fact , everything lay under the condition of Britain some 200,000 years ago ; not only do trains puff to and fro ( the zebras and antelopes are still there , accepting the locomotives like a friend , since it drives away the lions and ensures the respect of the game laws ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrugated iron and towns of tents and straw huts . The solitude of the Rift Valley has gone . Thousands of bearded Indians , hundreds of Europeans and Eurasians , negroes of every African type ( from the handsome Somali to the ugly Mudigo ) , Arabs , and Persians trudge to and fro on foot , ride donkeys , mules , and horses , pack the carriages like herrings , set up booths , and diverge far and wide a hundred miles in each direction from the railway line , trafficking with shy and astonished natives , who had scarcely realized the existence of a world outside their own jungle , for the beef , mutton , fowls , eggs , and vegetable foodstuffs  | which are to assist in feeding this invasion . Far away on Baringo natives are extending their irrigation schemes and planting twice as much as they planted before , knowing that there is a market where their spare food can be exchanged for rupees . Farther north still , in the Suk countries , Englishmen , Scotchmen , Goanese , Arabs , Swahilis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trading for ivory which the railway will carry to the coast at a rate less than the cheapest porter caravan . THE RAILWAY PROTECTS THE GAME The Nyando Valley , for years without human inhabitants other than the shiftless Andorobo , is filling up with Masai , Swahili , and Nandi immigrants ; while for 20 miles at a stretch on the beautiful heights and happy valleys of Mau you are in the presence of an unintentioned European colony , some of which no doubt will melt away with the completion of the railway , but much of which must be the nucleus of the great white colony one may hope to see established on the only land really fitted for its development in equatorial Africa . The Kavirondo , alas ! are wearing trousers and " sweaters ; " the sacred ibises have left Kisumu , for its swamps are drained . Piers and wharves , hotels and residences in corrugated iron , are springing up at Port Florence , destined , no doubt , to be  | a great emporium of trade on the Victoria Nyanza . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railway has actually come to the fore as a means of game preservation . It is really amazing how all the wild animals , except perhaps the lion , have taken to the railway . The big and small game soon realized the fact that they were shot at less from the railway line , and finally not at all , while on the other hand the lions , and perhaps leopards , were perturbed by the noise of the train , and began to shun the line , for , as regards shooting , exceptions were naturally made in their favor . However strict have been the game regulations in force for the protection of game along the line , naturally no restriction has been placed on the shooting of lions , leopards , and hyenas . Whether or not these deductions are fanciful , the plain fact remains to be testified to by any one who now takes a journey on the Uganda Railway that from the window of his carriage he can see as the train crosses certain tracts positive zoological gardens let loose .  |  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
