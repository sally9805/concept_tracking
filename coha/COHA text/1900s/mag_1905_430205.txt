 |p1110  " WHAT is Mr. Lawson 's reputation in Wall Street ? " I asked a well-known banker recently , not because I was curious to know his opinion , but the rather that I wished to see if I had properly gauged Wall Street opinion of the picturesque Boston character who seems now constantly to be in a state of eruption . " Reputation ? " the banker queried ; Lawson 's reputation ? " Then , after a pause , slowly , " Why ? he has n't any . " This , however , is drawing the long bow . It can not be truly said to represent the real Wall Street view of Lawson . For that matter , properly to understand and appreciate this point of view it is necessary to divide the Street , like Gaul , into three parts , to wit : the derelicts , the rank and file , and the responsible banking interests , for each one of these groups looks at Mr. Lawson with a different eye , and in the metaphorical handling of him uses pitchforks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . To begin at the beginning : When Mr.  |p1111  Lawson began his campaign for the purification of the financial center of this newer world , for the elimination of all the ills to which financial flesh is heir or prone and for the extinction of the capitalists who have done so much to build up the great industries of the country ? such men as Mr. J. P. Morgan , Mr. J. D. Rockefeller , Mr. James Stillman , Mr. H. H. Rogers , Mr. H. C. Frick and their co-workers and associates ? all Wall Street laughed . It was too amusing . Mr. Lawson did not mean it , or , if he did mean it , he was taking himself too seriously . At once came to mind the Lawson fight over his - cup defender yacht , which never defended , for reasons too well known to need repetition here ; came reminders also of Mr. Lawson 's rejection by several important social organizations in which were conspicuous certain of his old time business associates ; came reports of losses incurred by Lawson through rapid-fire work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lawson , one of the pool , was , in the vernacular , " leaking " ? which , being interpreted , means that Mr. Lawson , tho pledged to hold his stock to the end of the pool 's existence , was secretly but persistently dribbling it out . Hearing and remembering these things , Wall Street as a whole merely laughed when Mr. Lawson explained that he was rolling up his sleeves and was prepared to do or die . The predictions were many that Mr. Lawson 's move was merely a bluff , that in due time he would call himself off or be called off for a consideration , and that his campaign was that , vulgarly speaking , of a " sorehead " who , successful financially , found himself as it were a social outcast among the men whom he had helped or who had helped him to riches . Not for an instant was it believed that he would make good , or make a show of making good , his promises or his threats to tell the truth , the whole truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amalgamated " and about , also , sundry other financial crimes . This was the first phase of the Wall Street idea . Passing over several months , we come to the second phase . Mr. Lawson in his magazine articles was , in the opinion of some people , beginning to strike near home . Without doubt he was telling some truths ? how much or how little only those on the inside really knew . Beyond this Mr. Lawson stood revealed in a new light . Most people had regarded him , if they regarded him at all , as merely a man who had a great deal of money and who in the making of it had had neither time nor opportunity nor inclination to develop the intellectual and the finer side . And , behold ! there appeared a new Lawson : a student of conditions , a close observer of things , a reader of character , a man with a philosophy of his own and , above all , a writer at once so forceful , so picturesque and so alluring that he fairly carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man was more than a financier . He was a literary artist ; in the opinion of most people in Wall Street the best magazine writer of the day , plausible , powerful , amazingly original and always interesting . Thereupon the Wall Street attitude changed . From one of indifference and of ridicule it gave way to that of interest and curiosity and finally of wonder ? wonder , after all , if Mr. Lawson was n't really more in earnest than people had originally given him credit for ; wonder if perchance he would tell " the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth . " A few there were , to be sure , who still laughed at him and poohpoohed his declared intention to " drive the rascals out , " even tho he himself might go with them . But , generally , because of the interest excited by his articles and the newspaper notoriety that he had obtained , Mr. Lawson came to be regarded not so much as a thing of " shreds and patches , " but rather as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capable of doing much good ? or much harm . Some there were who still predicted that he would be bought off , but the majority began to believe in him and to declare that whether he was genuine in his work of reformation at first , he had so worked himself into a frenzy that , egged on by the socialistic element , who never see good in Wall Street , he fully believed he had a mission in life to perform ? the cleaning of the Wall Street houses . His articles were read word for word and discussed everywhere in the Street . When in his maga/ zine he , as it were , shook his head , Wall Street generally ? the larger banking interests excepted ? metaphorically shook ins head . There were to be " doings , " that was certain . Unquestionably scores of people had lost money in copper ; now they were to be shown how and why they did lose it ; tho some skeptics then wondered and still wonder why , if the rich nen are so powerful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called " rich man 's panic " of two y ears ago , when the wealthiest men in the country are known to have lost most heavily , despite their every effort to stay the tide swift flowing to lower prices . Another lapse , and the Street was again beginning to get doubtfu ' of Mr. Lawson . " In my next " he was always promising . It was the old Spanish cry , " Mariana , Manama , Manama " ? " to-morrow . too orrow and to-morrow . " Nothing that was not old or already known had been told but ? " in my next . " Nevertheless , Mr. Lawson was building better than the Street knew ? building for himself . At the beginning of his crusade he had warned every man , woman and child in the country , every barber , bootblack and waitress who had had a " fling " in the McKinley boom market , to beware of the market and to get from under nor stand upon the order of getting from under . Yet after six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until prices in many instances were the highest on record . Despite Mr. Lawson 's warnings and in the face of his predictions they had thus mounted , and for some weeks he had been marvelously still ? for Mr. Lawson . It was the opinion of most banking interests in the Street that prices had gone too high ; that a great deal of prosperity had been discounted and overdiscounted , and that it was a matter of but a brief time when the professionals who had jacked the market up would come to grief . These wen made no effort to conceal their views . They had been selling stocks on a scale up and at the top were well cleared of their commitments . Mr. Lawson learned these things ; his scouts and acolytes and emissaries were busy . With the exception of Mr. James R. Keene , he is perhaps the best market manipulator in the country . The time to smash prices had come . Gut first Mr. Lawson sold quietly many thousands of shares of stock , quietly and with as little influence upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue , he put out his " panic " advertisement in the newspapers , and with his followers , bona-fide brokers and bucket shop men as well , he fairly " avalanched ' ' the market . Prices crumbled away , five , ten , twenty points . and Mr. Lawson and his friends made a killing . That was the panic of December last , now known as the Lawson panic . It was then that Wall Street became divided into three parts so far as this story is concerned , for there sprang up a new Wall Street class as a result of this panic ? derelicts . These are the unfor1 unates who in the brief two ( lays of that panic lost countless thousands , many of them their all . The panic came as out of a clear sky , and scores of those who lost ever that in those two clays Mr. Lawson did more harm to innocent families throughout the land than could ever be offset by all the good that his magazine articles could produce , did they produce everything and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sprang up this new class in the Street ? men ruined by Lawson , who now damn him as seldom has individual ever been damned in the financial bailiwick . Yet , on the other hand , this coup gave Lawson a great uplift and renewed prestige . Here was still another phase f his character . He was more than a snudent of conditions , he was more than a writer , he was more than a market manipulator . He was able to see and to seize the psychological moment . More , he was able to do ; for had he not clone what he had promised to do ? shake the market to its very foundations ? And so his fame spread and his followers grew . Likewise his predictions , among them that Amalgamated Copper ? The Crime ? was going to 3o or thereabouts . He ( lid not say it in so many words , but the implication was that he would put it there . On the morning of the ( lay that that prediction was made Amalgamated and the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amalgamated was 6o points above Mr. Lawson 's predicted figure and the whole market was higher than ever . Again , therefore , a Wall  |p1113  Street change . Time and time again Mr. Lason came out with his warnings , predicting panic , but the market gave no heed . Slowly it came to be the opinion of speculators in the Street that as a market power Mr. Lawson was discredited , and that it were better for him did he stick to his articles , promise less and write more . And then , horrible of horribles , came the Equitable scandal , and came also Mr. Lawson 's " I told you so . " The Boston man again mounted his pedestal and there , especially since the demoralized market of these last few weeks , the rank and file in the Street ? by these I mean the " ticker fiends " and outside operators who , speculating on margin , hang over the ticker and sweat drops of blood when the market is going up against them ? allow him to remain ; indeed , believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by details , but by large results . Did he not say that the insurance companies were being looted ? Lo ! the Equitable turmoil ! Did he not say that the bankers of the country were speculating with the people 's money ? Lo ! the defalcation of President Bigelow of the First National Bank of Milwaukee ! Did he not say there would be a panic ? Behold ! prices at this writing are at the lowest point of the year . It matters not that his prediction in respect to Amalgamated has gone wrong and that the stock is now on a firmly established four per cent . basis , and , some people say , may receive greater returns yet ; it matters not that a score or more of his other predictions have gone absolutely wrong . The speculators bulk him large . They look not upon the many special things gone awry , but upon the result generally . There has been panic , there has been life insurance scandal , there has been bank defalcation : ergo , Mr. Lawson , as a prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoned with . Unfortunately , this sort of admiration is ephemeral , and if Mr. Lawson courts it he had better make the most of it while he may , for those who bestow praise upon him are a fleeting people ? in Wall Street to-day , gone to-morrow , empty of pocket and richer of experience . Those who remain will go to recruit the already large ranks of derelicts , and then they will be despisers of Mr. Lawson . But tho these fly-by-night speculators may place Mr. Lawson on a pedestal , they can not force the regular habitues of the Street , the brokers and the conservative bankers , to accept him at this lofty elevation . These men believe that Mr. Lawson should sell " ex-pedestal " ? considerably ex . They still refuse to take him seriously and there is little likelihood that they ever will . They know the man . They knew him , they say , putting it plainly , to be disgruntled ; they know him , they declare , to be chafing because his social ambitions have not been realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a man who turns upon his friends so only that there be a dollar in it ; they know him as a disseminator of false reports ( as witness his recent dispatches ) and as one who does not hesitate to assail character , whether with or without reason ; they know him as a traitor to his own associates . Yet they know him also to be a man of unquestioned physical courage and of great natural ability , a man quick in action , firm and tenacious in purpose , ready with his pen and equally ready with his tongue , and for the nonce , explain it as they may , with his knife out for the biggest financial men in the country . They ridicule him , they despise him , but not for an instant do they affect to ignore his possibilities for harm . They regard him as a man with a grievance , a disturber and a nuisance ? nothing more . They admit even that some of the things he has said are true , but they declare that for every statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man is as picturesque an exaggerator as he is a writer . Briefly put , then , the Wall Street estimate of Lawson is this : The more recent of the financial outcasts , once prosperous , but now content to cling to the ragged edge of the Street in the hope of a turn for the better in their fortunes , damn him as the author and agent of their troubles . The transient speculators who stand by the ticker the livelong day incline strongly to him , aye , believe in him and are confident that he is a man with a mission , that he is telling much truth and that in the end he will carry the people with him in his fight against the " unrighteous system " of which he  |p1114  was so long an integral part . The brokers and the bankers regard him as a disturber of the peace and as one who is actuated by selfish motives , by wounded pride and by a desire for revenge ? all three . In their estimation he is at once the Benedict Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because , if his own story be true , he is engaged in betraying his fellows ; the Bryan , in that , demagogic-like , he is seeking to array the masses against the classes , endeavoring , in short , by creating distrust and uneasiness and unrest through the perversion of a half truth into a whole one , to destroy the financial structure of America 's greatest and readiest market . His , they say , is the buccaneering kind ; the " pea-under-theshell " type , who , always smiling , ever gives you the worth of your money and the right change back ? " in the next . " He is , you will be told if you care to ask , not within speaking distance of the Morgan , Rockefeller , Stillman , Frick class . They and their kind will be in Wall Street when he and his kind are nowhere . Mr. Keene is immeasurably above him ; even Mr. Gates with all his faults is far superior to him . In short , he is a good man ? bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone wrong . As Kipling would say , there is " too much Ego in his Cosmos , " and the Ego is not of the right kind . Such at least is Wall Street banking opinion . Withal , it is agreed by all classes that Mr. Lawson is at once picturesque and amusing , a skillful market operator , a richer man as a result of his crusade , and last , but not least , a direct and pleasing contributor to the gayety of nations .
