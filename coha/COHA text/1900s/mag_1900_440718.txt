AT first thought , the existence in the Spain of to-day of a literature that ranks with the best of other countries in its modern quality of thought and in masterly form would seem to be a most remarkable phenomenon . But , after all , it is not so remarkable ; for if there is a law in these things , the law must demand that literary activity shall persist so long as the language and the race that produced it may exist . If the land of Shakespeare has a great contemporary literature , why not the land of Cervantes and Calderon ? But the conditions are different , it is replied . England is mighty ; Spain is weak . English-speaking peoples are literate ; Spaniards are illiterate . England , however , was an illiterate country when it produced Shakespeare , ? probably more illiterate than Spain was in the clay of Cervantes . Spain is still an illiterate country , ? much less so , indeed , than when Don Quixote was written ; but conditions not radically unlike those that prompted Cervantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present . Now , as then , these conditions compel greatthoughts to expression ; and now , as it was then , the speaking has more regard to the quality of the audience than to its numbers . In the latter respect the audience has given little pecuniary encouragement . This constituency , however , we should bear in mind , is wider than that comprised in the few millions of the Iberian Peninsula . For as Greater Britain extends around the world and includes the American republic in its realm of letters , so Greater Spain is also world-embracing ; and that its reading public is by no means inconsiderable is manifest in the numerous bookstores to be found in capitals like Mexico and Havana . Aside from a group of brilliant dramatists that snake the Spanish theatre of to-day a force as vital as it was in the times of Calderon and Lope de Vega , contemporary Spanish literature can show a list of eminent names in fiction . At its head stand Pereda , Galdds , Alarcon , Valera , Emilia Pardo Bazan , and Vald6s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are such authors as Navarrete , Ortega Manilla , Castro y Serrano , Coello , Teresa Arroniz , Villoslada , Am &; Escalante , and Oiler . Armando Palacio Vald6s , like Senora Pardo Bazan , is one of the relatively younger writers , and like that lady , who is regarded by not a few critics as the foremost woman novelist in the world , is one of the greatest figures in contemporary Spanish literature . But while Senora Pardo Bazan is an aristocrat by birth , and somewhat so in personal attitude , ? though intrinsically democratic in subject and treatment , as an author , ? Vald4s is essentially a man of the people ; radically democratic , and in religious matters transcending the limits of creed . Vald6s stands high in the esteem of many English and American readers , to whom he has been made familiar by the translation of several of his novels ; and he has enjoyed the rare distinction of the appearance of one of his novels in English , in serial form , here in the United States , prior to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain . He was born in the province of Asturias , in a village called Entralgo , where his parents possessed a small estate , that is now his own property . Entralgo is situated in the wildest and most rugged part of Spain , and is partially described in the author 's first novel , El Sefiorito Octavio , and partially in El Idilio de un Enfermo ( The Idyl of an Invalid ) , his third important work . In the former , he speaks of a view near the village as " one of the most splendid and grandiose panoramas of the most beautiful province of Spain . " Segada , as he calls his native village in the story , rises from the depths of the valley in the angle formed by a brook that runs from the neighboring mountains to the Lora . " A half league down the valley , which is not extensive , is to be seen a white group of buildings , ? the town of Vegalora . Between the village and the town the river runs turbulent and clear , traversing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient to its course . As it changes its bed very frequently , the fields of maizeand the meadows that border its banks are never certain of the morrow , and are as ready to regale ear and eye with HI* sonorously waving maize and their verdant turf as they are to torment the feet with their rounded or pointed pebbles . The people of Vegalora and Segada , in the space of forty or fifty years , have seen the river run over almost the entire surface of the valley . Notwithstanding this , in a little while after the river has forsaken any part of its bed a rich vegetation breaks forth , and the valley continues always picturesque and joyous like few others . On all sides it is surrounded by hills of a regular elevation , clothed with chestnut woods and gleaming meadows , except below , or on the Segada side . Here the hills occupy only the front rank ; above them there rise enormous and craggy mountains , snow-covered from October to June , forming part of the wild cordillera that separates the provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was therefore the last council-town of the province , and beyond those immense and shadowy masses there extended the barren and dilated plains of Castile . " The mother of young Palacio was not resigned to the life of the village , and in the year of his birth the family removed to the maritime town of Avil4s , where her own people lived . This town is the scene of Marta y Maria ( Martha and Mary ) , the novel that caused Howells to give Vald4s a most cordial introduction to the readers of the Editor 's Study , in Harper 's , and is pictured in that story under the name of Nieva . The lad ran about the town at complete liberty , acquiring , like so many coast-town boys , an extravagant liking for maritime life . He had exceedingly good and tolerant parents , and his childhood was happy . At the age of twelve years he was sent to study at the secondary school at Oviedo , the capital of the province , where he lived with his grandfather . He spent his summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ble cast of melancholy , confirmed me in my philosophical idealism . The man who has received from Heaven such a companion can be neither skeptic nor materialist . " Senor Vold &; leads a quiet life , reading , working , enjoying physical exercise , and looking after his boy , now a lad of about fifteen years . His favorite reading is supplied by the Greek classics , Shakespeare , Molibre , and Balzac . He abhors the materialistic tendency of French positivism , but at the same time he is fond of the natural sciences . Instead , however , of finding therein ground for credulity and skepticism , he sees more clearly each day that the grand enigma of existence can be solved only through the medium of faith . " Every man of feeling possesses the secret , " he says . " In the silent enjoyment of this , and with a continuous and , sustained activity , I live in a sweet melancholy which I would not exchange for all the empires of the earth . " In these words the author writes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues for me a pleasure , as much when I read as when I write . On the other hand , I avoid the literary life , which here is sad and poor as you can hardly imagine . I believe that the spectacle of the general life of the world in all its rich variety is indispensable to the poet , but I find literary intercourse dismal . I therefore pursue a fairly sociable activity , but without literary society . I remember only that I am of that sort when I sit at my desk to write . The poets and the novelists of the present age do not lead the adventurous and interesting life of our colleagues of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . Life , in normalizing itself and becoming more secure , has lost much of its poesy . Our biography is purely internal ; and the little that ' 3 interesting and external about us costs labor to achieve . What I wish to convey to you is that I am much given to the exterior life ; it pleases me to live in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page in my novels that I have not lived , or seen enacted before my eyes . Wherever I go , I like to dispossess myself of my character and my opinions , that I may assume those of the persons about me . In this way I have at times lived it all : vicious and virtuous , man of studies and man of the world , laborer , mariner , politician , and the rest . But do not believe that I have done this with literary intentions . Nothing of that sort ! It is because I have a character but vaguely defined , and therefore I enjoy adapting myself to the medium in which I live . The happiest days of my life , apart from the year and a half when I was married , were those which I passed in living the life of a fisherman in a little village on the coast of Asturias . Life is bad and sad ; but believe me , my friend , that we make it more sad and bitter by not knowing how to extract the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this that Valdds has the prime qualification for a great novelist , in the modern sense , that is , a revealer and interpreter of life , ? for he has the power of identifying himself with the lives of others . When he describes his character as one that is but vaguely defined , it must not be understood as something shadowy and lacking individuality . It is rather one that shades off , and merges itself in the life of the whole . The walls of the personality , commonly so dense as to shut the individual into a cell of selfishness , dull to impressions from without and correspondingly meagre in spirit , are thus made tenuous and sensitive , delicately responsive to the world 's movement . Hence they constitute but a slight barrier against the external , permitting him to make the life of others his own life , the sum of their experiences his own experience as well , and enriching his soul with the life of the world . This confers true individuality upon the personal unit that feels itself the centre of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wholeness , of his work there is therefore the deepest , keenest sympathy with all things ; a clear vision that penetrates to darkest depths , that lifts itself to farthest heights , illuminating and clarifying . He shows us the timings of every day and of common life as they are , but we are made to see them with his sense of proportion ; and while we recognize them as the things we have always known , he endows them with unsuspected interest , and reveals their inherent character in a wealth of illustrative detail . He refutes most convincingly the charge that realism in art exalts the trivial . He says that no one who has meditated upon the lofty problems of existence can speak depreciatively of trifles in life . The trivial , he maintains , is but a relative term ; that which is a trifle for some is the great fact for others . " The death of a child , for example , is an insignificant event , a trifle , in every village , however small it may be ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important and transcendental of their lives . The deposing of an alcalde and his trial are a capital occurrence in any town , but a trifle for the province to which that town belongs . The incidents of a political struggle in any province are important facts there , and trifles for the nation . The revolutions that agitate and destroy the nation are facts of little moment in the lap of humanity . And following this order of reasoning , we comprehend how this very planet where we live is verily a sad and insignificant trifle in the depths of infinite space . Either no created thing has importance , or it has all importance . The last is what I believe , for in all things the divine substance is manifest , hidden or revealed . In the whole of the particular the general exhibits itself ; in the whole of the finite , the infinite . Art is that which has the mission of revealing this ; it is that which represents absolute truth in sensible images . The more particular , the more determinate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will discover a new form of the infinite existence . " Valdds frankly confesses that he is neither pessimist nor optimist ; or rather , that at times he is both . He says that if he wrote for the sake of popularity he would be ostentatiously optimistic , and carefully efface from his pages every pessimistic thought . But since pessimism represents one of the great phases of existence , one half of the truth attained by human understanding , and since the two elements will ever be factors in all creations of art , lie feels that , should he confine himself to this side , he would show himself wanting in the artistic sincerity which he regards as indispensable to every literary work . For a work of art is no more than a manifestation of the way in which the artist 's spirit has been beautified in the contemplation of nature . If this beautification is false , if the artist has not felt that which he says , a beautiful result is not possible . " Sincerity , therefore , if not the foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As to literary decadence , Valdds holds that it can be manifest only when authors strive to falsify their sentiments , with the gross intention of producing excessive effect , of affecting excessive originality . The principal cause of decadence in contemporary literature he finds in the vice which , very graphically , has been termed " effectistn , " the itching to awake in the reader , at any cost , vivid and violent emotions that accredit the inventiveness and the originality of the writer . " This vice is rooted in human nature , and more visibly in that of the artist . His spirit has something of the feminine that stimulates him to coquet with his - reader , dangling before the eyes those qualities in which he believes he excels , just as women smile without other motive than to show their teeth when they are white , // regular , and dainty , or lift the skirt to show the foot when there is no mud in the street . " Our author remarks that French naturalism errs in supposing that realism is incarnated exclusively in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiring some of its most illustrious exponents , he protests that it represents only an insignificant part of life ; far from being a definitive literature , as claimed by some of its greatest representatives , lie is inclined to regard it as even more ephemeral than romantic literature . His ground for this is that it is characterized by gloominess and by a certain limitation . Among its merits he reckons its freshness , spontaneity , and , above all , legibility , qualities that make one think and feel something . But the rock on which many novelists affiliated with the modern French school find shipwreck is prosaism . " The novel is a work , not of science , but of art ; it is the poem of our times , and its sole end is to express the life and the beauty of human beings and their relations . " We are not accustomed to think of the Spanish as a humorous people , though if we reflected a. moment we should perceive that a race that produced a Cervantes could not well be other than humorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributes of Spanish literature , and Valdds has his full share of the gift . His work is saturated with it , and it is of a rich , delicious , sympathetic sort , that somehow seems strikingly akin to the humor which we know as distinctively American , ? perhaps more akin than the humor of any other nationality , not even excepting that of our brothers the English . In a discussion of the place of humor in literature , Valdds says that , in general , the style called humoristic is that which best reveals the personality of the writer ; and this is easy of comprehension . " The humorous is an entirely original mode of expression , " lie says . " The writer appears completely on the scene , and does not permit affairs to develop according to their conventional logic , but in obedience to that of his own head . " While the greater number of critics have considered Valdds an essentially humoristic writer , and while he allows that possibly humor may be that trait which is most intimate and genuine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind partisan , and holds that it has a place in fiction only under conditions of limitation and quality . Of the various kinds of humor , he defines one class as that which scoffs at all created things , setting a constant negation against every human sentiment , whatever it may be ; seeing in all manifestations of the real nothing but vain appearances , and pausing only to destroy them . " There is also a form of humor that consists in a play of the imagination , which capriciously alters and transforms the logical order of natural relations ; which is alert for paradoxical ideas and daring strokes , in the doing of which the author takes all his glory , without heed for the development of matters according to their nature . And finally , there is a humor that strives to set the vain appearance of things face to face with a lofty ideal that the author does not express , but permits to be divined . " In the first-mentioned class he arrays a multitude of satirical writers , without faith in anything , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their ruinous passions , attacking indiscriminately the good and the bad . In the seem-id class Jean Paul Richter and Heinrich Heine are ranked as the two most notable models . " The third has been illuminated by a number of immortal spirits adored by humanity : Cervantes , Sterne , Molibre , Dickens , etc . I love solely the humor of these . When the spirit places itself on a level so elevated that it reveals the misery to which it is subject at the time , and opposes thereto the permanent and divine principle that resides in all beings ; when 552 A Great Mod the sublime contempt for the transitory penetrates our soul , and we joyously contemplate ourselves joined by an eternal bond to the Infinite Idea that animates creation , then I believe with Jean Paul that the humoristic form is the most beautiful and excellent of all ; for it responds to the most elevated situation in which the spirit may find itself . This humor , implacable and disdainful of the ruinous and trivial manifestations of humanity , respectful of noble sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sacrifice of self , of all , in short , that proclaims that , though we come from the shadow , we march toward the light , that we are citizens of heaven , ? this humor is that which I delight to accept in the novel . The rest , above all the first , repel and make me indignant . I would break my pen to pieces before I would knowingly scoff at the good , the holy , and the beautiful . " There are conventions as to what may properly be subjects for literary treatment , and as to what may properly be said , that , as a rule , are more limited in the literature of our language than in that of most other countries . There is no call for the discussion , at this moment , of the merits or the justification of the respective attitudes upon this question of literary propriety . In a measure , it is a matter of local convention , ? much as though the word " pantaloons " were something not to be uttered in polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were under a similar ban in another . So far as manner of expression goes , Veld &; is no exception to the custom of wider latitude in utterance , common to Latin tongues . But the impression made is by no means repellent ; at the most , the effect is that of an engaging frankness , and not a few of us are disposed to question if our own literary morality would not be of a more robust quality if , greater freedom in this regard were permissible . Veld &; is a writer intrinsically clean ern Spaniard . and pure in thought . He finds in the naturalistic French writers a mania for impudicity , which he has fortunately never met among the good writers of other countries . He says : " I abhor prudishness , but I detest as much , or more , the loathsome libertinage that is now displayed by some writers to whom God should not have given their talent , they employ it so badly . Having sufficiently considered this aspect , I am convinced of a sad truth . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their excesses there is hidden a sordid thought : that this procacity is the consequence , not of an absurd system , but of a commercial premeditation . In substance , it is that the books in which they accumulate brutal descriptions and obscene phrases sell better than those in which decency is respected . This conviction excuses me from adding another word ; however , since there are still some innocent persons who believe that not only may one licitly break with pudicity , but that in this action is contained the principal merit of a novelist , I am going to say something to dissuade them . I firmly believe , like the naturalistic writers , that on this planet the last phase of animal evolution is represented by man ; that , on this hypothesis , the study of his instincts and animal passions is of interest , and that it explains a great portion of his actions . But this study has for me solely an historical value ; because , if man proceeds directly from the animal , every day separates him more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , progress is founded . We come , it is true , from the instinctive , from the unconscious , and from the necessary ; but we march toward the rational , the conscious , and the free . Therefore , the study of all that refers to the rational , free , and conscious spirit as an explanation of the other great portion of human actions ? the only noble and worthy ones is very superior to the former . // It is more interesting to study man as man than as animal , although the naturalistic school thinks otherwise . The material act of procreation confounds us , in effect , with the beasts ; but man has added to this act a spiritual element , ? that of chastity . To destroy this is to despoil ourselves voluntarily of a great conquest and retrograde to the beast . He who respects chastity respects not only the reason of others , but his own reason . Is this as much as to say that beauty is not expressible in that which refers to the union of the two sexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the manifestation of beauty , it is essential for us to show therein the Idea ; and this may be made to appear only in adding to the material union that belongs to the beasts the spiritual element that belongs to man . That alone is good , beautiful , and true which conforms to the being or the nature of things . For beauty to appear in man , it is necessary that he should manifest himself as man , not as beast . " Discussing the question of theme in works of fiction , Vald4s remarks : " The world of poesy and of its present form , the novel , is inexhaustible . It therefore displeases me to see the naturalistic Frenchmen , and those that faithfully follow in their track , persist in limiting their themes extremely , reducing them almost to a single one , ? that of adultery . I well comprehend that in modern society adultery is perhaps the ' social relation that generates the greatest number of complications , and brings into play and tension the most recondite springs of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to affirm that other relations exist that are equally or more worthy of translation to the novel . Love contains infinite shadings , in which adultery has no place ; and aside from sexual love there exist sentiments and passions that may give being to many an interesting novel . In explanation , though not in justification , of the fact that in dramatic work the element of adultery almost always plays the leading part , it may be said that it is because the author has but little time and space at his command , and is compelled to appeal to passions that immediately generate the violent struggle and the formidable conflict . But in the novel ? a more spiritual genus , because lacking the plasticity of the drama ? the author is master of indeterminate time and space ; he may calmly prepare his situations , and the production of vivid and strong emotions to force immediate applause is not essential . This privilege must therefore be used to conduct us to all the places where any interesting condition of life may be found . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some admirable words : Realism , as a spiritual manifestation , maintains a close relation with all the other manifestations of our epoch , and is a direct consequence of the general movement of life . Our epoch is characterized by a grand sentiment of curiosity , by a vivid and constant observation of nature in science , by a tendency toward the equality of all men before the law , and by an invincible desire to scrutinize and analyze our passions and sentiments in the sphere of art . The man of this epoch wants to know everything and enjoy everything ; he directs the objective of a powerful equatorial to the celestial spaces where moves the infinitude of the stars , as he applies the microscope to the infinitely small , whose laws are identical . His experience , joined to his intuition , has convinced him that in nature there is neither large nor small ; all is equal . All is equally great , all is equally just , all is equally beautiful , because all is equally divine . Just as science studies with extreme solicitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not perceive , and derives from its examination as rich a source of wis- 554 A Great Modern Spaniard . dom as from astronomical mathematics and physics ; just as politics , by means of ' long and painful labor , if not by vivid and cruel experimentation , has succeeded in elevating the condition of a great number of men condemned to perpetual degradation , realizing the sociological principle of equality before the law : so art , following the Fame impulse , has raised up certain beings that were condemned to perpetual ugliness , and has proclaimed them beautiful . In acquiring its political rights the lowly estate has acquired the right to beauty . The ancient poets , with rare exceptions , found worthy of their songs only the kings and warriors , the princesses and their sublimated loves , the heroic enterprises , the joys and the sorrows of the great ones of the earth . Those of today do not fear to soil their wings by descending to the abodes of the poor , to sing their feelings and their actions , often as interesting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Evangeline , Eugenie Grandet , poor children , born and reared in humble social spheres , are the beautiful heroines of our poems , ? as beautiful and interesting as Helena , Dido , and Penelope . The beings who are worthy subjects for art have neither country nor social condition ; they are born in all countries and in all classes of society . To be beautiful , it is only necessary for an artist to find them such , and to have adequate power to make them appear so to others . " Realist as he is , Valdes has little sympathy with certain manifestations of recent literature that have been classed as realism , and there is much about Ibsen and Tolstoi , as well as about the naturalistic Frenchmen , that he can not stomach . He believes that at no time is there lacking talent for art , and the reason for the absence of good art at certain periods he ascribes to quite other causes . He attributes decadence , when there is no external reason for it , to a perversion of taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adequate direction for artists . The origin of this perversion of taste , he holds , is not to be sought in momentary circumstances , in defects of schooling transmitted from one individual to another , or in fortuitous deviations . Its root is to be found , in his judgment , in the same principle that has engendered the great artistic superiority of the Occident as compared with Asia , in the greater development of individual energy . " The greater individual energy , the affirmation of its independence in the presence of nature , producing variety of character , is that which has elevated the Greek above the Hindu , and Occidental art above Asiatic . In the Oriental world there exist only types : hence the monotony of its poetical monuments , though often not wanting in beauty and sublimity . But that fecund principle for civilization , and singularly for the arts , which generated the Iliad , the Prometheus Bound , the Niobe , and the Parthenon ; which later created the portentous works of the Renaissance , being exaggerated in modern Europe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of balance , and has resulted in decadence . The exaggeration of individual energy and of independence has transformed those qualities into vanity . This is the worm that corrodes and paralyzes the force of contemporary artists . " Both Valdes and Sefiora Pardo Bazan have adopted the admirable custom of occasionally including with one of their novels a prologue setting forth their ideas in relation to literature . In this way they secure a wider public for such utterances than if published separately , for in the latter form their sentiments would be likely to gain but small circulation . The prologues which Valdes has written for his La Hermana San Sulpicio ( The Sister St. Sulpice ) and his Los Majos de Cadiz ( The Gallants of Cadiz ) are two of the most valuable essays deleted material 556 A Great Modern Spaniard . to his hearers . ' Do you not know that your souls form part of mine ? Yourselves and mine are distinct beings in the world ; in God , our common origin , we are one being , and we live one and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , Valdes has been singularly loyal to the high standard that he has set . He is , of course , no exception to the fact that there has never yet lived an artist who has not departed from his ideal . But this departure has at no time been taken with deliberate intention , and he has ever been frank to acknowledge his shortcomings . He confesses that there are some chapters in his books that he would now take great pleasure in effacing , and he purposes to banish from his productions every false and unreal element ; his endeavor being to produce an effect , not violent , but deep . His sole aspiration is to touch his readers , to bring to their thoughts and perceptions the beauty that ever passes unheeded before their eyes . He therefore seeks the simplest form for his work , with the purpose of giving verisimilitude to the picture ; avoiding . the idea that what is presented is a phantasmagory ; striving to make it appear , on the contrary , that it is an integral part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no desire to make an astounding effect with his inventions , for he well knows what such things amount to ; but he wishes to make his readers remember all their lives certain characters , whose originality and beauty he himself has felt , or which have impressed him profoundly in the course of his existence . To be guided by nature , not to do violence to her , is his principle . He feels that what every artist should do is to take her by the hand , and , like those modern divinators when they seek to discover the place where some object has been concealed , carefully follow the slightest impulses , until he reaches the spot where are hidden his treasures of the beautiful . His first novel , El Sellorito Octavio , with all its shortcomings , is a work full of brilliant promise , rich with the charm of description , and notable for a trait that strongly marks his writings , ? a hearty detestation of the conditions that confer privilege of birth . A chief character in the book is a nobleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a varnish of manner , makes us feel that aristocracy itself is something essentially mean and base , bearing the seeds of inevitable decadence . That aristocratic lineage is quite likely to originate in meanness and Laseness is made evident in much of his subsequent work . In Maximina , for example , we are told that the habitual attitude of the typical young aristocrat is one of universal depreciation of everything , and we find it expressed in these words that give reasons for his pride in himself : " I am owing ninety thousand dollars ; I am a viscount , and am ' sonic pumpkins ; ' I play a powerful game of baccarat ; an ancestor of mine used to put on Philip IL 's boots ; I can drive a carriage like the best coachman ; I wear such notable pantaloons that passers-by turn their heads to look ; I have an affair with a ballet girl at the Royal Opera , and others are paying for it . " The strongest picture , however , of the worthlessness of aristocracy as an institution is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in the English translation is wrongly entitled Scum . It is a vivid presentation of the gilded and frivolous life of fashionable Madrid , in which the vulgar multimillionaire , with a freshly bought ducal title , plays a dominant part among the descendants of those whose rough metal of rank , similarly purchased centuries before , has by long usage been worn to polished elegance . But that gentle birth is not necessarily synonymous with a decadent character is abundantly shown in the author 's work . A most charming example is that of the manly young Marques de // Pefialta , in Marta y Maria , the second novel of Vald6s , and an admirable work . A. most sympathetic figure in this story is Don Mariano Elorza , a typical cultivated modern Spanish gentleman : liberal in views , sincerely religious , but making a distinction between religion and the clergy , " for whom he professed a sort of Voltairean enmity , " and holding unchangeable faith in modern progress . He had an enthusiasm for new inventions , and if any interesting machine that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send for it , although he had no use for anything of the kind , and his house was full of curious mechanical contrivances , all covered with dust . This lovable gentleman is marked by many of the kindliest traits , and the author individualizes him with such delicious touches , for instance , as a passion for the smell of fresh linen , so that he loved to go and hold his face in the closet where it was stored . Marta y Maria is the story of two sisters , ? one domestic in character , and the other dreamily religious . The intense degree of selfishness that may characterize a devout nature is depicted with consummate delicacy . One thing that must impress the reader of this book is that the Spanish people there portrayed are remarkably like ourselves . The scene is in a town on the north coast , and in its essentials the life of the place seems much the same that one might find in a town on the New England coast , with minor differences of local color . The north coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the scene of Josh , a masterly study of humble life on shore and sea , and of El Cuarto Po-der , while the scenes of Riverita and of Maximina are in part laid there . El Mille de un Enfermo is a beautiful study of a primitive bucolic life . In El Cuarto Poder the theme is that of the establishment of a newspaper in a little town where nothing of the kind had before existed , and the amount oftrouble that was stirred up thereby . The . fact that the men of the place used to slap one another 's faces when enraged , and that they used to settle their difficulties with the fist , seems quite Yankee-like , and considerably at variance with our traditional conception of Spanish procedure in these matters , which we have been wont to fancy had a deal to do with knives and pistols . But such a thing as a duel was unknown in that region , until the innovating founder of the newspaper , fired with the desire for improving and modernizing the town , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarrel with an editor elsewhere in the province , ? after duly taking a course with a fencing master , expressly imported , ? and precipitated a duel ! In Riverita we have a most captivating picture of boy life , stamped with truth on every page ; and in Maximina , its sequel , the character of the heroine is one of the most exquisite in modern fiction . We are made to feel that it is as true as it is angelically beautiful . In the celebrated scene of the balcony , where Maximina and her husband stand and look at the midnight heaven , we have a noble example of the mysticism that forms a lofty trait of the author . Many eminent Spanish writers of the present , as of the past , have a strong mystical cast in their writings . This is natural , of course , in a land whose people are saturated with mysticism . We find it in Gald6s , in Valera , in Pardo Bazan , and in Alarcon , as well as in Valdfs . In El Origen del @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ending of the novel is marked by it as by the pure harmony of a symphony 's close . But the sublimest manifestation of this quality is found in La Fe ( Faith ) , which in certain ways is the masterpiece of Valdfs . La Fe is the story of a youthful priest , a saintly character , who is made a skeptic by the reading of modern scientific and philosophical works . He is falsely . accused of crime , and is condemned to a long imprisonment . But his pondering over the riddle of life and his anguish of soul carry his understanding beyond the limitations of material science , and land him in a faith immensely higher than that which had been destroyed , so that his prison life is made an absolutely blessed one . " Back of this life of appearances that surrounds us he saw the real life , the infinite life , and he entered into it with a heart filled with joy . In this infinite life everything is love , or , what is the same thing , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empire of Eternity . It is the life of the spirit . The world can not change it , nor time destroy it , for it is the essence of time and of the world . He enjoyed life in God ; beyond the realm of time , he lived at the very fountain head , ideal and perennial , of the imaginative world that envelops us all . His days no longer passed sadly and anxiously , as a part of time . He no longer feared the torment of will , no longer uttered pitiful complaints about Isis sins , about his vanquished resolutions ; for he no longer loved Isis own works , however good they might have been , as once he had loved them ; he loved only the Eternal . For works have their origin in the person , and he had rid himself of his ; he had denied it with firmness . In the midst of a holy and sweet indifference he left God to work within his spirit . Forever exempt from doubt and incertitude , he knew that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be added thereto . He was sure that the fountain of divine love that had been revealed within himself would nevermore be exhausted , and that this love would guide him eternally . The fear of destruction by death no longer perturbed him . Death , since his entrance into the life of eternity , bad become incomprehensible . It was not necessary for him to descend to the tomb to obtain this life eternal ; it sufficed him to join his heart to God in order to possess it and to enjoy it . " He learned , in the end , once and for ever , that man may save himself from grief and from death , not through reason , but through faith ; that is , through a knowledge distinct from and superior to that which reason may give us . Since this knowledge had illumined his spirit , he had attained absolute felicity . Without inquietude for the future , without feeling for the past , hungering for nothing , neither refusing anything , his life had for some time been gliding by like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let fall the burden of desires and of sorrows that had bound him to the earth . Set free from all illusion and from all effort , with neither fear of annihilation nor egoistic hope of resurrection , by the virtue of faith and of love he had learned how to reproduce in his soul the true kingdom of God . " In both La Fe and El Origen del Pensamiento the sophistical and morbid psychology of Lombroso and his school receives scathing condemnation , and in the latter the positivist philosophy meets with keenest ridicule . The shadow side of life prevails in El Maestrante , a heartrendingly tragic book . But both in this and in El Cuarto Poder , which is tragical in its outcome , there is so much of the world 's sunnier aspect that the sense of verity ? which has to do with a life of infinitely commingled light and shadow , more or less of one and the other here and there ? is not broken . El Maestrante has something of the inevitable movement of a Greek tragedy ; and in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruinous decadence of a worn-out aristocracy , which in fact is the great lesson of the book . The merriest , sunniest work of Valdis is La Hermana San Sulpicio , vivacious as the nature of the Andalusian folk among whom its scenes are laid . It is an enchanting idyl . Los Majos de CMliz is a comedy , in the true sense of // the word , of life among a lower social class . Like Jose and El Idilio de un Enfermo , it tells us that the same sentiments and passions , the same thoughts and emotions , have the same inherent interest among humble people as in higher ranks of life . Valdes 's latest work is La Alegria del Capitan Ribot ( The Joy of Captain Ribot ) . Like La Hermana San Sulpicio and Los Majos de Cddiz , it is a story of the semi-tropical south of Spain , and exhibits Valencia as they depict Andalusia . There is a classic serenity in the pictures of the tranquil life in the luxuriant huerta , the wide - expanding garden of the ancient kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its villas imbedded in flowers beside the sea . It has the same gay sparkle , the same idyllic movement , as La Hermana San Sulpicio , but is informed with some of the deeper tones of life . For all lovers of wholesome art , it has a special value in being " a protest from the depths against the eternal adultery of the French novel , " as the author wrote of it to a friend . In Delia Cristina , the lovely and devoted wife who is the heroine of this very human story , Valdes has created one of the most vital figures in recent fiction , hardly surpassed in sympathetic charm and gracious presentation by any other woman that lives in the world 's literature . We have seen that Valdes has been true to the office of the novelist in its highest sense , ? that which transcends the rdle of mere entertainment to the function of the interpreter of life . Hehas shown us the heights and the depths , the sunshine and the shadows , of very much of human existence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty , we may expect to explore under his illuminating guidance many another province of the infinite realm of the beautiful , the true , and the good . Less than two years ago , his country and ours , the land that he dearly loves and the land that we dearly love , were at war . Passions hateful in God 's sight were aroused . Multitudes in each laud were thinking all ill of the people of the other . But we have seen how a great writer of Spain has been true to the life of its people . Natural history tells us that in any species we can find no normal example that does not constitute a type of innumerable individuals that closely resemble it . We therefore may be sure that a country whose people have produced such types as Maximina , Padre Gil the convict-saint , and numerous other persons of kindly heart , noble mind , and beautiful spirit , all so genuinely human , that are found in the works of Valdes and his eminent contemporaries , ? as in the past that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inspired the lovely works of Murillo , ? must possess unnumbered beings of similar worth . Higher than any man-governed country in our allegiance is the fatherland of the spirit ; and compatriots therein , with many of ourselves who understand and love them , are Valdes and those countrymen of his who are his brothers in heart and soul .
