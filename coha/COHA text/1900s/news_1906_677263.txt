txt Gov . Higgins to-day appointed two new members of the State Racing Commission , and reappointed one of . the present members , John Sanford of Amsterdam . August Belmont , who held over since last May , when his term expired , has been dropped from the commission , as has also E. D. Morgan . In their stead the Governor appointed James W. Wadsworth of Geneseo , the representative in Congress from that district and father of the present Speaker of the Assembly , and Harry K. Knapp , a banker of 30 Broad Street , New York . Mr. Belmont 's retirement from the Racing Commission has been foreshadowed in these dispatches for several weeks , and in appointing as his successor Congressman Wadsworth , the Governor has carried out views which ex-Gov . Odell tried vainly to imress upon him a year ago . The first row between the Governor and Odell came about through the former 's retention in office of Mr. Belmont , who , Odell pointed out , had been active in trying to defeat Gov . Higgins in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . It is also stated on authority that Mr. Belmont 's attitude against the proposed Cassidy-Lansing anti-gambling bill , which the Governor favored , cut a considerable figure in the Governor 's action in dropping him from the board . The Racing Commission is now solidly Republican . Mr. Belmont was its only Democratic member , and as Mr. Morgan did little in the active work of the body the main duties devolved upon Mr. Belmont The appointments made by Gov . Higgins for the State Racing Commission are the first changes that have been made in that body in the eleven years of the commission 's existence . Harry K. Knapp , the new Chairman of the commission , has been a member of the Board of Stewards of The Jockey Club for about the full period of the existence of The Jockey Club and the State Racing 2ommission , both of which were created in the Winter of 1895-6 , the State control of the turf owing Its being to the Constitutional amendment which wiped out the old Ives pool law and compelled reorganization . Mr. Knapp until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in racing , the Very fact that he owned and rode horses or had anything to do with racing being due to the fact that he was the brother of Dr. Gideon Lee Knapp , founder of the Oneck Stable , under which name H. K. Knapp still races . The Oneck Stable was first conspicuous as the owner of Sir Walter . Last year it suddenly became again prominent through the ownership of Kiamesha , the fill which at Belmont Park last Fall equaled the world 's mile record . Mr. Knapp , through his long association with the members of the Board of Stewards of The Jockey Club , Is regarded by racing men as an official who is devoted to the policy outlined by The Jockey Club on its formation , and therefore no marked changes from its general policy are looked for . August Belmont , the Chairman of the State Racing Commission , whom Mr. Knapp succeeds , has occupied the office ever since the commission was created under Gov . Levi P. Morton , his reappointment as Chairman without a change in the commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Sanford , having been made successively by Goys . Black , Roosevelt , and Odell . Mr. Belmont was also Chairman of the Stewards of The Jockey Club , created to ucceed the old Board of Control , from the time that the new order of turf affairs was made necessary . He was active in the reorganization of the turf and in the support of the Percy-Gray bill , which was enacted and renewed the privileges of the race courses in New York under restrictions which are still in farce . Mr. Belmont is still the Chairman of The Jockey Club , having been re-elected only a few weeks ago . E. D. Morgan , who is succeeded by James W. Wadsworth as a member of the Racing Commission , is closely associated with Mr. Belmont , and has served on the Racing Commission from the time that the body was created on the passage of the Percy-Gray law . His successor , formerly a member of the House of Representatives from an upper New York district , is a Genesee Valley hunting man who always has taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , but who never has figured on the turf as an owner of horses raced on the major tracks . One effect that horsemen look for as the result of the change in the make-up of the Racing Commission is a renewal of the application of the Empire City track , controlled by James Butler , for racing dates in the New York or metropolitan circuit . Mr. Butler , who is a stanch Republican , canceled a Grand Circuit date for trotting races last year , and made application for dates for a running meeting on his track near Yonkers , but was ignored by the Racing Commission and The Jockey Club . Should the Empire City track obtain dates in August through getting a license for racing from the State Racing Commission , which has the licensing privilege . while The Jockey Club allots dates , the certain outcome would be a conflict which could not be other than disastrous to Saratoga , and racing men accordingly are much interested in waiting for the outcome .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
