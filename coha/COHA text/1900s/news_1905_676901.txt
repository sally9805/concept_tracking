With the completion of the choir , one of the greatest houses of worship in the world will ' be accomplished . Speaking of the work on the Cathedral Mr. Miller said : " To obtain the foundation took over two years and the expenditure of nearly $250,000 . When the work was finished , building Was begun and has since continued . The arch which is to ' be the west retaining wall of the choir is In place . Underneath the space between this arch and the three other arches which will support the tower and spire is the crypt , which has been in use for the last five or six years . The foundations for the choir on the east have already been completed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belmont tower , erected by Mr. August Belmont , and now practically completed . " The walls Of the choir can not be built until the eight columns which will stand about the chancel are in place . These columns were originally intended to be monoliths , but this was found to be impracticable , and the trustees instructed that they be formed of two pieces of stone , 36 and 18 feet respectively in length . The task of putting them in place , even after the modification was adopted , was tedious , and it was not until November last that they were finally erected . Now there is no obstacle to the building of the choir walls , and , with the great assistance ' of Mr. Morton 's noble ' gift , work will be pushed on rapidly . " It is impossible to say just when the entire structure , as designed , will be completed , but surely , with the example of the Morton gift before their eyes , New Yorkers will come forward rapidly from now on and the great work be pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue Crowd Escapes Injury When Gas Blows Up .
