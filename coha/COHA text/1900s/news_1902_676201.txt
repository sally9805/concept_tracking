txt Fire this mornirg ate a big hole in the business section of this place and rendered a dozen families homeless , causing a money loss of not less than $75,000 . For a time it looked as if the entire business section would be destroyed , but the Manor Fire Department . under Chief Mayhew Bronson , aided by help sent up from New Rochelle , stopped the flames . The wealthy and other members of the manor 's crack fire department were routed out of bed a few minutes after 5 o'clock this morning by the alarm . The flames started in the grocery store of Kuhnas &; Quigley , a frame building on Larchmont Avenue . By the time the alarm had been given and the firemen reached the scene , the building was burning fiercely , while the flames had leaped to the Larchmont Casino , another frame building owned by William Murray . This was the home of the Larchmont Athletic Club , and the big hall was used for balls and all the large gatheringstin the village . The Alexander and Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the flames spread , although the firemen managed to save the frames , and the destruction is not complete . On the Boston Post Road and adjoining the burned buildings were the livery stables of J. C. Harding and also the Montross Stable . These were also burned . The Harding Stable was partly of brick , and this aided the firemen in checking the flames in that direction . The flames also did more or less damage to Coutant 's drug store , J. I. Wilson 's drug store , the building of Patrick Burns , and those of George Walters and John Maddox . It was between the flames and the last-named places that the firemen from the manor , aided by the help which was soon on the scene from New Rochelle. made their stand on that side . On the Larchmont Avenue side of the fire the fight was made in the Alexander and Bull Buildings after the fire had entered them . The contents of the two flat houses were ruined by smoke and flame . What little escaped the fire had to be soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the scene of the fire were of wood made the fire hard to fight . The heat was very great , and again and again it seemed as if it would force the firemen to relinquish the fight and take stands further back , but they stood their ground , even when it was so hot that some streams had to be diverted from the fire to play on the men . The fire was long enough in ; reaching the livery stables to allow of the rescue of the horses and most of the carriages . Some of the harness , blankets , &c.,; were lost . The families driven from their apartments by the fire were taken care of in the village . Mr. Kuhnas and his family , who lived over the grocery store , were taken in by Dr. Taylor . William Murray , who had two tenants rendered homeless , rented house , paying the rent for a year , and established his tenants in it . The others were scattered about with friends and others who volunteered to give them aid . Meanwhile organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the village , headed by S. W. Flint . John Amory , Richard O'Gorman , and the Rev. Dr. Colic:en. was formed , and plenty of money was pledged to supply relief for all who need it As quickly possible those burned out will be provided with other living apartments , and they will be provided with such ether aid as they may require . Money will be given or loaned them , as they prefer , with which to buy furniture to replace that destroyed or ruined in the fire . The loss on the Kuhnas &; Quigley building and stock is placed at $a0,0 ( 0 by Mr. Kuhnas . This is the largest single loss , the other losses ranging from $10.000 down to a few dollars for those who lost only by water , or having their buildings scorched by the heat . In all the loss will amount to something between $70,000 and $80,000 . The , insurance , it was learned , will not cover the loss in the case of the grocers , the Casino . and the livery stables . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others partly burned . Kuhnas &; Quigley will rebuild as soon as possible and will erect a brick building . Thousands of persons from all parts of the county visited the scene of the fire during the day . The police force , under Chief of the Fire Department Bronson 's orders , and aided by several Deputy Sheriffs. established lines about the burned area . and outside of this the adjoining streets were jammed all afternoon and until dark . The firemen still have several streams on the ruins , which are smoking . It is believed the fire started in the icemaking plant in the Kuhnas &; Quigley building . This refrigerating and ice-mak- ? hg plant was run by a gasoline engine , and the fire under the boiler is said to have been the only one about the place .
