THE last three decades of the nineteenth century will be known as a period of extraordinary progress in American education . To the American college they have been a period of unsettlement , starting many problems , solving few , and completely transforming its environment ; so that the college will pass into the new century with many questions pressing upon it , so far - reaching and fundamental that the wisdom and experience of thirty years more will hardly suffice for their solution . The prevailing type of college instruction in this country is the one first established at Harvard , which leads the student to the bachelor 's degree by a more or less fixed course of study , occupying a definite period of time . The degree was originally attainable in three years , or even in two ; but as early as 1654 , owing to the inadequacy of the preparatory training of that day , the period was lengthened to four years . Yale passed through a similar experience , and the Harvard-Yale system was adopted by nearly all of the later colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college course , and today , after the lapse of two centuries , it still remains , ? one of the few things in American life that appear to be permanent . Under circumstances radically different from those under which it was established , against every assault and protest , the venerable institution still holds its ground , apparently impregnable . This permanence , however , is more in seeming than in reality . The assailants have made no breach in the walls , but they have entered in at the gates , and by various indirect means have worked their will . The college of to-day , with its outward form and framework little changed , is a , very different thing from the college of thirty years ago ; and this is true not only of the younger institutions , but of the oldest and the most conservative . The causes that have produced this change have worked upon the college in different ways , ? from below , from within , from above ; but they are all really one cause working through various channels . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elective system ; but the elective system is itself a result , or rather a method . The real cause , of which the elective system is merely the manifestation , is the enlargement of the range of education , due not so much to increase of knowledge , ? for not all new knowledge is straightway fit for educational purposes , ? but rather to the conversion of new fields of knowledge to the uses of education . This force has worked upon the college from below in the expansion and diversification of the preparatory course . Of the pupils of the academy and the high school a very small fraction go to college . The instruction in these institutions must of course be adapted to the needs of the great majority , who go from school directly into life ; and our secondary instruction has , in fact , been very much enlarged and improved in the interest of these pupils in the last thirty years . On the basis of this undisputed fact , it is claimed that the college ought to adapt its course to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any substantial subject learned in school should count toward admission to college , and the pupil should be free to choose at the end of his school course , instead of being required to choose at the beginning , whether he will go to college or not . The claim is a plausible one , and large 220 The American College in the Twentieth Century . concessions have already been made to it . How profoundly the college would he affected by granting the full measure of it needs no exposition . Within the college , the broadening of the educational horizon has necessarily developed the elective system , with its great advantages and its attendant dangers , the control of which presents one of the most difficult problems in college management to-day . Above the college , the development of our educational resources is most conspicuously manifest in the creation of the graduate school , which has come to round out our university system , providing for advanced students in letters and science the opportunities for which , thirty years ago , they had to go abroad . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the college by the gradual expansion of the body of instruction , until , like a protoplasmic cell , it separated naturally into two distinct organisms , or it has been grafted upon the college , with a separate management from the first . In the newer universities , the graduate department has sometimes taken precedence in the plans of the founders , but in only one instance , so far as I am aware , has undergraduate instruction been left out of the scheme entirely . In practically all our universities , then , the undergraduate and graduate departments exist together , as lower and upper divisions of the same scheme of instruction ; and whether the upper has been developed out of the lower or grafted upon it , or both came into being together , it is obvious that they are organically related , and must exert upon each other a powerful influence . It is obvious , also , that this influence will not be confined to the universities , but most extend to the independent colleges . But the graduate school , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of our educational system in its higher stages . The professional schools , one may almost say , have been made over in these thirty years . They not only provide more thorough and systematic instruction than formerly , but they have been broadened and liberalized in their methods , making room for a more scientific treatment of their several branches and for training in research . With this growth has come , necessarily , the requirement of more time . In law , where two years , or even eighteen months , once sufficed , three years are demanded now ; the medical schools have begun to require four years for their degree ; and the best equipped professional schools now provide such opportunities for extended study that their students may stay on with profit a year or two after graduation . Moreover , the professional schools have not failed to see that , for the better quality of work they now exact , a broad general training is necessary , and some of them already demand a college education as a requirement for admission . Thus , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college alone , but below it and above it , we see the sane forces at work , ? everywhere enlargement , expansion , vigorous growth . Under the operation of these forces , what is to become of the college ? Can it maintain its place ? Ought it to be maintained ? Why should we support , at great expense , this intermediate institution ? Why transplant our educational shoots twice ? What function does the college serve that could not be performed by the secondary school or by the graduate school ? Why not partition the province of the college between these two , and divert its resources into other channels ? This will seem to some an academic question in more senses than one , ? a question of no practical import . The college is firmly established in our national life . It is deeply rooted in the affections of thousands of graduates ; it administers the bounty of hundreds of benefactors ; for better or for worse , it // is here to stay . Yet there is no reason to believe that the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can prosper , or even long epdure , which does not serve some useful purpose to the community . Libraries , museums , wealth of endowment , noble traditions , ? not these , but the vigorous stream of intellectual life to which they minister makes the college . If new conditions arise , ? as they have now arisen , ? and the college fail to adjust itself to them ; or if , in its eagerness to meet new demands , it prove false to its own ideals ; if it really has nothing to offer the student that he can not get as well or better elsewhere , then the stream of intellectual life will pass it by , and we shall have put our trust vainly in endowments and traditions . But if the college has a pro . vince all its own , with natural boundaries on this side and on that , then it is of the highest importance to know clearly what this province is , and to recognize and define its boundaries . What , then , is needed , to adjust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twofold , involving , as it does , both the quantity and the quality of the college training . It touches , first , the length of the college course , and the adjustment of its boundaries to the new conditions . From the professional faculties comes an earnest protest against the maintenance of the old four years ' course . They point out that this course was established at a time when there was not only no graduate school , but no professional school ; when the boy went to college at fourteen , and , coming home at eighteen , could easily accomplish his reading for a profession by the time he was twenty-one . Now the youth enters college at the age at which he formerly graduated , and completes his professional training at twenty-six or twenty-seven . " Life is not long enough to justify such an expenditure of time ; the world is not rich enough to pay what it costs . We may even say that the worldis too wise not to know that , after a certain point has been attained , its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from books and lectures . " ' How shall the college answer this plea ? Thirty years ago it could have given a good and sufficient answer . The college and the professional course were in no way coordinated ; the professional faculties had no thought of demanding of their candidates a college training ; their catalogues showed but a thin sprinkling of college degrees . Moreover , the college was the advance guard in the forces of liberal culture . It could not have fallen back , had it been asked to do so , without abandoning what had been gained . Li fact , it was just because there was nothing beyond in its own field that it pushed forward , carried its students farther and farther , until it raised the age of graduation to the point now complained of . Can the college make an equally good I answer now ? I do not see how it can . The establishment of the graduate school has relieved it from guard duty as the advance post of liberal studies : there can at least be no danger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it would never have advanced under the circumstances which now exist . To the complaint of the professional schools there is really no answer , if we agree with them , as we assuredly do , that the professional man should have had a college training . The college , in fact , concedes the justice of the claim by yielding to it in various indirect ways . It permits the student , for example , to do the work of four years in three , and then , as a senior on leave of absence , to register in the professional school ; or it provides within its own course instruction by which students may anticipate a part of their professional work ; or it 222 The American College in the Twentieth Century . allows the first year of a professional course to be counted as the fourth year for the bachelor 's degree . These shifts were perhaps expedient when there was no graduate school . I can not think they are wise or necessary now . They involve various disadvan ? tages and injustices . They encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of a particular professional school ; or , worst of all , they inculcate confused ideas of ' the aim of a college education . It would be far better to admit frankly the claim which these devices virtually concede , and let the student go with his degree to the professional school at the end of three years . It is vastly more important to preserve the quality of the college course than to maintain its form and dimensions . Would any other student suffer by the change ? For the student who passes from the college to the graduate school , it might seem to be a matter of indifference where the line between the two institutions is drawn . But it is not a matter of indifference . Although the studies of the graduate school may be in the same fields that are open to the undergraduate , the attitude of the graduate student is entirely different . It does not differ essentially from that of the professional student . Both have left the pursuit of general culture for a special object , ? the mastery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the other , it is important that his studies in his special field should be pursued on a systematic plan , for which adequate time should be provided , ? in the ease of the larger fields of study , at least , not less than three or four years . If we should be asked when the student is , or ought to be , ready to enter on this special work , would any one hesitate to set the age as early as twenty or twenty-one , and the stage of proficiency at the beginning of his senior year ? In any college where such freedom of choice exists as to enable him to do so , it is at that point , if not earlier , that he will begin to specialize , wherever we may draw our line between the college and the graduate school ; and it will be much better to draw it where it will bring our organization into conformity with the fact . It will be much better for the student to form and enter upon his plan of special study under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supervision of graduate work . His case in this respect is precisely the same as that of the student of theology , or law , or medicine : so soon as he becomes a specialist , he should put himself under the guidance of those who have charge of the training in his specialty ; when he has become a graduate student in all but name , the name should not be withheld . There is in his case , indeed , a . stronger reason than in that of the professional student for not permitting him to lurk under the name of undergraduate in any college , at least where the studies are largely elective . His presence there constitutes a danger : not only does it tend , like the presence of the professional student , to obscure the essential aim of the college and to infuse a professional spirit into its work ; it tempts him , to his own hurt , into premature specialization . If we set a reasonable limit to the pursuit of general culture , and lay out from that point Plans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit will be respected . If we continue to draw an impracticable line , we draw in effect no fine at all ; and the student , under the promptings of his own half-formed and uninformed taste and the unwise zeal of teachers , will be led to specialize too early . For the protection of the college course , for the protection of the student against himself , we should place the beginning of the graduate school at the point where reason and experience show it ought to be . There is still a third class of students // to be considered , perhaps a majority of the whole number , ? those who go neither to the professional school nor to the graduate school , but pass directly from the college into active life . Shall we dismiss these too at the end of three years ? Certainly not . Shall we let them go at the end of three years ? To this question the answer should , in my judgment , be , Yes . For it is to be observed , in the first place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now , as it might have been perhaps thirty years ago , a question of turning the student away at the end of three years , with no place to go to for further study , ? as he actually was turned away , in those days , at the end of four years . If there was danger of any such result then , there is surely go such danger now . The growth of the graduate school has familiarized every college student with the fact that the bachelor 's degree is really , as it is called , only the first degree in arts , and not , as we used to regard it , the crown of a liberal education ; and if he desires to carry his studies beyond that point , even with no thought of devoting his life to any particular field of learning , the way stands open for him . And this would be true , should the three years ' course be adopted , % .... not only of the universities , with their fully organized graduate schools , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are perhaps the most important factor in this problem . It would not be difficult for at least the best of these to provide instruction for a year or two beyond a three years ' baccalaureate course ; and there is ground for confidence that the number of those who took such an extended course would he considerable . The broken tradition itself would remain as a strong influence in this direction , and would survive long enough at least to give the new system a fair start . But many students , perhaps a majority , and perhaps a growing majority , would go away at the end of three years , not to a professional school nor to a graduate school , but directly into life . What of these ? Would they gain , would the community gain , by this earlier entrance on their individual callings more than would be lost by it ? It must not be forgotten , in the first place , that these men also would have P an apprenticeship of some years to serve in business , or a technical training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin ; and in the second place , under the elastic system which has been suggested , the question of going or staying would be left in each case to time judgment of the persons most intimately concerned . Such a plan might be expected to yield better results than any rigid time requirement . Those for whom the longer course was more desirable ? that is , those who had such interest in their studies as to wish to pursue them further ? would be likely to stay ; those whose interest was feeble had better go . No doubt errors of judgment would occur ; no doubt lack of means would cut off the college careers of some ; but , on the other hand , there are now , as everybody familiar wills the inner life of a college knows , a great many students who would be much better off if they could be turned away at the end of three years , or , still better , if they came to college wills only a three years ' course in view . This class is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle and dissolute , but many a good and manly fellow who means to profit by his college life , and lapses into the habit of frittering away his time simply because he has so much of it . These students are not only numerous , but they are influential ; their attitude powerfully affects the prevailing tone of college life . For them , and for those whom they influence , ? and these make up the largest part of the class we are now considering , the men who go from college into active life , ? the reduction of the course would deleted material // equal recognition and rights for its course of " modern " and " useful " studies alongside of the old college course . The battle that ensued we need not fight over again . We can neither wholly blame the invaders , nor wholly vindicate the defenders , of the ancient citadel . But we can not overlook the consequences of the invasion , which have been in one way , at least , deplorable . The visible traces of the struggle are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? now fortunately diminishing in number , ? bachelors of arts , of letters , of philosophy , of literature , of science , of what not , which decorate our college graduates , standing ostensibly for so many supposed varieties of liberal culture , and giving currency and countenance to false and pernicious views of what liberal culture is ; for an education which aims to equip men for particular callings , or to give them a special training for entering upon those callings , however useful it may be , is not the liberal education which should be the single aim of the college . It should be the aim of the secondary school , too , ? if not for all pupils , certainly for those who are going to college . For those who turn away , at the end of the school course , to train themselves for some technical pursuit , let appropriate technical schools be provided , and let them be held in all honor . But they should not masquerade as institutions for liberal education . Above all , they should not invade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning it into a place where there are " a number of unconnected and independent educations going on at the same time , " instead of a place where , though there are many paths , they all lead to a single goal . For the essence of a liberal education lies in the aim , not in the studies pursued , ? not in letters , not in science . These are the materials with which it works ; and it employs them , not to make professional or technical experts , but to make men and women of broader views , of greater intellectual power , ? better equipped for whatever profession or employment they may undertake , and for their equally important function of citizen and neighbor . For the fulfillment of this aim , the college must be a place of freedom with responsibility , and that is why the school can not do the work of the college . The school has to do with boys and girls , and must deal with them as with pupils who need constant guidance and oversight ; the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and for their training freedom is as necessary as air for the young bird or water for the swimmer . The life-preserver stage of training is past ; the time has come to " swim without cork . " Manhood , character , independence , moral courage , can not be developed without the element of danger , and the college , which should be the best place for their development , can make itself so , not by shutting out the danger , but by providing the strongest influences to counteract it . The necessary safeguards are not to be found in detailed rules of conduct and petty prohibitions , with their petty penalties , serving as so many temptations to mischievous spirits . Regulations there must be , of course ; but these should be confined to such as are fundamental , essential to the aims of the college , positive . They should be requirements to do , and not injunctions to forbear . The college commandment should read , " Thou shalt , " and as little as possible , " Thou shalt not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide , the only real penalty appropriate to the college life is the timely removal of those who show that they can not profit by its freedom . The college is not for all ; least of all is it for the morally unfit . The first exhilaration of breathing its free air is a searching test of character . To some it brings the inspiration of high opportunity ; to some it is sine-ply the joy of unrestraint , with no in- 226 The American College in the Twentieth Century . centive to either good or evil ; to some it is intoxication . To most the reaction comes sooner or later , and they settle down , or spur themselves on to the wholesome pursuit of the legitimate work and play of college life . But there will always be a residuum of those who can not be reclaimed , who can neither control themselves nor be controlled by the influences about them . The best thing that can happen to these is to have their hopeless unfitness found out in time , and to be quietly but firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions are suited to their needs and may yet make men of them . The influences which the college brings to bear on its students , which make its atmosphere and control its life , are manifold , and not to be enumerated or described in a paragraph . But whatever form they take , whether they work through concrete regulations or unformutated tradition , they all , in the last analysis , emanate from one source , ? the characters and aims and example of the men who have made and make the college community . The college is a little world , and the most potent influence in its government is its own unwritten code of is/orals and of honor , the composite product of its own life ; not perfect , by any means , but in the main sound , adapted to youth , making for good . What is called student sentiment is a thing not only to be reckoned with , but to be trusted and cultivated as perhaps the most useful factor in college government . How greatly it can be improved under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years has abundantly shown . This policy brings no release from labor and vigilance to those charged with its management ; but the labor it entails is not that of a barren and never ending contest with indolence and love of mischief , nor that of forcing the full and rich life of youth into the mould of a formal system , but the more fruitful work of enlightening and developing thatlife , of giving play to its best impulses , of training it to independent action under a sense of responsibility . Freedom in the choice of studies , equally with freedom of conduct , is an essential element of the college scheme in its best development ; and here again , not unrestrained , undirected freedom , but freedom guided by all possible advice and information , and never permitted to range so far as to lose sight for a moment of the aim of the college life , which is liberal culture , and not the ad-vancement of learning nor the snaking of learned mess . These are the business of the graduate school , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college . Hence the unrestricted Lelafreikeit and Lernfreikeit of the German university have no place in the American college . Nor can the so-called equality of studies , which is sometimes appealed to in discussions of the elective system , be recognized there . Studies in a university may be called equal in the same sense in which we speak of the equality of men . We never mean by this that all men are equally good for every purpose . We mean only that all are entitled to the enjoyment of equal op-portunities . And this is all that can be claimed for studies . In the university , in the graduate and professional schools , all branches of learning , so far as circum-stances permit , should enjoy equal oppor-tunity ; but in the college , where a study is pursued , not for its own honor or ad-vancement , nor yet for the making of learned specialists , but for the intellectual cultivation and equipment of the student , its recognition and the extent to which it may be pursued must both be deter-mined solely by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can-not be infringed or called in question ; the essential aim of the college can not be sacrificed or its efficiency impaired in the interest of any study . When the principle , however , has been fully ap-plied , the material which all must recog- deleted material 228 The American College in the Twentieth Century . high school , if possible ; in schools designed especially for the purpose , if necessary ; preferably in both . The two courses must be maintained in some shape side by side , and the interests of neither class of pupils sacrificed to those of the other . Under this arrangement , some will suffer from their remoteness from suitable schools , or from tardiness in deciding to go to college ; but no system can be devised that will inset all cases . The school course and the college course , then , should be planned as two stages of the same training , with the same end in view , which is liberal culture ; and the choice of studies which may be offered to the student in either stage must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of the permissible range of choice has naturally raised the inquiry , What studies are necessary ? and much good ink has been shed over this question . So far as it relates to a liberal education it is an idle question . Not one of the studies appropriate to the preparatory school or to the college is necessary to everybody . In the technical or the professional education certain studies are indispensable elements of the student 's equipment . In the pursuit of liberal culture there is no such constraining necessity . Liberal culture is a thing of many degrees , of varying quality ; and it is not a goal , but a progress which may be indefinitely continued . For the college , which is the highest stage of this progress available for most educated men , the question must be , What , with its resources and in the time at its disposal , is the highest degree and the best quality of culture it can impart ? Not , What is necessary ? but , What is best ? is the fruitful question . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , best secure the aim of the college for the greatest number ? What plan or plans of study in the preparatory school will furnish the best foundation for the superstructure of the college training ? On the question of what are the best ingredients of a liberal training opinions differ , and will no doubt continue to do so , though they differ less than appears on the surface . The problem that most divides enlightened educational opinion in our time is not , What is intrinsically best ? but rather , How far shall what is recognized as best be insisted on ? How far can the college safely go , in admitting to its instruction and its degree those who , from necessity or choice , content themselves with something short of the best ? This question would present no serious difficulty if every student were an isolated unit , coming and going , and taking whatever he was capable of grasping . But students have to be taught in classes , and the presence in a class of an inferior quality of student inevitably lowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence in the college community , and as members of it , of a body of students intellectually inferior lowers the whole tone of the college . The question , then , of the quality of the training that it is expedient to require is most important ; but it is quite distinct from the question , What is best ? Take for illustration the matter which has been the most vigorously fought over in the last thirty years , the question whether the classics shall be required as the foundation of a college education . There are here two questions , ? the question of excellence and the question of expediency . Those disputants in the high debate we have witnessed , who have failed to recognize that these are the problems , and that they are distinct , have only darkened counsel with their own confusion of ideas , and have beaten the air with vain arguments to prove that the study of Greek is unnecessary . The high value of Latin for linguistic training and mental discipline they recognize ; but what need , they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The subject would deleted material 230 The American College in the Twentieth Century . The question of expediency has proved a troublesome one to this generation . We have wrestled with it many years and have tried many experiments , and we are not yet of one mind . The only thing certain is that the experiment is to go on . Whatever we may think about it , ? whether we see in the dislodgment of the classics from their traditional place a sure deterioration of the college education , or agree with those who wish " to broaden the foundations of liberal culture , " ? the experiment is to go on ; and it is to be tried on a larger scale and in a more radical way . The men of the twentieth century will at least have a larger fund of experience than we have . Let us hope they may be given wisdom to draw the right lessons from it , and that its teachings may be clear and conclusive . In discussing what seem to me the most important questions of college policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly of colleges for men , not from any desire to ignore the college education of women , but partly for convenience of expression ; chiefly , however , because the ' problems dealt with have been worked over and fought over in the colleges for men , and the promoters of the higher education of women have thus far contented themselves with demanding for women access to the best education provided for men . The movement for the higher education of women in this half century has taken the form of a struggle for rights . That battle has now been fought and won ; the barriers of prejudice have been beaten down ; the way to the highest intellectual privileges stands open to women , in theory , at least ; and if practice lags behind anywhere , it shields itself under a plea of circumstance , and no longer takes its stand on a denial of rights . The victory is won . And now comes the question how to use the victory , ? the question , lost sight of apparently in the heat of the struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far as this relates to the university , ? the graduate and professional schools , ? the problem is not a very difficult one , and is in a fair way to solution . In most subjects , at least , the training of learned specialists presents no separate problems for men and for women , and men and women already sit side by side in the lecture rooms of our most conservative universities . With the college the case is different . If the proper aim of the college has been correctly defined , and if liberal culture for men means the cultivation of an all - round , strong , disciplined , intellectually efficient manhood , then the college for women must have for its aim an all-round , symmetrical womanhood . Its business is not with the intellect alone ; it must concern itself as well with the moral qualities that constitute the strength and grace of the womanly character . What scheme of college training will best secure this aim ? Here is a field of inquiry and experiment on which we may be said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what type of college for women will provide the best conditions for working out such a scheme ? Of colleges exclusively for women we already have two types , corresponding to the two types of colleges exclusively for men : the independent college , like Vassar and Smith , and the college attached to a university , like Radcliffe and Barnard . Some people have looked on this second type as merely temporary , as a steppingstone to the admission of women to the university college for men . But this is a hasty inference . Such a college will inevitably develop its own college life and traditions , its own body of graduates , and other elements of permanence . At present , certainly , we must range it alongside of the independent college for women and of all colleges exclusively for men , over against the coeducational type of college , which has been generally adopted in the West . Journalism as a B Here is another great question , which we shall be better able to answer when we know better what the college can do for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined for the higher // positions of social life , who constitute as yet too small a proportion of our college students . Here again the experiment is to go on , and the twentieth century must find the solution of the problem .
