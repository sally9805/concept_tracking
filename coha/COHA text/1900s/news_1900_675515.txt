txt There are many things in the exposition that are better calculated- than the exhibition of the City of Paris " to take the eye of a vulgar crowd , " in Rufus Choate 's famous . phrase ' about the second-hand harness . But there is not one that is more instructive to- those who are interested in the problems of which the Parisian solution is here shown . To the inhabitants of an American city , and to the New Yorker in particular , the instruction must be mingled with a good deal of wholesome but bitter mortification . He can not help thinking what a figure his own municipality would cut if it were shown in competition not only with Paris , but with any one of the provinpial capitals of France . In Rouen , in Caen , in Tours , and in smaller towns than these , it - is as plain that the French have managed to get and keep the best brains and training available for . their edilities as it is that no American city has succeeded in doing so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individualism in provinces that are distinctly the provinces of corporate arrangement and management somehow fails to console in presence of the overwhelming evidence that in these matters the French are immeasurably more civilized than we are . Of course the City of Paris itself is its own permanent exposition . It so imposes itself as the object lesson for all Europe as well as for all America in the art of citymaking that the younger generation of our architects have succeeded in persuading themselves , and are trying . ' to persuade others , that the way to have well-ordered municipalities is to imitate the passing and questionable fashion of French architecture , the " neo-grec rococo , " which is questionable in France itself , and which is much more than questionable in its imported ' manifestations . ( In the United States naval exhibit there is shown a design for the new buildings of the Naval Academy at Annapolis which makes the observer think he has strayed into the French section by mistake . ) But the real lesson of Paris is not this . It is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get and keep the men who know best how to make it , and to subordinate individual freaks and advertising ambitions to the purpose of avoiding a " mean ' city . " I have Spoken already of the immeasurable inferiority of the means of public conveyance in Paris to those of New York , or of any other American city . It is , so far as one can see by taking careful notice , our one point of municipz.1 superiority against the thousand points of municipal inferiority which force themselves upon the attention of the visiting New Yorker , and fill him with wholesome shame . After seeing Paris , one is the more anxious to see the municipal exhibition , for the same reason that one is anxious , after having gone through a complicated building , to see and study the plan of it . And , of course , there are many here of the things that Paris does not show at all , the whole subterranean and circulatory systems , for example , of sewerage and water supply and the like , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part meets the eye . How much importance Paris attaches to the fact of such a representation may be judged from her having put up a building some 300 feet long and perhaps a third as wide in order to aeeemmodate her showing . The invaluable " Guide Hachette " states that this edifice recalls the Hotel de'Ville , which , inasmuch as it has a projecting centre flanked with hooded pavilions , though without the crowning lantern , it may do . To me it seems rather to illustrate the almost invariable infelicity which attends the French architect when he essays the romantic architecture of which , nevertheless , his country contains the most memorable examples . One can see that the elevation of the building on the Seine may have looked very well on paper . In execution it is so painfully . thin and shallow as to have the air of a pasteboard screen rather than of a built wall . If architecturally the building is unworthy of its contents , it has to be owned that these are arranged and presented in perfection , with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities , and makes any French presentation an " exposition. ! ' Tableaus and manikins are introduced whenever they are needed to make a " demonstration , " and the method of graphical presentation of statistics is employed whenever it is useful or even possible . In this manner are shown , in a series of separate and succeeding departments , the whole economy of the City of Paris , excepting , apparently , the depart- ; ment of the fine arts , of the union of sculpture and architecture and gardening which may be studied to ... so much better advantage out of doors . Here is shown the work of what in our classification would be the Departments of Police , of Health , of Charities and Corrections , and of Public Works . And every one of them is so arranged and presented , by whatever method will present it most vividly , that one tan imagine , a student going through the exhibition relating to his own specialty without having occasion to ask a single question , or feeling the need ' of any information additional to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to specialists that the exhibition mainly appeals . The generalist observes only how admirably it is made , and of what enormous interest and importance it must be to those who are technically engaged upon the problems of which there is here shown the Parisian solution , which is to say the solution most likely in all the world to be accurate and complete when the question is of citymaking . Doubtless the experts of European cities are diligently studying it . But only fancy coming upon Mr. Holahan , or Mr. Dalton , or even the gentleman to whom Mr. Dalton " pays $7,000 a year , " or Col. Murphy , immersed in the study of his own business as it is expounded where it is most successfully practiced ! Cease , Hope , cease that flattering tale . In that happy and distant day , when we have " downed Tammany " for good , and got the benefit of what intelligence ? we have that applies-to municipal government , as Paris now has of hers , when a Waring shall be no longer a shining exception to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our heads over departments may be found poring over the showing of how they order these matters better in France . But then we , too , shall be busy in making a city .
