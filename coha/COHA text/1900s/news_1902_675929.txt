txt District Attorney 1 Jerome 's address at the Reform Club on the subject of excise was read with great interest by members of the Legislature to1 ' day . When Senator John Raines , the author of the Raines law , was asked what he i had to say in reply to Mr. Jerome , he answered that he had nothing to add to the interview which he gave out a fortnight i ago , which , he thought , covered the sah- ? / ject completely . 1 The general opinion among the members t was that Justice Jerome had not helped the chances of excise legislation by his latest i utterance . His statement that he believed 1 a referendum would be voted down in New I York City was seized upon by the up-State I opponents of Sunday opening as proving the contention which they have made all ; along that the majority of the people of New York City were not with Justice Je : rome in his crusade for a more liberal ex ; cise law . Chairman of the State Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organ of the adI ministration. says this evening that Justice Jerome has destroyed his whole case by his confession that he seeks to force upon the people of New York City a law which the i majority of them do not want . The impression is growing here that the i Democrats will not be able to present a solid front on the question of excise , no ' matter what view the organization should t take upon any measure proposed . Senator Sullivan and some of the members of the : Assembly who live in the tenement dis tricts would welcome an opportunity to , vote for a Sunday opening bill , but many i other Democratic members say quietly that they do not see how they can bring them ; selves to support such a measure in view of the fact that the authorities of the Catholic Church are opposing it . t I ! j District Attorney Jerome yesterday denied emphatically that his speech Thursday night before the Reform Club was MI tended as a slap at the officials of the adI ministration elected on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome j i that some persons regarded the speech as placing the responsibility for the solution of the excise question on the Mayor and the Police Commissioner . The District Attorney said : " Unless we can have a new law , Tam1 many will succeed the present Government I two years from now . The legislators are i sworn to represent all the people , and not 1 ; their particular districts . There had al ; ways been a test relative to measures and a common practice to get good measures by potent influences , that is , to ' see ' somebody . 1 do not know that this will be nee- ' Iessary in this case . Among others I have talked to the brewers about this matter . and , though it will affect them financially , I I do not doubt their integrity . " If I live long enough , and I believe I will , the law will be changed . and for the fI betterment of the people . Personally , I can make my living as well under Tammany as under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fourteen years ' experience 1 with the excise question , and I honestly I and firmly believe the law must be changed . " In the event of the present law being I violated , I can do little . I have too much i regard for the oath of office to fail to do all I can to enforce the statutes . I am sup ! porting the administration loyally . I believe ' 1 ' it is composed of honest men pledged and in earnest in their efforts for good government . I do not want this administration supplanted by one like the last , and it will be if there is not a change in the excise law , a change that is reasonable and pracI ticable , and , most important , one that will I take the saloon out of politics . " Mayor Low declined to discuss the statements made by District Attorney Jerome in reference to the excise law and its en1 forcement in this city .
