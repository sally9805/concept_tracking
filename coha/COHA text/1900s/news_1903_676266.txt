txt Without doubt the bill introduced into the House of Representatives by Mr. GRIFFITH . M. C. from the Fourth District of Indiana , to restrict the wealth of citizens of this Republic , is calculated to promote the gayety of nations and increase the public stock of harmless pleasure . But that can scarcely have been Mr. GRIFFITH 'S idea . What his idea was remains a rational subject for conjecture . Apparently Mr. GRIFFITH has satisfied himself that he has succeeded in ascer , taining the emotions about wealth of his deestrick. ? ' It is Mr. GRIFFITH 'S psychologizing of the psychology of the Counties of Bartholomew , Brown , Dearborn . Decatur . Jackson , Jennings , Ohio , Ripley , and Switzerland , in the great pivotal Commonwealth at . Indiana , with which the investigator has to deal . The investigator may of course deny that Mr. GRIFFITH has psychologized his district with accuracy . But when a man bearing the historic praenomen of FRANCIS MAR-lox , and succeeding to the seat if not to the functions of W. S. HOLIAN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks that a measure to limit the individual acquisitions of an Ameri-i I can citizen to ten millions will strike an echoing chOrd in the bosom of the Fourth District of Indiana it does not behoove or become any inexpert who has never been elected to Congress from that district to quarrel with his diagnosis of his constituency . Apart from this diagnostic aspect of the matter , to inquire further into the ' great Griffith scheme for reducing envy by reducing the objects of it , would be , in the language cf the Arab sheikh 's famous rejoinder to the British investigator , " both difficult and useless . " It is , we suppose , unlikely that any one of Mr. GRIFFITH 's constituents in the Fourth District of Indiana can have accumulated even the modest competence of ten millions which the magnanimous GRIFFITH proposes to allow to a sufficiently enterprising and successful citi- zen . If there such GRIFFITH is not obliged to reckon . The general mass of Mr. GRIFFITH 'S constituents and the great majority of his supporters , finding the limit of wealth put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverted language of SHAKESPEARE which had been previously perverted : " Let the galled darned jade wince . Our withers are unwrung . " If Mr. GRIFFITH were a serious person , if his vision were not bounded by the level inclosing horizons of the Fourth m District of Indiana , and he might be supposed to have anything in view except his own conception of  --  the conception of the average Democratid - voter in his district , we might reason with Mr. GRIFFITH and institute a candid inquiry why he should have fixed the permissible limit of wealth at the figure of ten millions . It is of course conceivable that his notions have been expanded and aerated since he exchanged the frugal surroundings of his district for the luxurious atmosphere of the capital . Out in Indiana those constituents who agree with him that there are ' too rich men might be wondering at the extravagance of his permission of accumulation , and marveling why he did not put his limit at some such modest figure as thirteen thousand dollars , the while he himself , viewing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , as soon as you undertake to fix a limit , the absurdity of your contention of any limit at once appears . Because , as GRIFFITH himself , in his hours of ease and reason , when , he was not playing politics for the Fourth District of Indiana would probably admit , the accumulations of any American citizen , barring thieves and gamblers , are simply a commission on some public service which he has had the capacity and the opportunity to render . There are very few thieves and very few gamblers whose accumulations amount to ten millions  --  so few that , from the point of view of a legislator whose vision transcends the Fourth District of Indiana or any other district in which such an accumulation invites consideration and reflection , rather than mere blind brute envy , the exceptions are negligible . Otherwise , to tell a man whose commissions on his public service amount to more than ten millions that he can collect no more commissions is to tell him that the public is tired of the public service which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him not to render like pUblic service any more . Stated in these terms , which we believe to be the true terms of the actual proposition , the absurdity of Mr. GRIFFITH 'S prescription becomes apparent . The far better course is to do what has been done by the laws of England , and , in a less degree , by the laws of the State of New York . That is to say , the " State , " meaning the public , will not prevent the I rendering of public services to any extent . But when it comes to a question of the inheritors of the able man , in regard Co whom there is no presumption whatever that they are able or disposed to render the public services rendered by the deceased , then tax them toany extent which does not nullify its object . It does not much matter if you make some of them move to Neiv Jersey or Indiana or any other place in which the law has not yet caught up with them . But the very project of law proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRIFFITH shows that the question is not one that can advantageously ' be dealt with by the legislation of the Congress .
