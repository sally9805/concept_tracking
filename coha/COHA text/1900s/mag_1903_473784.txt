WHAT has the Pahanaa come for , how long is she going to stay , and what are in all those boxes ? " My hostess was peppered with questions by the group of curious Hopi Indians who had gathered to witness my arrival in their village after a two days ' drive across that Arizona wilderness of beauty known as the " Painted Desert . " What was in those boxes ? Ah , thereby hung the tale ! They held the cause and purpose of my visit to the Indian reservation ? a phonograph . Many have said truly that . the songs of the negro and the American Indian contain a wealth of musical material for the composer . But I sought the Indian songs solely that I might reverently record and preserve what I could of an art that is now fast passing away beneath the influence of the Moody and Sankey hymn tunes and patriotic songs taught the Indians in the government schools . Before coming West . I had the vague idea that all Indian music was a monotonous , barbaric chanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shared too the ignorance regarding the Indian that makes us class all tribes together as a race of savage people in the same primitive grade of development . Not until I saw with my own eyes the vast differences even in tribes who are close neighbors could T realize the absolute truth of the authoritative statement that there are as great differences between the tribes of North - American Indians as there are between Norwegians and Spaniards among Europeans . Certainly no people could be more unlike than the peace-loving Hopis and their warlike neighbors the Navajos . And yet their reservations lie side by side in the deserts and table-lands of northeastern Arizona . The Hopis are commonly known as " Moguls , " a word of their * The Hopi word for American . own language , signifying " dead . " It is thought that it was derisively applied to them by the Navajos , for they call themselves the Hopis , which means the " quiet " or " good people . " It was to escape the ravages of the ' Me and Apache that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky plateaus that rise 600 feet abrupt and sheer from the level sands . On inaccessible craggy heights they built their villages , seven in number , of which Oraibi is the largest and most characteristic . Every one has seen pictures of the Moqui villages . The square stone houses are built close together around open courts , in which are sunk the " kivas , " or underground council-charnhers , of the different clans . It is here that the sacred ceremonies and secret rites are performed , and here the Hopi men assemble to talk over grave matters or to indulge in friendly intercourse . The kiva of each elan is to its members what the club is to the white man . The scarcity of water can hardly he conceived by those who have not been there . Every drop used in Oraibi has to be brought for a distance of two miles , one-half of which is up the steep trail , and carried all that long way in heavy earthen jars on the backs of toiling women . And so the Hopi prays for rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the great need , the great want , the one cry . I had heard since I had come West much of these village - dwelling Indians , and T expected to see in them a higher grade of culture than that of the nomad Navajos or the Indians of southern Arizona . But I was not prepared to find a people with such definite art-forms , such elaborate and detailed ceremonials , such crystallized traditions , beliefs , and customs . Their music astounded me . I felt that I had come in search of gold and had found diamonds . The Hopis ' every act of life seems to be a ceremonial rite , containing a symbol , a poetic significance known only to those outsiders who have dwelt long in Hopi land and are deep-versed in Hopi lore . " We have songs for everything , " my little Hopi neighbor exclaimed , when I caught her singing as she combed her baby 's hair . " We have songs for dancing , songs for planting , songs for grinding the corn , for putting the babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She laughed as she continued the refrain which my visit had interrupted . These songs for different purposes are different in character . They are all definite in form , with forceful , graceful , or poetic words . The Kateina dunce songs consist of an introduction on vowel syllables , then the song itself , also interspersed with vowel refrains , and lastly a sort of coda , again on vowel syllables . And the Hopis sing . Theirs is no crooning over a camp-fire , no monotonous chanting , no nasal droning . The men have fine , clear voices , and the women sing softly with a " breathy " tone , the quality of which sounds often just a little sharp in pitch . The gentle lullabies , the pretty , graceful basket-songs of the women , and the melodies to which they grind their corn are as different from the rugged , rhythmic Katcina songs as are the cliffs of the mesa from the blossoms in the fields below , There are three great elements in music ? rhythm , melody , and harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its intensity and variety of syncopation , unlike anything I ever heard . And it must be heard to be realized , for to me the Hopi sense of rhythm seems far to surpass ours . In Japanese music also I had found a wonderful variety of rhythm . Here again the rhythmic forms seem more complex and interesting than ours . But the Japanese have no harmony , and their melodies are monotonous , so that they rely chiefly on their ever - changing rhythm for variety of musical effect . Not so the Hopi . Though he too lacks harmony , his melodies are rich and full of beauty . And so Japan , with its written language and advanced civilization , is still behind our American village Indian in the art of music . Indeed , it is a question whether in their free use of unusual intervals the Hopis do not surpass in melodic variety not only the Japanese , but the European as welt , Rhythm and melody are essential in any music , no matter how crude ; but harmony , being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . For this reason , though we may compare them , we can not place Japanese or Hopi music on the same plane with our own . Our system of polyphony and harmony , with its instrumentation , its combination of choral and instrumental effects , and its wealth of tone-color , is a world of which the Hopi , who sings always in unison , does not dream . He has but one really musical instrument , the flute , and marks the rhythm of his songs with the rattle , the drum , and the crude scraping of wooden sticks . Ruskin says that a people writes its character in its art , and I was interested to observe how Hopi music reflects Hopi life . The music of the European is the language of the soul . In it thoughts and feelings find expression transcending the power of words . But Hopi music is decorative rather than expressive . I use the word in the sense in which it is technically applied to drawing . Indeed , in his art generally the Hopi shows this characteristic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is speaking broadly , and my meaning is best illustrated in the form of Hopi art-work most familiar to . Americans pottery and basketry . In the designs on jug and woven Plaque there is no attempt . to produce an exact image of an object . The Hopis do not make a picture of cloud , water , bird , flower , or feather in the way that we would . They make a sign which stands for that thing . For instance , a wavy line , a symbol so common among Indians , is not intended to depict water ; it simply means water . If we laugh at this method of delineation , it is because we do not understand it . So , in Hopi poetry , a single word may stand for an idea that would take a sentence to express fully . Thus even those who speak the language may not understand the poetry , because they do not know the thought suggested by the word . In Hopi music there is no attempt to represent in sound the meaning- of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether in a given song the Hopi sing of rain or thunder , or whether he sing simple vowel refrains of " o-no , " " a-ha , " and the like , the listener would never know from the quality of the music that one part of the song had more significance than the other . In fact , a word is often drawn out in true decorative style over bar after bar of music . For instance , the word " Yoe , " meaning rain , may be prolonged as follows , Yo-o-o-o-o-ho-ho-e , thus forming a melodic phrase by itself . Such music is as unemotional as the conventionalized cloud forms and feather symbols on baskets and pottery . Yet , like all true art , the Hopi music reflects the people 's life . It is essential to all their ceremonials , sacred and other , and accompanies their every act . But of the music of emotion , of the longings of the spirit , of joy , grief , or love , the Hopi has no idea . This may be because be is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That intensity of mental and spiritual experience that makes the inner life , with its moral struggles , its emotions , and aspirations , is unknown to the IIopi . So no matter bow rich their music in form , rhythm , and melody , it will ever be barbaric in quality so long as it speaks not of the soul . Yet it was a revelation to me ; for our music , though it expresses much , has by no means exhausted all the forms of expression . T had not been in Oraibi twenty-four hours before my mental picture of the scope of music faded like desert mirage , revealing a new and far-off horizon stretching boundless as the desert itself ? a new world of art . My workshop , as I called it , was one of the " government houses " at . the foot of the mesa . The government builds the foundations , and furnishes materials for walls and roof , thus seeking to induce the Indians to leave their homes on the mesa for dwellings nearer the water-supply . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians collected daily with true Hopi curiosity to peek in at the windows , to stare at the " Pahana , " and to join in the fun and excitement of singing into the machine . Indeed , I had but to be seen issuing from the house where I lived , to be followed by a stream of Hopis ? women with babies on their backs , men on their way to the fields , children just off to school . The Indians opened my door and entered my little house as unceremoniously as they did each other 's . I always welcomed them , and offered them the customary empty boxes to sit on . There were never enough to go around , and half my visitors sat on the floor . But this was Hopi style ; boxes are an innovation of civilization . One morning , early , before any other Tndians had co-me , the door opened noiselessly , and a graceful Hopi youth entered the room , and stood with folded arms quietly watching me . It was Koianimptiwa , known to the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given to him at the government Indian school . He spoke English and wore American clothing , and was thus considered a " civilized " Indian . After watching me quietly a while , my visitor announced , simply , " I want to sing , " and pointed to the phonograph . " I am delighted , " I answered . " What will you sing ? " " I want to sing my song , " said he . " Your song ? " I asked . " Why , what do you mean ? " " My own song , " he answered . " I make a song ? yesterday ; nobody heard my song yet . I like to sing it in that " ? pointing again to the phonograph ? " before anybody hear it . " " Why , Koianimptiwa , " I exclaimed , thoroughly surprised and very much interested , " can you make songs ? can you make the words and the music too ? " " Yes , " he answered , with a quick smile , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katcina dance . " I gazed at Koianimptiwa and saw him in a new light . I had often watched him hauling wood , but now I wondered that I had never before thought of him as a poet . His slanting eyes had a dreamy charm , his face was thoughtful almost to gravity ; Ihe easy good nature and ready joke of the Hopi seemed foreign to him . His cheeks were hollow , his shoulders high , and his whole appearance delicate and spiritual . He was , as I said , dressed in American clothing , but for all that lie was a picturesque figure as he took his seat upon an upturned box before the phonograph . His thick hair was parted in the middle and hung on either side . It was not long enough to tie up behind in true Hopi fashion , for Koianimptiwa worked at road-making , and the government employs only those Indians who are willing to cut their hair . But he was still beautiful in spite of the government 's decree , for his black locks , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , hung below his ears in a glossy sweep , making an oval frame for his thin face . He was a study in black and white for an artist . His high , broad shoulders , Tithe frame , and slim , sinewy muscles were sharply outlined beneath a tight-fitting black jersey . He wore duck overalls and a broad black felt hat , which fastened under his chin with a cord . He resembled more a study by Velasquez than our common idea of an American Indian . His face had a particularly earnest look to - day . The singing of his new song was a matter of moment to him . I knew that , like all Katcina songs , the rhythm would be one of the distinguishing features , and I also knew that T never could catch it unless I could record in my phonograph the sound of the rattle which marks the rhythm . So before Koianimptiwa began I placed in his hand the eia , as they call it , and told him to shake it just as he would if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Koianimptiwa , and we both awaited with keen interest the result on the phonograph . It was a great success . Koianimptiwa flashed a smile as we listened , and I was delighted , for I had been struck with the beauty of the song , and felt that with its associations it would always be one of my most prized records . " Will you make that sing for the other Indians and not say nothing ? I like to hear if they like my song , " said the young poet . This was easily done . By noon the room was full of Hopis . I placed the song upon the machine . Koianimptiwa stood with impassive face . " Do you know that song ? " I asked of an old man who sat near me on the floor . " Can you tell me what it is ? " He thought a minute ; then said , " It is a Kateina song . " Yes , all Kateina songs have the same general character ? the genus is easily recognizable . " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there anybody here that knows it ? " The old man thought ; a look of embarrassment came over his face ; then he answered , truthfully , " It seems I do not know that song . " All the Indians became quite thoughtful . I could see that they were puzzled . " Do you like it ? " I asked . " Is it a good Katcina song ? " " It is a fine song , " the old man exclaimed . " Lolomai , pas lolomai ! " ( splendid , splendid ) , and the others echoed , " Lolomai ! " Koianimptiwa and I exchanged a glance of satisfaction ; then he stole from the room . What is a Katcina song ? This had been one of my first questions in regard to Hopi music . The Katcina is a mythical being , a semi-deity , a creature between the gods and man , who intercedes with the gods in man 's behalf . The Katcinas bring to the gods the Hopi 's prayers . They are strange beings with extraordinary heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all monstrous and all decorated with tufts of feathers . The Indians themselves impersonate Katcinas , and dance " Katcina dances " in supplication for rain . When the chief proclaims a dance he orders new songs to be made , choosing the composers from the village poets . A few days after making his song Koianimptiwa consented to give me the words thereof . Slowly he dictated , while I strove to record in written symbols the strange melody of the Hopi speech , for the language has the vowel music of the Samoan , and yet the soft guttural strength of the Greek . Koianimptiwa folded his arms and leaned upon the table with fixed , intent face . The most difficult part of his task was now before him , that of putting into the white man 's tongue his Hopi poem . " My song . " he began , " is about the butterflies flying over the corn-fields and over the beans . They are blue and they are yellow ; their faces are bright ; and I can not explain in English bow that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt , and there are many . But I can not say that just in English , either . The second part is about the bees . They are flying over the corn and over the beans and singing . And I must explain : it is not the big corn and the big beans ; my song is about the corn and beans when they are little . Then comes the thunder in the cloud , and that is hanging over the corn-field . Then comes the rain ; and I can not - tell you just how that is in English . It first comes afar off , a little bit ? drops , ? then lots of then the music , or how was it ? " I asked . The Indian looked puzzled , as though not understanding the question . Then he said , simply : " I do not make first words , then music . I make a song . My song has words and music . " " And did you make it all at once ? " I said , " or did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else , and then make a little more ? " He pointed to the east . " The yellow light , " he said ( for so the Hopis call the dawn ) , ? " the yellow light just coming when I start with my burro , and them falling very fast . That is what the song means , but I can not say it right . " He passed his hand over his forehead . " This is very hard for me , " he sighed ; then added , " That is the end ; that is all . " I was filled with the poetry of the song , and I looked at my Indian guest with something like awe . I longed to know how the creative impulse had stirred his poet fancy to activity . I longed to know the workings of the Indian mind when roused by the call of genius . " Will you tell me one thing more , Koianimptiwa ? " I said . " I would like to know just how you made your song . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time , or did it come to you suddenly when you were not thinking about it ? Tell me how it was ! " " It was like this , " he answered . " Yesterday I go all day with my burro to load wood , and while I load my wood I make my song . " " Did you make the words first and then I begin my song . The sun was there " ? he pointed slantingly above his head ? " when I had finished . " " You finished it , then , about two hours before midday ? " I asked . " Yes , " he answered , with a quick smile , " about two hours before midday . " He rose to go . " To-morrow I go to the kiva to teach the men my song . " He paused in The doorway , looking off to the sandy wastes , which his fancy had seen already in blossom , with blue butterflies flying over them and wild bees singing above them all day long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grave , dreamy face . Through the open door I saw a group of Hopis , who passed us with their burros to begin the steep ascent to the mesa top . They were returning from their fields , singing as they came . Had they , too , been making songs as they planted their corn ? The voices drifted faint and fainter down the trail ; the sun dipped low and lower ; the mountains were pink and lavender against the sky . Slowly came the stars . I wondered not that Koianimptiwa was a poet . " Koianimptiwa , will you teach me your song , just as you taught it to the men in the kivas ? " We were driving across the desert , for I had begun my homeward journey , and Koianimptiwa 's mules were to bring me to the camping-place where I should find friends and shelter . The sand stretched dazzlingly before us . It seemed to breathe and palpitate like a living thing as the hot air quivered over it in layers of light . Only the desert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the jolting , of the cart and the fresh young voice that rang out across the wastes . Again and again the Indian youth sang his song , and again and again I strove to imitate , but the subtle , shifting rhythm baled me , and T cried at last , " Ah , Koianimptiwa , I am stupid , and your song seems very difficult to me ! " " Yes , " he answered , gently , and with something of commiseration in his tone . " It is too hard for you . " " It is not easy for Pahanas to learn the Hopi songs , " I said ; " is it as difficult . for the Hopis to learn the American music in the schools ? Do the teachers have to sing the hymns and march tunes many times ? " " No , " my companion answered . " Some things we try to learn in the school are hard , like arithmetic , but the singing is all easy . " Indeed , I had myself noticed that not Hopis only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a. melody once or twice to know it perfectly . Never have I found such extraordinary musical aptitude . So quickly indeed do the Indians absorb our music that I fear the coming generation will never hear the song that drifted down the trail to me at evenfall , ? the poet will have vanished from the pueblo . Morning grew noon ? the sun burned , then the shadows lengthened , and still Koianimptiwa sang . He sang song after song , and again and again he sang his own . shaking an imaginary eia in the air , or marking the rhythm with a shrill cut of his long whip . It seemed as though the very spirit of the desert spoke through his voice . By evening I had learned the song . The sands had grown purple , and the sun had dropped below the mountains as we neared the camp . I took Koianimptiwa 's hand in parting . " I have learned your song , " I said , " and I am going to take it to my home in the East . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who live near the great , great water . I want them to know that the Indian songs are beautiful . They have never heard any Hopi music ; you have never seen the great waters near which my people live . The Pahanas will listen to your song , and it will be as new , as strange , as wonderful to them as the big salt ocean would be to you . And when they have listened and wondered , I will say to them : This is Koianimptiwa 's song . May it bring rain to his fields ! ' "
