She stayed there a week  --  a month  --  a year It was worse than creepy , creaky noises I ca n't play ... I 'm being good Murray had ... seen the vision , too Elizabeth Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowning as she wrote . " Dear John , " the letter began ,  --  " It 's all very well except one thing . I wonder you did n't think of that . I 'm thinking of it most of the time , and it takes away so much of the pleasure of the rose-garden and the raspberry-bushes ! Anne is in raptures over the raspberry-bushes . " Yes , the raspberries and the roses are all right . And I like the stone-wall with the woodbine over it . ( Good boy , you remembered that , did n't you ? ) And the apple-tree and the horse-chestnut and the elm  --  of course I like them . " The house is just big enough and just small enough , and there 's a trunk-closet , as I stipulated . And Anne 's room has a ' southern exposure '  --  Anne 's crazy spot is southern exposures . Mine 's it . Dear , dear , John , how could you forget it ! That everything else  --  closets and stone-walls and exposures  --  should be to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving out , before I move in . But I have n't told Anne . Anne is the kind of person not to tell , until the last moment . It saves one 's nerves  --  heigh-ho ! I thought I was coming here to get away from nerves ! I was so satisfied . I really meant to thank you , John , until I discovered  --  it . Oh yes , I know  --  Elizabeth is looking over your shoulder , and you two are saying something that is unfit for publication about old maids ! My children , then thank the Lord you are n't either of you old maids . Make the most of it . " Miss Salome let her pen slip to the bare floor and gazed before her wistfully . The room was in the dreary early stages of unpacking , but it was not of that Miss Salome was thinking . Her eyes were gazing out of the window at a thin gray trail of smoke against the blue ground of the sky . She could see the little house , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the clothes-line , and count easily enough the pairs of little stockings on it . She caught up the pen again fiercely . " There are eight , " she wrote . " Allowing two legs to a child , does n't that make four ? John Dearborn , you have bought me a house next door to four children ! I think I shall begin to put the books back to-night . As ill luck will have it , they are all unpacked . " I have said nothing to Anne ; Anne has said nothing to me . But we both know . She has counted the stockings too . We are both old maids . No , I have not seen them yet  --  anything but their stockings on the clothes-line . But the mother is not a washer-woman  --  there is no hope . I do n't know how I know she is n't a washer-woman , but I do . It is impressed upon me . So there are four children , to say nothing of the Lord knows how many babies still in socks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Salome had been abroad for many years . Stricken suddenly with homesickness , she and her ancient serving-woman , Anne , had fled across seas to their native land . Miss Salome had first commissioned John , long-suffering John ,  --  adviser , business-manager , brother ,  --  to find her a snug little home with specified adjuncts of trunk-closets , elm , apple , and horse-chestnut trees , woodbiney stone walls  --  and a " southern exposure " for Anne . John had done his best . But how could he have forgotten , and Elizabeth have forgotten , and Miss Salome herself have forgotten  --  it ? Every one knew Miss Salome 's distaste for little children . Anne 's too , though Anne was more taciturn than her mistress . " Hullo ! " Miss Salome started . In the doorway stood a very small person in blue jeans overalls . " Hullo ! I want your money or your life ! I 'm a ' wayman . " " A  --  what ? " Miss Salome managed to ejaculate . The Little Blue Overalls advanced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ;  --  you know what robbers are , do n't you ? I 'm one . You need n't call me a highwayman , I 'm so  --  so low . Just ' wayman ' ll do . Why , gracious ! you ai n't afraid , are you ? You need n't be ,  --  I wo n't hurt you ! " and a sweet-toned , delighted little laugh echoed through the bare room . " You need n't give me your money or your life . Never mind . I 'll ' scuse you . " Miss Salome uttered no word at all . Of course this boy belonged in a pair of those stockings over there . It was no more than was to be expected . " It 's me . I 'm not a ' wayman any more ,  --  just me . I heard you 'd come , so I thought I 'd come an ' see you . You glad ? Why do n't you ask me will I take a seat ? " " Will I  --  will you take a seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying a lesson . The Little Blue Overalls climbed into a chair . Illustration : Little Blue Overalls climbed into a chair " Looks pretty bad here , does n't it ? I guess you forgot to sweep , " he said , assuming social curves in his plump little body . He had the air of having come to stay . Miss Salome 's lips , under orders to tighten , found themselves unexpectedly relaxing into a smile . The Little Blue Overalls was amusing . " We 've got a sofy , an ' a rockin ' - chair . The sofy 's new , but Chessie 's broke a hole in it . " " Are there four of you ? " Miss Salome asked , abruptly . It was the Little Blue Overalls ' turn to start now . " Me ?  --  gracious ! four o ' me ? I guess you 're out o ' your head , are n't  --  Oh , you mean child'en ! Well , there 's five , ' thout countin ' the spandy new one  --  she 's too little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spandy new one ! Miss Salome 's gaze wandered from the piles of books on the floor to the empty packing-boxes , as if trying to find the shortest distance . " There are only four pairs on the line , " she murmured , weakly ,  --  " stockings , " she added . The Little Blue Overalls nodded comprehendingly . " I do n't wear ' em summers ,  --  I guess you did n't notice I was in my bare feet , did you ? Well , I am . It 's a savin ' . The rest are nothing but girls  --  I 'm all the boy we 've got . Boys are tough . But I do n't s'pose you ever was one , so you do n't know ? " There was an upward inflection to the voice of the Little Blue Overalls . An answer seemed expected . " No  --  no , I never was one , " Miss Salome said , hastily . She could hear Anne 's plodding steps in the hall . It would be embarrassing to have Anne come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more conversation on a surprising number of topics , the Little Blue Overalls climbed out of the chair . " I 've had a ' joyable time , an ' I 'll be pleased to come again , thank you , " he said , with cheerful politeness . " I 'm glad you 've come ,  --  I like you , but I hope you 'll sweep your floor . " He retreated a few steps , then faced about again and advanced into the enemy 's near neighborhood . He was holding out a very small , brown , unwashed hand . " I forgot ' bout shakin ' hands , " he smiled . " Le 's . I hope you like me , too , an ' I guess you do , do n't you ? Everybody does . Nobody ever did n't like me in my life , an ' I 'm seven . Good-bye . " Miss Salome heard him patter down the hall , and she half thought  --  she was not sure  --  that at the kitchen door he stopped . Half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose-garden . If there was something in his hands that he was eating , Miss Salome never asked Anne about it . It was not her way to ask Anne questions . It was not Anne 's way to ask her . The letter to John was finished , oddly enough , without further mention of  --  it . Miss Salome got the broom and swept the bare big room carefully . She hummed a little as she worked . Out in the kitchen Anne was humming too . " It is a pleasant little place , especially the stone-wall and the woodbine , " Miss Salome was thinking ; " I 'm glad I specified woodbine and stone-walls . John would never have thought . So many other things are pleasant , too ; but , dear , dear , it is very unfortunate about that one thing ! " Still Miss Salome hummed , and after tea she got Anne to help her move out the empty packing-boxes . The next day the Little Blue Overalls came again . This time he was a peddler , with horse-chestnut " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they were bargains . " You can truly eat the pies , " he remarked . " There 's a little sugar in ' em . I saved it off the top o ' her bun , " indicating Anne 's locality with a jerk of his little cropped head . So it was a fact , was it ? He had been eating something when he crossed the rose-garden ? Miss Salome wondered at Anne . The next day , and the next ,  --  every day the Little Blue Overalls came , always in a new character . Miss Salome found herself watching for him . She could catch the little blue glint of very small overalls as soon as they got to the far side of the rose-garden . But for Anne , at the end of the first week she would have gone out to meet him . Dear , dear , but for Miss Salome , Anne would have gone ! The Little Blue Overalls confided his troubles to Miss Salome . He told her how hard it was to be the only boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play girly plays , and how he had longed to find a congenial spirit . Mysteriously enough , he appeared confident that he had found the congenial spirit at last . Miss Salome 's petticoats seemed no obstacle . He showed her his pocketful of treasures . He taught her to whittle , and how to bear it when she " bleeded . " He taught her to whistle  --  very softly , on account of Anne . ( He taught Anne , too  --  softly , on account of Miss Salome . ) He let her make sails for his boats , and sew on his buttons ,  --  those that Anne did n't sew on . " Dear John , " wrote Miss Salome , " the raspberries are ripe . When you were a very small person  --  say seven  --  did you ever mash them between raspberry leaves , with ' sugar in , ' and call them pies ,  --  and eat them ? They are really palatable . Of course it is a little risky on account of possible bugs . I do n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did you ever play you were a highwayman , or an elephant , or anything of that sort ? Queer I ca n't remember . " Anne is delighted with her southern exposure , but she has never said so . That is why I know she is . I am delighted with the roses and the closets and the horse-chestnut  --  especially the horst-chestnut . That is where we play  --  I mean it is most pleasant there , hot afternoons . Did you use to dote on horse-chestnuts ? Queer boys should . But I rather like them myself , in a way ,  --  out of the way ! We have picked up a hundred and seventeen . " Miss Salome dropped into the plural number innocently , and Elizabeth laughed over John 's shoulder . Elizabeth did the reading between the lines . John was only a man . One day Little Blue Overalls was late . He came from the direction of the stable that adjoined Miss Salome 's house . He was excited and breathless . A fur rug was draped around his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried , eagerly . " It 's a circus ! I 'm the grizzled bear . There 's a four-legged girl  --  Chessie , you know , with stockin 's on her hands ,  --  and a Manx rooster ( ' thout any tail ) , and , oh , my ! the splendidest livin ' skeleton you ever saw ! I want you to be man'ger  --  come on ! It 's easy enough . You poke us with a stick , an ' we perform . I dance , an ' the four-legged girl walks , an ' the rooster crows , an ' the skeleton skel  --  Oh , well , you need n't poke the skeleton . " The Little Blue Overalls paused for breath . Miss Salome laid aside her work . Where was Anne ?  --  but the stable could be reached without passing the kitchen windows . Saturdays Anne was very busy , anyway . " I 'm ready , " laughed Miss Salome . She had never been a circus-manager , but she could learn . It was easier than whittling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door Miss Salome came to an abrupt stop . An astonished exclamation escaped her . The living skeleton sat on an empty barrel , lean and grave and patient . The living skeleton also uttered an exclamation . She and the circus-manager gazed at each other in a remarkable way , as if under a spell . " Come on ! " shouted the grizzled bear . After that , Miss Salome and Anne were not so reserved . What was the use ? And it was much easier , after all , to be found out . Things ran along smoothly and pleasantly after that . Late in the autumn , Elizabeth , looking over John 's shoulder one day , laughed , then cried out , sharply . " Oh ! " she said ; " oh , I am sorry ! " And John echoed her an instant later . " Dear John , " the letter said , " when you were little were you ever very sick , and did you die ? Oh , I see , but do n't laugh . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One is when one is anxious . And Little Blue Overalls is very sick . I found Anne crying a little while ago , and just now she came in and found me . She did n't mind ; I do n't . " He did not come yesterday or the day before . Yesterday I went to see why . Anne was just coming away from the door . ' He 's sick , ' she said , in her crisp , sharp way ,  --  you know it , John ,  --  but she was white in the face . The little mother came to the door . Queer I had never seen her before ,  --  Little Blue Overalls has her blue eyes . " There were two or three small persons clinging to her , and the very smallest one I ever saw was in her arms . She looked fright  --  " The letter broke off abruptly here . Another slip was enclosed that began as abruptly . " Anne says it is scarlet-fever . The doctor has been there just now . I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean the doctor . And you would not smile , either of you  --  not Elizabeth , anyway , for she will think of her own babies  --  " " Yes , yes , " Elizabeth cried , " I am thinking ! " "  --  That is why he must not stay over there . There are so many babies . I am going over there now . " The letter that followed this one was a week delayed . " Dear John , " it said ,  --  " you must be looking out for another place . If anything should  --  he is very sick , John ! And I could not stay here without him . Nor Anne . John , would you ever think that Anne was born a nurse ? Well , the Lord made her one . I have found it out . Not with a little dainty white cap on , and a nurse 's apron ,  --  not that kind , but with light , cool fingers and a great , tender heart . That is the Lord 's kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of our Little Blue Overalls . The little mother and I appreciate Anne . But he is very very sick , John . " I could not stay here . Why , there is n't a spot that would n't remind me ! There 's a faint little path worn in the grass beside the stone-wall where he has been ' sentry . ' There 's a bare spot under the horse-chestnut where he played blacksmith and ' shoe-ed ' the saw-horse . And he used to pounce out on me from behind the old elm and demand my money or my life ,  --  he was a highwayman the first time I saw him . I 've bought rose-pies and horse-chestnut apples of him on the front door-steps . We 've played circus in the barn . We 've been Indians and gypsies and Rough Riders all over the place . You must look round for another one , John . I ca n't stay here . " Here 's Anne . She says he is asleep now . Before he went he sent word to me that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a red cross and sew it on Anne 's sleeve . I must go and make it . Good-bye . The letter will not smell good because I shall fumigate it , on account of Elizabeth 's babies . You need not be afraid . " There was no letter at all the next week , early or late , and they were afraid Little Blue Overalls was dead . Elizabeth hugged her babies close and cried softly over their little , bright heads . Then shortly afterwards the telegram came , and she laughed  --  and cried  --  over that . It was as welcome as it was guiltless of punctuation : " Thank the Lord John Little Blue Overalls is going to get well . " Chapter II The Boy The trail of the Boy was always entirely distinct , but on this especial morning it lay over house , porch , barn  --  everything . The Mother followed it up , stooping to gather the miscellany of boyish belongings into her apron . She had a delightful scheme in her mind for clearing everything up . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to have any litter of whittlings , of strings and marbles and tops ! No litter of beloved birds ' eggs , snake-skins , turtle-shells ! No trail of the Boy anywhere . It had taken the whole family to get the Boy off , but now he was gone . Even yet the haze of dust the stage-coach had stirred up from the dry roadway lingered like a faint blur on the landscape . It could not be ten minutes since they had bidden the Boy his first good-bye . The Mother smiled softly . " But I did it ! " she murmured . " Of course ,  --  I had to . The idea of letting your Boy go off without kissing him good-bye ! Mary , " she suddenly spoke aloud , addressing the Patient Aunt , who was following the trail too , picking up the siftings from the other 's apron  --  " Mary , did you kiss him ? There was really no need , you know , because you are not his mother . And it would have saved his feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very young and pretty , and the " patient " in her name had to do only with her manner of bearing the Boy . " No , I did n't , " she said . " I did n't dare to , after I saw him wipe yours off ! " " Mary ! " " With the back of his hand . I am not near-sighted . Now why should a well-meaning little kiss distress a Boy like that ? That 's what I want to know . " " It did n't once , " sighed the Mother , gently . " Not when he was a baby . I 'm glad I got in a great many of them then , while I had a chance . It was the trousers that did it , Mary . From the minute he put on trousers he objected to being kissed . I put his kilts on again one day , and he let me kiss him . " " But it was a bribe to get you to take them off , " laughed the Patient Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . And you took them off to pay for that kiss . You ca n't deny it , Bess . " " Yes , I took them off  --  and after that I kissed them . It was next best . Mary , does it seem very awful quiet here to you ? " " Awful . I never heard anything like it in my life . I 'm going to let something drop and make a noise . " She dropped a tin trumpet , but it fell on the thick rug , and they scarcely heard it . The front gate clicked softly , and the Father came striding up the walk , whistling exaggeratedly . He had ridden down to the corner with the Boy . " Well , well , well , " he said ; " now I shall go to work . I 'm going up to my den , girls , and I do n't want to be called away for anything or anybody lower than a President or the minister . This is my first good chance to work for ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was rather young to go off alone on a journey , but a neighbor half a mile down the glary white road was going his way , and would take him in charge . The neighbor was lame , and the Boy thought he was going to take charge of the neighbor . It was as well . Nobody had undeceived him . In a little over half an hour  --  three-quarters at most  --  the trail of the Boy was wiped out . Then the Patient Aunt and the Mother sat down peacefully and undisturbed to their sewing . Everything was very spruce and cleared up . The Mother was thinking of that , and of how very , very still it was . She wished the Patient Aunt would begin to sing , or a door would slam somewhere . " Dear me ! " she thought , with a tremulous little smile , " here I am wanting to hear a door slam already ! Any one would n't think I 'd had a special set of door nerves for years ! " She started in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaked by the west window . Why did n't it creak now ? The Mother tried to make it . " Mary , " she cried , suddenly and sharply  --  " Mary ! " " Mercy ! Well , what is it , my dear ? Is the house afire , or anything ? " " Why do n't you talk , and not sit there as still as a post ? You have n't said a word for half an hour . " " Why , so I have n't ,  --  or you either , for that matter . I thought we were sitting here enjoying the calm . Does n't it look too lovely and fixed-up for anything , Bess ? Seems like Sunday . Do n't you wish somebody would call before we get stirred up again ? " " There 's time enough . We sha' n't get stirred up again for a week , " sighed the Mother . She seemed suddenly to remember , as a new thing , that weeks held seven days apiece ; days , twenty-four hours . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she remembered how the Boy said it . She saw him toeing the stripe in the carpet before her ; she heard his high sweet sing-song : " Sixty sec-unds make a min-it . Sixty min-its make a nour . Sixty hours make  --  no ; I mean twenty-four hours  --  make a d-a-a-y . " That was the way the Boy said it  --  God bless the Boy ! The Mother got up abruptly . " I think I will go up and call on William , " she said , unsteadily . The Patient Aunt nodded gravely . " But he does n't like to be interrupted , you know , " she reminded , thinking of the Boy 's interruptions . Up-stairs , the Father said " Come in , " with remarkable alacrity . He looked up from his manuscripts and welcomed her . The sheets , tossed untidily about the table were mostly blank ones . " Well , dear ? " the little Mother said , with a question in her voice . " Not at all ;  --  bad , " he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , Bess . At this rate , how soon will my new book be out ? It 's so confoundedly still  --  " " Yes , dear , I know , " the Mother said , hastily . Then they both gazed out of the window , and saw the Boy 's little , rough-coated , ugly dog moping under the Boy 's best-beloved tree . The Boy had pleaded hard to be allowed to take the dog on the journey . They both remembered that now . " He 's lonesome , " murmured the Mother , but she meant that they two were . And they had thought it would be such a rest and relief ! But then , you remember , the Boy had never been away before , and he was only ten . So one day and one more after it dragged by . Two from seven leaves five . The Mother secretly despaired . The second night , after the others were asleep , she stole around the house and strewed the Boy 's things about in all the rooms ; but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she let them lie , and , oddly enough , no one appeared to see them next morning . All the family made fine pretence of being cheerful , and spoke often of the quietude and peace  --  how restful it was ; how they had known beforehand that it would be so , without the whooping , whistling , tramping , slamming Boy . " So relieving to the nerves , " the Patient Aunt said . " So soothing , " murmured the Mother , sadly . " So confoundedly nice and still ! " the Father muttered in his beard . " Have n't had such a chance to work for ten years . " But he did not work . The third day he said he must take a little run to the city to  --  to see his publishers , you know . There were things that needed looking after ;  --  if the Mother would toss a few things into his grip , he 'd be off ;  --  back in a few days , of course . And so he went . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one when , on the fourth day , the Patient Aunt went away on a little visit to  --  to some friends . " I 'm glad they 're gone , " nodded the little Mother , decisively , " for I could n't have stood it another day  --  not another day ! Now I 'm going away myself . I suppose I should have gone anyway , but it 's much pleasanter not to have them know . They would both of them have laughed . What do they know about being a Mother and having your little Boy away ? Oh yes , they can laugh and be relieved  --  and rested  --  and soothed ! It 's mothers whose hearts break with lonesomeness  --  mothers and ugly little dogs . " She took the moping little beast up in her lap and stroked his rough coat . " You shall go too , " she whispered . " You ca n't wait three days more , either , can you ? It would have killed you , too , would n't it ? We are glad those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll go to the Boy . " Early the next morning they went . The Mother thought she had never been so happy before in her life , and the ugly little beast yelped with anticipative joy . In a little  --  a very little  --  while , now , they would hear the Boy shout  --  see him caper  --  feel his hard little palms on their faces . They would see the trail of the Boy over everything ; not a make-believe , made-up trail , but the real , littered , Boy thing . " I hope those other two people are enjoying their trips . We are , are n't we ? " cried the happy Mother , hugging the little ugly dog in her arms . " And they wo n't know ;  --  they ca n't laugh at us . We 'll never let them know we could n't bear it another minute , will we ? The Boy sha' n't tell on us . " The place where the Boy was visiting was quite a long way from the railroad station , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good way off they heard the Boy and came upon his trail . The little dog nearly went into fits with frantic joy at the cap he found in the path , but the Mother went straight on to meet the little shouting voice in her ears . Half-way to it she saw the Boy . But wait . Who was that with him ? And that other one , laughing in his beard ? If there had been time to be surprised  --  but she only brushed them both aside and caught up the Boy . The Boy  --  the Boy  --  the Boy again ! She kissed him all over his freckled , round little face . She kissed his hair and his hands and his knees . " Look out ; he 's wiping them off ! " laughed the Patient Aunt . " But you see he did n't wipe mine off . " " You did n't kiss me . You dars n't . You ai n't my mother , " panted the Boy , between the kisses . He could not keep up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I am , dear . I 'm your mother , " cooed the Mother , proud of herself . After a while she let him go because she pitied him . Then she stood up , stern and straight , and demanded things of these other two . " How came you here , Mary ? I thought you were going on a visit . Is this the way you see your publishers , William ? " " I  --  I could n't wait , " murmured the Impatient Aunt . " I wanted to hear him shout . You know how that is , Bess . " But there was no apology in the Father 's tone . He put out his hand and caught the Boy as he darted past , and squared him about , with his sturdy little front to his mother . The Father was smiling in a tender way . " He is my publisher , " he said . " I would rather he published my best works than any one else . He will pay the highest royalty . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed not the Boy alone , but them both . The next day they took the Boy back in triumph , the three of them and the little dog , and after that there was litter and noise and joy as of old . Chapter III The Adopted The Enemy 's chin just reached comfortably to the top fence-rail , and there it rested , while above it peered a pair of round blue eyes . It is not usual for an enemy 's eyes to be so round and blue , nor an enemy 's chin to reach so short a distance from the ground . " She 's watching me , " Margaret thought ; " she wants to see if I 've got far as she has . ' Fore I 'd lean my chin on folks 's gates and watch ' em ! " " She knows I 'm here , " reflected the Enemy , " just as well as anything . ' Fore I 'd peek at people out o ' the ends o ' my eyes ! " Illustration : ' Fore I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em ! Between the two , a little higher than their heads , tilted a motherly bird on a syringa twig . " Ter-wit , ter-wee ,  --  pit-ee , pit-ee ! " she twittered under her breath . And it did seem a pity to be quarrellers on a day in May , with the apple buds turning as pink as pink ! " I sha' n't ever tell her any more secrets , " Margaret mused , rather sadly , for there was that beautiful new one aching to be told . " I sha' n't ever skip with her again , " the Enemy 's musings ran drearily , and the arm she had always put round Margaret when they skipped felt lonesome and  --  and empty . And there was that lovely new level place to skip in ! " Pit-ee ! Pit-ee ! " sang softly the motherly bird . It had only been going on a week of seven days . It was exactly a week ago to-day it began , while they were making the birthday presents together , Margaret sitting in this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door-step . Who would have thought it was coming ? There was nothing to warn  --  no thunder in the sky , no little mother-bird on the syringa bush . It just came  --  oh , hum ! " I 'm ahead ! " the Enemy had suddenly announced , waving her book-mark . She had got to the " h " in her Mother , and Margaret was only finishing her capital " M. " They were both working " Honor thy Mother that thy days may be long , " on strips of cardboard for their mothers ' birthdays , which , oddly enough , came very close together . Of course that was n't exactly the way it was in the Bible , but they had agreed it was better to leave " thy Father " out because it was n't his birthday , and they had left out " the land which the Lord thy God giveth " because there was n't room for it on the cardboard . " I 'm ahead ! " " That 's because I 'm doing mine the carefulest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near so many hunchy places in mine . " " Well , I do n't care ; my mother 's the best-looking , if her book-mark is n't ! " in triumph . " Her hair curls , and she does n't have to wear glasses . " Margaret 's wrath had flamed up hotly . Mother 's eyes were so shiny and tender behind the glasses , and her smooth brown hair was so soft ! The love in Margaret 's soul arose and took up arms for Mother . " I love mine the best , so there !  --  so there !  --  so there ! " she cried . But side by side with the love in her soul was the secret consciousness of how very much the Enemy loved her mother , too . Now , sitting sewing all alone , with the Enemy on the other side of the fence , Margaret knew she had not spoken truly then , but the rankling taunt of the curls that Mother had n't , and the glasses that she had , justified her to herself . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  so there !  --  so there ! " She 's only got to the end o ' her ' days , '  --  I can see clear from here , " soliloquized the Enemy , with awakening exultation . For the Enemy 's " days " were " long , "  --  she had finished her book-mark . The longing to shout it out  --  " I 've got mine done ! "  --  was so intense within her that her chin lost its balance on the fence-rail and she jarred down heavily on her heels . So close related are mind and matter . Margaret resorted to philosophic contemplation to shut out the memory of the silent on-looker at the fence . She had swung about discourteously " back to " her . " I guess , " contemplated Margaret , " my days ' ll be long enough in the land ! I guess so , for I honor my mother enough to live forever ! That makes me think  --  I guess I better go in and kiss her good-night for to-night when she wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearly over . The long summer vacation stretched endlessly , lonesomely , ahead of Margaret . Last summer it had been so different . A summer vacation with a friend right close to you all the time , skipping with you and keeping house with you and telling all her secrets to you , is about as far away as  --  as China is from an Enemy ' cross the fence ! Oh , hum ! some vacations are so splendid and some are so un-splendid ! It did not seem possible that anything drearier than this could happen . Margaret would not have dreamed it possible . But a little way farther down Lonesome Road waited something a great deal worse . It was waiting for Margaret behind the schoolhouse stone-wall . The very next day it jumped out upon her . Usually at recess Nell  --  the Enemy  --  and Margaret had gone wandering away together with their arms around each other 's waist , as happy as anything . But for a week of recesses now they had gone wandering in opposite directions  --  the Enemy marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to the west . She had found a nice lonesome little place to huddle in , behind the wall , out of sight . It was just the place to be miserable in . " I know something ! " from one of a little group of gossipers on the outside of the wall . " She need n't stick her chin out an ' not come an ' play with us . She 's nothing but an adopted ! " " Oh !  --  a what ? " in awestruck chorus from the listeners . " Say it again , Rhody Sharp . " " An adopted  --  that 's all she is . I guess nobody but an adopted need to go trampin ' past when we invite her to play with us ! I guess we 're good as she is an ' better , too , so there ! " Margaret in her hidden nook heard with a cold terror creeping over her and settling around her heart . It was so close now that she breathed with difficulty . If  --  supposing they meant  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe a single word you say ! " sprang forth a champion valiantly . " She 's dreadfully fond of her mother  --  just dreadfully ! " " She does n't know it , " promptly returned Rhody Sharp , her voice stabbing poor Margaret 's ear like a sharp little sword . " They 're keeping it from her . My gran'mother does n't believe they 'd ought to . She says  --  " But nobody cared what Rhody Sharp 's gran'mother said . A clatter of shocked little voices burst forth into excited , pitying discussion of the unfortunate who was nothing but an adopted . One of their own number ! One they spelled with and multiplied with and said the capitals with every day ! That they had invited to come and play with them  --  an ' she 'd stuck her chin out ! " Why ! Why , then she 's a  --  orphan ! " one voice exclaimed . " Really an ' honest she is  --  an ' she does n't know it ! " " Oh my , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she 'd hide her head  --  I mean , if she knew ? " It was already hidden . Deep down in the sweet , moist grass  --  a little heavy , uncrowned , terror-smitten head . The cruel voices kept on . " It 's just like a disgrace , is n't it ? Should n't you s'pose it would feel that way if ' t was you ? " " Think o ' kissin ' your mother good-night an ' it 's not bein ' your mother ? " " Say , Rhody Sharp  --  all o ' you  --  look here ! Do you suppose that 's why her mother  --  I mean she that is n't  --  dresses her in checked aperns ? That 's what orphans  --  " The shorn head dug deeper . A soft groan escaped Margaret 's lips . This very minute , now while she crouched in the grass ,  --  oh , if she put out her hands and felt she would feel the checks ! She had been to an orph  --  to a place once with Moth  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  all checked . At home , folded in a beautiful pile , there were all the others . There was the pink-checked one and the brown-checked one and the prettiest one of all , the one with teenty little white checks marked off with buff . The one she should feel if she put out her hand was a blue-checked . Margaret drove her hands deep into the matted grass ; she would not put them out . It was  --  it was terrible ! Now she understood it all . She remembered  --  things . They crowded  --  with capital T 's , Things ,  --  up to her and pointed their fingers at her , and smiled dreadful smiles at her , and whispered to one another about her . They sat down on her and jounced up and down , till she gasped for breath . The teacher 's bell rang crisply and the voices changed to scampering feet . But Margaret crouched on in the sweet , moist grass behind the wall . She stayed there a week  --  a month  --  a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her bones and she crept away home ? Illustration : She stayed there a week  --  a month  --  a year She and Nell  --  she and the Enemy  --  had been so proud to have aprons just alike and cut by the same dainty pattern . But now if she knew  --  if the Enemy knew ! How ashamed it would make her to have on one like  --  like an adopted 's ! How she 'd wish hers was stripes ! Perhaps  --  oh , perhaps she would think it was fortunate that she was an enemy now . But the worst Things that crowded up and scoffed and gibed were not Things that had to do with enemies . The worst-of-all Things had to do with a little , tender woman with glasses on  --  whose hair did n't curl . Those Things broke Margaret 's heart . " Now you know why She makes you make the bed over again when it 's wrinkly , " gibed one Thing . " And why she makes you mend the holes in your stockings , " another Thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones ! " flashed Margaret , hotly , but she could not stem the tide of Things . It swirled in . " Perhaps now you see why She makes you hem towels and wipe dishes  --  " " And wo n't let you eat two pieces of pie  --  " " Or one piece o ' fruit-cake  --  " " Maybe you remember now the times she 's said , ' This is no little daughter of mine ' ? " Margaret turned sharply . " That was only because I was naughty , " she pleaded , strickenly , but she knew in her soul it was n't " only because . " She knew it was because . The terror within her was growing more terrible every moment . Then came shame . Like the evilest of the evil Things it had been lurking in the background waiting its turn ,  --  it was its turn now . Margaret stood quite still , ashamed . She could not name the strange feeling , for she had never been ashamed before , but she sat there a piteous little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be only nine and feel like that ! To shrink from going home past Mrs. Streeter 's and the minister 's and the Enemy 's !  --  oh , most of all past the Enemy 's !  --  for fear they 'd look out of the window and say , " There goes an adopted ! " Perhaps they 'd point their fingers .  --  Margaret closed her eyes dizzily and saw Mrs. Streeter 's plump one and the minister 's lean one and the Enemy 's short brown one , all pointing . She could feel something burning her on her forehead ,  --  it was " Adopted , " branded there . The Enemy was worst . Margaret crept under the fence just before she got to the Enemy 's house and went a weary , roundabout way home . She could not bear to have this dearest Enemy see her in her disgrace . Moth  --  She That had Been  --  would be wondering why Margaret was late . If she looked sober out of her eyes and said , " This ca n't be my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for certain . That would be the final proof . The chimney was in sight now ,  --  now the roof ,  --  now the kitchen door , and She That Had Been was in it ! She was shading her eyes and looking for the little girl that was n't hers . A sob rose in the little girl 's throat , but she tramped steadily on . It did not occur to her to snatch off her hat and wave it , as little girls that belonged did . She had done it herself . The kitchen door was very near indeed now . It did not seem to be Margaret that was moving , but the kitchen door . It seemed to be coming to meet her and bringing with it a dear slender figure . She looked up and saw the soberness in its dear eyes . " This ca n't be my little girl , can  --  " but Margaret heard no more . With a muffled wail she fled past the slender figure , up-stairs , that she did not see at all , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt her heart break under her awful little checked apron . For now she knew for certain . Two darknesses shut down about her , and in the heart-break of one she forgot to be afraid of the other . She had always before been afraid of the night-dark and imagined creepy steps coming along the hall and into the door . The things she imagined now were dreadfuler than that . This new dark was so much darker ! They thought she was asleep and let her lie there on her little bed alone . By-and-by would be time enough to probe gently for the childish trouble . Perhaps she would leave it behind her in her sleep . Out-of-doors suddenly a new sound rose shrill above the crickets and the frogs . It was the Enemy singing " Glory , glory , hallelujah . " That was the last straw . Margaret writhed deeper into the pillows . She knew what the rest of it was  --  " Glory , glory , hallelujah , ' tis n't me ! My soul goes marching on ! " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some one to lay her trouble to , Margaret " laid it to " the Enemy . A sudden , bitter , unreasoning resentment took possession of her . If there had n't been an Enemy , there would n't have been a trouble . Everything would have been beautiful and  --  and respectable , just as it was before . She would have been out there singing " Glory , glory hallelujah , " too . " She 's to blame  --  I hate her ! " came muffledly from the pillows . " Oh , I do !  --  I ca n't help it , I do ! I 'm always going to hate her forevermore ! She need n't have  --  " Need n't have what ? What had the little scape-goat out there in the twilight done ? But Margaret was beyond reasoning now . " Mine enemy hath done it , " was enough for her . If she lived a thousand years  --  if she lived two thousand  --  she would never speak to the Enemy again ,  --  never forgive her ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blesses . A plan formulated itself after a while in the dark little room . It was born of the travail of the child 's soul . Something must be done  --  there was something she would do . She began it at once , huddled up against the window to catch the failing light . She would pin it to her pin-cushion where they would find it after  --  after she was gone . Did folks ever mourn for an Adopted ? In her sore heart Margaret yearned to have them mourn . " I have found it out , " she wrote with her trembling little fingers . " I do n't suppose its wicked becaus I couldent help being one but it is orful . It breaks your hart to find youre one all of a suddin . If I had known before , I would have darned the big holes too . Ime going away becaus I canot bare living with folks I havent any right to . The stik pin this is pined on with is for Her That Wasent Ever my Mother for I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose is red the violet blue sugger is sweet and so are you . " Margaret . " She pinned it on tremblingly and then crept back to bed . Perhaps she went to sleep ,  --  at any rate , quite suddenly there were voices at her door  --  Her voice and  --  His . She did not stir , but lay and listened to them . " Dear child ! Would n't you wake her up , Henry ? What do you suppose could have happened ? " That was the voice that used to be Mother 's . It made Margaret feel thrilly and homesick . " Something at school , probably , dear ,  --  you must n't worry . All sorts of little troubles happen at school . " The voice that used to be her Father 's . " I know , but this must have been a big one . If you had seen her little face , Henry ! If she were Nelly , I should think somebody had been telling her  --  about her origin , you know  --  " Margaret held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an origin ? This thing that they were saying  --  hark ? " I 've always expected Nelly to find out that way  --  it would be so much kinder to tell her at home . You know it would , Henry , instead of letting her hear it from strangers and get her poor little heart broken . Henry , if God had n't given us a precious little child of our own and we had ever adopted  --  " Margaret dashed off the quilts and leaped to the floor with a cry of ecstasy . The anguish  --  the shame  --  the cruel gibing Things  --  were left behind her ; they had slid from her burdened little heart at the first glorious rush of understanding ; they would never come back ,  --  never come back ,  --  never come back to Margaret ! Glory , glory , hallelujah , ' twas n't her ! Her soul went marching on ! The two at the door suffered an unexpected , an amazing onslaught from a flying little figure . Its arms were out , were gathering them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exultant hugs . " Oh ! Oh , you 're mine ! I 'm yours ! We 're each other 's ! I 'm not an Adopted any more ! I thought I was , and I was n't ! I was going away and die  --  oh , oh , oh ! " Then Margaret remembered the Enemy , and in the throes of her pity the enmity was swallowed up forever . The instant yearning that welled up in her to put her arms around the poor real Adopted almost stifled her . She slid out of the two pairs of big tender arms and scurried away like a hare . She was going to find Nelly and love her  --  oh , love her enough to make up ! She would give her the coral beads she had always admired ; she would let her be mistress and she 'd be maid when they kept house ,  --  she 'd let her have the frosting half of all their cake and all the raisins . " I 'll let her wear the spangly veil when we dress up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried softly as she ran . " And the longest trail . She may be the richest and have the most children  --  I 'd rather . " There did not seem anything possible and beloved that she would not let Nelly do . She took agitated little leaps through the soft darkness , sending on ahead her yearning love in a tender little call : " Nelly ! Nelly ! " She could never be too tender  --  too generous  --  to Nelly , to try to make up . And all her life she would take care of her and keep her from finding out . She should n't find out ! When they were both , oh , very old , she would still be taking care of Nelly like that . " Nelly ! Nelly ! " If she could only think of some Great Thing she could do , that would  --  would hurt to do ! And then she thought . She stopped quite suddenly in her impetuous rush , stilled by the Greatness of it . " I 'll let her love her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " so there ! " Chapter IV Bobby Unwelcome Bobby had learned U that day in school , and he strutted home beside his nurse , Olga , with conscious relief in the swing of his sturdy legs . There was a special reason why Bobby felt relieved to get to U. He glanced up , up , up , sidewise , at the non-committal face so far above him , and wondered in his anxious little way whether or not it would be prudent to speak of the special reason now . Olga had times , Bobby had discovered , when you dassent speak of things , and it looked  --  yes , cert'nly  --  as though she was having one now . Still , if you only dast to  --  " It 's the same one that 's in the middle o ' my name , do n't you know , " he plunged in , hurriedly . " Mercy ! What iss it the child iss talking about ! " There ! was n't she having one ? Did n't she usually say " Mercy ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know  --  U. The one in the middle o ' my name , " Bobby hastened on  --  " right prezac'ly in the middle of it . I wish "  --  but he caught himself up with a jerk . It did n't seem best , after all , to consult Olga now  --  not now , while she was having one . Better wait  --  only , dear , dear , dear , how long he had waited a'ready ! It had not occurred to Bobby to consult his mother . They two were not intimately acquainted , and naturally he felt shy . Bobby 's mother was very young and beautiful . He had seen her dressed in a wondrous soft white dress once , with little specks of shiny things burning on her bare throat , and ever since he had known what angels look like . There were reasons enough why Bobby seldom saw his mother . The house was very big , and her room so far away from his ;  --  that was one reason . Then he always went to bed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was another reason why he and the beautiful young mother did not know each other very well , but even Olga had never explained that one . Bobby had that ahead of him to find out ,  --  poor Bobby ! Some one had called him Fire Face once at school , but the kind-hearted teacher had never let it happen again . At home , in the great empty house , the mirrors were all high up out of reach , and in the nursery there had never been any at all . Bobby had never looked at himself in a mirror . Of course he had seen himself up to his chin  --  dear , yes  --  and admired his own little straight legs often enough , and doubled up his little round arms to hunt for his " muscle . " In a quiet , unobtrusive way Bobby was rather proud of himself . He had to be  --  there was no one else , you see . And even at six , when there is so little else to do , one can put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you do n't call those bow-legged legs , do you , Olga ? " he had exulted once , in an unguarded moment when he had been thinking of Cleggy Munro 's legs at school . " I guess you call those pretty straight-up-'n ' - down ones ! " And the hard face of the old nurse had suddenly softened in a strange , pleasant way , and for the one only time that he could remember , Olga had taken Bobby in her arms and kissed him . " They 're beautiful legs , that iss so , " Olga had said , but she had n't been looking at them when she said it . She had been looking straight into his face . The look hurt , too , Bobby remembered . He did not know what pity was , but it was that that hurt . The night after he learned U at school Bobby decided to hazard everything and ask Olga what the one in his name stood for . He could not put it off any longer . " Olga , what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " he broke out , suddenly , while he was being unbuttoned for bed . " I know it 's a U , but I do n't know a U-what . I 've ' cided I wo n't go to bed till I 've found out . " Things had gone criss-cross . The old Norwegian woman was not in a good humor . " Unwelcome  --  that iss what it must stand for , " she laughed unpleasantly . " Bobby Unwelcome ! " Bobby laughed too . Then a piteous little suspicion crept into his mind and began to grow . He turned upon Olga sharply . " What does Unwelcome mean ? " he demanded . " Eh ? Iss it not enough plain to you ? Well , not wanted  --  that iss what it means then . " " Not wanted ,  --  not wanted . " Bobby repeated the words over and over to himself , not quite satisfied yet . They sounded bad  --  oh , very ; but perhaps Olga had got them wrong . She was not a United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person to get things wrong . Still  --  " not wanted "  --  they certainly sounded very plain . And they meant  --  Bobby gave a faint gasp , and suddenly his thoughts turned dizzily round and round one terrible pivot  --  " not wanted . " He sprang away out of the nurse 's hands and darted down the long , bright hall to his mother 's room . She was being dressed for a ball , and the room was pitilessly light . She sat at a table with a little mirror before her . Suddenly another face appeared in it with hers  --  a little , scarred , red face , stamped deep with childish woe . The contrast appalled her . Bobby was not looking into the glass , but into her beautiful face . " Is that what it stands for ? " he demanded , breathlessly . " She said so . Did she lie ? " " Robert ! For Heaven 's sake , child , stand away ! You are tearing my lace . What are you doing here ? Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that ? " he persisted . " Does what stand for what ? Look , you are crushing my dress . Stand farther off . Do n't you see , child ? " " She said the U in the middle o ' my name stood for Not Wanted . Does it ? Tell me quick . Does it ? " The contrast of the two faces in her mirror hurt her like a blow . It brought back all the disappointment and the wounded vanity of that time , six years ago , when they had shown her the tiny , disfigured face of her son . " No , it was n't that . I morember now . It was Unwelcome , but it means that . Is the middle o ' my name Unwelcome  --  what ? " " Oh yes , yes , yes ! " she cried , scarcely knowing what she said . The boy 's eyes followed hers to the mirror , and in that brief , awful space he tasted of the Tree of Knowledge . With a little cry he stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sound of a soft little body bounding down the polished stairs . A good while afterwards Bobby opened his eyes wonderingly . There seemed to be people near him , but he could not see them at all distinctly . A faint , wonderful perfume crept to him . " It 's very dark , is n't it ? " he said , in surprise . " I can smell a beautiful smell , but I ca n't see it . Why , why ! It is n't you , is it ?  --  not my mother ? Why , I was n't ' specting to find  --  Oh , I morember it now  --  I morember it all ! Then I 'm glad it 's dark . I should n't want it to be as light as that again . Oh no ! oh no ! I should n't want her to see  --  Why , she 's crying ! What is she crying for ? " He put out a small weak hand and groped towards the sound of bitter sobbing . Instinctively he knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I know what the matter is . It 's me , and I 'm very sorry . I never knew it before ; no , I never . I 'm glad it 's dark now  --  are n't you ?  --  ' count o ' that . Only I 'm a little speck sorry it is n't light enough for you to see my legs . They 're very straight ones  --  you can ask Olga . You might feel of ' em if you thought ' t would help any to . P'r'aps it might make you feel a very little  --  just a very little  --  better to . They 're cert'nly very straight ones . But then of course they are n't like a  --  like a  --  a face . They 're only legs . But they 're the best I can do . " He ended wearily , with a sigh of pain . The bitter sobbing kept on , and seemed to trouble him . Then a new idea occurred to him , and he made a painful effort to turn on his pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that  --  P'r'aps you think I 'm feeling bad ' count o ' the U in the middle o ' my name . Is that what makes you cry ? Why , you need n't . That 's all right ! After  --  after I looked in there , of course I knew ' bout how it was . I wish you would n't cry . It joggles my  --  my heart . " But it was his little broken body that it joggled . The mother found it out , and stopped sobbing by a mighty effort . She drew very close to Bobby in the dark that was light to every one else , and laid her wet cheek against the little , scarred , red face . The motion was so gentle that it scarcely stirred the yellow tendrils of his soft hair . An infinite tenderness was born out of her anguish . There was left her a merciful moment to be a mother in . Bobby forgot his pain in the bliss of it . " Why , why , this is very nice ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be as nice as this  --  I never knew ! But I 'm glad it 's dark ,  --  are n't you ? I 'd rather it would  --  be  --   --  dark . " And then it grew altogether dark for Bobby , and the little face against the new-born , heart-broken mother 's cheek felt cold , and would not warm with all her passionate kisses . Chapter V The Little Girl Who Should Have Been a Boy There was so much time for the Little Girl who should have been a Boy to ponder over it . She was only seven , but she grew quite skilful in pondering . After lessons  --  and lessons were over at eleven  --  there was the whole of the rest of the day to wander , in her little , desolate way , in the gardens . She liked the fruit-garden best , and the Golden Pippin tree was her choicest pondering-place . There was never any one there with her . The Little Girl who should have been a Boy was always alone . " You see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she communed with herself , in her quaint , unchildish fashion . " You are a mistake . You went and was born a Girl , when they wanted a Boy  --  oh , my , how they wanted a Boy ! But the moment they saw you they knew it was all up with them . You was n't wicked , really ,  --  I guess it was n't wicked ; sometimes I ca n't be certain ,  --  but you did go and make such a silly mistake ! Look at me ,  --  why did n't you know how much they wanted a Boy and did n't want you ? Why did n't you be brave and go up to the Head Angel , and say , ' Send me to another place ; for pity sake do n't send me there . They want a Little Boy . ' Why did n't you  --  oh , why did n't you ? It would have saved such a lot of trouble ! " The Little Girl who should have been a Boy always sighed at that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , for after that she always sat in the long grass under the Golden Pippin tree and rocked herself back and forth silently . There was no use in saying anything more after that . It had all been said . It was a great , beautiful estate , to east and west and north and south of her , and the Boy the Head Angel should have sent instead of the sad Little Girl was to have inherited it all . And there was a splendid title that went with the estate . In the sharp mind of the Little Girl nothing was hidden or undiscovered . " It seems a pity to have it wasted , " she mused , wistfully , with her grave wide eyes on the beautiful green expanses all about her , " just for a mistake like that ,  --  I mean like me  --  too . You 'd think the Head Angel would be ashamed of himself , would n't you ? He prob'ly is . " The Shining Mother  --  it was thus the Little Girl who should have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and wonderful sparkling gowns ; everything about the Shining Mother sparkled  --  the Shining Mother was almost always away . So was the Ogre . Somewhere outside  --  clear outside  --  of the green expanses there was a gay , frivolous world where almost always they two stayed . The Little Girl called her father the Ogre for want of a better name . She was never quite satisfied with the name , but it had to answer till she found another . Prob'ly ogres did n't wear an eye-glass in one of their eyes , or flip off the sweet little daisy heads with cruel canes , but they were oldish and scare-ish , and of course they would n't have noticed you any , even if you were their Little Girl . Ogres would have prob'ly wanted a Boy too , and that 's the way they 'd have let you see your mistake . So , till she found a better name , the Little Girl who had made the mistake called her father the Ogre . She was very proud and fond of the Shining Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , one feeling mattered about as much as the other . " It does n't hurt you any to be afraid , when you do it all alone by yourself , " she reasoned , " and it does n't do you any good to be fond . It only amuses you , " she added , with sad wisdom . As I said , she was only seven , but she was very old indeed . So the time went along until the weeks piled up into months . The summer she was eight , the Little Girl could not stand it any longer . She decided that something must be done . The Shining Mother and the Ogre were coming back to the green expanses . She had found that out at lessons . " And then they will have it all to go over again  --  all the miser'bleness of my not being a Boy , " the Little Girl thought , sadly . " And I do n't know whether they can stand it or not , but I ca n't . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive soul of the Little Girl who should have been a Boy . One of two things must happen  --  she must be loved , or die . So , being desperate , she resolved to chance everything . It was under the Golden Pippin tree , rocking herself back and forth in the long grass , that she made her plans . Straight on the heels of them she went to the gardener 's little boy . " Lend me  --  no , I mean give me  --  your best clothes , " she said , with gentle imperiousness . It was not a time to waste words . At best , the time that was left to practise in was limited enough . " Your best clothes , " she had said , realizing distinctly that fustian and corduroy would not do . She was even a little doubtful of the best clothes . The gardener 's little boy , once his mouth had shut and his legs come back to their locomotion , brought them at once . If there was a suspicion of alacrity in his obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Little Girl . Having always been a mistake , nothing more , how could she know that a boy 's best clothes are not always his dearest possession ? Now if it had been the threadbare , roomy , easy little fustians , with their precious pocket-loads , that she had demanded ! There were six days left to practise in  --  only six . How the Little Girl practised ! It was always quite alone by herself . She did it in a sensible , orderly way ,  --  the leaps and strides first , whoops next , whistle last . The gardener 's little boy 's best clothes she kept hidden in the long grass , under the Golden Pippin tree , and on the fourth day she put them on . Oh , the agony of the fourth day ! She came out of that practice period a wan , white , worn little thing that should never have been a Boy . For it was heart-breaking work . Every instinct of the Little Girl 's rebelled against it . It was terrible to leap and whoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was life or death to her , and always she persevered . In those days lessons scarcely paid . They were only a pitiful makeshift . The Little Girl lived only in her terrible practice hours . She could not eat or sleep . She grew thin and weak . " I do n't look like me at all , " she told herself , on a chair before her mirror . " But that is n't the worst of it . I do n't look like the Boy , either . Ugh ! how I look ! I wonder if the Angel would know me ? It would be kind of dreadful not to have anybody know you . Well , you wo n't be you when you 're the Boy , so prob'ly it wo n't matter . " On the sixth day  --  the last thing  --  she cut her hair off . She did it with her eyes shut to give herself courage , but the snips of the shears broke her heart . The Little Girl had always loved her soft , shining hair . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could caress and pet . She had made an idol of it , having nothing else to love . When it was all shorn off she crept out of the room without opening her eyes . After that the gardener 's little boy 's best clothes came easier to her , she found . And she could whoop and leap and whistle a little better . It was almost as if she had really made herself the Boy she should have been . Then the Shining Mother came , and the Ogre . The Little Girl  --  I mean the Boy  --  was waiting for them , swinging her  --  his  --  feet from a high branch of the Golden Pippin tree . He was whistling . " But I think I am going to die , " he thought , behind the whistle . " I 'm certain I am . I feel it coming on . " Of course , after a little , there was a hunt everywhere for the Little Girl . Even little girls can not slip out of existence like that , undiscovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only a gardener 's little boy in his best clothes , whistling faintly , was found . He fell out of the Golden Pippin tree as the field-servants went by , and they stopped to carry his limp little figure to the gardener 's lodge . Then the hunt went forward again . The Shining Mother grew faint and sick with fear , and the Ogre strode about like one demented . It was hardly what was to be expected of the Shining Mother and the Ogre . Towards night the mystery was partly solved . It was the Shining Mother who found the connecting threads . She found the little , jagged locks of soft , sweet hair . The Ogre came upon her sitting on the floor among them , and the whiteness of her face terrified him . " I know  --  you need not tell me what has happened ! " she said , scarcely above a whisper , as if in the presence of the dead . " A door in me has opened , and I see it all  --  all , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now , dear God in heaven , we have lost her ! " It was very nearly so . They could hardly know then how near it came to being true . Link by link they came upon the little chain of pitiful proofs . They found all the little , sweet , white girl-clothes folded neatly by themselves and laid in a pile together , as if on an altar for sacrifice . If the Little Girl had written " Good-bye " in her childish scrawl upon them , the Shining Mother would not have better understood . So many things she was seeing beyond that open door . They found the Little Girl 's dolls laid out like little , white-draped corpses in one of her bureau-drawers . The row of stolid little faces gazed up at them with the mystery of the Sphinx in all their glittering eyes . It was the Shining Mother who shut the drawer , but first she kissed the faces . After all , the Ogre discovered the last little link of the chain . He brought it home in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Little Girl 's white bed . It was very still and pitiful and small . The took the gardener 's little boy 's best clothes off from it and put on the soft white night-gown of the Little Girl . Then , one on one side and one on the other , they kept their long hard vigil . It was night when the Little Girl opened her eyes , and the first thing they saw was the chairful of little girl-clothes the Shining Mother had set beside the bed . Then they saw the Shining Mother . Things came back to the Little Girl by slow degrees . But the look in the Shining Mother 's face  --  that did not come back . That had never been there before . The Little Girl , in her wise , old way , understood that look , and gasped weakly with the joy and wonder of it . Oh , the joy ! Oh , the wonder ! " But I tried to be one , " she whispered after a while , a little bewildered still . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't help that ; I felt it coming on . Prob'ly , though , I should n't have made a very good one . " The Shining Mother bent over and took the Little Girl in her arms . " Dear , " she whispered , " it was the Boy that died . I am glad he died . " So , though the Ogre and the Shining Mother had not found their Boy , the Little Girl had found a father and mother . Chapter VI The Lie The Lie went up to bed with him . Russy did n't want it to , but it crept in through the key-hole ,  --  it must have been the key-hole , for the door was shut the minute Metta 's skirt had whisked through . But one thing Russy had to be thankful for ,  --  Metta did n't know it was there in the room . As far as that went , it was a kind-hearted Lie . But after Metta went away ,  --  after she had put out the light and said " Pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' do n't roll out , "  --  after that ! Russy snuggled deep down in the pillows and said he would go right to sleep ; oh , right straight ! He always had before . It made you forget the light was out , and there were queer , creaky night-noises all round your bed ,  --  under it some of ' em ; over by the bureau some of ' em ; and some of ' em coming creepy , cree-py up the stairs . You dug your head deep down in the pillows , and the next thing you knew you were asleep ,  --  no , awake , and the noises were beautiful day-ones that you liked . You heard roosters crowing , and Mr. Vandervoort 's cows calling for breakfast , and , likely as not , some mother-birds singing duets with their husbands . Oh yes , it was a good deal the best way to do , to go right straight to sleep when Metta put the light out . But to-night it was different , for the Lie was there . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . It was worse than creepy , creaky noises ,  --  mercy , yes ! You 'd swap it for those quick enough and not ask a single bit of " boot . " You almost wanted to hear the noises . Illustration : It was worse than creepy , creaky noises It came across the room . There was no sound , but Russy knew it was coming well enough . He knew when it got up close to the side of the bed . Then it stopped and began to speak . It was n't " out loud " and it was n't a whisper , but Russy heard it . " Move over ; I 'm coming into bed with you , " the Lie said . " I hope you do n't think I 'm going to sit up all night . Besides , I 'm always scared in the dark ,  --  it runs in my family . The Lies are always afraid . They 're not good sleepers , either , so let 's talk . You begin  --  or shall I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , this is great , is n't it ! I like this house . I stayed at Barney Toole 's last night and it does n't begin with this . Barney 's folks are poor , and there are n't any curtains or carpets or anything ,  --  nor pillows on the bed . I never slept a wink at Barney 's . I 'm hoping I shall drop off here , after a while . It 's a new place , and I 'm more likely to in new places . You never slept with one o ' my family before , did you ? " " No , " Russy groaned . " Oh no , I never before ! " " That 's what I thought . I should have been likely to hear of it if you had . I was a little surprised ,  --  I say , what made you have anything to do with me . I was never more surprised in my life ! They 'd always said : ' Well , you 'll never get acquainted with that Russy Rand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shook hands with me ! " " I had to . " Russy sat up in bed and stiffened himself for self-defence . " I had to ! When Jeffy Vandervoort said that about Her ,  --  well , I guess you 'd have had to if they said things about your mother  --  " " I never had one . The Lies have a Father , that 's all . Go ahead . " " There is n't anything else ,  --  I just had to . " " Tell what you said and what he said . Go ahead . " " You know all about  --  " " Go ahead ! " Russy rocked himself back and forth in his agony . It was dreadful to have to say it all over again . " Well , then , " doggedly , " Jeffy said my mother never did , but his did  --  oh , always ! " " Did what  --  oh , always ? " Russy clinched his little round fingers till the bones cracked under the soft flesh . " Kissed him good-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  --  an '  --  tucked him in . Oh , always , he said . He said mine never did . An ' I said  --  " " You said  --  go ahead ! " " I said she did , too ,  --  oh  --  always , " breathed Russy in the awful dark . " I had to . When it 's your mother , you have to  --  " " I never had one , I told you ! How do I know ? Go on . " He was driven on relentlessly . He had it all to go through with , and he whispered the rest hurriedly to get it done . " I said she tucked me in ,  --  came up a-purpose to ,  --  an ' always kissed me twice ( his only does once ) , an ' always  --  called me  --  Dear . " Russy fell back in a heap on the pillows and sobbed into them . " My badness ! "  --  anybody but a Lie would have said " my goodness , "  --  " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ! But I do n't suppose he believed a word of it  --  you did n't make him believe you , did you ? " " He had to , " cried out Russy , fiercely . " He said I 'd never lied to him in my life  --  " " Before ;  --  yes , I know . " Russy slipped out of bed and padded over the thick carpet towards the place where the window-seat was in the daytime . But it was n't there . He put out his hands and hunted desperately for it . Yes , there ,  --  no , that was sharp and hard and hurt you . That must be the edge of the bureau . He tried again , for he must find it ,  --  he must ! He would not stay in bed with that Lie another minute . It crowded him ,  --  it tortured him so . " This is it , " thought Russy , and sank down gratefully on the cushions . His bare feet scarcely touched toe-tips to the floor . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " I 'm coming ,  --  which way are you ? Ca n't you speak up ? " The Lie was coming , too ! Suddenly an awful thought flashed across Russy 's little , weary brain . What if the Lie would always come , too ? What if he could never get away from it ? What if it slept with him , walked with him , talked with him , lived with him ,  --  oh , always ! But Russy stiffened again with dogged courage . " I had to ! " he thought . " I had to ,  --  I had to ,  --  I had to ! When he said things about Her ,  --  when it 's your mother ,  --  you have to . " A great time went by , measureless by clock-ticks and aching little heart-beats . It seemed to be weeks and months to Russy . Then he began to feel a slow relief creeping over his misery , and he said to himself the Lie must have " dropped off . " There was not a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful that Russy laughed to himself in his relief . He wanted to leap to his feet and dance about the room , but he thought of the sharp corners and hard edges of things in time . Instead , he nestled among the cushions of the window-seat and laughed on softly . Perhaps it was all over ,  --  perhaps it was n't asleep , but had gone away  --  to Barney Toole 's , perhaps , where they regularly " put up " Lies ,  --  and would never come back ! Russy gasped for joy . Perhaps when you 'd never shaken hands with a Lie but once in your life , and that time you had to , and you 'd borne it , anyway , for what seemed like weeks and months ,  --  perhaps then they went away and left you in peace ! Perhaps you 'd had punishment enough then . Very late Russy 's mother came up-stairs . She was very tired , and her pretty young face in the frame of soft down about her opera-cloak looked a little cross . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's room , Ellen ?  --  just this once ? " he pleaded in her ear . " It will take but a minute . " " I am so tired , Carter ! Well , if I must  --  Why , he is n't in the bed ! " The light from the hall streamed in , showing it tumbled and tossed as if two had slept in it . But no one was in it now . The mother 's little cry of surprise sharpened to anxiety . " Where is he , Carter ? Why do n't you speak ? He is n't here in bed , I tell you ! Russy is n't here ! " " He has rolled out ,  --  no , he has n't rolled out . I 'll light up  --  there he is , Ellen ! There 's the little chap on the window-seat ! " " And the window is open ! " she cried , sharply . She darted across to the little figure and gathered it up into her arms . She had never been frightened about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to her own . " He is cold ,  --  his little night-dress is damp ! " she said . Then her kisses rained down on the little , sleeping face . In his sleep , Russy felt them , but he thought it was Jeffy 's mother kissing Jeffy . " It feels good , does n't it ? " he murmured . " I do n't wonder Jeffy likes it ! If my mother kissed me  --  I told Jeffy she did ! It was a Lie , but I had to . You have to , when they say things like that about your mother . You have to say she kisses you  --  oh , always ! She comes ' way up-stairs every night a-purpose to . An ' she tucks you in , an ' she calls you  --  Dear . It 's a Lie an ' it ' most kills you , but you have to say it . But it 's perfectly awful afterwards . " He nestled against the soft down of her cloak and moaned as if in pain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lie . It 's perfectly  --  aw  --  ful  --  " " Oh , Carter ! " the mother broke out , for it was all plain to her . In a flash of agonized understanding the wistful little sleep-story was filled out in every detail . She understood all the tragedy of it . " Russy ! Russy ! " She shook him in her eagerness . " Russy , it 's my kisses ! I 'm kissing you ! It is n't Jeffy 's mother ,  --  it 's your mother , Russy ! Feel them !  --  do n't you feel them on your forehead and your hair and your little red lips ? It 's your mother kissing you ! " Russy opened his eyes . " Why ! Why , so it is ! " he said . " And calling you ' Dear , ' Russy ! Do n't you hear her ? Dear boy ,  --  dear little boy ! You hear her , do n't you , Russy  --  dear ? " " Why , yes !  --  why ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ! She 's tucking in the blanket now ,  --  and now the little quilt , Russy ! That is what mothers are for  --  I never thought before  --  oh , I never thought ! " She dropped her face beside his on the pillow and fell to kissing him again . He held his face quite still for the sweet , strange baptism . Then suddenly he laughed out happily , wildly . " Then it is n't a Lie ! " he cried , in a delirium of relief and joy . " It 's true ! " Chapter VII The Princess of Make-Believe The Princess was washing dishes . On her feet she would barely have reached the rim of the great dish-pan , but on the soap-box she did very well . A grimy calico apron trailed to the floor . " Now this golden platter I must wash extry clean , " the Princess said . " The Queen is ve-ry particular about her golden platters . Last time , when I left one o ' the corners  --  it 's such a nextremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  oh , I mean  --  I mean she tapped me a little love pat on my cheek with her golden spoon . " It was a great , brown-veined , stoneware platter , and the arms of the Princess ached with holding it . Then , in an unwary instant , it slipped out of her soapsudsy little fingers and crashed to the floor . Oh ! oh ! the Queen ! the Queen ! She was coming ! The Princess heard her shrill , angry voice , and felt the jar of her heavy steps . There was the space of an instant  --  an instant is so short !  --  before the storm broke . " You little limb o ' Satan ! That 's my best platter , is it ? Broke all to bits , eh ? I 'll break  --  " But there was a flurry of dingy apron and dingier petticoats , and the little Princess had fled . She did not stop till she was in her Secret Place among the willows . Her small lean face was pale but undaunted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she panted . " It 's wash-day up at the Castle . She never enjoys herself on wash-days . And then that golden platter  --  I 'm sorry I smashed it all to flinders ! When the Prince comes I shall ask him to buy another . " The Prince had never come , but the Princess waited for him patiently . She sat with her face to the west and looked for him to come through the willows with the red sunset light filtering across his hair . That was the way the Prince was coming , though the time was not set . It might be a good while before he came , and then again  --  you never could tell ! " But when he does , and we 've had a little while to get acquainted , then I shall say to him , ' Hear , O Prince , and give ear to my  --  my petition ! For verily , verily , I have broken many golden platters and jasper cups and saucers , and the Queen , long live her ! is sore  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . She put up a little lean brown hand and rubbed a tingling spot on her temple  --  ah , not the Queen ! It was the Princess  --  long live her !  --  who was " sore . " " ' I beseech thee , O Prince , ' I shall say , ' buy new golden platters and jasper cups and saucers for the Queen , and then shall I verily , verily be  --  be  --  ' " Oh , the long words  --  how they slipped out of reach ! The little Princess sighed rather wearily . She would have to rehearse that speech so many times before the Prince came . Suppose he came to-night ! Suppose she looked up now , this minute , towards the golden west and he was there , swinging along through the willow canes towards her ! But there was no one swinging along through the willows . The yellow light flickered through  --  that was all . Somewhere , a long way off , sounded the monotonous hum of men 's voices . Through the lace-work of willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down beyond , in the clearing , the Castle Guards in blue jean blouses were pulling stumps . The Princess could not see their dull , passionless faces , and she was glad of it . The Castle Guards depressed her . But they were not as bad as the Castle Guardesses . They were mostly old women with bleared , dim eyes , and they wore such faded  --  silks . " My silk dress is rather faded , " murmured the little Princess wistfully . She smoothed down the scant calico skirt with her brown little fingers . The patch in it she would not see . " I shall have to have the Royal Dress-maker make me another one soon . Let me see ,  --  what color shall I choose ? I 'd like my gold-colored velvet made up . I 'm tired of wearing royal purple dresses all the time , though of course I know they 're appropriater . I wonder what color the Prince would like best ? I should rather choose that color . " The Princess 's little brown hands were clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth , her eyes , wistful and wide , on the path the Prince would come . She was tired to-day and it was harder to wait . " But when he comes I shall say , ' Hear , O Prince . Verily , verily , I did not know which color you would like to find me dressed  --  I mean arrayed  --  in , and so I beseech thee excuse  --  pardon , I mean  --  mine infirmity . ' " The Princess was not sure of " infirmity , " but it sounded well . She could not think of a better word . " And then  --  I think then  --  he will take me in his arms , and his face will be all sweet and splendid like the Mother o ' God 's in the picture , and he will whisper ,  --  I do n't think he will say it out loud ,  --  oh , I 'd rather not !  --  ' Verily , Princess , ' he will whisper , ' Oh , verily , verily , thou hast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that he does n't care what color I am , for he  --  loves  --  me . " Lower and lower sank the solemn voice of the Princess . Slower and slower rocked the little , lean body . The birds themselves stopped singing at the end . In the Secret Place it was very still . " Oh no , no , no ,  --  not verily ! " breathed the Princess , in soft awe . For the wonder of it took her breath away . She had never in her life been loved , and now , at this moment , it seemed so near ! She thought she heard the footsteps of the Prince . They came nearer . The crisp twigs snapped under his feet . He was whistling . " Oh , I ca n't look !  --  I ca n't ! " gasped the little Princess , but she turned her face to the west ,  --  she had always known it would be from the west , and lifted closed eyes to his coming . When he got to the Twisted Willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willow Twins , anyway . " And I shall know when he does , " she thought . " I shall know the minute ! " Her face was rapt and tender . The miracle she had made for herself ,  --  the gold she had coined out of her piteous alloy ,  --  was it not come true at last ?  --  Verily , verily ? Hush ! Was the Prince not coming through the willows ? And the sunshine was trickling down on his hair ! The Princess knew , though she did not look . " He is at the Twisted Willow , " she thought . " Now he is at the Little Willow Twins . " But she did not open her eyes . She did not dare . This was a little different , she had never counted on being afraid . The twigs snapped louder and nearer  --  now very near . The merry whistle grew clearer , and then it stopped . " Hullo ! " Did princes say " hullo ! " The Princess had little time to wonder , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every fibre of her trembling little being , though she would not open her eyes for very fear that it might be somebody else . No , no , it was the Prince ! It was his voice , clear and ringing , as she had known it would be . She put up her hands suddenly and covered her eyes with them to make surer . It was not fear now , but a device to put off a little longer the delight of seeing him . " I say , hullo ! Have n't you got any tongue ? " " Oh , verily , verily ,  --  I mean hear , O Prince , I beseech , " she panted . The boy 's merry eyes regarded the shabby small person in puzzled astonishment . He felt an impulse to laugh and run away , but his royal blood forbade either . So he waited . " You are the Prince , " the little Princess cried . " I 've been waiting the longest time ,  --  but I knew you 'd come , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' gold buckles on ? I 'm goin ' to look in a minute , but I 'm waiting to make it spend . " The Prince whistled softly . " No , " he said then , " I did n't wear them clo'es to-day . You see , my mother  --  " " The Queen , " she interrupted , " you mean the Queen ? " " You bet I do ! She 's a reg'lar-builter ! Well , she do n't like to have me wearin ' out my best clo'es every day , " he said , gravely . " No , " eagerly , " nor mine do n't . Queen , I mean ,  --  but she is n't a mother , mercy , no ! I only wear silk dresses every day , not my velvet ones . This silk one is getting a little faded . " She released one hand to smooth the dress wistfully . Then she remembered her painfully practised little speech and launched into it hurriedly . " Hear , O Prince . Verily , verily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find me dressed in  --  I mean arrayed . I beseech thee to excuse  --  oh , pardon , I mean  --  " But she got no further . She could endure the delay no longer , and her eyes flew open . She had known his step ; she had known his voice . She knew his face . It was terribly freckled , and she had not expected freckles on the face of the Prince . But the merry , honest eyes were the Prince 's eyes . Her gaze wandered downward to the home-made clothes and bare , brown legs , but without uneasiness . The Prince had explained about his clothes . Suddenly , with a shy , glad little cry , the Princess held out her hands to him . The royal blood flooded the face of the Prince and filled in all the spaces between its little , gold-brown freckles . But the Prince held out his hand to her . His lips formed for words and she thought he was going to say , " Verily , Princess , thou hast found favor  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Prince said . Chapter VIII The Promise Murray was not as one without hope , for there was the Promise . The remembrance of it set him now to exulting , in an odd , restrained little way , where a moment ago he had been desponding . He clasped plump , brown little hands around a plump , brown little knee and swayed gently this way and that . " Maybe she 'll begin with my shoes , " Murray thought , and held his foot quite still . He could almost feel light fingers unlacing the stubbed little shoe ; Sheelah 's fingers were rather heavy and not patient with knots . Hers would be patient  --  there are some things one is certain of . " When she unbuttons me , " Murray mused on , sitting absolutely motionless , as if she were unbuttoning him now  --  " when she unbuttons me I shall hold in my breath  --  this way , " though he could hardly have explained why . She had never unlaced or unbuttoned him . Always , since he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had never occurred to him that he loved Sheelah , but he was used to her . All the mothering he had ever experienced had been the Sheelah kind  --  thorough enough , but lacking something ; Murray was conscious that it lacked something . Perhaps  --  perhaps to-night he should find out what . For to-night not Sheelah , but his mother , was going to undress him and put him to bed . She had promised . It had come about through his unprecedented wail of grief at parting , when she had gone into the nursery to say good-bye , in her light , sweet way . Perhaps it was because she was to be gone all day ; perhaps he was a little lonelier than usual . He was always rather a lonely little boy , but there were worse times ; perhaps this had been a worse time . Whatever had been the reason that prompted him , he had with disquieting suddenness , before Sheelah could prevent it , flung his arms about the pretty mother and made audible objection to her going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by surprise . " Why , you little silly ! I 'm coming back to-night ; I 'm only going for the day ! You would n't see much more of me if I stayed at home . " Which , from its very reasonableness , had quieted him . Of course he would not see much more of her . As suddenly as he had wailed he stopped wailing . Yet she had promised . Something had sent her back to the nursery door to do it . " Be a good boy and I 'll come home before you go to bed ! I 'll put you to bed , " she had promised . " We 'll have a regular lark ! " Hence he was out here on the door-step being a good boy . That Sheelah had taken unfair advantage of the Promise and made the being good rather a perilous undertaking , he did not appreciate . He only knew he must walk a narrow path across a long , lonely day . There were certain things  --  one especial certain thing  --  he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheelah till her work was done , or she might call it not being good . So he waited , and while he waited he found out the special thing . An unexpected providence sent enlightenment his way , to sit down beside him on the door-step . Its other name was Daisy . " Hullo , Murray ! Is it you ? " Daisy , being of the right sex , asked needless questions sometimes . " Yes , " answered Murray , politely . " Well , le 's play . I can stay half a hour . Le 's tag . " " I ca n't play , " rejoined Murray , caution restraining his natural desires . " I 'm being good . " Illustration : I ca n't play ... I 'm being good " Oh , my ! " shrilled the girl child derisively . " Ca n't you be good tagging ? Come on . " " No ; because you might  --  I might get no-fairing , and then Sheelah 'd come out and say I was bad . Le 's sit here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lark , Daisy ? I was going to ask Sheelah . " " A  --  lark ? Why , it 's a bird , of course ! " " I do n't mean the bird kind , but the kind you have when your mother puts you  --  when something splendid happens . That kind , I mean . " Daisy pondered . Her acquaintance with larks was limited , unless it meant  --  " Do you mean a good time ? " she asked . " We have larks over to my house when we go to bed  --  " " That 's it ! That 's the kind ! " shouted delighted Murray . " I 'm going to have one when I go to bed . Do you have reg'lar ones , Daisy ? " with a secret little hope that she did n't . " I 'm going to have a reg'lar one . " " Huh !  --  chase all ' round the room an ' turn somersaults an ' be highway robberers ? An ' take the hair-pins out o ' your mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray gasped a little at the picture of that kind of a lark . It was difficult to imagine himself chasing ' round the room or being a highwayman ; and as for somersaults  --  he glanced uneasily over his shoulder , as if Sheelah might be looking and read " somersaults " through the back of his head . For once he had almost turned one and Sheelah had found him in the middle of it and said pointed things . In Sheelah 's code of etiquette there were no somersaults in the " s " column . " It 's a reg'lar lark to hide in your mother 's hair , " was going on the girl child 's voice . " Yes , sir , that 's the reg'larest kind ! " Murray gasped again , harder . For that kind took away his breath altogether and made him feel a little dizzy , as if he were  --  were doing it now  --  hiding in his mother 's hair ! It was soft , beautiful , gold-colored hair , and there was a great deal of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes and felt it all about him and soft against his face , and smelled the faint fragrance of it . The dizziness was sweet . Yes , that must be the reg'larest kind of a lark , but Murray did not deceive himself , once the dream was over . He knew that kind was not waiting for him at the end of this long day . But a lark was waiting , anyway  --  a plain lark . It might have been the bird kind in his little heart now , singing for joy at the prospect . Impatience seized upon Murray . He wanted this little neighbor 's half-hour to be up , so that he could go in and watch the clock . He wanted Sheelah to come out here , for that would mean it was ten o'clock ; she always came at ten . He wanted it to be noon , to be afternoon , to be night ! The most beautiful time in his rather monotonous little life was down there at the foot of the day , and he was creeping towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little traveller on a dreary plain , with the first ecstatic glimpse of a hill ahead . Murray in his childish way had been in love a long time , but he had never got very near his dear lady . He had watched her a little way off and wondered at the gracious beauty of her , and loved her eyes and her lips and her soft , gold-colored hair . He had never  --  oh , never  --  been near enough to be unlaced and unbuttoned and put to bed by the lady that he loved . She had come in sometimes in a wondrous dress to say good night , but often , stopping at the mirror on the way across to him , she had seen a beautiful vision and forgotten to say it . And Murray had not wondered , for he had seen the vision , too . Illustration : Murray had ... seen the vision , too " Your mamma 's gone away , has n't she ? I saw her . " Daisy was still there ! Murray pulled himself out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's coming back to-night . She promised . " " S'posing the cars run off the track so she ca n't ? " Daisy said , cheerfully . " She 'll come , " Murray rejoined , with the decision of faith . " She promised , I said . " " S'posing she 's killed ' most dead ? " " She 'll come . " " Puffickly dead  --  s'posing ? " Murray took time , but even here his faith in the Promise stood its ground , though the ground shook under it . Sheelah had taught him what a promise was ; it was something not to be shaken or killed even in a railroad wreck . " When anybody promises , they do it , " he said , sturdily . " She promised an ' she 'll come . " " Then her angel will have to come , " remarked the older , girl child , coolly , with awful use of the indicative mood . When the half-hour was over and Murray at liberty , he went in to the clock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A great yearning was upon him to know the mystery of telling time . He wished  --  oh , how he wished he had let Sheelah teach him ! Then he could have stood here making little addition sums and finding out just how long it would be till night . Or he could go away and keep coming back here to make little subtraction sums , to find out how much time was left now  --  and now  --  and now . It was dreadful to just stand and wonder things . Once he went up-stairs to his own little room out of the nursery and sat down where he had always sat when Sheelah unlaced him , before he had begun to unlace himself , and stood up where he had always stood when Sheelah unbuttoned him . He sat very still and stood very still , his grave little face intent with imagining . He was imagining how it would be when she did it . She would be right here , close  --  if he dared , he could put out his hand and smooth her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her soft hair , and hide in it  --  He meant to dare ! " Little silly , " perhaps she would call him ; perhaps she would remember to kiss him good-night . And afterwards , when the lark was over , it would stay on , singing in his heart . And he would lie in the dark and love Her . For Her part , it was a busy day enough and did not lag . She did her shopping and called on a town friend or two . In the late afternoon she ran in to several art-stores where pictures were on exhibition . It was at the last of these places that she chanced to meet a woman who was a neighbor of hers in the suburbs . " Why , Mrs. Cody ! " the neighbor cried . " How delightful ! You 've come in to see Irving , too ? " " No , " with distinct regret answered Murray 's mother , " but I wish I had ! I 'm only in for a little shopping . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to-night  --  unless , of course , you 've seen him in Robespierre . " " I have n't . Cicely Howe has been teasing me to stop over and go with her . It 's a ' sure-enough ' temptation , as Fred says . Fred 's away , so that part 's all right . Of course there 's Murray , but there 's also Sheelah  --  " She was talking more to herself now than to the neighbor . The temptation had taken a sudden and striking hold upon her . It was the chance of a lifetime . She really ought  --  " I guess you 'll stop over ! " laughed the neighbor . " I know the signs . " " I 'll telephone to Sheelah , " Murray 's mother decided , aloud , " then I 'll run along back to Cicely 's . I 've always wanted to see Irving in that play . " But it was seven o'clock before she telephoned . She was to have been at home at half-past seven . " That you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until morning . I 'm going to the theatre . Tell Murray I 'll bring him a present . Put an extra blanket over him if it comes up chilly . " She did not hang up the receiver at once , holding it absently at her ear while she considered if she ought to say anything else to Sheelah . Hence she heard distinctly an indignant exclamation . " Will you hear that , now ! An ' the boy that certain ! ' She 's promised , ' he says , an ' he 'll kape on ' She's-promising ' for all o ' me , for it 's not tell him I will ! He can go to slape in his poor little boots , expectin ' her to kape her promise ! " The woman with the receiver at her ear uttered a low exclamation . She had not forgotten the Promise , but it had not impressed her as anything vital . She had given it merely to comfort Little Silly when he cried . That he would regard it as sacred  --  that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a blow . And , oddly enough , close upon its heels came a remembrance picture  --  of a tiny child playing with his soldiers on the floor . The sunlight lay over him  --  she could see it on his little hair and face . She could hear him talking to the " Captain soldier . " She had at the time called it a sermon , with a text , and laughed at the child who preached it . She was not laughing now . " Lissen , Cappen Sojer , an ' I 'll teach you a p'omise . A p'omise  --  a p'omise  --  why , when anybody p'omises , they do it ! " Queer how plainly she could hear Little Silly say that and could see him sitting in the sun ! Just the little white dress he had on  --  tucks in it and a dainty edging of lace ! She had recognized Sheelah 's maxims and laughed . Sheelah was stuffing the child with notions . " If anybody p'omises , they do it . " It seemed to come to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike against her heart . This mother of a little son stood suddenly self-convicted of a crime  --  the crime of faithlessness . It was not , she realized with a sharp stab of pain , faith in her the little child at the other end of the line was exercising , but faith in the Promise . He would keep on " She-promising " till he fell asleep in his poor little boots  --  " Oh ! " breathed in acute distress the mother of a little son . For all unexpectedly , suddenly , her house built of cards of carelessness , flippancy , thoughtlessness , had fallen round her . She struggled among the flimsy ruins . Then came a panic of hurry . She must go home at once , without a moment 's delay . A little son was waiting for her to come and put him to bed . She had promised ; he was waiting . They were to have a regular little lark  --  that she remembered , too , with distinctness . She was almost as uncertain as Murray had been of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the word , as she had used so many other words to the child , heedlessly . She had even and odd , uncertain little feeling as to what it meant to put a little son to bed , for she had never unlaced or unbuttoned one . She had never wanted to until now . But now  --  she could hardly wait to get home to do it . Little Silly was growing up  --  the bare brown space between the puffs of his little trousers and the top rims of his little socks were widening . She must hurry , hurry ! What if he grew up before she got there ! What if she never had a chance to put a little son to bed ! She had lost so many chances ; this one that was left had suddenly sprung into prominence and immense value . With the shock of her awakening upon her she felt like one partially paralyzed , but with the need upon her to rise and walk  --  to run . She started at once , scarcely allowing herself time to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . " I 've got to go , Cicely  --  I 've promised my little son , " was all she took time to say ; and the friend , knowing of the telephone message , supposed it had been a telephone promise . At the station they told her there was another train at seven-thirty , and she walked about uneasily until it came . Walking about seemed to hurry it along the rails to her . Another woman waited and walked with her . Another mother of little sons , she decided whimsically , reading it in the sweet , quiet face . The other woman was in widow 's black , and she thought how merciful it was that there should be a little son left her . She yielded to an inclination to speak . " The train is late , " she said . " It must be . " " No . " The other woman glanced backward at the station clock . " It 's we who are early . " " And in a hurry , " laughed Murray 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get home to put my little son to bed ! I do n't suppose you are going home for that ? " The sweet face for an instant lost its quietness . Something like a spasm of mortal pain crossed it and twisted it . The woman walked away abruptly , but came back . " I 've been home and  --  put him to bed , " she said , slowly  --  " in his last little bed . " Then Murray 's mother found herself hurrying feverishly into a car , her face feeling wet and queer . She was crying . " Oh , the poor woman ! " she thought , " the poor woman ! And I 'm going home to a little live one . I can cover him up and tuck him in ! I can kiss his little , solemn face and his little , brown knees . Why have n't I ever kissed his knees before ? If I could only hurry ! Will this car ever start ? " She put her head out of the window . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we start ? " she said . " Hot box , " the oily person replied , laconically . The delay was considerable to a mother going home to put her little child to bed . It seemed to this mother interminable . When at length she felt a welcome jar and lurch her patience was threadbare . She sat bolt upright , as if by so doing she were helping things along . It was an express and leaped ahead splendidly , catching up with itself . Her thoughts leaped ahead with it . No , no , he would not be in bed . Sheelah was not going to tell him , so he would insist upon waiting up . But she might find him asleep in his poor little boots ! She caught her breath in half a sob , half tender laugh . Little Silly ! But if an express , why this stop ? They were slowing up . It was not time to get to the home station ; there were no lights . Murray 's mother waylaid a passing brakeman . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , all right ! Do n't be scairt , lady ! Wreck ahead somewheres  --  freight-train . We got to wait till they clear the track . " But the misery of waiting ! He might get tired of waiting , or Sheelah might tell him his mother was not coming out to-night ; he might go to bed , with his poor little faith in the Promise wrecked , like the freight on there in the dark . She could not sit still and bear the thought ; it was not much easier pacing the aisle . She felt a wild inclination to get off the train and walk home . At the home station , when at last she reached it , she took a carriage . " Drive fast ! " she said , peremptorily . " I 'll pay you double fare . " The houses they rattle past were ablaze with light down-stairs , not up-stairs where little sons would be going to bed . All the little sons had gone to bed . They stopped with a terrific lurch . It threw her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , " she cried , sharply , after a glance without . " No 'm ; we 're stopping fer recreation , " drawled sarcastically the unseen driver . He appeared to be assisting the horse to lie down . She stumbled to the ground and demanded things . " Yer 'll have to ax this here four-legged party what 's doin ' . I did n't stop  --  I kep ' right on goin ' . He laid down on his job , that 's all , marm . I 'll get him up , come Chris'mas . Now then , yer ole fool ! " There was no patience left in the " fare " standing there beside the plunging beast . She fumbled in her purse , found something , dropped it somewhere , and hurried away down the street . She did not walk home , because she ran . It was well the streets were quiet ones . " Has he gone to bed ? " she came panting in upon drowsy Sheelah , startling that phlegmatic person out of an honest Irish dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ? Oh no ! " for she saw him then , an inert little heap at Sheelah 's feet . She gathered him up in her arms . " I wo n't ! I wo n't go , Sheelah ! I 'm waiting . She promis  --  " in drowsy murmur . " She 's here  --  she 's come , Murray ! Mamma 's come home to put you to bed  --  Little Silly , open your eyes and see mamma ! " And he opened them and saw the love in her eyes before he saw her . Sleep took instant wings . He sprang up . " I knew you 'd come ! I told Sheelah ! When anybody promises , they  --  Come on quick up-stairs ! I can unlace myself , but I 'd rather  --  " " Yes , yes ! " she sobbed . " And we 'll have a lark , wo n't we ? You said a lark ; but not the reg'larest kind  --  I do n't suppose we could have the reg'larest kind ? " " Yes  --  yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes shone . He put up his hand , then drew it shyly back . If she would only take out the pins herself  --  if he only dared to  --  " What is it , Little Silly  --  darling ? " They were up in his room . She had her cheek against his little , bare , brown knees . It brought her soft , gold-colored hair so near  --  if he only dared  --  " What is it you 'd like , little son ? " And he took courage . She had never called him Little Son before . It made him brave enough . " I thought  --  the reg'larest kind  --  your hair  --  if you 'd let it tumble all down , I 'd  --  hide in it , " he breathed , his knees against her cheek trembling like little frightened things . It fell about him in a soft shower and he hid in it and laughed . Sheelah heard them laughing together . Chapter IX The Little Lover " I wish I knew for very certain , " the Little Lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , and he had laid his tongue on it one sweet instant , so he knew just how good it tasted . If he only knew for very certain  --  of course there was a chance that She did not love licorice sticks . It would be a regular pity to waste it . Still , how could anybody not love ' em  --  " ' Course She does ! " exclaimed the Little Lover , with sudden conviction , and the struggle was ended . It had only been a question of Her liking or not liking . That decided , there was no further hesitation . He held up the licorice-stick and traced a wavery little line round it with his finger-nail . The line was pretty near one of its ends  --  the end towards the Little Lover 's mouth . " I 'll suck as far down as that , just ' xactly , " he said ; " then I 'll put it away in the Treasury Box . " He sat down in his little rocker and gave himself up to the moment 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dividing-line between Her licorice stick and his . The moment of bliss ended , the Little Lover got out the Treasury Box and added the moist , shortened licorice-stick to the other treasures in it . There were many of them ,  --  an odd assortment that would have made any one else smile . But the Little Lover was not smiling . His small face was grave first , then illumined with the light of willing sacrifice . The treasures were all so beautiful ! She would be so pleased ,  --  my , my , how please She would be ! Of course She would like the big golden alley the best ,  --  the very best . But the singing-top was only a tiny little way behind in its power to charm . Perhaps She had never seen a singing-top  --  think o ' that ! Perhaps She had never had a great golden alley , or a corkscrew jack-knife , or a canary-bird whistle , or a red and white " Kandy Kiss , "  --  or a licorice-stick ! Think o ' that  --  think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She will , " laughed the Little Lover in his delight . If he only dared to give Her the Treasury Box ! If he only knew how ! If there was somebody he could ask ,  --  but the housekeeper was too old , and Uncle Larry would laugh . There was nobody . The waiting would n't be so bad if it was n't for the red-cheeked pear in the Treasury Box , and the softest apple . They made it a little dang'rous to wait . It had not been very long that he had loved Her . The first Sunday that She smiled at him across the aisle was the beginning . He had not gone to sleep that Sunday , nor since , on any of the smiling Sundays . He had not wanted to . It had been rest enough to sit and watch Her from the safe shelter of the housekeeper 's silken cloak . Her clear , fresh profile , Her pretty hair , Her ear , Her throat  --  he liked to watch them all . It was rest enough ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep ! She was very tall , but he liked her better for that . He meant to be tall some day . Just now he did not reach  --  But he did not wish to think of that . It troubled him to remember that Sunday that he had measured himself secretly beside Her , as the people walked out of church . It made him blush to think how very little way he had " reached . " He had never told any one , but then he never told any one anything . Not having any mother , and your father being away all the time , and the housekeeper being old , and your uncle Larry always laughing , made it diff'rent ' bout telling things . Of course if you had ' em  --  mothers , and fathers that stayed at home , and uncles that did n't laugh ,  --  but you did n't . So you ' cided it was better not to tell things . One Sunday the Little Lover thought he detected Uncle Larry watching Her too . But he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned Her beautiful head and smiled across the aisle , it had been at him . The Little Lover was " certain sure " of that ! In his shy little way he had smiled back at Her and nodded . The warmth had kept on in his heart all day . That was the day before he found out the Important Thing . Out in the front hall after supper he came upon a beautiful , tantalizing smell that he failed for some time to locate . He went about with his little nose up-tilted , in a persistent search . It was such a beautiful smell !  --  not powerful and oversweet , but faint and wonderful . The little nose searched on patiently till it found it . There was a long box on the hall-table and the beautiful smell came out under the lid and met the little , up-tilted nose half-way . " I 've found it ! It 's inside o ' that box ! " the Little Lover cried in triumph . " Now I guess I better see what it looks like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , in moist tissue wrappings , lay a cluster of marvellous pale roses , breathing out their subtle sweetness into the little face above them . " Why , I did n't know that was the way a beautiful smell looked ! I  --  it 's very nice , is n't it ? If it 's Uncle Larry 's , I 'm goin ' to ask him  --  Oh , Uncle Larry , can I have it ? Can I ? I want to put it in Her  --  " But he caught himself up before he got quite to " Treasury Box . " He could not tell Uncle Larry about that . The tall figure coming down the hall quickened its steps to a leap towards the opened box on the table . Uncle Larry 's face was flushed , but he laughed  --  he always laughed . " You little ' thafe o ' the wurruld ' ! " he called out . " What are you doing with my roses ? " " I want ' em  --  please , " persisted the child , eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , you do , do you ? But they 're not for the likes o ' you . " Sudden inspiration came to the Little Lover . If this was a Treasury Box ,  --  if he were right on the edge of finding out how you gave one  --  " Is  --  is it for a She ? " he asked , breathless with interest . " A  --  ' She ' ? " laughed Uncle Larry , but something as faint and tender as the beautiful smell was creeping into his face . " Yes , it is for a She , Reggie ,  --  the most beautiful She in the world , " he added , gently . He was wrapping the beautiful smell again in the tissue wrappings . Then it was a Treasury Box . Then you did the treasures up that way , in thin , rattly paper like that . Then what did you do ? But he would find out . " Oh , I did n't know , " he murmured . " I did n't know that was the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , Uncle Larry ,  --  to  --  to Her , you know ? With Her name on ? " Uncle Larry was getting into his overcoat . He laughed . The tender light that had been for an instant in his face he had put away again out of sight . " No ; I 'm my own ' ' spressman . ' You 've got some things to learn , Reg , before you grow up . " " I 'd ravver learn ' em now . Tell me ' em ! Tell what you do then . " The old mocking light was back in Uncle Larry 's eyes . This small chap with the earnest little face was good as a play . " ' Then ' ? Then , sure , I go to the door and ring the bell . Then I kneel on one knee like this , and hold out the box  --  " " The Treasury Box  --  yes , go on . " "  --  Like this . And I say , ' Fair One , accept this humble offering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering , I  --  I beseech thee "  --  the Little Lover was saying it over and over to himself . It was a little hard , on account o ' the queer words in it . He was still saying it after Uncle Larry had gone . His small round face was intent and serious . When he had learned the words , he practised getting down on one knee and holding out an imaginary Treasury Box . That was easier than the queer words , but it made you feel funnier somewhere in your inside . You wanted to cry , and you were a little afraid somebody else would want to laugh . The next afternoon the Little Lover carried his Treasury Box to Her . He had wrapped all the little treasures carefully in tissue like Uncle Larry 's roses . But there was no beautiful smell creeping out ;  --  there was something a little like a smell , but not a beautiful one . The Little Lover felt sorry for that . She came to the door . It was a little discomposing on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . I-it made you feel funny . But the Little Lover acted well his part . With a little gasp that was like a sob he sank on one knee and held up the Treasury Box to Her . " Fair One , " he quivered , softly , " accept this  --  offspring  --  no , I mean this hum-bul offspring , I  --  I  --  oh , I mean please ! " She stooped to the level of his little , solemn face . Then suddenly She lifted him , Treasury Box and all , and bore him into a great , bright room . " Why , Reggie !  --  you are Reggie , are n't you ? You 're the little boy that smiles at me across the aisle in church ? I thought so ! Well , I am so glad you have come to see me . And to think you have brought me a present , too  --  " " I be-seech thee ! " quivered the Little Lover , suddenly remembering the queer words that had eluded him before . He drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had the Treasury Box in her hand . She would open it by-and-by and find the golden alley and the singing-top and the licorice-stick . He wished he dared tell Her to open it soon on account o ' the softest apple and the red-cheeked pear . Perhaps he would dare to after a little while . It was so much easier , so far , than he had expected . She talked to him in Her beautiful , low-toned voice , and by-and-by She sat down to the piano and sang to him . That was the ve-ry best . He curled up on the sofa and listened , watching Her clear profile and Her hair and Her pretty moving fingers , in his Little Lover way . She looked so beautiful !  --  it made you want to put your cheek against Her sleeve and rub it very softly back and forth , back and forth , over and over again . If you only dared to ! So he was very happy until he smelled the beautiful smell again . All at once it crept to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same one that had crept out from under the lid of Uncle Larry 's box . It was there , in the great , bright room ! He slid to his feet and went about tracing it with his little up-tilted nose . It led him across to Her , and then he saw Uncle Larry 's roses on Her breast . He uttered the softest little cry of pain  --  so soft She did not hear it in Her song  --  and crept back to his seat . He had had his first wound . He was only six , but at six it hurts . It was Uncle Larry 's roses She wore on Her dress  --  then it was roses She liked , not licorice-sticks and golden alleys . Then it was Uncle Larry 's roses ,  --  then She must like Uncle Larry . Then  --  oh , then , She would never like him ! Perhaps it was Uncle Larry She had smiled at all the time , across the aisle . Uncle Larry " reached " so far ! He would n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I wanted Her to b'long to me . Nobody else does  --  I would n't have needed anybody else to , if She had . All I needed to b'long was Her . I wanted Her ! I  --  I love Her . She is n't Uncle Larry 's  --  she 's mine !  --  She 's mine ! " The thoughts of the Little Lover surged on turbulently , while the beautiful low song went on . She was singing  --  She was singing to Uncle Larry . The song was n't sweet and soft and tender for him . It was sweet and soft and tender for Uncle Larry . " I hate Uncle Larry ! " cried out the Little Lover , but She did not hear . She was lost in the tender depths of the song . It was very late in the afternoon and a still darkness was creeping into the big , bright room . The Little Lover nestled among the cushions of the sofa , spent with excitement and loss , and that new , dread feeling that made him hate Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was better so . But he knew the pain of it . " Why , Reggie ! Why , you poor little man , you 're asleep ! And I have been sitting there singing all this time ! And it grew quite dark , did n't it ? Oh , poor little man , poor little man , I had forgotten you were here ! I 'm glad you ca n't hear me say it ! " Yes , it was better . But he would have like to feel Her cool cheek against his cheek ; he would have felt a little relief in his desolate , bitter heart if he could see how gentle Her face was and the beautiful look there was in Her soft eyes . But perhaps  --  if She was not looking at him  --  if it was at Uncle Larry  --  No , no , Little Lover ; it is better to sleep on and not to know . It was Uncle Larry who carried him home , asleep still , and laid him gently on his own little bed . Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a star . The tumult of joy in the man 's heart clamored for utterance . Uncle Larry felt the need of telling some one . So , because he could not help it , he leaned down and shook the Little Lover gently . " You little foolish chap , do you know what you have lost ? You were right there  --  you might have heard Her when She said it ! You might have peeped between your fingers and seen Her face  --  angels in Heaven ! Her face !  --  with the love-light in it . You poor little chap ! you poor little chap ! You were right there all the time and you did n't know . And you do n't know now when I tell you I 'm the happiest man alive ! You lie there like a little log . Well , sleep away , little chap . What does it matter to you ? " It was the Little Lover 's own guardian-angel who kept him from waking up , but Uncle Larry did not know . He took off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a strange new tenderness in his big fingers . The familiar little figure seemed to have put on a certain sacredness for having lain on Her cushions and been touched by Her hands . And She had kissed the little chap . Uncle Larry stooped and found the place with his lips . The visit seemed like a dream to the Little Lover , next morning . How could it have been real when he could not remember coming home at all ? He had n't come home ,  --  so of course he had never gone . It was a dream ,  --  still  --  where was the Treasury Box ? " I wish I knew for very certain , " the Little Lover mused . " I could ask Uncle Larry , but I hate Uncle Larry  --  " Oh ! Then it was n't a dream . It was true . It all came back . The Little Lover remembered why he hated Uncle Larry . He remembered it all . Lying there in his little bed he smelt the beautiful smell again and followed it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry 's roses , so he hated Uncle Larry . He always would . He did not hate Her , but he would never go to see Her again . He would never nod or smile at Her again in church . He would never be happy again . Perhaps She would send back the Treasury Box ;  --  the Little Lover had heard once that people sent back things when it was all over . It was all over now . He was only six , but the pain in his heart was so big that he did not think to wish She would send back the Treasury Box soon , on account of the softest apple . The days went by until they made a month ,  --  two months ,  --  half a year . The pain in the Little Lover 's heart softened to a dreary loneliness , but that stayed on . He had always been a lonely little chap , but not like this . He had never had a mother , and his father had nearly always been away . But this was different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated Uncle Larry . That was before the Wonderful Thing happened . One day Uncle Larry brought Her home . He said She was his wife . That was the Wonderful Thing . The Little Lover ran away and hid . They could not find him for a long time . It was She who found him . " Why , Reggie ! Why , poor little man ! Look up . What is it , dear ? Reggie , you are crying ! " He did not care . He wanted to cry . But he let Her take him into Her arms . " I wanted to do it ! " he sobbed , desolately , his secret out at last . " Do it ? Do what , Reggie ? " " M-marry you . I was goin ' to do it . H-He had n't any right to ! I hate him  --  I hate him ! " A minute there was silence , except for the soft creak of Her dress as She rocked him . Then She lifted his wet little face to Hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother do ? " He nestled his cheek against Her sleeve and rubbed it back and forth , back and forth , while he thought . A mother  --  then there would be no more loneliness . Then there would be a place to cuddle in , and somebody to tell things to . " I 'd ravver a mother , " the Little Lover said . Chapter X The Child The Child had it all reasoned out in her own way . It was only lately she had got to the end of her reasoning and settled down . At first it had not been very satisfactory , but she had gradually , with a child 's optimism , evolved from the dreary little maze a certain degree of content . She had only one confidant . The Child had always lived a rather proscribed , uneventful little life , with pitifully few intimates ,  --  none of her own age . The Child was eight . The confidant , oddly , was a picture in the silent , awe-inspiring company-room . It represented a lady with a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child had never heard it called a Madonna , but it was because of that picture that she was never afraid in the company-room . Going in and out so often to confide things to the Lady had bred a familiarity with the silent place that came to amount in the end to friendliness . The Lady was always there , smiling gently at the Child , and so the other things did not matter  --  the silence and the awe-inspiringness . The Child told the Lady everything , standing down under the picture and looking up at it adoringly . She was explaining her conclusions concerning the Greatest Thing of All now . " I did n't tell you before , " she said . " I wanted to get it reasoned out . If , " rather wistfully , " you were a  --  a flesh-and-bloody lady , you could tell me if I have n't got it right . But I think I have . " You see , there are a great many kinds of fathers and mothers , but I 'm only talking of my kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my mother the next . Like this : my mother Monday , my father Tuesday , mother Wednesday , father Thursday  --  right along . Of course you ca n't divide seven days even , but I 'm going to love them both on Sundays . Just one day in the week I do n't think it will do any harm , do you ?  --  Oh , you darling Lady , I wish you could shake your head or bow it ! I 'm only eight , you see , and eight is n't a very reasonable age . But I could n't think of any better way . " The Child 's eyes riveted to the beautiful face almost saw it nod a little . " I have n't decided ' xactly , but perhaps I shall love my mother Sunday mornings and my father Sunday afternoons . If  --  if it seems best to . I 'll let you know . " She stopped talking and thought a minute in her serious little way . She was considering whether to say the next thing or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father and mother . If the Lady knew  --  and she had lived so long in the company-room , it seemed as if she must ,  --  then there was no need of explaining . And if she did n't know  --  suddenly the Child , with a throb of pride , hoped that the Lady did not know . But perhaps some slight explanation was necessary . " Of course , " the Child burst out , hurriedly , her cheeks aflame ,  --  " of course it would be nice to love both of ' em the same day , but  --  but they 're not that kind of a father and mother . I 've thought it all over and made the reasonablest plan I know how to . I 'm going to begin to-morrow  --  to-morrow is Tuesday , my father 's day . " It was cold in the company-room , and any moment Marie might come and take her away . She was always a little pressed for time . " I must be going , " she said , " or Marie will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She always sent her love to the baby in the beautiful Lady 's arms . The Child 's home , though luxurious , had to her the effect of being a double tenement . An invisible partition divided her father 's side from her mother 's ; her own little white room , with Marie 's alcove , seemed to be across the dividing line , part on one side , part on the other . She could remember when there had not been any invisible partition , but the intensity of her little mental life since there had been one had dimmed the beautiful remembrance . It seemed to her now as a pleasant dream that she longed to dream again . The next day the Child loved her father , for it was Tuesday . She went about it in her thorough , conscientious little way . She had made out a little programme . At the top of the sheet , in her clear , upright hand , was , " Ways to Love My farther . " And after that : " 1 . Bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 3 . Rangeing his studdy table . " 4 . Putting flours on " " " 5 . Takeing up His male . " 6 . Reeching up to rub My cheak against his cheak. " 7 . Lerning to read so I can read His Books . " There were many other items . The Child had used three pages for her programme . The last two lines read : " Praing for Him . " Kissing Him goodnight . " The Wednesday programme was almost identical with this one , with the exception of " my mother " instead of " my farther . " For the Child did not wish to be partial . She had always had a secret notion that it would be a little easier to read her mother 's books , but she meant to read just as many of her " farther 's . " During the morning she went in to the Lady and reported progress so far . Her cheeks were a delicate pink with excitement , and she panted a little when she spoke . " I 'm getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautiful face . " Perhaps  --  of course I ca n't tell for sure , but I 'm not certain but that he will like it after he gets used to it . You have to get used to things . He liked the flowers , and when I rubbed my cheek ' gainst his , and when I kissed him . How I know he did is because he smiled  --  I wish my father would smile all the time . " The Child did not leave the room when she had finished her report , but fidgeted about the great silent place uncertainly . She turned back by-and-by to the Lady . " There 's something I wish you could tell me , " she said , with her wistful little face uplifted . " It 's if you think it would be polite to ask my father to put me to bed instead of Marie  --  just unbutton me , you know , and pray me . I was going to ask my mother to-morrow night if my father did to-night . I thought  --  I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be the lovingest way to love him , for you feel a little intimater with persons when they put you to bed . Sometimes I feel that way with Marie  --  a very little . I wish you could nod your head if you thought it would be polite . " The Child 's eyes , fastened upon the picture , were intently serious . And again the Lady seemed to nod . " Oh , you 're nodding , yes !  --  I b'lieve you 're nodding yes ! Thank you ve-ry much  --  now I shall ask him to . Good-bye . Give my love to the baby . " And the little figure moved away sedately . To ask him in the manner of a formal invitation with " yours very truly " in it appeared to the Child upon thoughtful deliberation to be the best way . She did not feel very intimate yet with her father , but of course it might be different after he unbuttoned her and prayed her . Hence the formal invitation : " Dear farther you are respectably invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 7 . Yores very truely Elizabeth . " R s v p . P.s. the little girl is me . " It was all original except the " R s v p " and the fraction . The Child had asked Marie how to write " half , " and the other she had found in the corner of one of her mother 's formal invitations . She did not know what the four letters meant , but they made the invitation look nicer , and she could make lovely capital " R 's . " At lunch-time the Child stole up-stairs and deposited her little folded note on top of her father 's manuscript . Her heart beat strangely fast as she did it . She had still a lurking fear that it might not be polite . On the way back she hurried into the company-room , up to the Lady . " I 've done it ! " she reported , breathlessly . " I hope it was polite  --  oh , I hope he will ! " Illustration : Elizabeth The Child 's father ate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it over . On the opposite side of the table the Child 's mother ate hers silently and a little hastily . It was the usual way of their meals . The few casual things they said had to do with the weather or the salad . Then it was over and they separated , each to his own side of the divided house . The father took up his pen to write  --  it seemed all there was left to do now . But the tiny folded note arrested his hand , and he stared in amazement . The Child had inadvertently set her seal upon it in the form of a little finger-print . So he knew it was hers . The first shock of hope it had awakened subsided into mere curiosity . But when he opened it , when he read it  --  He sat a long time very still indeed  --  so still he could hear the rustle of manuscript pages in the other writing-room across the hall . Perhaps he sat there nearly all the afternoon , for the shadows lengthened before he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him two stood out most clearly  --  the memory of an awful day , when he had seemed to die a thousand deaths , and only come to life when a white-capped nurse came smiling to him and said , " It is a little girl , " and the memory of a day two years ago , when a man and a woman had faced each other and said , " We will try to bear it for the child . " The Child found her answer lying on her plate at nursery tea . Marie , who was bustling about the room getting things orderly for the night , heard a little gasp and turned in alarm . The Child was spelling out her letter with a radiant face that belied the gasp . There was something in the lonely little figure 's eagerness that appealed even to the unemotional maid , and for a moment there was likelihood of a strange thing happening . But the crisis was quickly over , and Marie , with the kiss unkissed on her lips , went on with her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Girl , Who Is You , ' " spelled the Child , in a soft ecstasy , yet not without dread of what might come , supposing he thought she had been impo  --  " ' Dear Little Girl , Who Is You , ' " she hurriedly began again , " ' your farther will be happy to accept your kind invitation for 1/2 past 7 this evening . Will you please call for him , as he is a little  --  b-a-s-h-f-u-l '  --  Marie , what does b-a-s-h-f-u-l spell ? " shrilled the eager voice . It was a new word . Marie came over to the Child 's chair . " How can I tell without I see it ? " she said . But the Child drew away gently . " This is a very intimate letter  --  you 'll have to ' xcuse seeing it . Never mind , anyway , thank you ,  --  I can guess it . " And she guessed that it spelled the way she would feel when she called for her father at half-past seven , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lady so . " I do n't dread it ; I just wish it was over , " she explained . " It makes me feel a little queer , you see . Probably you would n't feel that way if you was better acquainted with a person . Fathers and mothers are kind of strangers . " She was ready at seven o'clock , and sat , a little patient statue , watching the nursery clock . Marie , who had planned to go out and had intended setting the hands of the clock ahead a little , was unwarrantably angry with the Child for sitting there so persistently . " Come , " she said , impatiently ; " I 've got your night-gown ready . This clock 's too slow . " " Truly , is it ? " the Child questioned , anxiously . " Slow means it 's ' most half-past , does n't it ? Then I ought to be going ! " " Yes ,  --  come along ; " but Marie meant to bed , and the Child was already on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to explain to Marie . " I 've engaged somebody  --  there 's somebody else going to put me to bed to-night . You need n't wait , Marie , " she said , her voice oddly subdued and like some other little girl 's voice in her repressed excitement . He was waiting for her . He had been ready since half-past six o'clock . Without a word  --  with only an odd little smile that set the Child at ease  --  he took her hand and went back with her . The door of the other writing-room was ajar , and they caught a glimpse as they went by of a slender , stooping figure . It did not turn . " This is my room , " the Child introduced , gayly . The worst was over now and all the rest was best . " You 've never been in my room before , have you ? This is where I keep my clothes , and this is my undressing-chair . This is where Marie sits  --  you 're Marie to-night ! " The Child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such a funny idea ! She was not a laughing Child , and the little , rippling sound had the effect of escaping from imprisonment and exulting at its freedom . " You never unbuttoned a little girl before , did you ? I 'll have to learn you . " " Teach you , " he corrected , gently . " Marie says learn you . But of course I 'll say ' teach ' if you like it better , " with the ready courtesy of a hostess . " You begin with my feet and go backwards ! " Again the escaped laughter . The Child was happy . Down the hall where the slender figure stooped above the delicately written pages the little laugh travelled again and again . By-and-by another laugh , deep and rich , came hand in hand with it . Then the figure straightened tensely , for this new laugh was rarer even than the Child 's . Two years  --  two years and more since she had heard this one . " Now it is time to pray me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie lets me kneel to her  --  " hesitating questioningly . Then : " It 's pleasanter to kneel to somebody  --  " " Kneel to me , " he whispered . His face grew a little white , and his hand , when he caressed lightly the frolic-rumpled little head , was not steady . The stone mask of the man dropped off completely , and underneath was tenderness and pain and love . " Now I lame me down to sleep  --  no , I want to say another one to-night , Lord God , if Thee please . This is a very particular night , because my father is in it . Bless my father , Lord God , oh , bless my father ! This is his day . I 've loved him all day , and I 'm going to again day after to-morrow . But to-morrow I must love my mother . It would be easier to love them both forever and ever , Amen . " The Child slipped into bed and slept happily , but the man who was father of the Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found he had not thought nearly all of them in his afternoon vigil . On his way back to his lonely study he walked a little slower past the other lonely study . The stooping of the slender figure newly troubled him . The plan worked satisfactorily to the Child , though there was always the danger of getting the days mixed . The first mother-day had been as " intimate " and delightful as the first father-one . They followed each other intimately and delightfully in a long succession . Marie found her perfunctory services less and less in requisition , and her dazed comprehension of things was divided equally with her self-gratulation . Life in this new and unexpected condition of affairs was easier to Marie . " I 'm having a beautiful time , " the Child one day reported to the Lady , " only sometimes I get a little dizzy trying to remember which is which . My father is which to-day . " And it was at that bedtime , after an unusually active day , that the Child fell asleep at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her delicate neck , till it rested sidewise on the supporting knees , and the Child was asleep . There was a slight stir in the doorway . " ' Sh ! do n't move  --  sit perfectly still ! " came in a whisper as a slender figure moved forward softly into the room . " Richard , do n't move ! The poor little tired thing  --  do you think you could slip out without moving while I hold up her head  --  oh , I mean without joggling ? Now  --  oh , mamma 's little tired baby ! There , there !  --  ' Sh ! Now you hold her head and let me sit down  --  now put her here in my arms , Richard . " The transfer was safely made . They faced each other , she with her baby , he standing looking down at them . Their eyes met steadily . The Child 's regular breathing alone stirred the silence of the little white room . Then he stooped to kiss the Child 's face as she stooped , and their kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but smiled instead . " I want her every day , Richard ! " she said . " I want her every day , Mary ! " " Then there is only one way . Last night she prayed to have things changed round  --  " " Yes , Polly ? " " We 'll change things round , Dick . " The Child was smiling in her sleep as if she heard them . Chapter XI The Recompense There were all kinds of words ,  --  short ones and long ones . Some were very long . This one  --  we-ell , maybe it was n't so long , for when you 're nine you do n't of course mind three-story words , and this one looked like a three-story one . But this one puzzled you the worst ever ! Morry spelled it through again , searching for light . But it was a very dark word . Rec-om-pense ,  --  if it meant anything money-y , then they 'd made a mistake , for of course you do n't spell " pence " with an " s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stand up to look up things in it ,  --  Morry wished it was not so far away and that you could do it sitting down . He sank back wearily on his cushions and wished other things , too : That Ellen would come in , but that was n't a very big wish , because Ellens are n't any good at looking up words . That dictionaries grew on your side o ' the room ,  --  that wish was a funny one ! That Dadsy would come home  --  oh , oh , that Dadsy would come home ! With that wish , which was a very Big One indeed , came trooping back all Morry 's Troubles . They stood round his easy-chair and pressed up close against him . He hugged the most intimate ones to his little , thin breast . It was getting twilight in the great , beautiful room , and twilight was trouble-time . Morry had found that out long ago . It 's when it 's too dark to read and too light for Ellens to come and light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your troubles . They 're always there waiting . If Dadsy had n't gone away to do  --  that . If he 'd just gone on reg'lar business , or on a hurry-trip across the ocean , or something like that . You could count the days and learn pieces to surprise him with when he got back , and keep saying , " Wo n't it be splendid ! " But this time  --  well , this time it scared you to have Dadsy come home . And if you learned a hundred pieces you knew you 'd never say ' em to him  --  now . And you kept saying , " Wo n't it be puffectly dreadful ! " " Wo n't you have the lamps lit , Master Morris ? " It was Ellen 's voice , but the Troubles were all talking at once , and much as ever he could hear it . " I knew you were n't asleep because your chair creaked , so I says , ' I guess we 'll light up , '  --  it 's enough sight cheerier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came through the gloom and frightened away the Troubles . " Thank you , " Morry said , politely . It 's easy enough to remember to be polite when you have so much time . " Now I 'd like Jolly ,  --  you guess he 's got home now , do n't you ? " Ellen 's steps sounded a little thuddier as they tramped back down the hall . " It 's a good thing there 's going to be a Her here to send that common boy kiting ! " she was thinking . Yet his patches were all Ellen  --  so far  --  had seen in Jolly to find fault with . Though , for that matter , in a house beautiful like this patches were , goodness knew , out of place enough ! " Hully Gee , ai n't it nice an ' light in here ! " presently exclaimed a boy 's voice from the doorway . " Oh , I 'm so glad you 've come , Jolly ! Come right in and take a chair ,  --  take two chairs ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was always great when Jolly came ! He and the Troubles were not acquainted ; they were never in the room at the same time . Morry 's admiration of this small bepatched , befreckled , besmiled being had begun with his legs , which was not strange , they were such puffectly straight , limber , splendid legs and could go  --  my ! Legs like that were great ! But it was noticeable that the legs were in some curious manner telescoped up out of sight , once Jolly was seated . The phenomenon was of common occurrence ,  --  they were always telescoped then . And nothing had ever been said between the two boys about legs . About arms , yes , and eyes , ears , noses ,  --  never legs . If Morry understood the kind little device to save his feelings , an instinctive knowledge that any expression of gratitude would embarrass Jolly must have kept back his ready little thank you . " Can you hunt up things ? " demanded the small host with rather startling energy . He was commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word  --  " But Jolly had caught up his cap , untelescoped the kind little legs , and was already at the door . Nothing pleased him more than a commission from the Little White Feller in the soft chair there . " I 'll go hunt ,  --  where 'd I be most likely to find him ? " The Little White Feller rarely laughed , but now  --  " You  --  you Jolly boy ! " he choked , " you 'll find him under a hay-stack fast aslee  --  No , no ! " suddenly grave and solicitous of the other 's feelings , " in the dictionary , I mean . Words , do n't you know ? " " Oh , get out ! " grinned the Jolly boy , in glee at having made the Little White Feller laugh out like that , reg'lar-built . " Hand him over , then , but you 'll have to do the spellin ' . " " Rec-om-pense ,  --  p-e-n-s-e , " Morry said , slowly , " I found it in a magazine ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Look up ' rec , ' Jolly ,  --  I mean , please . " Dictionaries are terrible books . Jolly had never dreamed there were so many words in the world ,  --  pages and pages and pages of ' em ! The prospect of ever finding one particular word was disheartening , but he plunged in sturdily , determination written on every freckle . " Do n't begin at the first page ! " cried Morry , hastily . " Begin at R ,  --  it 's more than half-way through . R-e ,  --  r-e-c ,  --  that way . " Jolly turned over endless pages , trailed laboriously his little , blunt finger up and down endless columns , wet his lips with the red tip of his tongue endless times ,  --  wished ' t was over . He had meant to begin at the beginning and keep on till he got to a w-r-e-c-k ,  --  at Number Seven they spelled it that way . Had n't he lost a mark for spelling it without a " w " ? But of course if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blunt finger leaped into space and waved triumphantly . " R-e-c-k ,  --  I got him ! " " Not ' k , '  --  there is n't any ' k . ' Go backwards till you drop it , Jolly ,  --  you dropped it ? " Dictionaries are terrible ,  --  still , leaving a letter off o ' the end is n't as bad as off o ' the front . Jolly retraced his steps patiently . " I 've dropped it , " he announced in time . Morry was breathing hard , too . Looking up words with other people 's fore-fingers is pretty tough . " Now , the second story ,  --  ' rec ' is the first , " he explained . " You must find ' rec-om ' now , you know . " No , Jolly did not know , but he went back to the work undaunted . " We 'll tree him , " he said , cheerily , " but I think I could do it easier if I whistled "  --  " Whistle , " Morry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more wetting of lips and tireless trailing of small , blunt finger , and then  --  eureka ! there you were ! But eureka was not what Jolly said . " Bully for us ! " he shouted . He felt thrilly with pride of conquest . " It 's easy enough finding things . What 's the matter with dictionaries ! " " Now read what it means , Jolly ,  --  I mean , please . Do n't skip . " " ' Rec-om-pense : An equi-va-lent received or re-turned for anything given , done , or suff-er-ed ; comp-ens-a-tion . ' " " That all ?  --  every speck ? " " Well , here 's another one that says ' To make a-mends , ' if you like that one any better . Sounds like praying . " " Oh , " sighed Morry , " how I 'd like to know what equi-valent means ! " but he did not ask the other to look it up . He sank back on his pillows and reasoned things out for himself the best way he could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up . To make up for something given or suffered ,  --  perhaps that was what a Rec-om-pense was . For something given or suffered  --  like legs , maybe ? Limp , no-good-legs that would n't go ? Could there be a Rec-om-pense for those ? Could anything ever " make up " ? " Supposing you had n't any legs , Jolly ,  --  that would go ? " he said , aloud , with disquieting suddenness . Jolly started , but nodded comprehendingly . He had not had any legs for a good many minutes ; the telescoping process is numbing in the extreme . " Do you think anything could ever Rec-om-pense  --  make up , you know ? Especially if you suffered ? Please do n't speak up quick ,  --  think , Jolly . " " I 'm a-thinkin ' . " Not to have ' em that would go ,  --  not go ! Never to kite after Dennis O'Toole 's ice-wagon an ' hang on behind ,  --  nor see who 'd get to the corner first ,  --  nor stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sirree ! " ejaculated Jolly , with unction , " nothin ' . " " Would ever make up , you mean ? " Morry sighed . He had known all the time , of course what the answer would be . " Yep ,  --  nothin ' could . " " I thought so . That 's all ,  --  I mean , thank you . Oh yes , there 's one other thing ,  --  I 've been saving it up . Did you ever hear of a  --  of a step-mother , Jolly ? I just thought I 'd ask . " The result was surprising . The telescoped legs came to view jerkily , but with haste . Jolly stumbled to his feet . " I better be a-goin ' , " he muttered , thinking of empty chip-baskets , empty water-pails , undone errands ,  --  a switch on two nails behind the kitchen door . " Oh , wait a minute ,  --  did you ever hear of one , Jolly ? " " You bet , " gloomily , " I got one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Then , " rather timidly , " perhaps  --  I wish you 'd tell me what they 're like . " " Like nothin ' ! Nobody likes ' em , " came with more gloom yet from the boy with legs . " Oh ! " It was almost a cry from the boy without . This was terrible . This was a great deal terribler than he had expected . " Would one be angry if  --  if your legs would n't go ? Would it make her very , do you think ? " Still thinking of empty things that ought to have been filled , Jolly nodded emphatically . " Oh ! " The terror grew . " Then one  --  then she  --  would n't be  --  be glad to see anybody , I suppose , whose legs had never been ?  --  would n't want to shake hands or anything , I suppose ?  --  nor be in the same room ? " " Nope . " One 's legs may be kind even to the verge of agony , but how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was busy with his own anticipated woes ; he did not know he was unkind . " That 's all ,  --  thank you , I mean , " came wearily , hopelessly , from the pillows . But Morry called the other back before he got over the threshold . There was another thing upon which he craved enlightenment . It might possibly help out . " Are they pretty , Jolly ? " he asked , wistfully . " Are who what ? " repeated the boy on the threshold , puzzled . Guilt and apprehension dull one 's wits . " Step-ones ,  --  mothers . " Pretty ? When they were lean and sharp and shabby ! When they kept switches on two nails behind the door ,  --  when they wore ugly clothes pinned together ! But Jolly 's eye caught the wistfulness on Morry 's little , peaked , white face , and a lie was born within him at the sight . In a flash he understood things . Pity came to the front and braced itself stalwartly . " You bet they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Prettier'n anythin ' ! You 'd oughter see mine ! " ( Recording Angel , make a note of it , when you jot this down , that the little face across the room was intense with wistfulness , and Jolly was looking straight that way . And remember legs . ) When Ellen came in to put Morry to bed she found wet spots on his cushions , but she did not mention them . Ellens can be wise . She only handled the limp little figure rather more gently than usual , and said rather more cheery things , perhaps . Perhaps that was why the small fellow under her hands decided to appeal in his desperation to her . It was possible  --  things were always possible  --  that Ellen might know something of  --  of step-ones . For Morry was battling with the pitifully unsatisfactory information Jolly had given him before understanding had conceived the kind little lie . It was , of course ,  --  Morry put it that way because " of course " sometimes comforts you ,  --  of course just possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of there being another kind . So , under the skilful , gentle hands , the boy looked up and chanced it . " Ellen , " he said  --  " Ellen , are they all that kind ,  --  all of ' em ? Jolly 's kind , I mean ? I thought poss'bly you might know one "  --  " Heart alive ! " breathed Ellen , in fear of his sanity . She felt his temples and his wrists and his limp little body . Was he going to be sick now , just as his father and She were coming home ?  --  now , of all times ! Which would be better to give him , quinine , or aconite and belladonna ? " Never mind , " sighed Morry , hopelessly . Ellens  --  he might have known  --  were not made to tell you close things like that . They were made to undress you and give you doses and laugh and wheel your chair around . Jollys were better than Ellens , but they told you pretty hard things sometimes . In bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself for what was to come . He pondered over the word Jolly had looked up in the dictionary for him . It was a puzzly word ,  --  Rec-om-pense ,  --  but he thought he understood it now . It meant something that made up to you for something you 'd suffered ,  --  " suffered , " that was what it said . And Morry had suffered  --  oh , how ! Could it be possible there was anything that would make up for little , limp , sorrowful legs that had never been ? With the fickleness of night-thoughts his musings flitted back to step-ones again . He shut his eyes and tried to imagine just the right kind of one ,  --  the kind a boy would be glad to have come home with his Dadsy . It looked an easy thing to do , but there were limitations . " If I 'd ever had a real one , it would be easier , " Morry thought wistfully . Of course , any amount easier ! The mothers you read about and the Holy Ones you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you needed was to have had one of your own . Then ,  --  Morry 's eyes closed in a dizzy little vision of one of his own . One that would have dressed and undressed you instead of an Ellen ,  --  that would have moved your chair about and beaten up the cushions ,  --  one that maybe would have loved you , legs and all ! Why !  --  why , that was the kind of a step-one a boy 'd like to have come home with his father ! That was the very kind ! While you 'd been lying there thinking you could n't imagine one , you 'd imagined ! And it was easy ! The step-one a boy would like to have come home with his father seemed to materialize out of the dim , soft haze from the shaded night-lamp ,  --  seemed to creep out of the farther shadows and come and stand beside the bed , under the ring of light on the ceiling that made a halo for its head . The room seemed suddenly full of its gracious presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to come . And in a reg'lar mother-voice it began to speak . Morry lay as if in a wondrous dream and listened . " Are you the dear little boy whose legs wo n't go ? " He gasped a little , for he had n't thought of there being a " dear . " He had to swallow twice before he could answer . Then :  --  " Oh yes 'm , thank you , " he managed to say . " They 're under the bedclothes . " " Then I 've come to the right place . Do you know  --  guess !  --  who I am ? " " Are  --  are you a step-one ? " breathing hard . " Why , you 've guessed the first time ! " the Gracious One laughed . " Not  --  not the one , I s'pose ? " It frightened him to say it . But the Gracious One laughed again . " The one , yes , you Dear Little Boy Whose Legs Wo n't Go ! I thought I heard you calling me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To think of that ! " Guess , you Dear Little Boy ! What would you like it to be ? " Oh , if he only dared ! He swallowed to get up courage . Then he ventured timidly . " A Rec-om-pense . " It was out . " Oh , you Guesser  --  you little Guesser ! You 've guessed the second time ! " Was that what it was like ? Something you could n't see at all , just feel ,  --  that folded you in like a warm shawl ,  --  that brushed your forehead , your cheek , your mouth ,  --  that made you dizzy with happiness ? You lay folded up in it and knew that it made up . Never mind about the sorrowful , limp legs under the bedclothes . They seemed so far away that you almost forgot about them . They might have been somebody else 's , while you lay in the warm , sweet Rec-om-pense . " Will  --  will it last ? " he breathed . " Always , Morry . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know this kind ,  --  we never s'posed there was a kind like this ! Real Ones must be like this . " And while he lay in the warm shawl , in the soft haze of the night-lamp , he seemed to fall asleep , and , before he knew , it was morning . Ellen had come . " Up with you , Master Morris ! There 's great doings to-day . Have you forgot who 's coming ? " Ellens are stupid . " She 's come . " But Ellen did not hear , and went on getting the bath ready . If she had heard , it would only have meant quinine or aconite and belladonna to drive away feverishness . For Ellens are very watchful . " They 'll be here most as soon as I can get you up ' n ' dressed . I 'm going to wheel you to the front winder  --  " " No ! " Morry cried , sharply ; " I mean , thank you , no . I 'd rather be by the back window where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , freckled , familiar Jolly ,  --  he needed something freckled and homely and familiar . The old dread had come back in the wake of the beautiful dream ,  --  for it had been a dream . Ellen had waked him up . A boy would like to have his father come home in the sunshine , and the sun was shining . They would come walking up the path to the front-door through it ,  --  with it warm and welcoming on their faces . But it would only be Dadsy and a step-one ,  --  Jolly 's kind , most likely . Jolly 's kind was pretty ,  --  she might be pretty . But she would not come smiling and creeping out of the dark with a halo over her head . That kind came in dreams . Jolly 's whistle was comforting to hear . Morry leaned out of his cushions to wave his hand . Jolly was going to school ; when he came whistling back , she would be here . It would be all over . Morry leaned back again and closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did the hardest thinking ,  --  and this was the very hardest . Sometimes he forgot to open them , and dropped asleep . Even in the morning one can be pretty tired . " Is this the Dear Little Boy ? " He heard distinctly , but he did not open his eyes . He had learned that opening your eyes drives beautiful things away . The dream had come back . If he kept perfectly still and did n't breathe , it might all begin again . He might feel  --  He felt it . It folded him in like a warm shawl ,  --  it brushed his forehead , his cheek , his lips ,  --  it made him dizzy with happiness . He lay among his cushions , folded up in it . Oh , it made up ,  --  it made up , just as it had in the other dream ! " You Dear Little Boy Whose Legs Wo n't Go ! "  --  he did not catch anything but the first four words ; he must have breathed and lost the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask her if she had brought the Rec-om-pense , but it was such a risk to speak . He thought if he kept on lying quite still he should find out . Perhaps in a minute  --  " You think he will let me love him , Morris ? Say you think he will ! " Morris was Dadsy 's other name . Things were getting very strange . " Because I must ! Perhaps it will make up a very little if I fold him all up in my love . " " Fold him up "  --  that was what the warm shawl had done , and the name of the warm shawl had been Rec-om-pense . Was there another name to it ? Morry opened his eyes and gazed up wonderingly into the face of the step-one.  --  It was a Real One 's face , and the other name was written on it . " Why , it 's Love ! " breathed Morry . He felt a little dizzy , but he wanted to laugh , he was so happy . He wanted to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , it makes up ! " he cried , softly .
