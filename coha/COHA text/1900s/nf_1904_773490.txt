txt HEALTH , STRENGTH , AND POWER muscles on the back of the neck gradually lose their tone and stretch out as does a piece of elastic cord that is supporting a weight continuously . This stretching of the muscles that usually support the head in an upright position allows the head to droop or incline forward , and unless the muscles regain their tonicity through appropriate exercise , the defect of a " drooping head " is likely to become a permanent one . This special defect may easily be overcome by systematically practising any vigorous exercise that draws the head upward and backward repeatedly , followed by brief intervals of rest . One very good exercise for this purpose is to recline upon the floor , face downward , and raise the head upward as far as possible . There are many others . It will be observed that in this case the attention is devoted to one part of the body , that of the head , and all of the energy is concentrated upon getting it upward and backward . This is the essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essentially local . Upon further observation , however , it will be found almost impossible to produce strictly local results without the cooperation of other parts . For instance , getting the head back to its normal position , after it has become drooped , implies the gradual stretching of the muscles of the front of the neck , chest , and abdomen , and the gentle toning up of the muscles of the spine , buttocks , and back of the thighs and legs . HEALTH , STRENGTH , AND POWER Similar cooperative or concordant changes in other parts of the body would accompany the correction of any other local defect or deformity . The body is so well poised upon a pillar of separate bones , that anything that disturbs the balance or equilibrium of one part disturbs the equilibrium of all other parts , and a new adjustment of the different proportions of the body has to be made . So firmly have I become convinced of this fact , and the tendency of the body under normal conditions to assume its normal shape , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemented by an all-round development of the entire muscular system . This all-round development may best be attained without apparatus by throwing the body into such attitudes as require great general effort of the muscles of the trunk and limbs to get into , get out of , or sustain . With the human body , as with any material body , the nearer it gets to a horizontal position , the more difficult it is to get it into a vertical position again . The parts of the body used and the number and variety of the muscles engaged depend , of course , upon the positions assumed , while the speed and energy with which the attempts to get into and out of these different positions are made , measures the intensity of the exercise . In most free exercises the limbs are used for weights or resistance . In a man weighing 150 pounds , the arms usually weigh about ten pounds each , and the legs twenty pounds . Where the arms and legs are used // separately , much may be done to develop their by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving sole attention to the parts to be developed . The principal objection to this method of development is , that the results attained are not only largely local , but inevitably tend to remain so . The only way to develop muscle is to increase its nourishment by sending more blood to it . This is the chief object of bringing a muscle into action and concentrating the mind and energy upon it . But the heart is the principal organ involved in sending an increased supply of blood to a part after the lungs and stomach have contributed their life-giving properties . Though it is possible , therefore , for a man to attain a good general development by developing one part at a time , the strength acquired through this method is often local rather than general or constitutional . A person who has acquired his general development in this way is very much in the same condition as a factory which is supplied with a great many different machines of greater or less capacity . Under ordinary circumstances only a few of these machines are used at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed to meet the demands of these few machines . If the occasion ever arises for using a larger number of these machines at the same time , the power of each one will of course be greatly lessened , and consequently the working capacity of each machine will be greatly reduced . So with the locally developed man ; if he ever wants // to run , row , swim , or engage in any exercise calling for the use of a great many muscles at the same time , he will find the power of each group of these muscles very much reduced . Although exercises requiring the use of but few muscles at a time may be advisable in case of a weak heart or weak lungs in a debilitated person , they are not the exercises that are most advisable to practise where the aim is to strengthen and invigorate these important organs . This brings us at once to the consideration of the kind of exercises that are necessary to practise in order to cultivate organic vigour . By organic vigour I mean the vigour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissues necessary to meet the vital demands of the whole system . When we use a few muscles at a time , as in moving a single part of the body , as an arm or leg , it is possible to make so much exertion with these muscles as to exhaust them completely . On the other hand , if the whole body is engaged in the effort , the respiration and circulation will be so much increased that we shall be much " distressed for breath " and have to stop long before we can bring about the exhaustion of the muscles . The power to continue the general effort for a long time , or until complete exhaustion follows , may be termed organic vigour . This may be cultivated to some extent by practising exercises which , though requiring the use of comparatively few groups of muscles , may be done so rapidly , // energetically , and persistently as to bring the heart , and lungs into great activity , as bicycling , dancing , etc . Even in these exercises great speed and prolonged activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used ordinarily , and increase of speed and long continuance of effort also tend to bring greater strain on the nervous system . Generally the more muscles and tissues involved in the exercise , the greater the action of the heart . The best exercises , therefore , for invigorating the heart and lungs and improving the entire organism , are those that bring large groups of muscles into action , like rowing , running , swimming , etc . If these exercises are done slowly , and according to a certain rhythm , for a considerable time , the results are most favourable . The heart , though at first quickened by these exercises , is eventually made to beat more slowly , regularly and powerfully , and is less disturbed by any sudden and unexpected call upon it . The practice of gymnastics and the concentrated form of free exercises tend largely to the development of muscular power ; while the practice of athletics , especially running , rowing , swimming , etc. , tends rather to the cultivation of respiratory and circulatory power . What is needed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and athletics . Many of the exercises selected for this book have been chosen for the purpose of cultivating organic vigour and good staying power , as well as muscular strength . // The waves of popular enthusiasm for muscular development that have swept over the country during the past few years have induced some overzealous persons to advocate strongly certain " quick and ready methods " of attaining the desired result . The method which has been most extensively advertised , and which has received the most attention , is that which advises the concentration of the will upon the muscles to be developed , and the simultaneous resistance of the muscles opposed to their contraction . To use a familiar phrase , what is true about this method is not new , and what is new is not true . Every schoolboy is familiar with the fact that , by concentrating the mind upon the biceps and slowly flexing the forearm toward the shoulder , the biceps muscle becomes larger and firmer than when it is in a passive state . Apply this principle to the other muscles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the essence of the concentration theory in a nutshell . Now if you will place the fingers of your left hand on the biceps of your right arm , and the thumb on the triceps or back of the arm , and flex the forearm , while trying to keep the whole arm as stiff and rigid as possible , you will be conscious of two facts . First , the muscles on the back of the arm will be hard and tense , as well as those on the front of the arm , and secondly the whole arm will be more or less immobile . If two forces act upon a body , one pulling one way and the other in the opposite direction , the body will move slowly and reluctantly toward the force which is the 35 HEALTH , STRENGTH , AND POWER . stronger . If the forces exactly balance each other , the body will not move at all . There is no doubt that , by concentrating the mind upon a group of muscles , during their action , the blood may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus tend to improve their nutrition and development . So standing in front of a looking-glass , and becoming for the time being a devoted admirer of one 's own physique , will through some psychic influence help to the realization of the desired object . By repeatedly contracting and relaxing the different muscles of the body , while under the influence of this psychic stimulus , a more direct communication between brain and muscles seems to be established , and as a preliminary introduction to other exercises , this method is unobjectionable . But when one devotes too much time and attention to these self-centred movements , he is likely to become , if not vain and egotistical , extremely conscious of his many muscles , and this very consciousness , when he attempts to effect something outside of himself , may lead to his embarrassment . It is very difficult to concentrate the attention upon more than one group of muscles at a time , yet the practice of fencing , boxing , tennis , and many skilled sports requiring mental alertness , brings many groups of muscles into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic sports , the mind must be given directly to the goal to be won , or the thing to be achieved . Any attention given to the // muscles engaged in the separate movements would be a hindrance instead of an assistance . Concentrate the attention upon the muscles of the right arm and shoulder and try to throw a ball at a target , and see what the result is . If the preliminary practice has called for the contraction of antagonistic muscles , as a means of resistance , the arm and shoulder will feel very much as though they were bound with straps or cords , that make freedom of movement very difficult . This is what is sometimes termed being " muscle bound , " and unfits one for the practice of any skilled sport . The contraction of antagonistic muscles makes one stiff , staunch , and strong , but it is not the kind of strength that is serviceable . In competitive games one so trained spends much of his energy in competing with himself , as it were . In training men for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentials is to teach them to relax , , and not to contract antagonistic muscles . Many of the exercises introduced in this book are especially designed to cultivate the power of externalizing oneself , as it were , and of throwing all of one 's strength and purpose into the work to be done . By this method of exercising , the action of the different muscles will follow each other in regular sequence , and an ease and grace of movement will be acquired that will readily be appreciated . Although the specific thing to be done is largely imaginary , the effort to do it may be real , and the selfdiscipline acquired by holding oneself down to a steady line of physical work of this kind is of the utmost value . 37 CHAPTER VI . THE PHYSICAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN No one who has had the care of children will question the difficulty of trying to keep them still . From the earliest infancy , there is an almost uncontrollable desire for movement . Watch an infant in his crib when freed from the restraints of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes out with his arms , and clutches with hands and feet at every object that comes within his reach . Moreover , every movement seems to give hint pleasure . There is joy in action for the sake of action . As he grows a little stronger , and begins to creep and roll about , he experiences a new pleasure from the exercise of the muscles , ? the pleasure of handling objects and moving himself from place to place . When he begins to stand on his feet and balance himself in the erect position , and then to walk and meet obstacles , and overcome resistance , a new pleasure accompanies every new effort . This is true of the development of every new form of movement , and the exercise of every kind of power , such as running , throwing , catching , etc. , in which children // show so much delight . The aimless and almost incessant movements of the child are his ways of taking exercise . Nature prompts him to make these varied movements of head , trunk , and limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is nature 's first efforts toward free muscular development , and they should not be thwarted or opposed . On the other hand , we should do everything we can to favour and encourage these spontaneous movements of the child . See that the limbs have free play , and that no bodily movement is hindered by tight clothing . Long frocks or petticoats should never be worn by children . They impede the action of the lower limbs , and often cause defects and mannerisms in the gait that last through life . A suit made on the plan of a union garment , or little overalls and suspenders , are much better for a knockabout suit for either sex to play in . In children , the legs do not develop as soon as the arms , and care should be taken not to overwork the lower limbs , for fear of causing bow-legs or knock-knees . Children can stand a great deal of activity if they have a frequent change in the variety of exercise , and frequent intervals of rest . The practice of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , is pernicious . Children 's legs are much shorter than adults , and in order to keep pace with them , they have to take very long steps or quicken their gait into a run . This effort not only causes great muscular fatigue , but sometimes is // the origin of a heart strain , which may incapacitate the child for any further efforts . Up to ten years of age , a child 's bones are very plastic , and they are susceptible of being moulded into almost any shape . For this reason , parents should frequently see their children naked , or have them examined by an expert , in order to discover whether they are growing and developing properly in trunk and limbs . Great care should be taken to see that the stockings are not suspended by straps from the shoulder-girdle , as this practice tends to droop the shoulders and curve the spine . Care , also , should be taken to see that the school seat and desk are not too high or too low , but perfectly adjusted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat is too high , the child 's thighs will be bent forward , and the circulation of the blood in the legs and feet will be impeded . If the desk is too low the child will become round-shouldered ; if the desk is too high , one shoulder will grow higher than the other , or the spine will be curved and twisted . For the same reasons , great care should be taken in the selection of rocking-horses , ponies , bicycles , carts , sleds , skates , shoes , and even lounges and beds . Everything a child makes use of he tries to adapt himself to . Therefore , if saddles for riding-horses , ponies , or bicycles are too broad , or if stirrups , handle-bars , etc. , are not properly adjusted , or if beds are too soft , pillows too high , shoes too short or too long , with soles too thick , etc. , // we have some of the factors at work which are moulding , silently but surely , the bow-legs , knock-knees , drooping heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and defective walk and carriage , with which those of us who examine children and adults are far too familiar . Habitual postures , like habitual actions , make us what we are in form and figure . In fact , all postures are the results of sustained muscular action , in which some groups of muscles are kept continually on the stretch , and other groups in a state of mild contraction . If you wish to know what this means , take a seat in the front row of a gallery , or in some place where the seats are placed so near together that it is impossible for you to straighten your legs . How the knees will ache , and also muscles on the front of the thighs that have been kept so long on the stretch . A change of position that will enable you to straighten your legs for a minute will bring you almost immediate relief . This is only a single illustration . Every posture long sustained causes aching muscles , and a change of position is the only way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adult to sit still than it is to move about . When a child shifts his sitting position , stretches his arms or legs , and leans and lolls about on his desk , lie is often seeking rest for muscles that have been kept too long under tension . If the seat is made too comfortable , or the stooping or leaning position is too long and repeatedly maintained , the overstretched muscles lose // their tonicity and an ill formation or permanent defect soon becomes established . The only relief is frequent change of position , and the practice of developing movements and corrective exercises . I have dwelt at some length upon the plastic condition of children , because it renders them so susceptible of injury as well as improvement . Nothing is more likely to injure them physically than frequent and persistent confinement to school seats and benches . Nothing is more likely to improve them than frequent change of position , and the widest range of movement . Up to ten years of age , an active child usually finds his best exercise in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down , " " Ring Around a Rosy , " " King , King , Calico , " " Prisoners ' Base , " " One Old Cat , " and the various forms of " tag . " But it is an error to suppose that all children will play even when an opportunity is offered them . Many children seem to be born without the playing impulse . If left alone with other children , they are crowded out of the game , and seem to be contented in seeing other boys play . Such children often need to be incited to make efforts for themselves . Some one always has to take the initiative for them . Children are very fond of imitating the efforts of older persons , and at a very early age they aspire to be men , and introduce into their childish plays and games many of the forms of activity that chiefly concern men . Children are also very fond of imitating different animals // and various kinds of machines . By taking advantage of this keen faculty for imitating the employments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce children to follow her through a very valuable series of exercises for strengthening , developing and corrective purposes . Some of these exercises are described in the text and illustrations under the names " Wood Chopping , " " Scooping Sand , " " Diving , " " Steamboat , " " Teamsters ' Warming , " " Locomotive , " " Chicken Wings , " " Hand Fire-Engine " " Jumping Jack , " " Charge Bayonets , " " Throwing Ball , " " Hurrah , " and the like . These exercises are especially designed to bring into action the large surface muscles of the trunk and limbs rather than the smaller and finer muscles of the hands , arms , and feet , which , for the benefit of the child 's nervous system , may better be developed later . If the parent or teacher will lead up to these valuable , exercises through some sort of dialogue or story that will appeal to the imagination and suggest plenty of action , such as going on a journey or a picnic , where different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the . interest of the child greatly intensified . Not only will the child enter into the exercises with the keenest enjoyment , but the exercises themselves will prove much more beneficial . In giving exercises to children , remember that the one thing they can not stand is continuous tension and mo- // notony . This is what makes walking , standing , and all attitudinizing and slow-moving exercises so wearisome to children . Give them short , quick , lively exercises , with frequent changes and plenty of rest . It matters not how interesting or amusing the exercise , game , or play is , the child soon wants to " play something else . " The following list , which may be best given in the order enumerated , are very good exercises for children , both from the standpoint of interest and development . figure 44 CHAPTER VII . EXERCISES FOR BOYHOOD AND YOUTH AFTER a boy arrives at the age of ten or twelve years , he will begin to forsake what he terms childish plays and take to something more serious . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running , jumping , boxing , swimming , skating , the popular games , such as baseball , football , hockey , and various forms of heavy gymnastics . He wants to do something to assert his individuality . He feels that he is becoming a man , and desires to show his skill , strength , and courage in doing manly things . He delights in the approval of his mates , and likes to excel in the feats and " stunts " that demand their admiration . In becoming the fastest runner or the highest jumper in his neighbourhood , he is lifted out of the crowd and singled out for distinction . This recognition often makes him ambitious to prove his abilities in other sports . He feels the growing instinct for companionship , and , having won distinction for himself , he wants to join a club or team where he can show his prowess in winning distinction for others . He // wants an opportunity to " play his part , " " hold up his end , " " pull his oar , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of his services to the club or community of which he is a member . It is expected that every healthy boy will learn to run , jump , row , swim , skate , box , fence , and wrestle as a means of self-culture and individual accomplishment . It is very difficult for a boy who can not do these things to get any line upon his own abilities , or get any rating among his mates . As I have stated in a previous chapter , it was only by indulging in such all-round exercises that the race has been enabled to maintain its existence . Our youth take to them instinctively as a matter of course . But it is very seldom at the present day that one 's life depends upon the speed with which he can run , or the distance he can jump , though his ability to swim might be the means of self-preservation . It is a question , therefore , how far boys should be encouraged to attain a high degree of excellence in these various sports . Even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an athlete to further his own selfish ends . It is only as a member of some school , college , or city athletic club , where self interests are subordinated to the welfare of the common cause , that the youth of to-day can be induced to put forth their best efforts . // This is the spirit that is back of some of our best institutions and furnishes us with our highest ideals of community life . Add to this desire to work for the interest of one 's club , society , school , or college , the pleasure and exhilaration that comes from the pursuit of the game itself , and you get at the basis for the boy 's enthusiasm over baseball , football , basket-ball , and other athletic contests . The ability to do good team work , the readiness to throw oneself into the breach to stop an assault , the willingness to make a sacrifice hit to advance one 's side , to jump overboard in order to lighten the boat when one 's oar is broken , are types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are always living in an age of chivalry , when the bravest man is not the man who only goes as far as others dare to go , but the man who dares to go farther , and does go . Courage , loyalty , and self-sacrifice are the qualities born of this age , and who shall say that they are not qualities worthy of the highest degree of cultivation ? As long as there are new problems to be solved , new enterprises to be launched , new regions to be explored , where men must act in combination whether in the pursuit of war or of peace , these qualities will always be in demand . The age of youth is the time to foster and cultivate the heroic virtues , and there is no better way of doing it than by the judicious practice of manly sports and games . // When we come to a practical application of these theories , however , we find it very difficult to realize the many advantages claimed for athletic sports . The large amount of land required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount that is available in large towns and cities , where out-of-door activity is most needed , places at once a limit on the number of our youth who can engage in these invigorating exercises . Then again , the high standard of skill and ability demanded of those who participate in the sports and games , necessarily restricts the number who can take part in them : firstly , by discouraging a great many boys from trying to qualify for the athletic teams , which they find they can not do without giving more time to practice than they can afford , and secondly by eliminating a great many by process of trial who are physically unfit to stand the strain of the contests . Thus our present-day athletics bring to the front a small minority who are naturally strong and vigorous and do not need so much physical training , and shut out the great majority of the boys who are not so well endowed physically and who do need just this kind of training to prepare them for their life 's work . A few of the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging the formation of class competition , by having first , second , third , and fourth teams in the more popular games , and by trying to awaken interest in those less popular , such as lacrosse , cricket , ice // and field hockey , basket-ball , hand-ball , tennis , and many others , which from a physiological point of view are superior to some that are now receiving much more popular attention . This is a step in the right direction . Some other evils have grown up in connection with the practice of athletic sports which threaten to lessen their value both physically and morally as a training for boys . One of these evils is the desire to win at any cost , which seems to have taken possession of our youth within the past few years . Victory as an end in the minds of many boys would seem to justify the employment of almost any means to attain it . This has led to the practice of various tricks and deceits to deceive the umpires or disconcert the opposing players ; also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the registration of players who are not officially connected with the school or college to which they are credited . In some of the large colleges where the competitive spirit runs high , and the rivalry in athletics is intense , all sorts of inducements are offered to schoolboy athletes to enter these institutions . Once entered they are supposed to work their utmost for the success of the " nine , " or the " eleven , " and for fear they will not do their best , the non-athletic students are urged to visit the traininggrounds and encourage the players with their cheers and shouts . In order to keep up this highly artificial strain // and stress in athletics , the pleas of " developing manly courage , " " fostering loyalty to the institution " and " cultivating the spirit of self-sacrifice , " etc. , have been in my opinion sadly overworked . Young athletes are often induced to endure the hardships of almost continuous training on the ground that they are working for the honour of the school or college with which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their coachers and trainers . Athletic contests provide amusement for the many , but physical culture for the few . Yet it is in the hope of getting some physical improvement for their sons that many parents send them to athletic schools and colleges . Surely there is a difference between the physical training that one gets in seeing a thing done , and trying to do it oneself . For those who are left out in the competition for places on the school and college athletic teams , and for those who are really in earnest in their desire for physical improvement , I offer a series of developing exercises without apparatus , which may be termed Home Athletics . These exercises may be practised at any time and in any place . They are not only designed to give one a fine all-round development , but to attain that form in practice which it is necessary for one to have who wishes to excel in the several athletic events . The list includes such exercises as putting the shot , throwing the hammer , etc. , and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduating from school or college , young men miss the opportunities and incentives for physical training that stimulated them to effort during their youthful days . They have entered upon the study or practice of a profession , or engaged in some occupation where the demands of business are very exacting and the chances for physical improvement are rare indeed . It is true that many of the varied occupations in which young men engage do afford great opportunity for physical activity , but in consequence of the division of labour which we have spoken of elsewhere , this physical activity is likely to be very limited and leaves a man in need of exercise of a different kind to keep him in good physical condition . This is especially the case in the large cities , where good light and air are at a premium , and where confinement to an office or store becomes all the more irksome . if the young man has been accustomed to some athletic training while at school or college , he will feel the need of it very much when he first goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This new experience will be especially trying if he keeps up his training diet . Many a college man has had to admit to his discredit that he could not stand the strain of close confinement in professional and business pursuits as well as could the office clerks who had had no such opportunities as the college men for the attainment of mental and physical vigour . Those who have acquired strong and vigorous hearts , lungs , and muscles , through the practice of vigorous athletic exercises , through the growing period of their lives , can not drop these exercises with impunity upon arriving at adult age . Organs and tissues that have been built up in response to the demands that have been made upon them for years by an energetic life can not be suddenly adapted to the requirements of a sedentary life . Strong hearts , capacious lungs , and vigorous muscles must necessarily have a continuance of some of the work that contributed to their development , ill order to keep them in a healthy condition . When the young man in the city or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletics , he meets with difficulties . He may join an athletic club of some kind , but he will find very few athletic clubs that have baseball nines , football teams , or facilities for crew rowing . All active interest in these popular sports is likely to end with school and college days , because it is impossible to find the young men who can afford to give the time necessary for practice . Without practice a high // standard of excellence can not be attained , and unless athletic teams can make a creditable showing they receive neither popular favour nor financial support . Then again , the sentiment which keeps boys up to their athletic work while at school and college is lacking in the city athletic clubs . Add to this lack of incentive the loss of time in getting to and from the place for practice , and the large expense for membership , and we see some of the reasons why the majority of young men , after leaving school , can not keep up their practice in football , baseball and track athletics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership in most of the city athletic clubs is composed of men of athletic taste who join the clubs principally for social or business purposes , and incidentally pay their fees to see some other man , a non-member probably , perform for their amusement . This tendency is radically wrong and shows how far we have gone adrift in this whole athletic movement . The Young Men 's Christian Association gymnasiums , through their well-trained directors , are trying to overcome this evil tendency by confining their attention to such exercises and games as the average man can participate in , leaving the enthusiastic devotee of a single specialty to look after himself . Then there are a large number of small clubs for riding , fencing , boxing , rowing , bowling , canoeing , golf , tennis , etc. , where sport is pursued for sport 's sake , and the members // actually participate in the sports to which they subscribe . A large part of the pleasure which one receives from following some specialty comes from meeting those who are equally interested and skilled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a game which he can not play or in a sport in which he is not fairly skilful . This implies practice in early youth , for it is exceedingly difficult for a man to become skilful in a sport or game which he takes up after twenty-five or thirty years of age . For this reason the sports of one 's later youth should be made to embrace not only the large developmental games such as baseball , football , lacrosse , rowing , etc. , but the sports requiring some individual skill and alertness , such as fencing , boxing , wrestling , skating , swimming , handball , tennis , dancing , etc . They call for much less space and fewer opponents or playing partners than the larger games , and it is easier to find opportunities to practise them . So important do I regard these accomplishments in individual athletics apart from team contests , that I would have every boy taught one or more of them before he is twenty-one years of age . Instead of putting so much stress upon what promising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletics , more attention should be given to what athletics a r e e likely to do for the average school and college boy . Success in life depends largely upon energy , strength , // courage , alertness , persistency , stamina , and endurance , and it is the province of athletics to cultivate and maintain these manly virtues . If a young man comes to the threshold of his business or professional career without these qualities , he should lose no time in trying to acquire them , or if he has them , in trying to keep them in active service . If the opportunity offers , join a gymnasium , or some of the numerous clubs I have mentioned , for the practice of physical spurts and recreation . Avail yourself of every chance to walk to or from your business , if not more than a mile or two in distance . Occasionally break into a run , stopping just short of the perspiring stage . Do n't take an elevator if you only have one or two flights of stairs to climb . Skate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance as the opportunities present themselves . Do n't despair of attaining physical vigour , even if all of these different avenues of sport are closed to you . Remember you always have home athletics , and physical exercises that you may take in your room , to fall back upon . I have seen some excellent results obtained by the practice of these simple exercises . They require a little courage at first , but if you keep at them persistently until the habit is established , good will surely follow , as a matter of course , and you will begin to feel stronger and better from the start . One advantage these exercises possess over many others is that they may be taken in the morning or evening , as HEALTH , STRENGTH , AND POWER you are dressing or undressing , so that no change of clothing is necessary . As a general rule , unless the temperature of the room is below 50 ? , the less clothing one has on during exercise , the better . Try to get into a perspiring state , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take a cold sponge bath immediately afterward , and rub down with a rough Turkish towel . The following is a list of excellent exercises for young men , which will be followed by the best results if taken in the order given . figure 57 CHAPTER IX . APPROPRIATE EXERCISE FOR GIRLS UP to ten or twelve years of age , there would seem to be no good physiological reason why girls should not indulge in the same physical exercises as boys of the same age . They have the same bones , muscles , and nerves , the same hearts , lungs , stomachs , and brains , as boys , and these important parts and organs in both sexes need the same care and attention iii order to enable them to properly perform their several functions . Moreover , inasmuch as girls are more hampered and restrained by their clothing and social customs , after twelve years of age , than boys , it is all the more important that they have greater freedom of movement during their early youth . Many a woman owes the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was allowed to run , jump , skate , swim , and play all manner of out-of-door games with her brothers . Although girls are born a little smaller than boys , they soon overtake them in height and weight , and at the age of twelve are actually larger upon the average than boys of that age . If the girl has had a fair chance , // she can often surpass the boys of her age in physical efficiency , as shown by her ability in running , swimming , bicycling , and general gymnastics . This physical superiority over the boy , however , only lasts for a few years ; then he forges ahead of her , and by the age of twenty , the man , upon the average , is five inches taller , weighs twenty pounds more , and is fully two times stronger than the average woman of the same age . The superior height , weight , and strength of the girl of twelve are an . indication of the importance which nature places upon these qualities as a preparation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this time the woman must have perfected within her organism the vital machinery for supporting two lives instead of one , and this fact must ever afterward be borne in mind . As strong , therefore , as I ant in advocating a similarity of exercises and opportunities for physical training for both boys and girls up to the age of puberty , I am equally strong in the opinion that the girl 's physical training should be very different from the boy 's after this period . Not but that girls should be permitted and encouraged to still engage in many of the exercises usually monopolized by boys ; but they must all be entered into with certain mental and physical reservations . A failure to regard this important consideration often brings illhealth to girls and bad repute to gymnastics and athletics . We have , then , on the part of girls , an anatomical structure which requires just as much care // and attention to keep it in good working order , an emotional nature which renders her more likely to carry the exercises she enjoys to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renders it necessary to keep a large stock of her power in reserve . The exercises which are the best calculated to build up the muscular system of a boy or girl are those of a well-appointed gymnasium . This is what those institutions are primarily for , and they are of the greatest importance to women and children , for several other reasons . All of the exercises can be carefully adjusted , regulated , and controlled , so that they can readily be adapted to the strength of the strong , as well as the weakness of the weak . They can also be applied directly to strengthen local parts and tone up the condition of debilitated organs . They can be limited as to time and amount . They can be practised every day in the week and during all seasons of the year . They allow freedom of dress , and a certain amount of privacy , which can not be secured on open playgrounds . The most important exercises for girls are those that develop the muscles about the waist and abdomen , not alone because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because of the effect which exercise of these parts has upon both stomachic and intestinal digestion . Strange enough , it is the waist and abdominal region that women have rendered most HEALTH , STRENGTH , AND POWER inert through the conventional method of dressing . In order to fortify themselves against the evil consequences of this silly fashion of constricting the waist , waist and abdominal exercises in young girls should receive supreme attention . The best exercises for developing this region of the body are the Free Exercises , which I shall mention later , that may be practised in the gymnasium , or in one 's room night and morning , when free from the restrictions of the ordinary clothing . Then rowing , a most admirable exercise for the development of the muscles of the abdomen , waist , and back , as well as those of the arms , and shoulders , and legs , if the sliding seat is used . Swimming is perhaps one of the best exercises for girls , because nearly all of the muscles of the body are brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown back , the chest forward , and every stroke of the arms tends to increase the chest expansion . So many muscles , also , are brought into action that the lungs and heart are greatly stimulated , and all parts of the body share this increase of the respiration and circulation . Moreover , swimming is an exercise which all girls should practise as a precautionary measure in case of accident on the water , and it is one of the sports in which women may excel . Dancing , of course , every girl should indulge in , not necessarily the society dancing that always requires a partner , but that free and joyous expression of the emotions through the rhythmic and graceful movements // of the body and limbs which delights both the performer and the observer . The self-possession and the mental and physical poise that comes from this kind of dancing , which is taught in most gymnasiums , is worth everything . Fencing is very much to be recommended on the same grounds . Then the Indian clubs , which give so much grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are such valuable agents for training one 's powers of coordination . Juggling with the bounding balls , which so delighted the maidens of Ancient Greece , and to which the Japanese attribute so much of their manual dexterity , is an admirable exercise for training both eye and hand to accuracy and alertness . Wands , dumb-tells , and chest-weights , those indispensable agents of the well-equipped gymnasium , are always serviceable and accessible for developmental purposes , and so are the swings , ladders , ropes , bars , and much of the so-called heavy apparatus . Learning how to climb a ladder , descend a rope , or swing from a tar are simply lessons in the art of handling the weight of one 's body by the arms , which every healthy girl and boy should be able to do . Every girl should learn to ride a bicycle , and where the opportunity presents itself , she should learn to ride horseback also . Physical accomplishments bring their mental as well as physical equivalents , and should be considered part of the girl 's mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many active games and plays in which girls may engage with profit , but those which are most likely to enlist their interest and attention are cricket , baseball , basket-ball , field-hockey , hand-ball , squash , and lawn tennis . In the playing of the highly competitive games lies an element of danger which it is well to recognize and resist . We have seen in the previous exercises that we have recommended that the amount of effort called for could be carefully regulated by the teacher , through the movements selected , the resistance to be overcome , time required , etc. , so as to meet the needs of the individual . When one is exercising by herself , she can start or stop when she desires , and the effort she puts forth is entirely dependent upon her own initiative . It is not so with exciting games . Here you have the efforts of an opponent to meet , or you have a position to maintain , where failure to play your part may cause the defeat of the whole team . You feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , or class at stake . Urged on by admiring friends and companions , you not only strive to do your best , but better than your best . You would not be worthy to represent your team or school if you did not put forth your best efforts to bring victory to their shrine . It is in this energetic unselfishness , in this persistent and courageous effort to work for the good of the cause , figure CHAPTER X. EXERCISE FOR WOMEN WITH women , as with men , it is very desirable to learn exercises in their youth to practise when older . Exercises and games which require some skill and adroitness , like dancing , fencing , lawn-tennis , and many others , come slowly to those who are well advanced in adult life , and for this reason many persons who are in need of physical recreation are loath to take them up . They do not like to bring their awkwardness into unpleasant comparison with the nimbleness and gracefulness of youth , and so frequently forego the pleasure of practising in skilled sports altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of some kind of physical exercise to-day than at any time during their recent history . The confinements of school life ; the restrictions and limitations of shop , store , office , and factory work , the perplexing cares and responsibilities of bringing up a family ; the idle and luxurious habits of the newly rich ; together with the hampering and constraining influence of clothing , with which all classes are more or less 67 // oppressed , impose conditions upon our women which are detrimental to their health and vigour , and which must be net as far as possible by more sanatory methods of living . The hours spent in the schoolroom , added to the hours required for study at home , interfere very much with natural growth and development , and unless something is done to provide for more physical activity than is required in following out the ordinary school curriculum , the average girl reaches maturity in a more or less enfeebled condition . She has built a brain , but in many cases it has been at the expense of her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good red blood , hysteria , and other nervous troubles , are quite in evidence . The rapidity with which women recover their normal condition when they take systematic exercise , is an indication of what they should have as a constant factor in their every-day lives , ? less brain worry , and more physical activity . The economic conditions which make it necessary for many women and girls to earn their living and contribute to the support of a family , are bringing about sad physical results in many instances . Division of labour , which has io restricted the physical activity of men , is equally baneful in its influence upon the health and physique of women . Women , being regarded as the weaker sex , are generally given or fit into positions which require seemingly little physical effort , such as clerks , stenographers , typewriters , cashiers , bookkeepers , saleswomen , waitresses , // factory employees , etc . But , as a matter of fact , the confined positions in sitting or standing , the constant use of small groups of muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to work , are much more fatiguing than the employment of larger groups of muscles in more strenuous efforts with frequent intervals of rest . Many a college football player would " go stale " under the peculiar muscular and nervous strain which hundreds of women are going through daily . What this class of women most need is something that will give them a broader range of physical activity and relief from nervous tension . Something that combines the elements of rollicking fun and innocent amusement with helpful , corrective exercises . A well-equipped gymnasium that has something to meet the needs of all classes , best meets the peculiar needs of the working girls , ? a gymnasium with a pleasing , competent instructor , inspiring music , and agreeable comrades ; where corsets may be laid aside for an exercising suit , and freedom to breathe and to move be thoroughly enjoyed . It is gratifying to know that many of the great manufacturing establishments , like the Plant Shoe Factory , in Roxbury , Mass. , the National Cash Registry , at Dayton , Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many others , are providing well-furnished gymnasiums , with instructors , baths , resting-rooms , restaurants , etc. , for their employees . It is also gratifying to learn that improved service , and the time saved through the reduc- // tion in the amount of sickness on the part of the employees , more than compensates the employers for all the money expended iii behalf of physical recreation . Where girls are attending school , or earning their living in offices , stores , or factories , they have little time or inclination for housework , and the burden of keeping the family together , and attending to the household duties , usually devolves upon the mother . Under such circumstances , she is rarely in need of physical exercise , though she is often in need of physical recreation . But of late years , the cares , responsibility , and expense of housekeeping have induced many families to board or to live in apartments , where the physical efforts required to keep one 's home or rooms in order have been greatly reduced . Where families are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough muscular work to do to keep them in good condition . If this freedom from the necessity of making strenuous physical efforts is accompanied by overeating , and luxurious habits of living , then obesity and ill-health speedily follow . This is one of the evils that always accompany too much prosperity , and prompts the poet to sing : u Ill fares the land , to hastening ills a prey , Where wealth accumulates , and men decay . " I have dwelt at some length upon the importance of physical activity for women , not because it will ever be desirable for them to compete with men in work requiring // great muscular strength , but because it is a matter of organic necessity . Two-thirds of the body weight consists of bones and muscles , and these parts can only be kept in condition by performing the functions for which they were created . In performing these functions , they not only improve the quality and tone of bones and muscles , but they improve the health and strength of the entire system , including brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the effect produced upon the respiration , circulation , digestion , etc . The possession of large muscle areas into which the blood may be drained at times , to relieve blood-pressure in the brain or pelvis , is a matter of the greatest importance , and often constitutes the difference between a life of enjoyment and one of periodic misery . Now the way to acquire these large muscle areas is not by engaging in feats of strength , or in entering upon the practice of antagonistic games and competitive athletics , ? but by engaging in exercises that require greater continuity of effort and a less expenditure of nervous energy . Some of the exercises that are well calculated to produce the desired effects I will illustrate at the close of this chapter . Exercises which require a considerable number of conscious contractions of the muscles , made rhythmically , and followed by more or less complete relaxation , seem to contribute most to their general nutrition . Many women // are often deterred from making conscious muscular efforts through fear of acquiring " large knotty muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as all the muscle that most women are likely to attain is pretty sure to be covered with more or less adipose tissue . Some of the recreative exercises in which women may indulge with profit from maturity on through middle life are walking , bicycling , rowing , swimming , golf , and gentle running . Walking in a short skirt , with good walking shoes , across country , up hill and down , is an admirable exercise for the development of the lower extremities , and for improving to some extent the respiration and circulation . Bicycling , which I am glad to see coming into fashion again , is especially valuable for heavy women . While walking they have to support their own weight , and have acquired muscular power in so doing . In bicycling the machine supports the weight of the body , and the well developed muscles of the lower extremities are left free to do the pedaling . Under such circumstances the heavy person is induced to ride farther , and get out into the country , where blooming trees , green fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good cheer and refreshment . The bicycle is a better all-round leg developer than walking , and the handle-bars , if used properly , may be made to aid the respiration . Rowing and swimming are as valuable to women as to girls , but they should be practised in moderation , because // of the large number of muscles involved and the consequent strain put upon the heart and blood-vessels . Golf is especially advantageous to woman , not only because it takes her out into the open country , but because the game calls into particular action the muscles of the chest and front and side walls of the waist and abdomen . If the waist is large and fleshy , this game tends to reduce it ; if , on the other hand , the waist is narrow and constricted , golf tends to broaden it . It is a splendid antidote to the corset , as it tends to develop the abdominal muscles which this garment makes inert . For this reason golf is a better game physically for women than for men , as these muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter . As Mosso , the distinguished physiologist , says , " In their lives women have terrible moments when weakness in the contraction of these muscles prolongs the labour of a mother and sometimes causes her death . " These are the muscles upon which the Greeks laid so much stress in their male and female statues , and for the development of which they prescribed so many exercises . All exercises should be considered especially advantageous for women in proportion as they give employment to the respiratory muscles of the chest , the muscles of the spine , and the muscles of the waist and abdomen . Of course there are many mental , moral , and social advantages in athletic games , but I am intentionally narrowing myself down to a consideration of their physical advantages , which , after all , is what they are practised // for . I maintain that women can not compete successfully in men 's games , under men 's rules , without acquiring traits and physical characteristics which are essentially masculine , any more than men can engage in woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manly sports , implies that they are sports which tend to make men more manly , not women more womanly , and yet the latter 's feminine characteristics are just as essential to the welfare of the race as the formers manly qualities . In the early history of mankind women and men led lives more nearly alike , and consequently they were more alike both mentally and physically than they are to-day . As an illustration , compare the Indian women and men with those of our white people . The former look alike , the latter look unlike . This divergence of the sexes is a marked characteristic of progression among high ) civilized races . Woman 's instincts teach her that her power and influence in the world depend upon making herself different from man . For this reason , and in order to accentuate her sex , she has encumbered herself with skirts and constricted herself with corsets for some three thousand years . Although these artificial restraints have hampered woman physically and organically , they have at least helped to preserve her identity . Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sloping shoulders , large thighs , well developed mammie , and small wrists , ankles , hands , // and feet will continue to be regarded as feminine characteristics , and the vast majority of women will adhere to these ideals long after the brawny athletic girls and the manly women have had their day . While rejoicing , therefore , in the emancipation of woman from anything that interferes with the full development of her body , limbs , and vital organism , let us be sure that we do not recommend for her adoption as an aid to this development exercises that , when pushed to extremes , tend to unsex her . I refer to the highly competitive games and athletic contests now being introduced into many of the schools and colleges for women . In order to keep these exciting games and contests within the bounds of safety , a careful system of training should be taken in preparation , and the rules so modified that the time of playing , distance run , height jumped , and weights thrown , etc. , shall only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read this book it may seem absurd that I have thought it necessary to caution any class of women against carrying athletics to excess , realizing that marry more women need to be stimulated in their efforts to take exercise , rather than to be repressed . This is very true , yet from my official position I have been appealed to so , frequently for my opinion as to the advisability of women participating in athletics that I have taken this occasion to give expression to my views on the subject . Probably the great majority of women have little oppor- HEALTH , STRENGTH , AND POWER tunity or inclination to practise many of the sports and games I have enumerated . I know , however , that very many of these women are sadly in need of the life and health-giving influence of some kind of physical exercise . To these women , and to all others who enjoy the pleasures of right living and well being , I recommend the following list of free movements and rhythmic exercises . figure 76 CHAPTER XI . THE BEST FORM OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty or thirty-five most men are well established in their business or profession . The cares and responsibilities of life are beginning to demand more time and attention , and it becomes more and more difficult to break away from the desk , counter , or bench for regular exercise or systematic physical recreation . Moreover , if the exercise requires companionship and the cooperation of skilled players , as baseball , football , lacrosse , and some of the other games , it becomes difficult for all to arrange their engagements so as to meet at the club or grounds at a given hour . The field is preoccupied by younger and more active players , and you are forced to take your chances with them or to abandon this kind of sport for ever . This in brief is the history of the experience of many who have tried to carry the sports of their youth and early manhood into mature life . Under natural conditions there is no reason why baseball , lacrosse , and cricket should not he practised up to the age of forty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body are fully developed , all of the bones have con- // solidated , and the muscles are capable of standing the greatest strain and rendering the greatest service . But we are constantly reminded that we are not living under natural conditions . We are playing the game of life under artificial rules and unnatural restrictions , which require us to shut ourselves up in shops , offices , and warehouses , and assume positions , habits , and customs which are detrimental to us individually , however the results of our efforts may serve to advance the condition of humanity as a whole . We allow ourselves to become prematurely old , and to be burned out before our time , not because the real exigencies of life call for any such unnatural consumption , but because the spirit of the age and the high tension of present business methods seem to demand it . Moreover , this individual activity is becoming more and more mental and less and less physical as time goes on . Steam-power and electricity are now bearing the heavy burdens of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to keep up with the increased volume of work that is poured in upon them , by the use of those swift and powerful agents . But it requires a large consumption of fuel to generate steam and electricity ; it also requires a large consumption of food to generate mental power and nerve-force . This food must not only be collected and prepared outside of the body , but it must also be properly digested , assimilated , and distributed within the body before its force- // value can be made available for mental or physical efforts . These vital processes involve the action of heart , lungs , stomach , and other organs , which it is the province of certain kinds of physical exercise to develop and keep in a healthy condition . When it is considered that ninetenths of all the food consumed is required to sustain the vital work of these important organs , and keep the internal machinery of the body heated up and ready for service , before any external work can be done , one begins to realize some of the responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunate is he who brings to mature life well developed respiratory and circulatory organs and an efficient digestive apparatus . More fortunate still is the man who knows how to manage and care for these organs during the trying period of middle life . The man who was athletic during his youth and early manhood feels well and strong , eats heartily , and sees no reason for changing his mode of living , though his occupation now is largely mental and he is confined to his office and desk eight or ten hours a day , taking little or no exercise . This is a fatal mistake . Very soon the digestion will be impaired and various forms of dyspepsia will begin to make their presence felt , such as constipation , distention of the stomach , flatulency , heartburn , acid eructations , and feelings of heaviness , dulness , and despondency . // The circulation will begin to grow more feeble , the hands and feet will be frequently cold , and passive congestions of the blood in the head , lungs , liver , or intestines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or palpitation and irregularity of the heart . The lungs and throat will be troubled with an increased secretion of mucus . Shortness of breath will ensue after the slightest effort , and this difficulty in respiration will lessen the amount of oxygen taken into the system . This will occasion an accumulation of by-products in the blood and tissues which ought to have been oxidized or burned up , and the clogging of the tissues with these products leads to gout , gravel , rheumatism , or the fatty degeneration of some of the most important organs and parts of the body . To allow your system to get into this condition is like allowing your stove-grate to be clogged with ashes and clinkers , your funnels with soot , your water-pipes with rust , and your sink pipe with waste and dirt . Trouble and disease follow as a matter of course . Men who have been accustomed to take vigorous exercise in their youth should do one of three things : engage in some active occupation , greatly reduce the amount of food they consume , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will enable them to properly digest and assimilate it . The best kind of exercises for men between thirty and forty to take , in order to keep the heart , lungs , stomach , // and brain in good condition , are mild forms of running rowing , swimming , horseback-riding , hand-ball , and lawn tennis . After forty years of age and until over fifty , all of the above exercises may be continued in a mild degree if the individual has been long accustomed to them . But it would be inadvisable , if not dangerous , for a person over forty to start in upon the practice of most of these exercises . Walking , hunting , shooting , fishing , bowling , golf , and bicycling would be more appropriate exercises for men as they approach fifty years of age . If one avoids hillclimbing in bicycling and walking , the above group of exercises may be practised in moderation up to sixty and over . The guiding principle for exercise after forty should be slow and easy efforts long continued , instead of violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been accustomed to take any kind of physical exercise during their youth , it is often a perplexing question to know just what to do in this direction after thirty or forty years have gone by . This is especially the case if the occupations in which they have engaged are mental or sedentary ones . Where young men are too studiously inclined and devote all their attention to mental pursuits , the brain , of course , is the part that is most developed . The lion 's share of the body 's nutriment has been directed there to increase its growth and development , and all of the bloodvessels flowing to the brain are correspondingly enlarged // meet the demands that have been made upon them . e rest of the body , including the heart , lungs , stomach , 1 muscles , have been made the slaves of the brain , and , Ting been deprived of their just share of blood , the ly 's food , they have not attained the power and effincy of which they were capable . But at the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure has passed . The aeity of the vital organs have been gauged to meet requirements of the brain , and after middle life they rarely be made to exceed this function . Not unfrequently some one of these organs becomes weak and tilitated because it does not have enough work to do , 1 a diseased state soon follows . Weak lungs , a feeble at , and a rebellious stomach , with flabby muscles and aciated limbs are the usual accompaniments of a life exclusive brain-work . Sometimes a person of this ntal habit finds himself troubled with frequent headLes , confusion of thought and sleeplessness . He is used by his physician to take up horseback riding some other equally interesting and spirited exercise . returns every time with more headache and feelings exhaustion , and not infrequently forswears all kinds of exrcise for ever after . In this case the trouble arises m taking exercises which are too stimulating to the heart . When the heart is made to beat faster than usual , blood flows more rapidly throughout the body , but re especially into those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant head-worker the freest channels are always in the brain , and the blood frequently flows to this part in excess after vigorous exercise . Hence the cause of congestive headaches in such cases , and the condemnation of exercise as a means of relieving them . This case is a typical one . If this man in his youth and early manhood had accustomed himself to take systematic physical exercise , thereby developing the large muscles of the trunk and limbs as they ought to be developed , they would , when used , act as reservoirs for the surplus blood that occasioned the throbbing head , and brought about almost instant relief . Congestion of the liver , bowels , and other parts of the body may frequently be relieved by those accustomed to exercise in the same way . It behooves every man to develop his muscles during his youth , and to learn and practise some game or exercise which he may practise and enjoy as he grows older . Where this has not been done , and the man , as he voyages through middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain him in his daily work , let him remember that he must begin slowly and cautiously to acquire this desired result . Do n't begin by holding the limbs rigid and making the muscles hard and tense , for this process shuts the blood out of the muscles , and uses up too much nerve-force . You will get much better results by entering upon the practice of a series of slow , rhythmic movements , which // call for the action of the large muscles about the chest , back , and abdomen , and which are such a powerful aid to the internal organs in performing their functions . The list of exercises given in this book which are best adapted to those in middle life are as follows : 84 CHAPTER XII . EXERCISE IN OLD AGE AMONG animals and in the primitive conditions of human beings , no efforts are made to prolong the lives of those who are approaching old age . As soon as an animal is unable to maintain a footing in the world , to fight his enemies , and gain food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among savage tribes , where food is scarce , and the struggles for existence depend almost entirely upon physical strength and hardihood , the aged are killed off in the fight or left to starve . Even in the semi-civilized races , the worth of the individual to the community grows less in the declining years of his life , and the younger men who can bear arms , and endure the hardships of war and the chase , are given the preference in the struggles for existence . In exceptional cases , among savage tribes , where the chiefs are strong and vigorous and possessed of superior knowledge of value to the community , they are suffered to survive , and are frequently protected and cared for by their people even when well advanced in years . // In the highly civilized nations , where society , the institution , the government count for so much , be who can render the most valuable service to the community as a whole is most indispensable to its welfare . Inasmuch as it now requires about thirty years , nearly an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citizenship in our present-day civilization , the services of men of age , experience , and accumulated wisdom have become more and more valuable to the community . At the present time , property interest , established reputations , broader fields of observation , a greater financial power , and , above all , character , which are likely to be the possessions of men of age , take the place of the superior physical vigour and agility of the younger men , which figured so prominently in the early struggles for the maintenance of life . One can recall numerous instances like Gladstone , Von Moltke , Bismarck , De Lesseps , Queen Victoria , Pope Leo , Herbert Spencer , Lord Salisbury , and many others who rendered great service to their fellow men after they had reached the age of threescore and ten . The present age is so strenuous that there is a tendency on the part of men of affairs to carry the strains and burdens of life into their declining years . They become so centred and absorbed in their great interests that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The habit of routine work , and the many ties that bind men to their business or professional associates , make it hard to leave the traces , and surrender one 's position to others . Then , too , one 's pride in his own powers , and a reluctance to admit even to himself that he is growing old , keep many a man in heavy harness when he should seek to lighten his burden . Unfortunately , some are compelled by misfortune or necessity to continue the struggle to the bitter end . Some of the most heroic , and at the same time pathetic cases that I have ever known , have been among men who have lost their pecuniary competency late in life , and have had to enter the battle anew . It behooves every one to strive to lay by a sufficient sum of money , during his early or middle life , to see him safely through his declining years , and it also behooves every man to conserve his energy , and so husband his vital resources , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a premature collapse or a sudden breakdown . With the comforts and conveniences of modern life , the period of old age to a man in health should be a pleasant , if not a happy one . How to prolong one 's service in life , and to grow old gracefully and happily , are attainments worth striving for . I have already alluded to the necessity of lightening one 's burden after the period of old age has fairly cornmenced . This does not mean that all physical and // mental activity should cease , or that a man should enter upon a prolonged period of rest . It simply means that he has passed the summit of his powers and has entered upon the decline . " From birth to maturity , " says Doctor Humphry , in his book on old age , " there is an increase of bodily material , an increase of activity , an increase of strength ; from maturity onward is a lessening of material , a lessening of activity , and a lessening of strength . As in the early stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportion to the requirements , and all the organs and tissues of the body adapted themselves to the demands made upon them , so in the later stages , as age advances , there is the same harmonious adjustment of the organs and parts to the lessening weight and the diminishing energy and activity that is taking place . " During the time that the bones are becoming lighter and less capable of offering resistance , the muscles become , in like proportion , lighter and weaker , and with a narrowing range of action , and the associated volitional and other nerve apparatus exhibits a corresponding lowering of energy and force . The loss of will to run and jump and indulge in athletic sports is , or should be , commensurate with the inability of the muscles to effect the requisite movements , and of the bones to bear the requisite shocks . " The weakening of the heart and the diminished elasticity of the arteries provide a proportionately feebler blood-current ; and a lower digestive power , and a less- // ened appetite provide a smaller supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the slowing fires . Thus the capacity for action is diminishing , and the demand for it and the material for it are diminishing also ; and all are diminishing in due ratio to one another . It may be said , indeed , that at all periods of life , the healthy and well-working , and especially the enduring , quality of the body , depends upon a good adjustment , a good balance , of the several parts ; and it is upon the well-ordered , proportionately or developmentally regulated decline in the several organs that the stages which succeed to maturity are safely passed , and that crown of physical glory , a healthy old age , is attained . . " A time comes at length when , in the course of the descending developmental processes , the several components of the machine gradually grow weaker and slow down , a time when the nervous , the circulatory , and the respiratory organs have not force enough to keep one another going ; then the wheels stop like those of a watch or clock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to meet these gradual changes in the system as one advances toward old age , the whole organism should be gradually slowed down . Less and less demands should be made upon all of the bodily functions , but more and more attention should be paid to fresh air , sunlight , proper food , clothing , bathing , and immediate environment . // Gentle , all-round activity of body and mind , followed by frequent intervals of rest , should be the rule . Nothing in excess . In order to meet the specific changes that are taking place in the bones , muscles , tendons , arteries , heart , lungs , nervous system , etc. , special precautions should be observed in taking any kind of exercise . Exercises and games that require sudden , quick , and forceful efforts , like boxing , tennis , hand-ball , etc. , should be avoided . Exercises that require extensive body bending , reaching , and stretching , although admirable as a means of warding off some of the infirmities of old age , should also be avoided after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dancing , and exercises of skill which keep the nervous system under great tension , should be abandoned , also rapid walking , running , bicycling , rowing , swimming , horseback riding , basket-ball , and all exercises and sports that bring great strain upon the lungs , heart , and bloodvessels . Cricket , golf , bowling , bicycling , and other exercises that may be followed in moderation , may be continued up to seventy or eighty years of age . The safest exercises , however , are walking , carriageriding , billiards , etc. , that give gentle activity to body and mind , and may be indulged in great moderation . As in infancy and early childhood all exercises began with simple movements of the arms , trunk , and legs , so as age advances , and one returns to second childhood , these simple movements should again be relied upon to // keep up life 's current , and promote the necessary tissue changes upon which health in old age so much depends . We have seen that movements taken without apparatus are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable extent , because so many muscles are brought into action . The best selection of movements for elderly persons are given at the close of this chapter . These should be practised daily with great care and moderation , taking the slowest rhythms , and pausing frequently for rest . At the same time , one should enter with the heartiest interest into the affairs of life , making the home exercise supply what the day 's work does not afford . Hold on to life tenaciously , and life will hold on to you . 91 CHAPTER XIII . FRESH AIR AND BREATHING EXERCISES A MAN breathes upon the average about twenty times a minute , or 28,800 times every twenty-four hours . Any function of the body that requires this incessant activity day and night must be an important one . If one is deprived of air even for a short time , a feeling of suffocation immediately ensues , and if the air is withheld from the lungs for a few minutes more , life itself becomes extinct . Several historical incidences are on record where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from breathing impure air . In the Black Hole at Calcutta , of the 146 persons confined , 123 died in one night . In a prison in which three hundred Austrian prisoners were placed after the battle of Austerlitz , 260 died very rapidly . The steamer Londonderry had a large number of emigrants confined below during a storm ; when the hatches were raised , most of them were found dead . The reason that air which has once been breathed is so deadly is because it has lost a large part of its oxygen , which is a life-giving // property , and taken on an increased amount of carbonic acid and organic substances which are rank poisons . Under ordinary circumstances , the air breathed is vitiated so slowly that its poisonous effects are not perceived . The sense of smell becomes blunted and inert , a little mental dulness , drowsiness , and some headache perhaps , are the only warning symptoms , and these are often attributed to other causes . It is the inability of most persons to detect any injurious properties in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their workshops and living-rooms . Most persons are , however , very sensitive to draughts of cool air , and consequently tend to regulate the quality of air breathed by its temperature rather than by its purity and freshness . If a person feels cold , nothing seems more natural than to close the doors and windows and stop the ingress of the outside air . In so doing , of course , the fresh air is not only kept out , but the impure air that has been breathed is kept in , to be breathed over and over again . Thus persons who would think it highly objectionable to bathe their bodies in water that had been bathed in by others , frequently take into their lungs air which has been repeatedly used again and again . From a vital standpoint the former process , though not pleasant , is not injurious , whereas the latter process is vitally harmful . It is estimated that forty per cent . of the total mortality is caused by breathing impure air . Yet as long as people herd together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all civilized communities , a certain amount of vitiated air must necessarily be breathed . The great problem in ventilation is to supply as much fresh air as possible and reduce the amount of impure air to a minimum . The best way of obtaining fresh air is to secure for each person as large a volume of air to breathe as is practicable . Under ordinary circumstances , each individual requires about four hundred cubic feet of air every twenty-four hours . Each person should have at least 250 cubic feet of air-space in every school or recitation-roam , three hundred cubic feet in his sleeping-room , four hundred cubic feet in his dwelling , office , or study-room , and one thousand in his work or exercise room . Even when this large volume of air can be secured for each individual , it would soon become foul unless it were frequently changed . The best way to change the air in a room is to open the windows and doors occasionally and let the wind blow through . The windows should always be opened a little at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting a narrow strip of board at the bottom of the window-frame , the current of air may be directed upward so as to protect one from draughts . A curtain at the top of the window or a screen may serve the same purpose . A few practical hints as to the management of the air for breathing and living purposes may be serviceable . Keep the temperature of your room as near as possible to // the mean temperature of the climate in which you live . The best temperature for health and work is between 60 ? and 70 ? F. Open fireplaces or Franklin grates are preferable to hot-air furnaces or air-tight stoves . When steamradiators are used it is advisable to have a pan of water placed upon them , so that the evaporation from the heated water will render the air less dry . It is much more hygienic , as well as much more economical , to try and keep the body warm through an increase of clothing rather than an increase of external heat . To the young and vigorous , continued heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breathing through the nose at all times . Do not talk in the cold air immediately after being in a warm room . On the other hand , it is better not to go immediately into a very warm room after running or riding in the cold air . Either practice may give you all the symptoms of a bad cold in the head . If possible secure a sleeping-room in which the direct rays of the sun enter sometime during the day . Do not use the sleeping-room as a study , work , or livingroom if any other room is available for these purposes . If compelled by circumstances to use the same room for working and sleeping , see that it is thoroughly aired every night before retiring . Remember that every lighted lamp and every gas-burner consumes more oxygen than several persons , and make // allowance for an increased supply in ventilating your apartment in the evening . Many persons , realizing the importance of fresh air , act upon the presumption that it is impossible to get too much of it . Respiratory experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term " breathing exercises , " and all persons are advised to practise these exercises as a means of increasing their vital capacity and organic power . Where the lungs are weak and there is any tendency or susceptibility to consumption , it is absolutely necessary that the person should have not only fresh air to breathe , but that he should frequently take long , deep breaths , and get as much pure air into his lungs as ' possible . It is also desirable for all persons , at all times , to keep the chest walls as flexible and mobile as they may , and to see that their respiratory apparatus is in good working order . To base a system of physical training for every one , however , upon breathing exercises alone , and expect to build up the body generally by blowing into a spirometer , is a fallacy . It is a fallacy , however , built upon such a plausible foundation , backed by the dread of that very prevalent yet terrible disease , consumption , and by the fear that any attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much from one 's vitality , that a great many persons confine their physical training to breathing or lung exercises . This is a perversion of physiological truth which should not be allowed to go unchallenged . The primary object of respiratory activity is not simply // to carry nourishment to the lungs , but to use the lungs as a sort of clearing-house , from which some of the oxygen of the inspired air could be sent to the rest of the body , and some of the carbonic acid received from this source could be eliminated from the system . The amount of external respiration is always determined by the amount of internal respiration , that is , by the amount of chemical activity that takes place in the muscles and tissues of the general system . Assuming that the total lung capacity of the average adult is 350 cubic inches , only about thirty cubic inches are required to satisfy the demands of ordinary inspiration . Should the person , however , engage in very violent efforts , such as are sometimes required in rowing , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expiration might be increased one hundred cubic inches , and the number of respirations a minute be greatly increased . This still leaves in the lungs over one hundred cubic inches of air , which no physical effort can expel . This residual air , however , mingles freely with the air taken in at every inspiration , and effects the changes which take place between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries . This exchange of oxygen and carbonic acid is always in proportion to the work being done , though persons in training can usually make greater efforts with less destruction of tissue . Every one is familiar with the fact that he breathes harder and faster when active than he does when he sits still . Doctor 97 3EALTH , STRENGTH , AND POWER Edward Smith found by experiments , made some years go , the relative amount of air inspired during different orms of muscular exertion . Thus , letting the amount inspired in the recumbent position at rest be taken as 1 , ? figure From the above table it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply the system with air in proportion to its needs , which depend Ton the condition of the blood . When the blood is less aterial and more venous , as is always the case when nuch work is being done , the respiratory centre is stimu ated , and the breathing is increased . When , on the other land , the blood is more arterial and less venous than usual , which is the case when the oxygen is not used up n combustion , because little work is being done , there s less demand for air , and the respiratory centre is depressed . When an attempt is made through deep-breathing xercises to take in more air than the system needs , the // blood becomes more highly arterialized than is necessary , and the respiration is temporarily arrested . This is a condition known as apnwa . It shows that nature does not tolerate any interference with the regulation of her functions without a protest . It is not an unusual thing for persons to feel faint after taking a few deep inhalations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temporary unconscious condition after persistently practising deep inhalations in front of an open window . The absurdity of attempting to improve the general system through breathing exercises alone , is made doubly apparent when we consider how little the action of the heart is augmented by these exercises . In rapid walking , running , swimming , or in any exercise bringing large numbers of muscles into action , the number of heart-beats is greatly increased , as well as the number of respirations . In very violent or prolonged exercises the heart sometimes beats as many as 1.60 times a minute , the normal number being about seventy-five or eighty . The object of this increased action of the heart is to pump the arterialized blood more rapidly from the lungs to the tissues , where its oxygen is being rapidly used up , and back again from the tissues to the lungs , where the blood gives up its waste product in the form of carbonic acid , and takes on a renewed supply of oxygen . The effectiveness of all muscle work depends upon the rapidity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal process depends upon the rapidity with which the gaseous changes we have referred to take place in the lungs . Both internal and external respiration are therefore dependent for their effectiveness upon the rapid beating of the heart . When a person takes a number of deep inspirations , the blood is sucked as it were from the brain to the heart and lungs , but not in sufficient quantity to stimulate the heart to increased action so that it would send the blood quickly back to the brain again , consequently the feeling of faintness that often follows such practice . If one would take the precaution to continue his respiratory exercise with some other form of exercise that quickens the action of the heart as well as the lungs , the process would be a perfectly natural one , and both heart and lungs would be invigorated at the same time . I have already suggested some of the exercises that are excellent for this purpose , such as rapid walking , hill climbing , dancing , running , skating , swimming , rowing , etc . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free movements given in this book , which tend to limber up the cartilages of the ribs , render the walls of the chest more elastic , and develop the muscles of forced respiration . But to attempt to pump more oxygen into the system , thereby hoping to revitalize it , by practising deepbreathing exercises only , is folly , simply because the blood can not absorb the increased supply of oxygen , and the system has no use for it . 100 CHAPTER , XIV . THE FOOD WE SHOULD EAT EVERYTHING we do , whether it be work , exercise , or play , is done by expending energy . The very process of living , breathing , seeing , listening , thinking , and the action of the cells and glands involved in carrying on the functions of secretion , digestion , assimilation , etc. , and the maintenance of animal heat , all call for the expenditure of force , which must be made good in the form of food , drink , and fresh air . Every one is familiar with the fact that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows warmer , and perspires . That is to say , he gives off more water from the skin , more carbonic acid from the lungs , and more energy from every part , and if the efforts were long continued he would lose considerable weight . The amount of waste material given off , and the loss of weight , are in almost direct proportion to the efforts made , and the demands for food are regulated accordingly . Some of the competitors in athletic contests lose as much as ten pounds in a single race or game . Those who are young , and still growing and developing , require // much more food than adults , because their radiating or evaporating surfaces are much larger in proportion to their bulk , so that they lose more heat , and they need more material , as they have to build up the body as well as replenish what has been lost through exertion . One of the principal objects of exercise is to break down old tissue , so that it may be replaced with new material . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts can not be followed by the consumption of a sufficient amount of nutritious food to make good the waste , then such effort may prove injurious rather than beneficial . The relation , therefore , of food and diet to the proper growth and development of mind and body is an exceedingly important one . A perfect food must not only be capable of repairing the waste of the body , and supplying it with new building material , but it must also supply the heat and energy for doing nervous and muscular work . In order that a food may fulfil these functions , it must be made up of certain substances termed proteids , carbohydrates , fats , and mineral matters . The proteids comprise the gluten of flour , the albumen of the white of egg , the fibrin of the blood , the casein of cheese , the syntonin which is the chief constituent of muscle , and other such building material . The carbohydrates consist of the sugar , starch , dextrin , and gum found largely in the vegetables , such as potatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereals , such as oatmeal , Indian corn , rice , buckwheat , and others . The carbohy- // drates also abound in such dried fruits as apples , dates , figs , prunes , currants , and raisins . The fats include many of the vegetable and animal fatty matters and oils . They are found in very small quantities in such vegetables as parsnips , artichokes , onions , and sweet potatoes , and somewhat more in the cereals , especially in oats , Indian corn , millet , and buckwheat , but they are found most abundantly in nuts , particularly the walnut , filberts , sweet almonds , and cocoanuts . The animal fats are found in the fatty meats , such as pork , bacon , mutton , and goose , and in milk , cream , cheese , butter , oleomargarine , and the yolk of eggs . The mineral matters in our food include mainly the elements sodium , potassium , line , iron , phosphorus , and chlorin . They are present to some extent in all ordinary foods , and are found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt , in pulses , such as beans and peas , and in various sorts of nuts . The especially valuable salts are found in the outer layer of wheat , barley , and other grains . Most foods contain one or more of these several ingredients . No single group fulfils all the body 's needs , but each group fulfils some special function better than any other , so that something from all the groups is necessary for complete living . The proteids , mineral matters , and water provide the raw material out of which the body is built up and repaired , while the proteids , carbohydrates , and fats , singly // or combined , furnish the potential energy for work and keep up the animal heat . Some physiologists claim that water , mineral matters , and fresh air should also be classified among the work and heat producers . The proteids perform both functions as tissue builders and energy and heat generators , and they are therefore considered the most important of all the foods . This fact is universally recognized by the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some form of proteid with their other food selections , which are usually fats and carbohydrates . This is shown in such familiar combinations as bread and milk , crackers and cheese , bread and butter , pork and beans , ham and eggs , rice and milk , meat or fish and potatoes , bread and honey , cereals and cream , etc . How much of the essential nutrients does each food contain ? How much potential energy will it yield ? Can it be readily prepared and easily digested ? What does it cost ? and how much of each shall we eat ? These are all important questions , but they can not be answered within the limits of a single chapter . As to the kind and amount of food to consume , much depends upon the age , sex , climate , season , occupation , mode of life and environment , which we will briefly consider . As a general rule , a child should eat about one part proteids , or building food , to every four parts carbohydrates and fats , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to five of the same nutrients . // The standard amount of foods for adults , as usually given , are as follows : figure More recent experiments , however , have shown that if the food is thoroughly masticated at least one-half of this quantity is sufficient to furnish working energy for the average man . A growing child , who is ever active , needs more food in proportion to his bulk than an adult , for reasons which I have already stated . A developing youth , or young man practising athletics and gymnastics , requires a greater proportion of proteids , or body-building material , than a full-grown man , though he may be working at some laborious pursuit . The latter fares better under a greater relative increase of the carbohydrates and fats . The proteids , especially the meats , seem to have the power of yielding a large amount of energy in a short space of time , and are consequently very desirable where short bursts of speed are required , or great feats of strength undertaken . Where prolonged activity is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to give one more sustained power . The proteids form the chief essentials in the so-called training diet . After the age of twenty-four the body has usually com- // pleted its growth and development , and there is less demand for the proteids as building material . Yet college athletes , and young men who were very vigorous and active in their teens and early twenties , tend to keep up their excessive feeding after they have discontinued their muscle work . The consequence is that many of these men break down with indigestion , and some of them become chronic dyspeptics . The remedy is a reduction in the amount of food consumed , especially the meat proteids , or a return to more active muscular work . As one advances in age after thirty or forty years , there should be a gradual reduction in the amount of all kinds of food consumed , until the age of sixty or seventy , when one-half the usual amount of sustenance for adults will suffice . As a rule , women need only about four-fifths as much food as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five pounds less in weight . Women as a class also have usually a greater amount of adipose tissue , and consequently give off less heat , which is an equivalent to the saving of so much food . Persons exposed to the rigours of a cold climate have to consume more food . Sometimes an increased amount of clothing will help conserve the body 's heat for awhile , but sooner or later it will be necessary to generate more heat . This is most quickly supplied by an increased quantity of the oils , fats , and carbohydrates . In very warm weather , or in going into a hot climate , the meats , // as well as the oils , fats , etc. , consumed , should be reduced to a minimum , and the fruits , vegetables , and cereals should be relied upon mainly for sustenance . A person may acquire the habit of overeating , and then feel that he is not being sufficiently nourished because he does not feel a comfortable distention of the stomach . Those who are engaged in laborious occupations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fresh air , may eat with impunity a great quantity of many different kinds of food , which could not be digested or even consumed without more or less distress by persons confined indoors and working at a sedentary occupation . Great muscular inactivity not only weakens the powers of digestion , but leaning over a desk , table , or bench , or wearing tight clothing or corsets about the waist , interfere with the action of the ribs , diaphragm and the stomach , and frequently cause dyspepsia . In order properly to perform their function , the stomach and abdominal viscera must not be cramped , and should have freedom of movement . Many hints and suggestions in regard to diet , which have good physiological foundations , may be briefly condensed into a few paragraphs . It is an excellent thing to begin the day by drinking a glass of hot water . If hot water can not be secured , a glass of cold water will prove serviceable . The water will remove the mucous coating from the stomach and tone it up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food thoroughly . Time spent in chewing the food is time saved through the gain of nervous energy and the more perfect assimilation of all that is eaten . When very tired or exhausted from overwork , postpone eating until you can secure an hour or two of rest . Great physical fatigue , prolonged anxiety , mental worry , or great emotional disturbance of any kind , frequently cause acute indigestion . As a general rule , it is better not to read the morning mail or the morning newspaper before or at breakfast . Start the first meal of the day with the mind as free from thought , care , or anxiety as possible . Never eat when in great haste . It will be less injurious to omit the noon meal entirely than to devour your food at a quick-lunch counter . Give yourself up entirely to the enjoyment of every meal eaten for its own sake . A pleasant dining-room , with clean table-linen , fine service , and agreeable table companions enhance the enjoyment of eating . Sugars and sweets are now considered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eaten sparingly , however , and at meal-time , together with other food . If eaten between meals or in excessive quantities , they will cause acid fermentation in the stomach . Sweets , like meats , may be eaten most freely by those who are accustomed to take vigorous physical exercise . Cold water , not iced water , is the best form of drink , // because it is the best solvent for the solid substances taken as food . Tea and coffee , however , are drunk in moderation by many persons without any apparent injurious effects . Other persons can not drink then without suffering loss of sleep and digestive disturbances . Tea and coffee are in no sense muscle food , for experiments have shown that they increase rather than diminish tissue waste . For this reason persons who desire to be well developed and strong would better dispense with them . If much heated and very thirsty from prolonged exertion , do not try to quench the thirst immediately . Rinse the mouth , gargle the throat , and take a few swallows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you may begin to drink all that you need . Individual idiosyncrasies and peculiarities are so numerous and varied that it is not safe to lay down any absolute rules in regard to the quantity or quality of one 's diet . Very little is really known about the chemistry of nutrition , but we do know that during the growing and developing period nature provides for a surplus of food , but not for a deficiency . Therefore , it is better in youth and early manhood to eat abundantly of a mixed diet , and trust to the digestive apparatus to make the final analysis and selection of what is best for the system , and to exclude what is not fit for assimilation . In a healthy person , the appetite , if not perverted by 110 i HEALTH , STRENGTH , AND POWER stimulants , condiments , etc. , should be a safe guide to the choice of foods . Bearing in mind the tendency after middle life to overeat , it is better to take the mixed and varied diet necessary from meal to meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes or courses at one meal . Ascertain what should be your weight for your race and sex in proportion to your age , height , chest girth , etc. , and allow yourself to vary but a few pounds from this standard . Bear in mind , however , that , while the normal weight may be preserved by having a surplus of flesh in one part of the body , some other part may be impoverished from want of suitable nutriment . The best way to distribute the body 's nutriment to the parts most needing it , is through a system of carefully selected physical exercises , such as are described herein . Increase in weight after forty is not an indication of good health , as so many suppose , but of approaching disease . If you value your life and wish to prolong it , keep down your waist girth as you advance in years . The best method of treating extreme leanness and obesity I will consider in the succeeding chapter . 111 CHAPTER XV . OBESITY AND LEANNESS WHEN the accumulation of fat becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various functions of the body , it is termed obesity . We have seen in the previous chapter that as soon as the amount of food eaten is in excess of what is expended through activity , that there is a tendency to take on fat . This is particularly the case in persons of both sexes who have been active and energetic in youth and early adult life , thereby cultivating an appetite and acquiring good digestion , but who , as they become more prosperous , cease to be so active , while they continue the excessive feeding . Some authorities maintain that a moderate accumulation of adipose in middle life is an indication of health , and that this increase of fat is simply one of nature 's methods of conserving the heat and vital force that is generated so slowly and lost so rapidly in old age . We know that a certain amount of fat enters into the composition of the body in health , and that all persons possess more or less of it . According to Huxley , a man // weighing 154 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of skeleton , and twenty-eight pounds of fat . Here fat is used in the gross sense of adipose tissue , not of pure fat in the chemical sense , which in the above case would amount to about seven pounds only . In women the proportion of fat to bone and muscle is usually much greater . As fat is the most unstable of all the tissues that enter into the structure of the body , it is the tissue that is most likely to fluctuate in quantity , and influence most potently the loss or gain in body weight . How great this fluctuation is , few persons realize . The insurance companies allow a variation of twenty per cent . from the normal weight , other things being favourable , before considering a person ineligible . This variation would allow a person whose normal weight was 150 pounds to drop to 120 pounds , or raise his weight to 180 pounds , before passing the physiological limit . In my opinion , however , any marked deviation from the normal weight for a given age and height indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man for all-round service is one who weighs from 2 to 2.5 pounds to every inch in height , and the most capable women are those who range in weight from 1.8 to 2.3 pounds to each inch in height . In order to determine your own factor in this particular , divide // your weight in pounds by your height in inches . Thus , if your weight is 136 pounds and your height is sixtyeight inches , your weight-height factor is two pounds to the inch . Any weight above two and one-half pounds to the inch in stature may be considered excessive , inasmuch as it adds little or nothing to one 's mental or physical efficiency , and any weight above three pounds to the inch in stature should be regarded in the nature of corpulence or obesity . The causes of this disagreeable condition are many , but the chief causes are heredity and excessive eating . About fifty per cent . of the persons who become corpulent inherit the tendency directly from one of their near or remote ancestry . Some families tend to fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fat , it is very difficult to keep the person within normal limits , as everything consumed seems , though moderate in quantity , to tend to adipose tissue . The other fifty per cent . really acquire corpulence by eating large quantities of all kinds of foods , but especially those that are rich in fats and carbohydrates . The sugars and starchy matters are particularly disposed to produce fat . Diminished physical activity is also a very frequent cause of obesity in both sexes , and two-thirds of all the corpulent persons are women . Women who have borne many children are apt to become corpulent after forty or fifty years of age . // Diminished mental activity and the acquirement of indolent habits and a phlegmatic , easy-going disposition are also causes . The reduction of respiratory activity , through the interference of the accumulated abdominal fat with the action of the diaphragm , tends to a further increase in adipose tissue , which might otherwise be oxidized through the lungs . Breathlessness is a condition arising not only from an excess of fat , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Fat is a bad conductor of heat , therefore much of the warmth generated in the body , which usually passes off through radiation , is checked in the obese by the subcutaneous layer of fat that surrounds them . This retention of animal heat leads to a further accumulation of fat , which accounts for the fact that a rise in external temperature , or acute fevers or pneumonia , are very hard to bear by persons who are corpulent . Another cause that favours the deposition and conservation of fat in the body is the consumption of alcohol . This is so readily oxidized or turned into heat , that it prevents the fat in the foods being burned , so they accumulate in the body . An anaemic condition of the blood , occasioned by a reduction in the number of red blood corpuscles , and indicated by blanched lips , pale face , etc. , lessens the decomposition of fat through oxidation , and thus leads to its accumulation . It was observed by Aristotle in // ancient times that the fattening of cattle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is also commonly observed at the present time that many persons are fat because they have relatively less blood than the lean , and that women are usually fatter than men because they have fewer red blood corpuscles . The diseases that follow obesity may affect the brain , heart , lungs , stomach , liver , kidneys , or blood-vessels , and are usually hard to bear on account of the excessive fat . How to reduce corpulence , therefore , is not simply a matter of securing a more comfortable existence ; it is a matter of keeping off impending disease and an early death . From what we have learned to be the cause of corpulence , the remedy would seem to suggest itself . Eat less and burn up more . When fat first begins to accumulate , this is a comparatively simple thing to do , as is illustrated frequently by athletes , who reduce their weight by training . But after corpulence is established , and the person weighs fifty or a hundred pounds more than he should for his stature , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inherited , and the person is advanced beyond middle life . As we have already intimated , a person who is corpulent gets into a vicious circle from which it is almost impossible to extricate himself . Increased weight calls for greater expenditure of energy // in moving about , increased expenditure of energy increases the appetite , more food creates more fat , and more fat tends to increase the accumulation of fat by interfering with the normal processes of oxidation and combustion . Nevertheless , if a person has the resolution and determination to continue the treatment , a great reduction in weight may be secured without loss of health . One of the first essentials is to reduce uniformly but moderately all articles of food , but especially the fats and carbohydrates . This means a reduction in the usual supply of bread , milk , butter , sugar , potatoes , rich puddings , pastry , and fat meats . If there is any one food that you like better than another , and have eaten to excess , that is likely to be an offender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total amount of liquid to two or three pints a day , unless you perspire very freely , when another pint may be drunk . This drink may be made up of one cup of weak tea or coffee ( which will stimulate the circulation ) , and water enough to make up the balance . The amount of water taken at meal-times should be reduced to a minimum , as it tends to increase the desire for food . Eat less than your appetite craves . Leave the table hungry . You will not starve , but simply make up the deficiency which your system may need by living upon your accumulated capital of fat and adipose tissue . // Weigh yourself every few days , and if you can reduce your weight two or three pounds a week , the result will be better in the end than to strive for a more rapid reduction . In order to increase the oxidation of the body fats , the person must lead a life of great mental and muscular activity . This is nature 's only way of getting rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood and the breaking down of tissue . Exercises like running , rowing , swimming , boxing , hand-ball , tennis , and basket-ball , are the best for reducing the weight , because they call for mental and physical alertness , and make you breathe five or six times as much as you do when sitting still , and it is the rapid breathing that furnishes the increased oxygen that burns up the fat . Such exercises create a forced draught , as it were , and make the internal fires burn more briskly . Unfortunately , there are many corpulent persons who have not a sufficient amount of physical vigour and nerveforce to keep up the pace required in the exercises I have just mentioned . Such persons , however , may find great benefit from engaging in exercises that require less intense activity , but may be indulged in for a longer time , such as golf , cricket , bicycling , horseback riding , and hill climbing . Although fat goes on increasing daily , the opportunities for reducing it by exercise are unfortunately limited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other // extraneous conditions , over which one may have no control . To such persons who have the pluck and determination necessary to get rid of their burden , many of the exercises described and illustrated herein will be of the greatest service . They may be practised daily under all conditions of weather or seasons , wherever one can find standing-room and good air to breathe . The best exercises for reducing the weight are as follows : Chopping Wood , Striking the Anvil , Scooping Sand , Steamboat , Hoisting and Furling Sail , Windmill , Locomotive , Grand Bend , Pitching Hay , Standing Start , Jumping-Jack , Driving Stakes , Clap under Legs , Lower Chest Expander , The Long Pass , Sawing Wood , Hurrah , Rowing , and Rocking the Boat . In training for the reduction of fat , it is always advisable to carry the exercises to the perspiring stage . After this take a warm bath with a profuse use of soap , which should be followed immediately with a cold bath of sufficient duration to deprive the body of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the utmost importance to the corpulent , and everything should be done through frequent bathing and rubbing of the surface to keep it up to the highest state of functional activity , as it is through the skin that the evolution of heat takes place which helps to eliminate the fat . For this reason , though sweaters and heavy clothing may be used while exer- // cising , to favour perspiration , as light clothing as possible should be worn at other times , and very few bedclothes should be made to suffice . The amount of sleep should be reduced to seven hours at the most , so as to prolong the hours of mental and physical activity . In case the corpulent person is feeble and debilitated , having anaemia or some heart weakness , it would be better to consult a physician who makes a specialty of treating such cases . LEANNESS In case of excessive leanness , the cause and treatment are very nearly opposite from what we have observed in obesity . As a general thing , any amount of food taken in excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life will be deposited as fat . There are , however , many persons who , for some reason or other , fail to assimilate a large portion of what they eat , and consequently they remain thin , or at least , never gain fat . One may readily recall among his acquaintances some lean and cadaverous-looking individual who easily consumes much more food than his fat neighbour . Such cases , however , must be regarded as exceptional . Persons who are lean are undoubtedly much more active than those who are fat , and they usually expend a great deal more energy . 120
