txt Ordinarily the air of the Subway is sufficiently pure and fresh to give no discomfort to people using it . Sometimes the conditions are so conspicuously different that it excites general remark . When Prof. CHANDLeR made his report the facts warranted it : if it were made now they would not . An opinion as to why the air is so much less pure one day than another , if given without the most careful examination of all the conditions of temperature , humidity , direction and velocity of wind , and other influencing caused , would have very little value . The fact is as we have stated it . and the reason is worth seeking by the only weans which will explain it satisfactorily . Meanwhile , no useful purpose will be accomplished by denying facts which are matters of general experience . Still less will it serve to dismiss the subject as of no consequence . For example , Mr. E. P. BRYAN is quoted as saying : Tile people do n't seem to mind the air . The traffic of the Subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole Subway . If they did not like the air would they patronize the road or submit to crowding in the cars in the rush hours ? The action of the people has made it clearly evident what they think about impure Subway air . This does not do credit to Mr. BRYAN 'S intelligence . The people certainly object very much to impure air , and are not generally satisfied with existing conditions . They use the Subway because it is a vast public convenience For this reason they would continue to patronize it even though the conditions should approximate the intolerable . Many of them could not get where they need to go-by any other ' conveyance . Consequently the fact that the Subway travel does not conspicuously fall off when the air is noticeably bad does not make it at all clear what . the ' public think of the Subway air , but ' it does show that the Subway is an indispensable public necessity , and that some millions of people use it for the same reason that some other millions live under conditions not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to .
