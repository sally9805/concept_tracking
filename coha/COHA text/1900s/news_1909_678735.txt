txt It is noteworthy that a strong movement for entire publicity in Congressional and other National elections is spreading through the States where opposition to the Payne-Aldrich tariff is the most determined . The Chicago Tribune has been making a special inquiry concerning this movement , and it finds that the Congressional delegations of the following States are unanimous in ; 1 , support : Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Minnesota , Montana , Nebraska , North Dakota , South Dakota , Wisconsin . In the delegations of four other States , Illinois , Michigan , Ohio , and Missouri , there are a few , but only a few , who decline as yet to commit themselves . It is needless to say that among these is found Speaker CANNON , whose courage does not run in the direction of challenging publicity in matters political end personal . The rallying point of this movement is the plain and satisfactory recommendation of President TAFT in his annual message : I urgently recommend to Congress that a law be passed requiring that candidates for election to the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and campaigns file in a proper office of the United States Government a statement of the contributions received and of the expenditures incurred in the campaign for such elections , and that similar legislation be enacted in respect to all other elections ' which are constitutionally within the control of Congress . We are well aware that the principle of this recommendation is not easy to enforce . The gum hat forms an essential part of a politician 's conscience is elastic , and the interpretation of the extent of publicity required by the law suggested is sure to be in many cases loose and evasive . Moreover , if a man chooses to lie under oath as to the receipt or payment of money for political purposes it will always be extremely difficult to prove that he has lied , as in bribery there are usually only two witnesses to the offense , and both are interested in suppressing the truth . Nevertheless , if the law be made sufficiently specific , if all agents are included in its provision as nearly as possible , if vouchers are required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath , with proper penalties for all violations of the law , including the ii , oss of office to a candidate and disfranchisement to others , the law may be made really formidable . Where it is sustained by a considerable public opinion it may be made practically effective . It is quite conceivable , for instance , that in the Eighteenth District of Illinois , which now is represented by Mr. CANNON . as it has been for some thirty-five years , a. law requiring definite and complete publicity could be enforced , because the election would be looked upon as not local but National and typical , and vigilance would be accordingly alert and persistent . In any event there appears every prospect that an earnest effort will be made to carry an effective law through Congress at the current session , in order that it may be applied to the election of riepresentatives next Autumn . All good citizens , without distinction of party , ** cooperate in that effort .                 @ @ @ @
