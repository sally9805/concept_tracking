" Many other points which may perplex us in the doctrines of the Gospels may perhaps be founded on a misapprehension on the part of the disciples ; the sense of the words spoken in Syriac may have suffered more or less in the translation into Greek , or the obscurity of the metaphors may still be cleared up on better acquaintance with the East , as has been the case with the camel and the eye of the needle . " It is due to misrepresentations that Christianity is sometimes regarded as less enlightened than Buddhism , which is said to have gained four hundred millions of adherents without proclaiming either a recompense for good works or a punishment for bad actions .

" XV. ? ISLAM . BEFORE the appearance of their prophet the tribes of the Arabian peninsula were still in the shackles of fetishism . They worshipped stones , rocks , trees , and images , and also the sun , moon , and constellations . ' Mohammed himself confesses that in his Mohammed . 3C youth he adored the gods of his fathers . The meteoric stone in the Ka'aba at Mecca had long been the object of pilgrimages in connection with which fairs were held , and in order not to deprive his native city of this source of profit , Mohammed condescended to incorporate the worship of this stone into his religious system . The existence of invisible and supernatural beings , jins and angels , was also believed , and endeavours were made to obtain their good-will by worship . Even in very early times the Bedouins acknowledged a creator of the heavens and a ruler of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from the verb ldh , which signifies trembling and shining . ' On other grounds its relationship to the Hebrew El , or Eloah , and with Alghah , the old Arabic name for the sun , is also conjectured.3 A future life was denied , so that it was Mohammed 's doctrine of resurrection which especially repelled the higher classes of his countrymen.4 The prophet , who was left an orphan at an early age , and was in his youth obliged to adopt the humble occupation of a sheep and goat-herd , improved his position in life by marrying at twentyfour a rich widow at least fourteen years older than himself . He suffered all his life from hysterical attacks , and for that reason alone would have been regarded by the races of Africa , Northern Asia , and America as a powerful Shaman . Like all such , he also firmly believed that his revelations were extraneous , and that a higher power spoke by him . When in advancing years his enthusiasm gradually subsided , and practice gave him the power of evoking at will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foaming at the mouth , he delivered revelations for the most trivial purposes . Before bringing home his eighth wife , she required that her marriage should be decreed by the word of God , which was given at her demand.5 Having sworn to another of his wives to reject a Coptic lady whom he loved , but afterwards repenting of his promise , he procured a revelation from God assuring him that such oaths to women were not obligatory. ? Thus the // youth , self-deceived by Shamanism , was at an older age transformed into a crafty impostor . To reconcile the miracle of revelation with reality , it was supposed that the will of God was made known to the Prophet only in its purport , and that time was required to clothe the meaning in that poetical prose which soon so deeply affected the minds of the believers , that pious Moslems , on unexpectedly hearing the menaces of a verse of the Koran , repeatedly fell down unconscious from mere terror , and are even said to have died in consequence. ? Mohammed , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sceptics , if they believed the Koran was devised by him alone , to try to write even one or two Suras like his . The Koran itself contains one hundred and fourteen psalms or Suras , differing in length from a single verse to the dimensions of a sermon . Narratives of judicial punishments taken from biblical and ancient Arabic legends , arc mixed up , as in a heap devoid of order , with social ordinances and the actual Divine revelations . By arranging them according to the date of their origin we can gain an insight into the growth and development of the new faith , which is merely a recoining of Jewish and Christian thoughts . The predecessors of the Prophet among the Arabs were the Hanyfes , who worshipped a creator and expected a resurrection of the dead , followed by a judgment of moral acts . Mohammed called himself a Hanyfe , and Abraham the founder of Hanyfism , which in his mouth meant a purified monotheism , which is well called Islam , a significant word which implies direct opposition to atheism as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogmas of the Ebronite Jewish Christians at Jerusalem and Pella , who recognized only the first Gospel as genuine , and rejected the doctrines of the incarnation and redemption . ' ? Mohammed himself visited Jerusalem more than once ; he honoured Christ and his sister , as he deemed the Holy Ghost , and even the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary was included in his dogmas . " The Prophet at first attempted Influence of Christianity on Mohammed . 303 to found a Jewish Christian community among the Arabs . But as he was probably never able to read , it often happened that he made erroneous appeals to the Old Testament and the Gospels . When he was reproached with such mistakes , he took refuge in the evasion which has from that time been maintained by all Moslems , that the revelations in the Old and New Testaments are of Divine origin , but from vile and interested motives had been so distorted and corrupted by Jews and Christians , that it was necessary that they should be revealed again to the Prophet , fresh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said in the fifth Sura , " we have given the book of truth , which confirms the law of Moses and the Gospel .

' 2 Later , however , there was no more question of such tolerance and equality . On the 16th of January , 624 , the Prophet decreed an alteration of the Kibla , or direction in which prayers were to be said ; the face was previously turned towards Jerusalem , but henceforth it was to be directed towards Mecca , although , as if to quiet his own conscience , the Prophet adds in the same Sura which inculcates this ordinance " Direct your prayer where you will , God is there , for God is omnipresent and omniscient .

" The moral decrees enacted by the Prophet on the strength of his Divine mission , were arranged iii imitation of the Sinaitic laws , in the following two series , each of live precepts To acknowledge no other gods but God ; 2. to show respect to parents ; 3. not to kill children on account of dread of starvation ; 4. to preserve chastity ; 5. to protect the life of others except where justice demands the contrary . To this first series are attached as injunc ? // tions ; 6. inviolability of the property of orphans ; 7. just weights and measures ; 8. no overburdening of slaves ; 9. impartiality of judges ; ro. sacredness of oaths and of the covenant with God . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Prophet obviously racked his brains in order to reach the normal number , and after all inserted mere police regulations . The consecration of the Sabbath was not ordained : Mohammed maintained that it was imposed upon the Jews only on account of their perversity , because they persevered in the celebration of the Saturday , and not as Moses wished of the Friday . ' 5 The authorization of four lawful wives and an unlimited number of female . slaves betrays the weakness of the Prophet , who set no bounds to his own love of pleasure . But it would be unjust to regard polygamy as the essential contrast between Islam and our own religion . Long before Christianity , monogamy was the law among many nations , and still is so among pagan races ; moreover , in the earliest times it was possible while belonging to the Christian Church to have several wives . In common with all nations in a low state of civilization , the Arabs in the time of their heathenism had imposed upon themselves highly complicated dietary prohibitions . The Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunted animals , and of blood.16 To procure credence for his revelations , the Prophet endeavoured to alarm his followers by the threats of the resurrection and a day of judgment . In this the fiery force of his poetic language was of service , and he neglected no opportunity of recalling the judgments already accomplished in biblical and ancient Arabic legends . On the other hand , in wearisome reiteration , he promised the believers and the righteous an Elysium , according to the popular taste ? a shady garden with bubbling fountains , delicious fruits , luxurious couches , and a race of houris who united every charm that could eternally satisfy eternal desire . It is true the Koran contains passages which reduce these entrancing descriptions to the level of metaphors adapted to hums comprehension , ' that others represent the contemplation of the // glory of God as the reward of the righteous , 8 but the extraordinary attraction of Islam was based on the literal interpretation of these sensuous promises ; later traditions have taken care to satiate the greedy expectations of the faithful with fabulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koran is the denial of free-will in man . The destiny of each person is predetermined and recorded , so that the course of life is related to this record as the acting is to the text of a dramatic poem. ? Damnation is decreed for those on whom it falls by an irrevocable counsel of God ; for , continues the Koran , had Allah so willed it , all men would have believed , but without His will no soul would attain to faith.21 The doctrine of predestination was always maintained by the orthodox , and although the more liberal sects clearly recognized the incompatibility of preordination and punishment with Divine justice and mercy , and held milder views , the weak-minded mass of believers adhered to the letter . On account of this doctrine no priesthood could ever gain ascendancy in the society of Islam , for there was nothing to bind or to loose . Moreover , the Caliphs and their successors were always at the head of the faithful . 22 In addition to the Koran , the Sunna , or book of customs and legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation , has full authority , and contains ordinances on social and criminal matters , as well as precepts with regard to food and apparel . In addition to this , legal force is imputed to the Record , or Hadyth , which contains such traditional utterances of the Prophet as can be traced back through good witnesses to himself.23 In Persia these legal authorities were not recognized , and hence arose a division among the faithful into the Sunnites , adherents of the Sunna , and the apostates , or Shyites. // Shortly after its establishment Islam overran Egypt and Northern Africa ; at the beginning of the eighth century it passed over the Straits of Gibraltar , and maintained itself in Western Europe until the fall of Granada , in 1492 . In the same century in which it was driven back from Spain to Africa , it succeeded in gaining a footing in Southern Europe in the eastern peninsula , and in 1453 it obtained the dominion over the straits which divide our quarter of the world from Asia Minor . In the beginning of the eighth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indus , but their principalities of Mooltan and Mansora soon fell off from the Chalifate . Arab communities existed in all the towns on the coast of Malabar , though Islam was then merely tolerated in those regions . It was was only in the year A.D. 1000 that it obtained a firm footing in India among the Ghazuwids , and under Baber , the founder of the kingdom of the Great Moguls , the chief power in the peninsula fell into the hands of Mohammedan princes . In Sumatra the doctrine of the Prophet first became predominant in 1206 in the kingdom of Atschin , and in the kingdom of Malacca shortly after its foundation in the year 1253 , while in Java it did not supplant Buddhism until after the fall of the state of Madschapahit , . in 1478 . It reached the island of Celebes in 1512 , yet the Buginese were still vainly resisting its spread even in 1640 . Islam still continues its progress eastwards . Its furthest limit in that direction is a small mosque at Dobo in the Aru Islands , a dependency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many new converts among the Papuans.26 In Africa the doctrine of the Prophet was first naturalized in the Mediterranean districts . It made its way across the desert into Bornou between 1086 and 1097 , but early in the same century it had spread to the great kingdom of Sonrhay , on the middle Niger , and in the beginning of the thirteenth century it extended to the rulers of Melli on the Upper Niger.27 It reached Wadai , Darfur , // and Kordofan only in the beginning and the middle of the seventeenth century. $ Whether the Tuareg were formerly Christians , as Barth conjectures , requires further confirmation , and , again , whether in the former kingdom of Ghana , lying westwards of Timbuctoo , Christianity succumbed to Islam only in 1075 , and in Nubia , where according to reliable records it still prevailed in the first half of the fourteenth century . ' 9 Even at present Islam is slowly expelling Christianity from Abyssinia . Within our times the Fellatah have carried it to Adamaua , far into the interior of pagan Africa . The doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africans . The negro who embraces Islam is assured that he rises higher , and by reason of his purer doctrine is nearer to God than the Christians . Lastly , in Africa the promulgators of the doctrine of the Prophet are poor and unpaid , whereas the missionaries , although they preach contempt for riches , surround themselves with profusion . In the opinion of a clear-sighted observer , these are the reasons why the Christian religion gives way to Islam among the negroes.3 ? This doctrine has recently been victorious in China . It had early been diffused there ; partly by way of Kashgar and the fertile districts on the southern slopes of the Thianshan , partly by sea , following the great mercantile routes to the places on the coast , until towards the end of the ninth century , on the downfall of the " Tang dynasty , a persecution of foreigners and the extermination of the Mohammedans took place.31 A short time ago a governor established himself at Talifu , in the south-west of the Celestial Kingdom , among the Mohammedan Chinese , and seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had entered into commercial transactions with this infant state by way of Burmah , were full of praise of the honesty and morality of the Panthays , as these new adherents of Islam were natned.32 According to more recent accounts the Chinese again destroyed this new creation in 1872. 308 The Zone of the Founders of Religions . XVL-THE ZONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF RELIGIONS . " KNOWLEDGE of the natural characters of different regions of the world , " sa s Von Humboldt , in one of the most profound passages of his Physiognomy of Plants , " is an essential part of the history of the human race and of its culture . For although the beginning of this culture is not determined by physical influences alone , yet its direction and the national character , the gloomy or cheerful temper of mankind , depend largely on climatic conditions . The sky of Greece had great influence on its inhabitants ! The colonists in the beautiful and favoured districts between the Euphrates , the Halys , and the Egean Sea began early to recognize moral loveliness and tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and religious enthusiasm had suddenly brought the sacred East into prominence , our forefathers again brought home from those genial valleys more gentle manners . The poetry of the Greeks and the ruder songs of the primitive people of the north mainly owe their peculiar character to the forms of the plants and animals , to the mountain valleys which surrounded the poet , and to the air which he breathed . Turning only to familiar objects , we all feel different emotions in the dark shade of beech-trees , on hills crowned with scattered fir-trees , or on the grassy plain where the wind rustles through the trembling foliage of the birch . These plants of our native land severally evoke in our minds melancholy , elevating , or gladsome images . The influence of the physical upon the moral world , the mysterious interaction of the sensible and of that which lies beyond the senses , endows the study of nature , when raised to higher points of view , with a peculiar charm which is as yet too little recognized . " It would be a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events in human society and the scenes in which they occurred . No one could better help us in our preparation for such researches than Buckle , according to whom , nothing is simpler and more intelligible than the reaction of the place of abode upon the mental phenomena . Where nature terrifies man by portentous objects of alarm , the imagination // is more fully developed than the intellect , and belief in miracles is most luxuriant . " Italy , Spain , and Portugal , " says Buckle , " are , of all countries in Europe , most frequently visited by earthquakes ; earthquakes intimidate the mind of man , consequently the belief in the interference of supersensual powers with the physical order of the world has been more stubbornly maintained among the inhabitants of Southern Europe than in other parts . " The terrible catastrophe which befel Lisbon more than a hundred years ago , although it stands alone in magnitude , may in ome degree justify us in considering Portugal among the countries in which earthquakes most frequently occur , but Spain , although not entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely visited by earthquakes . Japan , which so often trembles under the trident of Poseidon , is peopled by a cheerful race of men , given to tricks and jests , and heedless on subjects of religion . Russia , again , is almost entirely free from earthquakes , yet Italy has long been cleansed from a system of exorcism such as still prevails in the Greek Church . " In the tropics , " Buckle continues , " nature appears still more violent and terrible in contrast with human pusillanimity , and hence among the inhabitants of India the imagination is preeminently peopled with illusions . There , " he says , " obstacles of every sort were so numerous , so alarming , and apparently so inexplicable , that the difficulties of life could only be solved by constantly appealing to the direct agency of supernatural causes . There the terrified imagination beheld such visions of horror as Civa , or his consort Durga-Kali , the palms of whose hands were constantly reddened with fresh blood , and whose necks were adorned with a string of human skulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindostan proper , that is to say , in the district of the Ganges , exclusive of Bengal , nature , according to Buckle 's views , ought there above all to have filled the minds of the population with sensations of fear and awe . Earthquakes do not occur , indeed , but they are replaced by terrific hurricanes . The Bay of Bengal is certainly the source of those cyclones or circular storms which have visited footnote 1 History of Civilization . 310 The Zone of the Founders of Religions . Calcutta twice within the last few years . The range of these scourges is however confined to the coast , and their devastations never extend beyond the limits of Bengal . The Himalayas are also supposed by Buckle to have exercised an intimidating effect , but they are either invisible from the thickly populated districts , or appear only as a beautiful boundary on the northern horizon . When Buckle spoke of pestilences invading tropical Asia with specially destructive footsteps , he was thinking only of the cholera which just at the time he wrote was making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was visited in former times by the black death and the plague ? destroying angels which might well be compared with the relatively modern epidemic of India , so that the temperate zone was no more exempt than the tropics . Strangely enough Buckle does not even mention the most fatal evil genius of India , namely , famine , the most active of gravediggers , which even now , when rains fail and rivers run low , occasionally causes greater destruction than any pestilences or cyclones , and transforms densely populated districts into deserts ; this happened in 1770 , at the beginning of the British rule , when ten out of five-and-twenty millions of Bengalese perished in consequence of a failure of the crops . If the dangers and anxieties inherent in a place of abode exercise a control such as Buckle attributes to them over the dispositions of the people , the Dutch ought to be far more credulous than the Belgians . Constantly , but more especially at the time of the syzygies of the moon , they are threatened by an adversary as pitiless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inhabiting a territory below the level of the sea , have robbed of its rightful property . This power , though expelled , has frequently avenged itself , as , for instance , when the Zuyder Zee and the Dollart were filled by a sudden inroad , and all the villages with their inhabitants were swallowed up . Lastly , in every nation sailors and miners ought to be more superstitious than any other craftsmen , for they are peculiarly exposed to freaks of the forces of nature quite beyond calculation , yet no one has ever stated that this is the case in any perceptible degree . Hence we must admit that the greater perils of life in any place of abode have not been the cause of an excessive development Influence of Food on Character . 31 I of the imagination . Even Alexander von Humboldt 's beautiful saying in regard to the reaction of the Grecian sky on the Hellenic temperament is unconvincing . If one spot on earth deserves the name of paradise rather than another , it is assuredly Mexico , with its lakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by snowy volcanoes , its perpetually bright weather and its bracing mountain air . But it is under these delightful skies that the gloomy disposition of the natives of Anahua has evolved all the horrors of a dark and bloody worship . Let us , then , rather attempt to ascertain whether the habitual food of the nation stands in causal connection with the phenomena of their temperament . Hindostan , the abode of Brahminism , and Central China , the home of Confucius , are almost equally exposed to sun , and are covered by a similar vegetation . Nature , as Buckle was obliged to admit , is in both places equally great and almost equally terrible ; this may at least be strictly asserted of Southern China , and yet in the Celestial Empire imagination has taken quite another direction than in India , or rather , it has scarcely taken any direction at all . The Chinese eat everything , even Holothurians , or sea-cucumbers ( Trepang ) , the very sight of which makes those who are unaccustomed to them shudder . Orthodox Hindoos of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal food . But it was not always so . In the time of the Vedas the consumption of animal food was not yet prohibited , and at the same time the Vedic religion was not darkened by the creation of bloodthirsty deities , nor filled with horrors and terrors as in later times . The depression of spirits , the inclination towards the prodigious and grotesque , the weariness of life , the dread of an endless series of transmigrations , first began to develop among the Hindoos simultaneously with the transition to a purely vegetable diet . Probably every one knows by personal experience that our mental functions arc dependent upon nutriment ; for the genuine unconscious sleep , which is profound and refreshing , flies from us when the stomach is heavily overloaded . But hunger also , like all other cravings , even if partially satisfied , exercises control over the imagination . This biological fact was and still is the origin of the rigid fastings prescribed by religions so widely 312 The Zone of the Founders of Religions . different , and made use of by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to enter into communication with the invisible powers . As often as the usual order of nutriment is interrupted or even disturbed , as soon as it ceases to be regular , the imagination acquires unusual power , and in this shaken or enfeebled condition is more susceptible to that which it ascribes to supersensual operations . Here , then , we fancy that we have at last found the key that gives us an insight into the control exercised by physical laws in the province of mental phenomena . But turn again to Buckle , although it will this time be not as a counsellor but as a warning . " As regards the daily food , " he observes , " the date is in Africa what rice is in the fertile districts of Asia . The date palm is indigenous in all countries from the Tigris to the Atlantic , and it provides millions of human beings with daily sustenance both in Arabia and nearly the whole of North Africa . " He adds , moreover , that in various places even camels are fed with dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds to say that rice contains an unusual amount of starch , namely , between 83 and 85 per cent. , and that dates possess precisely the same nutritious substances , with the single difference that the starch is already converted into sugar . In his opinion this observation is a revelation , for in India , as in Egypt , he beholds the people , devoid of all will , yielding themselves completely to the priesthood . Only those who have not observed the effects of wine and other alcoholic beverages , or of tea , coffee , tobacco , and narcotic substances in general , either on themselves or others , will deny that the nature of the food reacts upon the mental powers of man , that the temperament evoked by different sorts is different . But we are still far from having ascertained anything in regard to the permanent effects of daily food , especially as the human stomach has to a great degree the power of accommodating itself to various food substances , so that with use even narcotics lose much of their effect . Lastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that the old Egyptians were date-eaters . We are far from disputing that they knew and cultivated date palms , for we should be at once met by an appeal to their ancient monuments , which bring their daily // life before us as in a picture book . But we deny that the date was a constant or even an important article of food ; on the contrary , we maintain that it was only an auxiliary or supplementary food of the Pharaonic people.2 Buckle can hardly suppose that the Joseph of Bible history gathered up dates into the royal garners during the seven years of plenty . Nor can he imagine that during the years of scarcity Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy dates . When , in the days of Moses , Divine plagues were inflicted upon Egypt a hailstorm destroyed , not the date groves , but the barley and the flax , and spared the other crops , which had had not yet sprung up . The date is the daily food only in the date oases of Arabia , and to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fezzan , and Southern Algeria ? that is to say , on the edge and in the midst of the Sahara ; there it trains up independent and warlike desert tribes which gave not the most remote mental relationship to the rice-eating Hindoos , but are of a completely different character . Indirectly we can ascertain that religious creations are in no way dependent on the kind of nourishment used by the population . These same Hindoos , whose unbridled fancy created during the epic times the most atrocious deities , were also the greatest story-makers that ever existed . It has long been known that the series of stories , which is of Indian origin , reached the West under the title of the Thousand and One Nights through the Arabs , and that besides this collection there are whole series of narratives which are sometimes put into the mouth of a skeleton , or of a clever parrot , or a wooden image which has suddenly come to life . Buckle recognizes in the numerical exaggerations of the 1-Iindoos , with their countless ages of the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of fifty-one places , a servile reverence for remote antiquity ; we are more inclined to discern in this a predisposition for arithmetic , for the same people who played so eagerly with quantitative conceptions , benefited human culture by the contri- 314 The Zone of the Founders of Religions . bution of an educational instrument second only to the invention of written characters , namely , the art of indicating the value of the numbers by their position , or , as we are wont carelessly to express ourselves , the invention of Arabic numeration . We are by no means the first to point out the obvious fact that the creation of religious and of profane fictions are merely to be regarded as different manifestations of the same intellectual capacity . Nations possessed of epic and dramatic creative powers , and those which are fond of building , painting , and sculpture , have also the faculty and the impulse requisite to people an Olympus with varied figures , which are either cheerful or gloomy according to the predominant disposition of their authors . But it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to the rice-eating Hindoos . Fictions and legends of striking power have been collected from the scanty population of Iceland . There grain no longer ripens , and shrubs alone will grow ; one single mulberrytree , standing in a sheltered situation at Akreyri , is proudly exhibited by the natives as the tree of the island . The people live only on animal food , the produce of cattle-breeding and fishing . Even were it admitted that many of the beautiful legends were only preserved by the Icelanders , and were derived from their old northern home , it is certain that a great number were invented in ' Iceland itself ; even had they originated in Norway , cattle-breeding and fishery decidedly predominated there also , and in former times far more than now . Hence we perceive that the activity of the imagination is quite independent of whether the daily aliment consists exclusively of vegetable or animal substances . It would appear from this that there is no apparent connection between the greater precariousness of life at any given place of abode , or between the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , find something serviceable where we should least expect it , among the old Arabian geographers . Although they were disciples of the Alexandrian Greeks , and familiar with the Ptolemaic division into degrees , in their popular expositions of their science they nevertheless distributed the earth into climates , or , as we are wont to express it , into climatic zones . These zones were not always of the same breadth , but were about // seven degrees , more or less . Each zone was supposed to possess certain products , animal , vegetable , and mineral , in special perfection ; even towards the close of the Middle Ages , our schoolmen believed that black men were to be found only on or close to the equator , and that gold and precious stones never occur beyond the limits of the second zone . In the language of this systematic error , Shemseddin , 3 who was named after his native city of Demeschqi ( Damascus ) , stated that people of light colour and high intellectual endowments are limited to the third and fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north latitude , and that in these zones were born all great founders of religion , philosophers , and scholars , himself included . This zone begins a little to the south of the parallel of Mecca ( 21 ? 21 ' ) a great deal to the south of the parallel of Kapilavastu ( 27 ? ) , the birthplace of Buddha Gautama ; on the other hand , its northern margin does not include Rai ( Raghes ) near Teheran , and still less Balch ( Bactra ) . As we have already mentioned it was in one of these towns that Zoroaster was born . Yet there is some truth in the observation of the Arabian geographers , that the founders of the higher and still existing religions , Zoroaster , My s , Buddha , Christ , and Mohammed belong to the subtropical zone . For the birthplace of the latest of the prophets alone falls within the tropics , though only by about seventy-four miles . We make no mention of Confucius , not on account of the high latitude of his birthplace in the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we should degrade the other founders of religion were we to reckon the Chinese moralist among their numbers . The fact that the zone of religious founders does not lie within temperate latitudes , might be explained by the supposition , that it was only in the presence of advanced intellectual development that mankind was able to add a yet higher dignity to human existence by allegiance to ideal objects , and that it was exactly in the subtropical climates that the most ancient social organizations had flourished . But even when civilization in its advance had passed outside the tropics , subtropical Asia still remained the fruitful parent of religions . Christianity did not 316 The Zone of the Founders of Religions . make its appearance in the over-refined European empire of the Romans , but in Palestine . Islam came into existence six hundred years later , not in Byzantium , but in Arabia . In the cold of the temperate zone , man has always been obliged to struggle hard for his existence , working more than praying , so that the burden of the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm countries , on the contrary , where Nature facilitates the acquisition of the necessaries of life , and the sultry hours of mid-day prohibit any bodily exertions , opportunities for mental absorption are far more abundant . The place of abode is not however quite without influence on the direction taken by religious thought . The three monotheistic doctrines , Judaism , Christianity , Islam , originated with the Semitic nations , yet the tendency of the race was not exclusively to monotheism , for other Semites , such as the Phoenicians , Chaldeans , and Assyrians , took other courses , while even among the Jews reversions to polytheism were frequent , and in Egypt especially the people , of God sank completely into idolatry . The perpetual reappearance of monotheism received powerful support from the surrounding scenes of nature . All who have been in the desert extol its beneficent influence on the health and spirits . Aloys Sprenger declares that the air of the desert invigorated him more than that of the high Alps or of the Himalayas , and in a letter to the author he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their remarkable historical character . In the boundless plains , the imagination which guides the youth of men is filled with images quite different from those suggested by forest country . The thoughts thus acquired are rather noble than numerous ; out of his own consciousness of power man evolves for himself a yet bolder personality ? a personal God by whom he is guided in his wanderings . " Lastly , in nomadic life , it frequently happens that a herdsman roams about in solitude for weeks , tortured by hunger and thirst . Even the healthiest then suffers from illusions of the senses . In this state it often occurs that the forsaken wanderer hears voices speaking and calling to him ; hence in Arabic there is a special word Hdaif for voices of this sort . In Africa , again , Ragl , derived from Raddsclrol the man , signifies such anthropomorphous ocular illusions. // Every traveller who has crossed the deserts of Arabia and Asia Minor speaks enthusiastically of their beauties ; all praise their atmosphere and brightness , and tell of a feeling of invigoration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arched heavens and the unbounded expanse of plain a monotheistic frame of mind necessarily steals upon the children of the desert . The confusion of the Egyptian pantheon , the beautiful images of stone , the sacred animals , and human figures with emblematic heads and symbols , were not forgotten by Moses , the priest of Heliopolis , until he fled to Sinai , the oldest rock known to geology , and which , according to Oscar Fraas , is still uncovered by the smallest particle of any more recent formation , seeming as if it had never been submerged beneath the sea , had never risen up , never moved . Here in the wilderness it was necessary that the old Jewish race , with its Egyptian paganism , should be buried , before monotheism as a result of the thoughts and sights of the desert , could rise and strengthen itself in a new race . In other parts of the Scriptures the healthy influence of the desert is likewise testified . The zealous Elijah retired into the desert ; John the Baptist also preached in the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raiment of camel 's hair , and living on locusts and wild honey . Christ also prellared himself for his career by passing forty days and forty nights in the desert . Lastly , Mohammed , although born in a city , imbibed the milk of a. , Bedouin fostermother , lived for a long time as a shepherd , and in his caravan journeys crossed the deserts between his own country and Palestine . The pilgrimages to Mecca , although far more ancient than Islam , are of no little service in strengthening the faith , inasmuch as they are preceded by a journey across the desert . But even independently of this , the followers of the Prophet live in the vicinity of deserts , for the doctrine of Mohammed has spread almost exclusively in the zone of Eastern Monsoons , and only in very late times extended into Africa as far as the Soudan . In India it was unable to extend beyond very narrow limits , and that only with political assistance . This is probably all that can be accurately ascertained in regard to the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious feeling of the population . The desert contributes 318 The Zone of the Founders of Religions . materially to awaking monotheism , because , from the dryness and clearness of its atmosphere , it does not expose the senses to all the attractive phantoms of forest scenery , the sunbeams as they play through the openings in the trees on the trembling and shining leaves , the marvellous forms of the gnarled branches , creeping roots , and storm-stricken trunks ; the creaking and sighing , the whispering and roaring , the hissing and rustling , and all the voices and sounds in wood and forest , amid which the illusion of an invisible animation is so apt to overcome us . Neither do curling mists sweep and steal over the desert as on damp meadow lands . These cloud forms , as they rise over the forests of New Guinea , are venerated by the nations of Doreh as visible manifestation of their good spirit Narvoje . It may therefore be asserted that with the extermination of the forests , not only is the climate of the locality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the axe . But if a sunny land is favourable to monotheistic emotions , yet at the same time every religious creation is but an expression of the mental endowments of the race . The Semites never possessed any genuinely epic literature , and their dramatic literature was extremely scanty , for they were destitute of the Aryan capacity for framing such productions . It would be an error to trace all the intellectual productions of nations to previous physical conditions alone . They axe assuredly subject to a normal course of development , and are nothing more than the necessary expression of a series of causes . But the historical destinies of the nations are certainly among these causes . " It is an old maxim , " says Delbriick , I " that it is in the experiences of life that each individual finds or loses his God . " THE RACES OF MANKIND . IN an earlier chapter we found that in any one race all the physical characters , such as the shape of the skull , the proportions of the limbs , and the colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the hair must not be considered a persistently distinctive mark , and hence that , in the classification Of the human species into groups or races , all the predominant characteristics must be taken into consideration . Though the limits of such groups are often easy , they are more often very difficult to define . W ' must not draw them where the common characteristics of one gr up merge by slight gradations into the couuuon characteristics of another group , for on historical authority such gradations must b traced to intermarriage , and would he represented by hybrids . 10n this principle we shall be obliged to sepaiite mankind into seven groups , races , sub-species , or species , whichever expression may be preferred . The first includes the inhabitants of Australia and Tasmania ; the second , the Papuans of New Guinea and the adjacent islands ; the third , the Mongoloid nations , among which we reckon not only the Asiatics of the Continent , but also the Malayo-Polynesians and the aborigines of America ; the fourth , the Dravida of Western India of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the sixth , the Negroes ; the last consists of the Mediterranean nations , answering to the Caucasians of Blumenbach . The vindication both of the separations and associations of this system of seven groups must be reserved for the chapters which treat of each respectively . Moreover , we hold it to be the duty of ethnology to estimate the social , moral , and 22 // intellectual development of the individual races . The maturity of the different social conditions of mankind does not , however , accurately correspond to the various endowments of races , but depends also on the advantageous or disadvantageous nature of the place of abode ; so that the reaction of this on the history of the civilization of each group of mankind must be considered . I. ? THE AUSTRALIANS . THE physical characters of the inhabitants of the continent of Australia , of the islands on the coast , and of Tasmania , separate these into a distinct group . With skulls of which the average index of breadth is 71 , and the index of height is 73 , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and phanerozygmatic . The nose is narrow at the root , widening greatly below , but does not curve as does that of the Papuans . The mouth is wide and unshapely . The third upper molar tooth has usually three roots , a formation which is of rare occurrence among Europeans . ' The body is thickly covered with hair ; the hairs , which are black , and in section are distinctly elliptical , stand out round the head , forming a shaggy crown ; but being weaker than those of the Papuans , they are frizzly , and have a tendency to become matted . In the peninsula of Coburg straight hair and obliquely set eyes are also to be met with , but these characters are due to intermixture with the Malay trepang-fishers who visit that part . Many of the natives of that district even speak the Macassar language ; ' rock inscriptions in Buginese or Macasssar characters also prove the presence of Malays.3 The colour of the skin is always dark , sometimes black ; sometimes , on the south and south-east coast , light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembled the Australians , except that the ? // growth of their hair was more Papuan in character , that is to say , more tuftecl.5 The few skulls that have been measured show a greater width as well as height , namely , 74 in both cases.6 The way in which they reached the island has puzzled many , for the Tasmanians are erroneously supposed to have had no boats . They had however raft-like canoes ; 7 nor was any great skill required for a migration of Australians across Bass 's Straits , which are studded with islands . The proof that such voyages were made is to be found in the circumstance that the Tasmanians bore scars on their skin of the same form as those of the Australians.8 Their island was colonized by Europeans in the year 1803 . The last native died in 1869 . The true history of their remorseless extermination has been told by an inhabitant of Tasmania . The nearest of kin to the Australians and Tasmanians are not the African negroes , and still less the aborigines of Western India , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are distinguished from them by the structure of their language , for the Australians employ no prefixes , defining the meaning of the root by suffixes . A few faint resemblances in the pronouns of the Australian and South Indian or Dravida languages , have induced Bieck , on very insufficient grounds , to infer a linguistic kinship between these peoples. ? In the Australian languages the words , which are polysyllabic , begin with a consonant and end with a vowel or'semi-vowel . " But , according to vocabulary , the Australian languages are separable into countless subdivisions . , It is therefore mor remarkable that the same family names around in West and South Australia and in Carpentarria . ' ' Although many Australian dialects are poor in numerical expressions , it is not the case that the natives were unable to distinguish larger numbers , for they use eighteen different terms for children , according to // whether the child designated is the first to the ninth-born boy , or the first to the ninth-born daughter . ' 3 Before discussing their intellectual and social condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abode . Nowhere can the retarded development of mankind be more readily accounted for by the unfavourable configuration of the country than in Australia . Situated in a remote region of the globe , and too small to constitute a world of its own , Australia was so much undervalued that , until quite recently , no civilization had approached it . It was the last of all the continents to be discovered . Of all the discoveries it was the longest neglected , that is to say , for full two hundred years ; and when it was first colonized by Europeans , it was thought only fit for a place of banishment for the outcasts of society . Its coast line is , with the exception of that of Africa , more circular than that of any other part of the world ; in other words , its circumference bears the smallest proportion to its superficies . Its only two projections are the peninsula of Carpentaria , or Cape York , and the island of Tasmania , which , as we have stated elsewhere , is a partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pointed projections of the other southern continents of South Africa and South America . Yet , however inadequate these projections may appear , one at least , Cape York , has exercised a great influence as the only path by which , till quite recently , Australia maintained any intercourse with higher civilizations . For Cape York is connected with New Guinea by a chain t of lofty rocky islands ; and as we must look upon Australia as originally uninhabited , and upon its present dusky population as the results of an immigration at a period immeasurably remote , the passage by Torres Straits must have been the most convenient route for tribes with little inclination for sea voyages . It is even possible that the Australians made their way from New Guinea to their present home on dry land ; for along the chain of islands the depth of the sea in Tones Straits is nowhere more than ten fathoms ( 6o feet ) , ' 4 and the bottom may easily have sunk as much as this oince the appearance of man , for in Sardinia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found mixed with marine testacea and mud in a fossil state . The vocabularies collected by the scientific expedition under Captain Blackwood prove , moreover , that the tribes at Cape York speak a language allied to that of the inhabitants of the islands in the Endeavour Straits , of the Murray Islands , and likewise of Masid and Errub , all of which lie to the east of the entrance to Torres Straits.ls Thus , if we follow the track of the language we arc led on almost to the coast of New Guinea . The Papuans , who inhabit these islands , are distinguished from the Australians by such distinct racial characters that , as Jardine has observed , a practised eye can easily discern among the Australians of Cape York the huge figures of individual emigrants from New Guinea ; nevertheless , from these migrations , which take place even now , and from the above-mentioned traces of affinity of language , we see that there has always been communication between New Guinea and Cape York ; these facts are the only indications of the road by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This at once justifies us in attributing historical importance to the peninsula of Cape York , the only medium by which the continent of Australia in some degree maintains its now very broken connection with the Old World . It was only by t is same channel , by which it received its first human inhabitants , that , till recently , it received a few products of a rude civilization . For , notwithstanding their bloodthirstiness and cannibalism , the Papuans of New Guinea are in comparison to the Australians a refined people , whose spacious , dwellings appear like stately palaces beside the leaf huts of 4 ) . Australians . Some of them have already rendered the tribes of Cape York familiar with the use of the bow and arrow , which considerably increases the certainty of their aim . To the Papuans also is due the great improvement in shipbuilding that has taken place , for the old bark canoes are now supplanted by long pirogues with outriggers , after the Papuan model ; and , lastly , the first rudiments of husbandry have spread from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although these are limited to the planting of tubers . // and other edible roots . ' 6 So that if Europeans had appeared in the Indian Ocean some five hundred years later , and had the Australians longer enjoyed their insular repose , the influence of the Papuan tribes might very easily have raised the inhabitants of this continent to a state which would have placed them on a level with the nobler hunting tribes of South America . According to the conjecture of one of our greatest authorities on Australia , the elevation of the surface of the sea by only a few hundred feet would he sufficient to resolve this continent into clusters of numerous islands , for the mountainous districts which mainly lie on the margin round the central plains are in many places separated by depressed tracts of low country.I7 There are , however , some plateaux in the heart of the country . ' s So far as we are as yet acquainted with Australia , its most striking feature is the absence of lofty mountain chains , and consequently of great rivers . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of projections arid indentations of outline , are combined with a want of variety in its elevation . Unfortunately , also , its greatest elevations , the so-called Alps , which reach an altitude of 7000 feet , are situated in the most remote corner of the continent , while the only great river system , of which some thousand miles have proved navigable for steamers , lies on the side most distant from the civilized regions of the Old World . The highest mountains of Australia , or , we might rather say , the eastern slopes of the continent , resembling in form the Ghauts of India , are moreover directly hurtful to the continent , for the lofty coasts of the east intercept the damp monsoon , forcing it to deposit its rain on their slopes , so that it reaches the plateaux considerably exhausted and able to bring them only a very small amount of moisture . If in place of this range a high chain of mountains had risen on the western margin of the continent , as in South America , while the eastern margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undulating , a river , if not so magnificent as the Amazon , yet of the size of the Orinoco , would have been developed , and the natives of its shores might perhaps have reached the grade of the Brazilian hunting tribes . By the exploration of about two-thirds of the surface of Australia , the old delusion has been exploded that the interior is entirely occupied by a desert void of vegetation . If Australia really possesses a Sahara , it must be a very limited one , confined to the centre of the western arm of the continent . All the other districts enjoy a short but violent rainy season . In the centre of the continent Mackinlay 2 ? found himself stopped , if not seriously endangered , by floods ; for on nearly half the horizon nothing but an unbounded surface of water was to be seen , from which projected only the tallest trees and a few island-like elevations of ground . J. M. Gilmore experienced the same in the extreme west of Queensland . " This sudden discharge of moisture from the atmosphere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks after the inundations the soil is again parched with drought . In consequence of this irregular distribution of moisture , the known part of Australia 22 consists mainly of grass land , with park-like woods or trees bordering the rivers , although great tracts of brushwood are frequent This would not in itself have been prejudicial to the development of human society had it not been combined with the unprepitious geological structure of Australia . The appearance of t tertiary strata has as yet been noticed in two places only . The rocks are either crystalline or their strata belong to the earliest ages , seldom more recent than the carboniferous period , and arc scarcely ever as old as the variegated sandstone . This implies in other words that this portion of the globe has never been submerged since the secondary and tertiary periods , but has been exposed without regeneration or reparation to all the depredations of the atmosphere , and has thus lost more // and more of the charms of its original form . The highest part of its mountainous formations of the primary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aqueous action , and thus have been levelled towards the general surface . Even this would not have been so injurious had not the communication by land which existed between Australia and the great mainland of the Old World also been interrupted . But the isolation of Australia took place at an immature period , namely , when the development of the fauna had advanced only to the stage of marsupials and rodents , and not as far as the ungulates . While in the Old World the continued struggle for existence secured improved animal forms by a ? progressive advancement , to which those of the archaic marsupial character were obliged almost completely to give way , the struggle in Australia was confined within much narrower limits , and hence , with slight alterations , its animal creation remained stationary at the point which it had reached when the isolation first took place . The most ancient continent of the world shelters the oldest mammalian forms . First we notice the absence of carnivora , for the dingo , or Australian dog , probably immigrated only with man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , as might be conjectured from the discoveries of their remains in ancient bone-caves , they entered Australia before mankind , this occurred , nevertheless , within a recent geological period . As powerful antagonists , beasts of prey exercise a favourable effect on the education of mankind , so that their absence forms one of the disadvantages of the place of abode . The absence of ungulates is yet more to be regretted , for it at once barred man from the possibility of raising himself to the highest grade of civilization . With the exception of the dog , probably no Australian animal has allowed itself to be tamed ; a certain degree of intelligence seems to be requisite when an animal is to be received into the society of man as his supporter or assistant , and the deficiency of intellect in marsupials renders them unfit for this purpose . As we all know , Australia is especially adapted for the breeding of sheep , cattle , horses , and camels , but these creatures , which are so The Struggle for Existence in Australia . 329 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was unconnected with the Old World . It may , therefore , be truly said of Australia that it is an island without the advantages of an island climate , a country of productive steppes without the ungulates of the steppes , a land of insular tranquillity , or , in other words , of a languid struggle for existence , and an asylum for animal and vegetable forms of past ages . But if we correctly understand the processes of animated nature , quiet involves stagnation , for the mammalian forms of Australia seem like living fossils when compared with those of the Old World . When the first ship landed animals from the Old World , the seclusion of Australia was over and it ceased to be an island , for a bridge , although only a flying one , again united it with the Old World ; then the prematurely interrupted struggle for existence was renewed , but it was now between creatures armed and adapted for fighting and others unused to strife : it was inevitable that the last surviving and superseded forms of past ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in palaecontological books , and the kangaroo hunter ' disappear with the kangaroo . This has ever been the cotrse of Nature ; always eager in pursuit of novelty , it acknowled es only the right of the strongest , and the strongest must always be something new ; were the newer the weaker , it would be supressed almost before it came into being . European travellers ; ' landing in Australia have always met with natives or their traces . Where one explorer perchance fancied that he was passing through a desert , on the same spot the next corner found himself surrounded with blacks . In the remarkable lake district which Stmt assumed to be an uninhabited region , Mac Kinlay in his journey across the continent in 1861 , 62 , was surprised by the density of the population ; the latter in turn found no natives between 26 " and 22 " south latitude , though almost at the same time Macllouall Stuart , in his second journey through Australia , found himself , six degrees more to the east , in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact centre of Australia , on the 3rd of March . On the 5th of January , 1861 , shortly before reaching the tropics , Burke and Wills also perceived fresh traces of natives whom they actually met further to the north . Leaving the inhabitants of the peninsula of Carpentaria out of // consideration , we find the tribes of the mainland in very different stages of civilization , and differing also very materially in physical respects . Hitherto the piteous objects at King George 's Sound , in the south-west corner of the continent , of which Dumont d'Urville procured drawings , have been generally regarded as samples of Australian humanity . We were wont to imagine them emaciated skeletons , with narrow pelvises even in the women , meagre feeble limbs , and swollen , bellies ; but according to all explorers the type improves towards the interior . In the lake district , at the north-east limit of South Australia , MacKinlay found the handsomest tribes that he had seen on the continent . Landsborough in April , 1862 , in 23 ? south latitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stuart in the north , met with natives whom they agree in describing as fine and powerful men . The settlers on the shores of Queensland also say that the natives of that district are well-built and strong-limbed . The social development visibly deteriorates both from north to south and from east to west ; that is to say , in proportion to the distance from Cape York , the chief point which has served to connect Australia with the Old World , the customary mode of life of the natives becomes more and more degraded . For example , before the introduction of the Papuan pirogue the tribes of the peninsula of Carpentaria had long possessed boats , although the best specimens were not better than the bark canoes of the Red Indians of North America . On the east coast of Queensland , observers on board H.M.S. Fly were unable to discover any such canoes south of Rockingham Bay , ( 18 ? south lat . ) ' In Botany Bay , Cook found that the natives had pieces of bark which served as boats , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s In the neighbourhood of Port Essington , on the north coast , the people used rude floats , and Ferd . Muller who , with Gregory , discovered the Victoria River and Sturt 's Creek , also observed among the tribes of the interior only floats of two or three trunks , which , for fear of alligators , were used in crossing . Lastly , Gregory 's ship Dolphin , when lying behind Dampier Island , on // the north coast - (1861) , was visited by natives who used trunks of trees in their natural form instead of boats . The Australians of the south coast have not been met with on the sea . James Browne z6 assures us that the West Australians of Swan River are not only destitute of any boats , but are even unable to swim . At King George 's Sound the natives have only leaves for roofs ; they *read a covering of leaves over curved stakes , the ends of which are inserted in the ground . In New South Wales , Queensland , and on the shores of the Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground serves as a protection from the weather for a single person , or several pieces of bark spread upon a framework of stakes gives shelter to several . Thus the Australian builds no permanent dwelling , but lives as a roving hunter in a tent made of leaves or bark . Yet in West Australia there are wooden ' huts and spacious buildings in the peninsula of Coburg , and others with two storeys in the Cape York district . ' In the two latter cases , however , the favourable influence of Malays and Papuans may be inferred . The Australians when first di covered were living in the age of unpierced stone implements . heir arms and hunting weapons were projectiles , the most important being the spear , of which the point was either hardened n the fire for hunting purposes , or provided with barbed hoc s for harpooning fish , or armed with sharp flints or shells for fighting purposes . The boomerang is found among all the tribes of the north , west , south , and east coasts , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes on the Lower Murray . Shields for defensive purposes are used by all the tribes both on the coast and in the interior , except in West Australia . The people of the east coast manufacture lines and hooks for lisping , the latter being made of birds ' claws or mussel shells , while on the west coast nets are used for fishing purposes.The wish to cover the body as a matter of sentiment is as yet unfelt in Australia , but on the west , south , and east coasts , cape-like cloaks , made of the skins of animals , are . r // thrown round the shoulders as a protection against bad weather . Many tribes also fasten straps round their loins , which are drawn tighter in times of scarcity in order to diminish the feeling of emptiness . An attempt at clothing is first met with at Cape York , where the influence of the Papuans is evident.39 The monuments and works of art of the Australians consist almost solely of decorations of burying-places , and of hollow boat-like coffins , which latter do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing the body of a child was noticed by MacDouall Stuart on May 12th , 1861 , in the Ashburton mountains , in the northern half of Australia , and is described by him as the most artistic native production he had seen . There are also figures of men and animals drawn in chalk and ochre on the rocks of the Victoria River , which were observed by Gregory and Miiller 3 ? in 1856 , as well as still more remarkable etchings , an inch in depth , on the rocks of the east coast ; in those , for instance , at Camp Cove , near Sydney , rude outlines of men and animals may be discerned . The women of the tribes on the Murray , and in New South Wales , showed great dexterity in plaiting baskets of rushes . In the previous enumeration of weapons , we purposely omitted to mention the wummera , or throwing-stick , an invention common to all Australian tribes without exception , and indicates much greater intelligence than the boomerang , which , although more surprising on account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the discovery of which was probably the result of accident . The throwing-stick fastened to the palm of the hand , or held by the three last fingers , and provided at the fore end with a diagonal groove in which the spear is laid , doubles the throwing power of the human arm . If it be imagined , says Jukes , that the forefinger is the same length as the throwing-stick , and that while the spear is held with the thumb and middle finger , the last joint of the forefinger is bent round the end of the spear , this explains the increase given by the throwing-stick to the initial velocity of the spear.3 ? Unfortunately , it can not be positively ascertained that the Australians did not borrow this invention , for the New // Caledonians also use a throwing-sling , although not the throwingstick . A similar plan is followed in other places : by the Aleutians and their neighbours the Eskimo , and was used by the ancient Mexicans.32 The factithat the intelligence of the Australians is by no means contemptible has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages . If the profusion of forms briefly expressing minute relations were to decide the rank of a language , we and all the nations of Western Europe might envy the miserable tribes of King George 's Sound ; for their language possesses four more case-terminations than Latin , and a dual as well as singular and plural . The verb is as rich in tenses as Latin , and has also terminations for the dual , and three genders for the third person ; in addition to active and passive , it has reflective , reciprocal , determinative , and continuative forms . In point of structure of language , the highly cultured Polynesians , and even the ancient Chinese , must yield to the inventive . Australians . We also find among them attempts at poetry and the names of renowned poets . Although their sons are rude they nevertheless contain expressions which no long occur in daily intercourse.33 They have , moreover , many pretty and picturesque names for the constellations . They regard the ' Milky Way as a reflection of the River Darling , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clouds of Magellan as two old witches , transfixed to the sky for their crimes.34 The most surprising fact is that they have names for eight different winds . They are peculiarly inventive in expressions of courtesy , which they both require and bestow freely in conversation . We have already stated that a great dread of incest prevails amongst them , and that wife-stealing is therefore customary ; that they hold the duties of " vendetta " sacred , recognize property in immovable objects , and inherit the family name from the mother . Even in such a condition as that of the Australians , society is 334 ' The Australians. regulated by various institutions . The Australian languages are indeed said to be without an expression for chieftain , 35 and we look in vain among the western tribes for anything that might even in a broad sense be termed a priesthood . In New South Wales and in Queensland , which are the most highly civilized districts of Australia , we find on the other hand the Koradshi , who have so far discarded the vulgar terror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graves of dead men . By their Shamanistic arts they are likewise able to give comfort and reassure sick people , and they also know how to apply slight palliatives , blood-letting among others . It is a curious fact that among the wretched people of the west coast , the inviolability of ambassadors is respected till the gaping wound by which such a messenger is marked is completely healed.36 Experience in Queensland and New South Wales shows that the modern Australians were quite capable of rising to a higher condition , for in those parts many learnt to speak English with fluency and correctness , became skilful and bold riders , and as shepherds were preferred to Europeans , on account of their adroitness in the bush , and also because it was found possible to train them into efficient guards for the more remote runs . That their condition has hardly improved is partly due to the isolation of their native land , which impeded any contact with other nations . Hence the inhabitants of Cape York were first influenced by Papuan immigrants , and they in their turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the east coast , according to Angas , all the new popular songs , and the dances which accompany them , have been propagated from the north in a southerly direction.37 But the degraded condition of the Australians is principally due to their ignorance of agriculture , while they are not strictly maritime people like the Fuegians and the Eskimo . They were thus obliged to content themselves with the produce of the chase , with the fish and shellfish which they were able to obtain on the seacoast and the banks // of the rivers , and with the nutriment afforded by wild roots . While thus dependent on chance from day to day , man does not as yet recoil from cold-blooded animals , such as caterpillars , lizards , alts , and worms . As hunters destitute of bows and arrows , even the throwing-stick would not have ensured them against frequent times of scarcity had'they not made great use of prairie fires . But the chase itself necessitated frequent change of abode . When the pools left by the last rainy season began to dry up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repair to the well-known spots where water still remained in deep pools . Thus it may perhaps be the steppe-like nature of the country which has kept the natives from agriculture in any form . Recent explorers who , though hardy and meritorious , were usually uneducated men , have frequently stated that Australian grass consists of oat and barley grass . It would be natural to suppose that in such an extensive and sunny region of steppes some wild species of cereals should exis , 38 and this is actually the case , and in relatively , if not absolutely , greater variety than in America . ' Thus in the marshes near Stuffs Creek and on the Victoria , Ferdinand Muller , the botonist , found wild rice , which the natives ground between two ; g ones , and the edible seeds of a wild cereal of the genus Pannicum , or millet , and occasionally in North-western Australia a species of wild oat . On April 28th , 1861 , MacDouall Stuart , in his second attempt to cross the con tinent , discovered at Tomkinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grains were smaller and the straw much tougher . In the autumn of 1861 , when staying near the remarkable lake district between 28 ? and 26 ? south latitude somewhat to the east of the longitude of Adelaide , MacKinlay noticed a leguminous vetch-like plant growing on the lands covered by the floods of the rainy season . The natives swept up the fallen seeds , cleaned them by winnowing , ground them to flour , and baked them into flat cakes . It is probable from the same seed that the tribes on Cooper Creek made the Nardu bread , with which they for a time prolonged the lives of those unfortunate men , Burke and Wills , // who were the first persons to cross the continent of Australia , on their return from Cape York . Howitt , who there rescued King , their last surviving companion , describes ( Cooper 's Creek , Sept. 1st , r86r ) , the plant which probably produces the Nardu seeds as resembling clover in foliage , but covered with a silvery down , which envelops the seeds also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are flat and almost oval , literally cover the ground , and when they have been separated from the sand , they are crushed by the natives and made into bread.39 These facts are of great importance , as proving that the manufacture of flour and the baking of bread are older than agriculture . Various reasons may be adduced to show how it happened that the natives never thought of multiplying these useful products by artificial cultivation , thus supplying themselves with provisions , diminishing their dependence on the produce of the chase , freeing themselves from the necessity for wandering , and consequently rendering it possible to rear a more numerous posterity . Australia , especially in the tropical parts , possesses a great variety of fruit trees , so that scarcely any explorers return without bringing home some new or nominally new discovery of this description . Even bananas are said to grow wild in the Carpentaria country , and in the north , Ferdinand Muller came upon a grape-bearing creeper which he considers identical with our vine . In the south , the so-called Hottentot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesembryanthemum , is a natural article of food . The adoption of agriculture by the Australian people was , however , delayed less by the fruits , which remain in an edible condition only for a short time , than by edible roots , which , unlike the cereals , required no careful preservation . The peninsula of Carpentaria produces the true yam ( Dioscorea Carpentaria ) , while the south yields the roots of the sorrel , an oxalis , and the grass-tree , which is a species of Xanthorhea . The root of the latter is dug up by the women with pointed sticks , and is always kept as the last resource in case of failure of the chase . On the Swan River , on the west coast , kangaroos are so plentiful in places , that when the natives were promised ninepence a head for them , they brought in such // a number that the settlers fed their pigs with them . The late James Morill , who lived for seventeen years among the coast tribes of Queensland , near Cape Bowling Green , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Australian society was not yet ripe for the transition to agriculture , that is to say , was not sufficiently dense , for the population is estimated at not more than 200,000 , by many at only 6o,000 , for which the hunting grounds were more than adequate . Yet the digging up of roots is so troublesome , and the food so little nutritious , that it appears strange that as , by the abundant growth of the cereals enumerated , Nature had so clearly shown them the method and the advantages of agriculture , the Australians should never have thought of putting seeds into the ground . It is only because habit has blunted our apprehension of the extraordinary , that we fail to perceive that an unusual degree of intelligence is implied by the first scattering of seed in the expectation of a result . The ancient Greeks , who were nearer to the first movements of human civilization than we are , and from whom the A'reat first- steps were not hidden , regarded a purposive invention of agriculture as beyond the intellectual powers of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A the Egyptians , amongst other honours , gave to their Osiris the credit of having taught mankind the art of sowing seed . The first cultivation of plants , even if practised only by migratory hordes in their summer quarters , contains the germ of all future progress , for man then ceases to depend on the chance of finding a supply of natural roots . When his strength is not perpetually exhausted by the exertion of hunting , man has time left for the invention of improvements . The high degree of intelligence often met with in hunting tribes is quite absorbed by the chase itself , as it is constantly and keenly directed to the observation of the nature of both the game and the hunting ground . The chase is also fatiguing to the body , so that in default of some other mode of gaining a maintenance , intellectual development , which always requires physical repose , is out of the question . 23 // IL ? THE PAPUANS OF AUSTRALIA AND ASIA . THE Papuans of Australia include the inhabitants of New Guinea , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Solomon group , the New Hebrides , New Caledonia , with the adjacent Loyalty Islands , and lastly of the Fiji archipelago . The distinctive characters of their race are preserved in the greatest purity in New Guinea , although even there , especially in the western half , intermixtures with the Asiatic Malays have recently taken place . In the other islands mentioned , the Polynesians have intruded themselves among the older populations , and have materially influenced the language and manners , but their influence upon the physical characters has been much less , so that the inhabitants of the Pelew and Fiji groups , as well as of New Caledonia , may be unhesitatingly reckoned among the Papuan race . In the Carolines and Mariannes , or Ladrones , Polynesian and Papuan blood is intermingled , but the former preponderates , so that , as hybrids , these so-called Micronesians are more correctly placed in the next group of nations . The most distinctive mark of the Australian Papuans is their peculiarly flattened , abundant , and long hair , which grows in tufts and surrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight inches high , which is however probably much aided by constant care and the aid of a three-pronged comb. = This tufted matting of the hairs is also common to the Hottentots , whose hair does not however grown so long or so thick ; perhaps close miscroscopic comparison would show different causes for the tendency . The Papuans are also distinguished from the aborigines of the Cape by the abundant growth of their beard , and by their general hairiness . ' The skin of all Papuans is dark , almost black in New Caledonia , brown or chocolate colour in New Guinea , blue-black at Fiji , this peculiar colour being due to the growth of a light- // coloured down upon the skin . Welcker 's measurements show that the New Caledonians have an index of breadth of 7o , an index of height of 77 ; in other Papuans the numbers are 73 for the one and 75 for the other , which show that the form of the skull is narrow and high . This agrees with the results obtained by Barnard Davis in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hebrides , and New Caledonia ; he found 72 as the index of breadth and 76 ? 79 of height . The Papuans must therefore also be ranked as dolichocephals . The jaws are prognathous , although not to so great a degree as occurs in extreme cases among negroes . The lips are fleshy and somewhat intumescent . The broad nose is hooked , giving the countenance the Jewish cast noticed by all observers . It is noticeable in the inhabitants of New Caledonia and of Annatom in the New Hebrides , 4 in the Fijians , and in the inhabitants of Errub and Darnley Islands , s of the north coast of New Guinea near Dorey , 6 of the south coast on the River Utanata , 7 a d , lastly , of the P.elew Islands. $ , We gather from descriptions that the Papuans , independent of local variations , are of medium stature , or at least certainly not tall . Wallace considers the inhabitants of the is ands on the coast of New Guinea , such as Waigiou and Mysol , and likewise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Larat and Timor-Laut , to be pure Papuans , while we find on the more westerly islands , on the Molucca group , including Halmahera , the Banda Islands , the eastern half of Floris , as well as on Chandana and all the islands to the east of it , the remains of an aboriginal population , once belonging to the Papuan race , but now much mixed with Malay blood . It is far more difficult to determine the race of the aboriginal population of the Philippines and those islands which on geological grounds must be assigned to Asia and not to // Australia.9 We shall not adopt the ordinary names of Melanesians , Alfurs , Harafurs , Negritos or Australian negroes , for all these appellations have been so loosely used that their application has become ambiguous . ' O For instance , certain Alfurs on the island of Celebes are described as having physical characters which clearly show that they are Malays ; and it has become customary in the Dutch settlements to describe as Alfurs any so-called savages , even when they are undoubtedly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumatra , and of the Dyaks of Borneo . " We therefore prefer to call the remnants of the aboriginal population of these islands Asiatic Papuans . To these belong the Aeta of the Philippines , who have preserved their racial characters in full purity ; but this applies only to the few bands on the northeastern shore of Luzon . In Petermann 's Mittheilungen for 1876 , Dr. Meyer proves that the so-called Negritos of the Philippines are pure Papuans . Karl Semper found their average stature to be 4 feet 7 inches in the case of men , and 4 feet 4 inches in that of women . In common with the Australian Papuans , they have woolly crimped crowns of lustreless hair and flat noses widening below . Their skin is not black , as the Malay name of Aeta would lead us to expect , but of a dark copper-colour . The lips are a little intumescent , and the jaws slightly prognathous . These hunting tribes , unlike Malays , use bows and arrows.12 If we may judge from a photograph copied by Jagor , I3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of Luzon might be classed as Aeta . At present we should be justified in classing this aboriginal people , which has now been supplanted and nearly extirpated by the Malays , with the Australian Papuans . We assign to them the value of a subdivision , but it is as a precaution , for we require more accurate researches than have yet been made to enable us finally to decide as to the position of their race . Several skulls which reached Berlin through Schetelig // as those of Negritos of the island of Luzon , had , according to Virchow 's measurements , a relative breadth of 8o ? 8 to 9o ? 6 , with a relative height of 77.6 to 82 ' 3 . They were therefore brachycephalic , of small height , prognathism , chiefly due to the position of the alveoli , was strongly marked in them , and the zygomatic arches were very prominent . The skulls were too greatly brachycephalic not to render us doubtful as to their relationship with the Papuans of Australia . It is quite possible that the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly suspects . Moreover , Karl Semper states that the skulls in question all came from the mountains of Mariveles in the neighbourhood of Manila , the population of which has long ago lost its purity by intermixture . ' 4 Scattered remnants of a former aboriginal population of Papuan race were also seen by Wallace at Sohoe ( Soho ) and Galela on Halmahera . They have the Papuan crown of hair , are bearded , and are hairy on the body , but are at the same time as fair as the Malays.IS Lastly , far to the westward are the Mincopies 16 of the Andaman Islands , a small race of men resembling the Papui ns in the growth of their hair . As they shave their heads quite si both with shells or the fragments of broken glass which are occasionally washed upon the shore , this statement may appear somewhat strange , I7 yet the tufted matting of the hair was observed on Mincopie prisoners at Moulmein , ' by A. Fytche , who ' describes their skin as " sooty , not black , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend exclusively on the character of the hair may regard the Mincopie as , the western advanced post of the Papuan race , and must suppose that the latter , at some remote period , spread from the mainland of Southern Asia eastwards to the Australian Ocean . This would be as good as proved , if , on account of their abundant beards and frizzly hair , accompanied , according to Logan 's description , by a brown or black complexion , we may class the Semangs of the peninsula of // Malacca , who are a diminutive race of men , physically and intellectually feeble , and now in process of extinction , with the Asiatic Papuans . Latham , who has investigated their language , classes them with the Negritos , which according to him implies relationship with the Aetas , and he scarcely admits that they bear any resemblance to the Andamanese , but places them unhesitatingly in the Malay group.2 ? The languages of the Australian Papuans make use of roots of one or more syllables , and effect the definition of meaning by prefixes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally disappeared . Herr von d . Gabelentz , who examined and compared the languages of ten Papuan islands , discovered , amid all other differences in the vocabularies , an agreement in the mode of word structure . Besides this , a relationship with the Polynesian languages was everywhere shown ; at any rate , the personal pronouns were analogous , and also several adverbs of place and a large number of prefixes . Among the latter is fat a , which appears in all Papuan and Polynesian languages only as a prefix , but in Fiji may still be used as an independent word or as a suffix.21 The investigation led to the general conclusion that the Papuan languages have more in common with the Polynesian than could arise from merely borrowing from one another . These unquestionable facts involve a great problem , for from the agreement of the languages a common origin was inferred in the case of two races which are very distinctly separated by their physical characters . But the results obtained by Herr von d . Gabelentz admit of another interpretation . The vocabularies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the New Hebridean islands of Annatom , Tanna , Erromango , and Mallikolo , on Marre and Lifu in the Loyalty group , on the adjacent island of New Caledonia , and lastly in Bauro ( San Christoval ) and Guadacanar of the Salomon group . Intermixture with Polynesians in all these islands has been proved , in consequence of which the Papuans have adopted Polynesian customs and manners . A fuller examin- // ation of the Papuan languages of New Guinea than any which , as we believe , has yet been made , can alone explain the linguistic relationship . The Papuan of New Guinea is clearly distinguished from the reserved and cautious Malay by his noisy , talkative , petulant , and inquisitive nature , and by his constant restlessness . The Papuans of New Guinea , the Fiji group , and New Caledonia , cook in earthen vessels , which are never found among Polynesians . The inventive powers of the Fijians are shown by their habit of dyeing and stamping their clothing material made of bark ( Tapa ) , with gaudy patterns , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stencil-plates of banana leaves . The people of Humboldt 's Bay in New Guinea , when the Dutch sailors gave them paper and pencil , which they could certainly never have seen before , drew fishes and birds with a firm hand . " Wallace gives great weight to the fact that the Papuan decorates his house , his boat , and his utensils with carvings , and thus exhibits an artistic impulse of which the Malay race is almost entirely deficient. ' 3 But this latter is certainly only true of the Asiatic Malays , and in this case it may be ascribed to the circumstance that the trades and arts of semi-civilization were neglected and extinguisher after a lengthened commercial intercourse with nations of superior finement . The Polynesian Malays , on tie contrary , greatly excel all Papuans in artistic carvings and tatooings . These latter , as their wide distribution over the sea shows , ventured upon the ocean early and perhaps earlier than the Malays , but have since then been far outstripped by the latter in nautical skill . The Papuans use unpierced stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guinea the knowledge of iron ore and the art of smelting has . become general . From the filet that bellows with tubes and pumps of Malay type zs are used in the latter process , we may infer that this advance came from the West . After the age of maturity the women always wear the liku , or // fringed girdle ; among the men a cloth above the loins is customary , but on secluded shores and islands , a piece of bamboo , a rolled up leaf , a gourd , or a shell is considered sufficient for purposes of decency.z6 Complete nudity in men is rare , but is said to occur in New Ireland.27 Bows and arrows as hunting weapons are found only in New Guinea and its immediate vicinity . Captain Cook observed from a distance on the south coast of this island a tube in the hands of the natives , who placed it as if for taking aim , after which a cloud seemed to issue from its mouth . If a report had been heard at the same time we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Salomon Muller , a fine dust is blown from the tube , and signals are made by the direction of the cloud. $ The Papuans live on the produce of such agriculture as the cultivation of trees . They possess only seedless varieties of the bread-fruit tree , so that they must have borrowed it from other nations.29 Their fields and gardens are fenced . The New Caledonians build water conduits of great length to irrigate theseThey have no pigs , which with dogs are otherwise universal among the Papuans , and are their only domestic animals . This race has deeply degraded itself by cannibalism , which prevails in New Guinea , New Caledonia , the Fiji Islands , and probably in other parts inhabited by this race . Otherwise the Papuans of New Guinea and the smaller islands are praised for their chastity and morality , their respect for parents , and their brotherly affection.3 ' In the New Hebrides old people are buried alive , but it is probably , as in the Fiji Islands , at their own desire . The belief in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which man abandons this world is believed to be his condition in the next , premature death is preferred to total debilitation . The horrible scenes which Williams describes at // the burying of a living Fiji chief , whose wives were strangled at the same time , are not unfavorably explained by this superstition ; indeed the custom which is found in the Loyalty Islands of killing the mother or aunt of a loved dead child that it may not be quite forsaken in the other world , is almost pathetic.32 With this is closely connected the worship of the dead , whose skulls are set up as household gods , invoked for signs , and appealed to for assistance in difficult undertakings . This custom can not have been borrowed from the Polynesians , as it has been observed among the Papuans of New Guinea . In the latter place are found large , high , empty buildings , erected on piles , which are used as temples or places of devotion.33 The Papuans hold dualistic opinions , for they hurl all manner of imprecations at an evil being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the good guardian spirit , under the name of Narvoje.34 There are no professional Shamans among the nations of pure race , but each individual studies to interpret the future . The innocence of persons accused is tested by ordeal , either by boiling water or by prolonged immersion . In New Guinea , and wherever Polynesian visitors have not introduced their customs and social tenets , free om and equality prevail , and the power of the chiefs is therefore onnnal . The Papuan race has attained its highest intellectualpnd social development in the Fiji Islands , where , ewing to frecklent intercourse with the Tongans , it has very readily adapted a ' olynesian inventions and institutions . Among these are the drinking of Yakona , or Kava , the division into guilds or castes , and , lastly , the institution of taboo , which the chiefs have carefully fostered as a means of increasing their power . It is only necessary to trail their garments over the fields in order to consecrate to their own use all the produce which they had touched . The chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Fiji , bore the title of Gala-euva-ki-/a'i , or " subject to Heaven alone . " The small island despots were in constant strife , and their history is in many points comparable with that of the Peloponnesian war . A kind // of diplomatic corps existed at the various courts , and was familiar with political arts.35 When embassies were sent , sticks and nets were used to aid the memory . This seems a first attempt at symbolical embodiment of thought , and a proof of a need for writing . In the Pelew Islands strings with knots and loops serve for the exchange of news , or to authorize any commission entrusted to a third person . In the local dialect they are called rusl , and it is a significant fact that this word is now applied also to the letters of Europeans.36 The Fijians are polite and polished in their conversation : according to Williams , their languages contain expressions which exactly correspond to the French Monsieur and Madame.37 Even in presence of Europeans they retain a strong feeling of national pride , which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mythological fictions , which are recited in rhythm as well as rhyme , and in magniloquent language . A European , who told them the stories of the Arabian Nights , gained a considerable sum of money from his auditors . As in all Papuans , belief in a future life is so powerful that it leads to suicide and human sacrifice on the graves of the deceased . As a matter of course , this is accompanied by a worship of the dead , in addition to which Ndengei , the creator of the world and of mankind , is adored under the symbol of a serpent.39 Among their industrial inventions is a net , as a protection against mosquitoes : the neighbouring Polynesians have neither these nets nor earthen vessels , such as are made by the Fijians of red or blue clay , and are remarkable for their true and graceful outlines . Although in shipbuilding they are the pupils of the Polynesians , yet they manufacture canoes one hundred and eighteen feet long , and twenty-four feet wide , fit them with masts of sixty-eight feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these purposes their tools are only unpierced a t // stone axes , and rat 's teeth for the finer sculpture ; brain corals , and the skin of the sting ray are used as files , and , lastly , pumicestone for polishing . They have advanced so far in the science of war as to fortify their vilrages with moats or canals , and to lay in stores of food , nominally sufficient for four years . Unluckily , they are more inclined to cunning than to heroic courage , and they are also generally accused of craft , falsehood , and inordinate distrust . It is among this undoubtedly highly gifted and active people that cannibalism did and does especially prevail . III. ? THE MONGOLOID NATIONS . To this race belong the Polynesian and Asiatic Malays , the people of South-eastern and Eastern Asia , the inhabitants of Thibet , some of the hill tribes of the Himalayas , as well as all Northern Asiatics with their kinsmen in northern Europe , and , lastly , the ' aboriginal population of America . Their common characters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost complete absence of beard and hair on the body ; a dark-coloured skin , varying from a leather-like yellow to deep brown , or sometimes tending to red ; and prominent check-bones , generally accompanied by an oblique setting of the eyes . Their other characters occur in so many gradations that the local types pass into one another , as will be shown in each group . The linguistic characters alone afford grounds for subdivision . I.-THE MALAY RACE . The Malay languages are distinguishable by a community of roots but not of words . This indicates that the members of this family of nations separated before the structure of the language had assumed fixed principles . The primitive language itself developed independently and stood alone in the world . Its defining roots are sometimes placed before and sometimes after the main word . The Polynesian dialects are poorer in sounds and have remained more 34$ The Mongoloid Nations . archaic ; the Western or Asiatic dialects are richer , and in them the morphological and material elements of the groups of roots are at the same time more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this primitive language was developed was situated in South-eastern Asia , either on the great islands of the Sunda or on the projection of the continent . From this centre a portion of the family , now become maritime , swarmed out towards the east , peopling the islands of the South Seas as far as the Hawai group on the north , and Easter Island on the extreme east . This branch of the Malays came into frequent contact with the Papuans , thus giving rise to the hybrids which are cailed Micronesians . The time at which the Polynesian Malays separated from their Asiatic kinsfolk can not as yet be even approximately determined . An able botanist , Berthold Seemann , who was taken from us prematurely , has indeed remarked that the palm wine , which is obtained from the sheath of the cocoa-nut tree blossom , is called toddy , or taddy , by the Malays of the Sunda Islands . As this word is derived from Sanscrit , 2 it would appear to have been the Brahminical Hindoos who first introduced the important art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , as the cocoa-nut palm probably spread from east to west , and occurs in all tropical islands of the South Seas , as its nuts are the daily food of the inhabitants of the atolls , or coral groups , and its milk is often the only means of appeasing thirst , it is hardly credible that if the Polynesians before their migration knew the secret of preparing palm wine , they should ever have disused it . But as this beverage was entirely unknown to them at the time of the first visits of Europeans , their emigration must have taken place before the arrival in Java of Sanscrit-speaking Indians , hence certainly before the beginning of the era of the Saka or Salivana , which was introduced about the year 78 B.c.3 But this argument points to a period too recent . The evolution of the varieties of the language required a far greater lapse of time . We may also add that the // art of manufacturing earthen vessels was not yet known to the Polynesians in their original home at the time of their migration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated stones . On the other hand , the custom of consecrating persons or things so that they mhst not be touched was already established in this original abode , for traces of the institution of taboo are still preserved in the form of interdicts in the island of Timor and among the Dyaks of Borneo.4 The prevalent eastern monsoons and westward currents offered no insurmountable obstacles to the eastward diffusion of the Polynesians from the west , for there are plenty of contrary winds and counter currents . That these obstacles were formerly much over-estimated is proved by the map of Tupaia , 5 a Polynesian who was familiar with all the island groups between the Marquesas to the east , and the Fiji archipelago in the west , so that in ' Captain Cook 's time intercourse from Tahiti must have extended throughout forty degrees of longitude . Comparison of Polynesian dialects and the traditions of the natives afford further means of ascertaining the order in which the various colonizations succeeded each other . The inhabitants of Rapa-nui , or Easter Is and , maintain that they come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 144 ? 20 ' W. long. ) , and therefore , on their voyage to their own country , must have touched at Pitcairn 's Island and abandoned it again , for remains of old stone structures are still standing there.6 t according to the native traditions they landed , four hundred in number , under a leader or king Tu-ku-i-u , or Tocuyo , who is also called Hotu , or Hotu Motua.7 From the time of their arrival to the present day twentytwo chiefs have succeeded to the government , so that if the average duration of each reign is reckoned at twenty years , the colonization of the island does not date further back than the // year A.D. 1400 . The tradition will gain in weight if the three wooden tables of hieroglyphics , which were recently found among the Easter Islanders and carried off by Europeans , contain the list of the kings ' names , in early attempts at writing.8 The inhabitants have made hundreds of high but very rude stone images with human faces , of a very friable trachyte lava , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dead.9 They also built great stone terraces which recall the Morai of the other Polynesians . Lastly , ruins have been found of spacious buildings of stone slabs , which though now in a dilapidated condition , must have been inhabited within 150 years , for on their walls are pictures in white , red , and black , representing sheep , horses , and ships with their rigging , ' ? and Roggeween was the first seafarer to open intercourse with the inhabitants in 1721 . On good grounds it has been conjectured that a civilized people , now extinct , were in possession of Easter Island before the arrival of the present Polynesian inhabitants , but as yet these suppositions have received no confirmation . On the other hand , the present inhabitants confirm the experience that when a handful of people stray into an ocean solitude , and live there without the incitement of intercourse with others , they gradually lose the accomplish . ments and capacities which they possessed before their separation . Though the other Polynesians now erect only wooden buildings , yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands of the South Seas.x1 Names of islands and of places in the Samoan group ( Sevaii , Upulu , Lefuka ) , reoccur in the Sandwich Islands in the forms Hawaii , Upolu , and Lehua . Yet the first settler of the Sandwich Islands did not come directly from the Samoan group , even if their original home was there . Islands of the Marquesas archipelago , such as Noukahiva and Taowatte , are mentioned in their old songs , // as is also Tahiti.12 As the dialect of the Kanaks or Hawaians is closely allied to that of the Marquesas Islanders , Horatio Hale considers it to have come from the latter , while its legends and proverbs even point back to Tahiti.13 The lists of kings contain sixty-seven names , but of these at least twenty-two must be rejected as fabulous , so that , allowing an average of twenty years for each reign , we must place the colonization of the group in the middle of the tenth century . It was only after the emigration of the Kanaks that the important discovery was made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved for a long time if allowed to ferment , for the practice was unknown in the Sandwich Islands.I Here again we perceive how unfavorably local separation , which hinders the spread of useful discoveries , affected remote islands . The first visitors from over the sea landed considerably earlier in the Marquesas group , in the dialects of which Tongan and Tahitian peculiarities reappear , from which circumstance it may be inferred that it was colonized from the Society and the Friendly Islands . It was from Vavau , or one of the Friendly Islands , that the Noukahivian chief Gattanewa , or more correctly Keatanui , led the first inhabitants to the group which became their home , and the names of no less than eighty-eight other rulers might be enumerated . x6 This would take us back to 1e first centuries of our era , unless we must make allowance he e also for fabulous personages at the beginning of the list . There are no traditions respecting the firs colonization of the Low Archipelago ; the local vocabulary conta ns an extraordinary number of peculiarities , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that an immigration from the Society Islands probably took place.I7 The traditions of the Maori of // New Zealand are , on the contrary , vivid , for they profess to know the number and names of their ships , and the points on the shore at which their forefathers landed . The northern island was first reached from the east , yet the Maori call their early home Hawaiki , thus pointing to the Samoan group , although Hawaiki subsequently came to mean a far off land of bliss , the home to which departed souls were destined to return. =$ The Maori did not bring with them the domestic animals of their native land , yet their language has retained the Polynesian word for pig , p uaka. ' 9 Their forefathers must have known the cocoa-nut palm , for the Polynesian word for the nut occurs in the Maori language , although only applied to an implement used in soothsaying . ' ? The list of the New Zealand chiefs extends backwards for eighteen or twenty generations , so that scarcely 400 years can have elapsed since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived from Hawaiki about a century ago , and to have brought the Kumara , or sweet potato , to New Zealand.21 Earlier or later colonizations of the smaller groups of islands have been proved ; and even if no great weight can be attributed to the calculations given above , it is certain that the islands of the Pacific were gradually peopled " from Samoa or Navigators ' Islands , and since this may have happened at a period not very remote , traditions of an immigration have nowhere entirely died out . The Polynesians fished but did not hunt . They lived also on the produce of the cocoa-nut groves , the bread-fruit , and a few tuberous plants , such as the Taro and the sweet potato . The dog and the pig were their domestic animals , the absence of which in New Zealand is probably due to the circumstance that during the long passage the live stock on board the vessels was eaten ; for in other respects the colonization of new islands was always well planned . The distribution of land and water in Southeastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // abodes , for nowhere else in the world have former continents been resolved into islands of such various degrees of size . The low coral reefs are inadequately protected against storms and surf ; atolls are occasionally destroyed , and their inhabitants obliged to seek a new home . The Polynesians , in common with all Malays , are clever seamen ; they are indebted to their own ingenuity for the single or double outrigger which secures their narrow sailing craft from being upset by the rolling waves . Their manufactures are those of the age of polished but unpierced stone implements . The spear and club are the usual weapons of war . They are without earthen vessels , but cook their food by means of heated stones . Their dwellings consist of posts with roofs of leaves , and their clothing of bark of the paper mulberry tree , although the cotton plant grows wild in the the islands . The religious emotions of the Polynesians manifested themselves in worship of the forces of nature personified , whose deeds and conduct , interwoven with geological legends , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek Olympus . The Maori of New Zealand , detestable as they are , on account of their cannibalism , yet possess beautiful legends of the Creation , according to which , thought , as the subtlest element first germinated in the primordial night , and was followed by desire ; or , according to a different version , thought arose first , hen the spirit , and lastly , matter.23 Beside the forces of nature , the chiefs after death also received divine honours , 34 and oracles tilt ere instituted at their shrines . The priestly order was well versed in all the juggleries of Shamanism , but was held in far less respect than were the princes , who boasted of divine descent , and were certain of worship after death . Closely connected with this was their privilege of tabooing , a right which enabled them by touching a field to render it unlawful for others to set foot upon it , or to eat the produce of the harvest . Taboo , however , in some forms , could be inflicted by those of lower rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enforced the observance of useful police // regulations.25 Any breach of this interdict was unheard of , fot temporal and eternal punishments menaced the reprobate . Unconscious infraction of this institution led to sanguinary acts of vengeance on the part of the nations against the Europeans , and Captain Cook , although received by the Sandwich Islanders as a god both before and after his death , perished in expiation of breach of taboo . The misapprehension of this custom long blackened the character of the Polynesians . A Maori perhaps came to the rouse of a European settler and begged for a drink ; after refreshing himself he would either break the glass or quietly carry it off , since it had been consecrated by contact with him , and was unfitted , therefore , for use by any other individual ; but the person robbed ever after entertained a deep grudge against New Zealanders in general on account of this supposed act of base ingratitude . The difficulties caused in daily life by this strange institution were partly counterbalanced by the fact that slaves made prisoners in war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities were divided into princes , nobles , and plebeians . The forms of intercourse were adjusted according to these gradations , and the gratification of aristocratic vanity was amply provided for by rigid etiquette . In the Society Islands we moreover find the association of the Arreoi , a confraternity half social , half artistic , for the performance of dramatic dances . To this society , divided into seven grades distinguished by tattoo marks , belonged princes , nobles , and ' commons , men as well as women ; the children of these last were killed as soon as born . The Arreoi wandered from island to island to perform their festal games , and were everywhere entertained with merrymakings . They have been justly praised in that , as cultivators of art , they have diffused higher culture and social polish . ' b The Asiatic Malays , who remained nearer their original home , are still to be net with in the peninsula of Malacca , or it may be that they have returned to it again . They inhabit the large islands now under Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // e long been known that the civilized agricultural inhabitants of the shores of this last island spoke a Malay language ; ' 7 but in the mountains of the interior there is a savage warlike tribe , called by the Chinese Chinwan , or " barbarous savages . " They were supposed to be akin to the Philippine population . Schetelig , who first investigated their language , came to the conclusion that these Chinwans have only borrowed a sixth part of their vocabulary from their Malay neighbours , from whom they differ otherwise in language , and are physically closely allied to the continental people of China.23 It might have been supposed that the vast tract of the Indian Ocean , destitute of islands , would have set a limit on the west to the migratory impulse of the Malays . The similarity of Malagassic and Malayan words was observed both by Sir Joseph Banks , who as botanist accompanied Captain Cook on his first voyage , and by Hervas , the philologist ; but it is only since Wilhelm von Humboldt 's researches in the Kawi language that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rodriguez , Mauritius , and Bourbon were found uninhabited at the time of their discovery by European seafarers , Madagascar was peopled by Malays . Traces of the custom of taboo , occur there , for by a Aiarry which is a tuft of grass on the point of an erect pole , the guardia of the fetishes are able to prevent any intrusion on the part of unconsecrated persons into the holy places.3 ? No tradition has been preserved among the Malagassees themselves , although their immigrant may have been much more recent than the separation of the ' Polynesians from their Asiatic kindred . According to Ellis , 3 ' the Hovas of Madagascar in smelting iron ore use a sort of bellows with two bamboo tubes , through which alternately the air is expelled by the motion of a pump . This ingenious invention occurs nowhere r. // else except in the Malay islands ; and Tylor32 therefore seems justified in the impression that the colonization of Madagascar took place only after the working of iron was practised in the Sunda Islands . In connection with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zebu , or Indian buffalo , though the indigenous cattle of Madagascar are like the African species.33 If with this we connect the fact that the inhabitants of the southern coast of Ceylon and of the Maledives speak the Malay language , this throws some light on the way by which the ancestors of the Hovas reached Madagascar . It is very difficult to estimate rightly the natural capabilities for social organization of the Asiatic Malays , for they lost their independence at an early period . First Brahminical and , later , Buddhist settlers brought to Java 34 Indian learning , Indian religious arts , and Indian characters , as well as a chronology ; nor were Sumatra and the peninsula of Malacca unaffected by their influence . On the extinction of Buddhism the old temples on the Sunda Islands fell into ruins . Since that time the Malays have adopted Islam , the precepts of which now constitute the framework of social justice . The oldest events of their written history point to a kingdom in Sumatra of which Menang-Kabao was the centre , and whence seafaring adventurers started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves at Singapore . From that time it was mainly the Arabs who imparted their culture to the nations of the Sunda Islands . The Dyaks of Borneo and the warlike Batta of Sut'iiatra have alone remained almost untouched by foreign influences . The former in their self-evolution have scarcely raised themselves higher than the Polynesians . Until stopped by Rajah Sir James Brooke , the primitive custom of taking heads was in force amongst them , a custom probably characteristic of all Asiatic Malays , for it has recently been observed by Bechtinger in Formosa 35 and in the fifteenth century it still prevailed among the // Batta in Sumatra.36 The meaning of this strange custom of procuring from anywhere , by force or craft , a head or skull , which was taken as a precious possession to the grave , is explained by the popular superstition , that in the abode of the departed the former owner of the skull would be the slave of its later proprietor.37 We have already assigned due credit to the Batta , who are cannibals , for having invented an alphabet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian characters.38 The Asiatic Malay is reserved , taciturn , obsequious to superiors , harsh to inferiors , cruel , revengeful , and susceptible to insult , yet , on the other hand , he is gentle to children , dignified , and polished in manners . Wallace ; who lived for a long time among both Malays and Papuans , considers the latter to be the more highly gifted race . We find the third group of Malays east of the Philippines , and north of or close upon the equator , in the Marianas , the Pelew group , the Carolines , as well as on the Ralik , Rddik , and Gilbert Atolls . Recently they have all been given the name of Micronesians . The inhabitants of these islands are hybrids of Polynesians and Papuans , but in language , customs , and social institutions , they are Polynesian . Among the inhabitant of the Pelew Islands , however , Papuan blood predominates , so that they should not be classed in the Malay race . But ? order ez tt , the type becomes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region which they inhabit , the Micronesians are distinz uished from the pure Polynesians by the frizzliness ' of their hair , while on approaching Japan oblique setting of the eyes grows more frequent.39 Among Asiatic as well as Polynesian Malays , dolichocephals are very rare ; when they occur , as in the Carolinas , they only confirm the statement that the Micronesians must be regarded as a hybrid people . The cranial index of breadth in Polynesian , is , however , perceptibly lower than in the case of Asiatic Malays , hence the // Former rank among the mesocephals , the latter among the brachy cephals.4 ? In both divisions of the Malay family , the height of the skull is as great or perhaps a little greater than the breadth.42 Prognathism is moderate in degree , but the zygomatic arches are more or less prominent . All the nations of this family have a dark but never a completely black skin ; while among the Asiatic Malays tt is of a dirty yellow hue . The characters which they have in common with other members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a scanty growth of beard and of hair on the body , the latter being , moreover , artificially removed . The nearer their abode to the continent of Asia , the more frequent is the oblique setting of the eyes . In this they very closely resemble the populations of the eastern portions of the Old World . Not only have they more resemblance to them than to any other races of mankind , but no distinct line of difference can be drawn between them , as the types merge into one another . Hence a Chinese origin has been wrongly ascribed to the inhabitants on the Nias and Battu islands , on the west coast of Sumatra.42 Semper , to account for resemblances in various tribes in the Phillipines and among the Iraya to the Japanese and Chinese , supposes an admixture of blood , although he admits that " only in a few cases some slight historical evidence can be found . " 43 Wallace decides the matter when he writes , 44 " I was much struck when , in the island of Bali , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and who could then hardly be distinguished from Malays , and , on the other hand , I have seen natives of Java who , as far as physiognomy was concerned , would pass very well for Chinese . " Latham speaks of the physical characters of the Malays as " truly Indo-Chinese , " 45 and in another passage he says that the Mongolian type is more marked in the Micronesians thalr in the Chinese , g6 which can , however , be admitted only in regard to the inhabitants of the Marianas . We believe , with // Moritz Wagner , that the shape of skull , the form and colour of the face , as well as the whole physical constitution of the Malay race , is so nearly allied to the Mongolian that , in similar apparel , the two races are hardly distinguishable . We shall therefore not be contradicted if we class the Malay race among the Mongoloid nations . Yet their linguistic characters entitle them to a separate place . We subdivide them into Micronesian hybrid nations and Polynesians , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter are better subdivided again , as by Frederick Muller , into ? I. The inhabitants of the Philippines , termed Tagals and Bisaya ; 2. the Malays in the restricted sense , as inhabitants of the peninsula of Malacca , and in Sumatra , the Atchinese , Passumahs , Rejangs , and Lampongs ; 3. the Sundanese in . the west ; 4. the Javans in the eastern part of Java ; 5. the Batta in Sumatra ; 6. the Dyaks of Borneo ; 7. the Macassars and Buginese in the island of Celebes . Lastly , this race includes scattered members settled in the islands of Formosa , Ceylon , and Madagascar . II . SOUTHERN ASIATICS WITH MONOSYLLABIC LANGUAGES . To this group belong primarily the inhabitants of the eastern peninsula of India , whom we will speak of as Malayo-Chinese , rather than by their inappropriate epithet of Indo-Chinese . With these are allied the people of Thibet and the southern slopes of the Himalayas on the west , and the Chinese on the north and north-east . They all have straight , black hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , a coloured skin , usually of a leather y low , and obliquely set eyes . Narrow skulls are extremely rare amongst them . According to their index of breadth these nations rank in part among the mesocephals , and in part among the brachycephals . The height of the head is either equal to its breadth , or not infrequently surpasses it . Prognathism is not universal , and is always moderate in degree . lint very few skulls have been measured . Even Barnard Davis had at his disposal only twentyone Chinese heads of both sexes , a very insufficient number , by 360 Asiatics with Monosyllabic Languages . means of which to find the average proportions of 350 millions of human beings scattered over one of the greatest empires of the world . Owing to the uniformity of the most important physical characters of the various races , they can be distinguished only by their languages . The language of the Bod-dschi , the inhabitants of Thibet , although strictly monosyllabic , nevertheless possesses prefixes which are written but not pronounced , ' thus proposing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tribes , whose names we need not enumerate , inhabit the Himalayas , especially their southern slopes . They much resemble the Thibetians in physical characters and in language , but are only partially pure-bred , having usually Indian blood in them . Among those of pure breed are the Leptscha of Sikim.3 It must be noted that the nomadic Sifans of the Chinese provinces of Schensi and Sse-tschuen also belong in language to the group of Thibet nations . Another group centres round the Burmese , whose linguistic type we have already noticed . With them are allied the inhabitants of Aracan , the Khyeng , in the mountains dividing Aracan from the Irawaddy , and the small tribes between this last river and the Brahmaputra . The Thai , or Siamese , form another division ; the Laos nations in the interior of Siam are separated from these only by varieties of dialect . The still barbarous Miaotse , or Miautsi , in the highlands of the southern half of the Chinese empire , who are there regarded as aborigines , are said also to belong to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonkin and Cochin China stand alone . Unconnected with any of the previous groups are the Kares in Pegu and in southern Burmah , the Mon in the delta of the Irawaddy , the Rhos or aborigines of Camboja , the Tsampa on the coast to the east of the mouths of the Mekong , who in the // time of Marco Polo had set up a kingdom , the Kwanto , who are the ' aborigines of Tonkin , who must not be confounded with the Anamese , and the Moi , or Myong , in the mountains which separate the Nukong from Tonkin.5 The Kho language in Camboja and the Mon language in Pegu arc said to be much more nearly allied ' to each other than to the Thai language , which is spoken in the intervening country.6 These smaller tribes are of but little interest to ethnologists . They are no longef in a primitive condition , and such civilization as they have adopted is of foreign origin , a graft on a wild stock . This is true even of the greater states . Burmah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these three countries considerable remains have been discovered of handsome but now mostly ruined edifices , their buildings all bear the stamp of Indian origin and of the Indian taste which was introduced with Buddhism . However , they all belong to the post-Christian period and are of no high antiquity . Tonkin , on the other hand , received its culture mainly from China , while Siam has in recent times added Chinese methods of improvement to the Indian ones which it previously possessed . We may therefore pass quickly from the Malayo-Chinese in order to dwell longer on the Chinese as the most civilized nation of the Mongolian race . We have already pointed out the most important facts in regard to their language . S Too many of our countrymen know nothing of the Celestial Empire but the pigtail ? though this was only adopted by the Chinese in 1644 , and will be laid aside on the fall of the Mandschu dynasty ? and the great walls , which arc now neither guarded nor repaired , and of which it is proverbially , though falsely , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the W est . For centuries , according to the more cautious , for tens of centuries according to the more confident , China has remained China without moving forwards or backwards . To disprove this errory we shall assign dates in the enumeration which follows of the innovations which the Chinese , like other nations , have adopted ; fr which dates it will be sell=evident that the inhabitants of he
