txt deleted about 10 lines Mr. E. N. Gosse , in the current number of the Anglo-Saxon Review , 1- , gins an interesting discussion in an article entitled " Culture and the Small Nations . " His thesis is that the citizens of the small countries which are kept national by the mutual jealousies of their bigger neighbors , have a compensation for their smallness . They are able to devote themselves to the things of the mind without having too much of their attention distracted either by the militarism or by the commercial rivalry which actuate the citizens of the big empires . Apparently there is a good deal in this . It is quite true that a specialist in any branch of science or art or polite letters , or what they used to call ' the humanities . " would be puzzled if he were called . The Afrikanders have not been in the EurOpean " movement , " andtheir intelleqtual stage is that which was reached and passed . in the North of Eu. - rope in the seventeenth century . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the Dutch colonies in South Africa , one simply shudders to think what would have been the subsequent procedures after the witch burnings of Salem , if the development of the colony had not been affected from the outside . However all that may be , Mr. Goose 's point Is very interesting , and he amasses many instances in support of it . It ought to startle and disgust any humane observer to remark how much of the brains of Germany and France , for the last thirty years , have been diverted to the armies of those respective nations , how much the nation has been sacrificed to the army , when the army is nothing whatever , so long as , there is no war . Unlike productive industry , which has be-7a with us the successful rival of the things of the mind , it does not even tend to keep people alive , being-In fact a mere drawback and handicap to productive industry . Historically it is true that the productive periods in letters and art have not been the big bow-wow empires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian Republics , and so on . Even " the spacious times of great Elizabeth " and their poetical flower were not so much an " era of expansion " as subsequent periods which have left a much slighter intellectual mark . Mr. Gosse 's conclusion is striking and suggestive : " There will never rise again out of the Hohenzollern-trampled empire the little clusters of foliage which have sheltered the poetry and music and drama of the Teuton so intimately in the past . All that is gone , with the moonlight of Novalis , gone to be submerged in a vast imperial system and boundless commercial wealth , and a colonial policy ' and a ' dominant navy policy . ' But Denmark , to whom all these costly luxuries are denied , may still be pre-eminent in the arts ; Belgium may still produce poets like Maeterlinck and Verhaeren ; still may the Norwegian peasant , in his desolate farmstead , through the interminable Winter , follow with intelligent eagerness the science and the imagination of the world ; still may there be an appreciation of intellectual things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain in London or Berlin .
