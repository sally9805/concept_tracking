CHATEAU AND COUNTRY LIFE IN FRANCE SECOND PAPER ? COUNTRY VISITS By Mary King Waddington ILLUSTRATIONS BY P. L. BLIJMENSCHEIN  |p521  WE did n't pay many visits ; but sometimes when the weather was fine and there was no hunting , and W. gone upon an expedition to some outlying village , Mme. A. and I would start off for one of the neighboring chateaux . We went one day to the chateau de C. , where there was a large family party assembled , four generations ? the old grandmother , her son and daughter , both married , the daughter 's daughter , also married , and her children . It was a pretty drive , about an hour all through the forest . The house is quite modern , not at all pretty , a square white building , with very few trees near it , the lawn and one or two . flower-beds not particularly well kept . The grounds ran straight down to the VillersCotterets , where M. M. has good shooting . The gates were open , the concierge said the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned by a bell . That is one of the habits of this part of the country . There is almost always a large bell at the stable or commons , and when visitors arrive and the family are out in the grounds , not too far off , they are summoned by the bell , which tells them that visitors are waiting at the house . I was astounded one day at liourneville , when we were in the woods at some little distance from the chateau , when p 522 we heard the big bell , and my companion , a niece of Mme. A. , instantly turned back , saying , " That means there are visits ; we must go back . " ) We found all the ladies sitting working in a corner salon with big windows opening on the park . The old grandmother was knitting , but she was so straight and slight , with bright black eyes , that it would n't have seemed at all strange to see her bending over an embroidery frame like all the others . The other three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrasures of the windows . I was much impressed , particularly with the large pieces of work that they were undertaking , a portiere , covers for the billiard-table , bed , etc . It quite recalled what one had always read of feudal France , when the seigneur would be off with his retainers hunting or fighting , and the chatelaine , left alone in the chateau , spent her time in her " bower " surrounded by her maidens , all working at the wonderful tapestries one sees still in some of the old churches and convents . I was never much given to work , but I made a mental resolve that I , too , would set up a frame in one of the big drawing-rooms at home , and had visions of yards of pale-blue satin , all covered with wonderful flowers and animals , unrolling themselves under my skilful fingers ? but I must confess that it remained a vision . I never got further than little crochet petticoats , which clothed every child in the village . To make the picture complete there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched on the floor at the feet of his mistress , trying to distract her with songs and ballads . The master of the house , M. M. , was there , having come in from shooting . He had been reading aloud to the ladies ? Alfred de Musset , I think . That part of the picture I could never realize , as there is nothing W. loathes like reading aloud , except , perhaps , being read to . They were very friendly and easy , showed us the downstairs part of the house , and gave us gaiter , not tea , wine and cake . The house looked comfortable enough , nothing picturesque ; a large square hall with horns , whips , foxes ' brushes , antlers , and all sorts of trophies of the chase on the walls . They are sporting people ; all ride . The dining-room , a large bright room , was panelled with life-size portraits of the family : M. and Mme. M. in hunting dress , green coats , tricorne hats , on their horses ; the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a boat on a small lake ; the eldest son in shooting dress , corduroys , his gun slung over his shoulder , his dog by his side . They were all very like . We strolled about the garden a little , and saw lots of pheasants walking peacefully about at the edge of the woods . They made me promise to come back one day with W. , he to shoot and I to walk about with the ladies . We saw the children of the fourth generation , and left with the impression of a happy , simple family party . M. M. was a conseiller general of the Aisne and a colleague of W. 's . They always stayed at the same hotel ( de la Hure ) , in Laon at the time of the conseil general , and M. M. was much amused at first with W. 's baggage : a large bath-tub , towels ( for in small French provincial hotels towels were microscopic and few in number ) , and a package of tea , which was almost an unknown commodity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and always excused themselves with the same phrase , " Merci , je vais bien , " evidently looking upon it as some strange and hurtful medicine . That has all changed , like everything else . Now one finds tea , not only at all the chateaux , with brioches and petites roties de pain , but even in some of the hotels , but I would n't guarantee what we got there as ever having seen China or Ceylon , and it is still wiser to take chocolate or coffee , which is almost always good . We had a lovely drive back . The forest was beautiful in the waning light . As usual , we did n't meet any vehicle of any kind , and were quite excited when we saw a carriage approaching in the distance ? however , it proved to be W. in his dog-cart . We passed through one or two little villages quite lost in the forest ? always the same thing , one long , straggling street , with nobody in it , a large farm at one end and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was late , the farm gates were all open , the cattle inside , teams of white oxen drinking out of a large trough . In a large farm near Boursonne there was much animation and conversation . All the beasts were in , oxen , cows , horses , chickens , and in one corner a flock of geese . The poor little " goose girl , " a child about ten years old with bright-blue eyes and a pig - tail like straw hanging down her back , was being scolded violently by the farmer 's p 523 wife , who was presiding in person over the rentrec of the animals , for having brought her geese home on a run . They would n't eat , andwouldcertainly all be ill , and probably die before morning . There is a pretty little old chateau at Boursonne ; the park , however , so shut in by high walls that one sees nothing in passing . We had shot there once or twice in former years , but it has changed hands very often . I do n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits , not to chateaus , but the principal people of the little country town near , from which we had all our provisions . We went to see the doctor 's wife , the notary 's wife , the mayor 's @# p 524 wife , and the two schools ? the asile or . infant school , and the more important school for bigger girls . The old doctor was quite a character , had been for years in the country , knew everybody and everybody 's private history . He was the doctor of the chateau , by the year , attended to everybody , masters and servants , and received a regular salary , like a secretary . He did n't come very often for us in his medical capacity , but he often dropped in at the end of the day to have a talk with W. The first time I saw him W. presented him to me , as nit bon anti de la fantille . I naturally put out my hand , which so astonished and disconcerted him ( he barely touched the tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. explained after he had gone that in that class of life in France they never shook hands with a lady , and that the poor man was very much embarrassed . He was very useful to W. as a political agent , as he was kind to the poor people and took small ( or no ) fees . They all loved him , and talked to him quite freely . His women-kind were very shy and provincial . I think our visits were a great trial to them . They always returned them most punctiliously , and came in all their best clothes . When we went to see them we generally found them in short black skirts , and when they were no longer very young , with black caps , but they always had handsome silk dresses , velvet cloaks , and hats with flowers and feathers when they came to see us . Some of them took the cup of tea we offered , but they did n't know what to do with it , and sat on the edge of their chairs , looking quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea-cup . Mme. A. was rather against the tea-table ; she preferred the old-fashioned tray handed around with wine and cakes , but I persuaded her to try , and after a little while she acknowledged that it was better to have the tea-table brought in . It made a diversion ; I got up to make the tea . Someone gave me a chair , someone else handed the cups . It made a little movement , and was not so stiff as when we all sat for over an hour on the same chairs making conversation . It is terrible to have to make conversation , and extraordinary how little one finds to say . We had always talked easily enough at home , but then things came more naturally , and even the violent family discussions were amusing , but my recollection of these French provincial visits is something awful . Everybody so polite , so stiff , and the long pauses when nobody seemed to have anything to say . I of course was a novelty and a foreign element ? they did n't quite know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I grew very fond of her , and she was invariably charming to me ; I was something different . We had many talks on every possible subject during our long drives , and also in the winter afternoons . At first I had my tea always upstairs in my own little salon , which I loved with the curtains drawn , a bright wood-fire burning , and all my books about ; but when I found that she sat alone in the big drawing-room , not able to occupy herself in any way , I asked her if I might order my tea there , and there were very few afternoons that I did n't sit with her when I was at home . She talked often about her early married life ? winters in Cannes and in Paris , where they received a great deal , principally Protestants , and I fancy she sometimes regretted the interchange of ideas and the brilliant conversation she had been accustomed to , but she never said it . She was never tired of hearing about my early days in America ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , etc . We often talked over the religious question , and though we were both Protestants , we were as far apart almost as if one was a pagan . Protestantism in France always has seemed to me such a rigid , intolerant form of worship , so little calculated to influence young people-or draw them to church . The plain , bare churches , with white-washed walls , the ugly droning hymns , the long sermons and extempore prayers , speaking so much of the anger of God and the terrible punishments awaiting the sinner , the trials and sorrows that must come to all . I often think of a sermon I heard preached in one Protestant church , to the boys and girls who were making their first communion ? all little things ten and twelve years old , the girls in their white frocks and long white veils , the boys with white waistcoats and white ribbons on their arms , making such a pretty group as they sat on the front benches listening hard to all the preacher said . I wondered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him besides the horrors of eternal punishment , the wickedness and p 525 temptations of the world they were going to face , but his only idea seemed to be that he must warn them of all the snares and temptations that were going to beset their paths . Mme. A. could n't understand my ideas when I said I loved the Episcopal service ? the prayers and litany I had always heard , the Easter and Christmas hymns I had always sung , the carols , the anthems , the great organ , the flowers at Easter , the greens at Christmas . All that seemed to her to be a false sentiment appealing to the senses and imagination . " But if it brings people to church , and the beautiful music elevates them and raises their thoughts to higher things ? " " That is not religion ; real religion means the prayer of St. Chrysostom , Where two or three are gath-  |p526  ered together in My name I will grant their requests . ' " " That is very well for really religious , strong people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any outward expression of it , but for weaker souls who rant to be helped , and who are helped by the beautiful music and the familiar prayers , surely it is better to give them something that brings them to church and makes them better men and women than to frighten them away with such strict , uncompromising doctrines ? " " No , that is only sentiment , not real religious feeling . " I do n't think we ever understood each other any better on that subject , and we discussed it so often . Mme. A. , with whom I made my round of calls at the neighboring chateaux , was a charming companion . She had lived a great deal in Paris , in the Protestant coterie , which was very intellectual and cultivated . The salons of the Duchesse de Broglie , Mmes. de Stael , d'Haussonville , Guizot , were most interesting and rech.erclaes , very exclusive and very serious , but a centre for all political and literary talk . I have often heard my husband say some of the best talkers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men , they listened some enough ) to a smaller salon , which the family usually occupied . Then he lighted a fire ( which consisted principally of smoke ) and went to summon his mistress . The living-room was just as bare and stiff as the others , no trace of anything that looked like habitation or what we should consider comfort ? no books nor work nor flowers ( that , however , is comparatively recent in France ) . I remember quite well Mme. Casimir-Pe -- Her telling me that when she went with her husband to St. Petersburg about fifty years ago , one of the things that struck her most in the Russian salons , was the quantity of green plants and cut flowers ? she had never seen them in France . There were often fine pictures , tapestries , and furniture , all the modestly to all the brilliant conversation going on around them . It was an exception when we found anyone at home when we called in the neighborhood , and when we did , it was evident that afternoon visits were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our visit was a sample of many others that we paid . The door was opened by a footman struggling into his coat , with a handful of fagots in his arms . He ushered us through several bare , stiff , cold rooms ( proportions hand/ chairs in a row against the wall . Our visits were always long , as most of the chi'teaux were at a certain distance , and we were obliged to stay an hour and a half , sometimes longer , to rest the horses . It was b e f o r e the days of five-o'clock tea . Atray was brought in with sweet wine ( Malaga or Vin de Chypre ) and cakes ( ladies ' - fin-gers ) which evidently had figured often before on similar occasions . Conversation languished sometimes , though Mme. A. was wonderful , talking so easily about everything . In the smaller places , when people rarely went to Paris , it ran always in the same grooves ? the woods , the hunting ( very good in Villers-Cotterets forest ) , the schoolmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read ) , the cure , and all local gossip , and as much about the iniquities of the republic as could be said before the wife of a republican senator . Wherever we went , even to the largest chateaux , where the family went to Paris for the season , the talk was almost entirely confined to France and French interests . Books , politics , music , people , nothing existed apparently audela des frontieres . America was an unknown quantity . It was strange to see intelligent people living in the world so curiously indifferent as to what went on in other countries .  |p528  At first I used to talk a little about America and Rome , where I had lived so many years and at such an interesting time ? the last days of Pio Nono and the transformation of the old superstitious papal Rome to the capital of young Italy ? but I soon realized that it did n't interest anyone , and by degrees I learned to talk like all the rest . I often think of one visit to a charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest ? just room enough for the house , and the little hamlet at the gates ; a magnificent view of the forest , quite close to the lawn behind the chateau , and then sweeping off , a dark-blue mass , as far as one could see . We were shown into a large , high room , no carpet , no fire , some fine portraits , very little furniture , all close against the wall , a round table in the middle with something on it , I could n't make out what at first . Neither books , reviews , nor even a photographic album ?  |p529  the supreme resource of provincial salons . When we got up to take leave I managed to get near the table , and the ornament was a large white plate with a piece of fly-paper on it . The mistress of the house was shy and uncomfortable ; sent at once for her husband , and withdrew from the conversation as soon as he appeared , leaving him to make all the frais . We walked a little around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little place , with its background of forest and the quiet , sleepy little village in front ; very lonely and far from everything , but with a certain charm of its own . Two or three dogs were playing in the court-yard , and one curious little animal who made a rush at the strangers . I was rather taken aback , particularly when the master of the house told me not to be afraid , it was only a marcassin ( small wild boar ) , who had been born on the place , and was as quiet as a kitten . I did not think the great tusks and square , shaggy head looked very pleasant , but the little thing was quiet enough , came and rubbed itself against its master 's legs , and played quite happily with the dogs . We heard afterward that they were obliged to kill it . It grew fierce and unmanageable , and no one would come near the place . I took Henrietta with me sometimes when I had a distant visit to pay ; an hour and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never meet anything was rather dull . We went one cold December afternoon to call upon Mme. B. , the widow of an old friend and colleague of W. 's . We were in the open carriage , well wrapped up , and enjoyed the drive immensely . The country looked beautiful in the bright winter sunshine , the distant forest always in a blue mist , the trees with their branches white with " givre " ( hoarfrost ) , and patches of snow and ice all over the fields . For a wonder we did n't go through the forest ? drove straight away from it and had charming effects of color upon some of the thatched cottages in the villages we passed through ; one or two had been mended recently and the mixture of old brown , bright red and glistening white was quite lovely . We went almost entirely along the great plains , occasionally small bits of wood and very fair hills as we got near our destination . The villages always very scattered and almost deserted ? when it is cold everybody stays indoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done on the farms when the ground is hard frozen . It is a difficult question to know what to do with the men of all the small hamlets when the real winter sets in ; the big farms turn off many of their laborers and as it is purely agricultural country all around us , there is literally nothing to do . My husband and several of the owners of large estates gave work to many with their regular " coupe " of wood , but that only lasts a short time , and the men who are willing to work but can find nothing drift naturally into cafes and billiard saloons , where they read cheap bad papers , and talk politics of the wildest description . We found cur chateau very well situated on the top of a hill , a good avenue leading up to the gate , a pretty little park with fine trees at the back , the tower of the village church just visible through the trees at the end of the central alley . It was hardly a chateau ? half manor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather farmyard , quite deserted ; no one visible anywhere ; the door of the house was open but there was no bell nor apparently any means of communicating with any one . Hubert cracked his whip noisily several times without any result ? and we were just wondering what we should do ( perhaps put our cards under a stone on the steps ) when a man appeared , said Mme. B. was at home but she was in the stable looking after a sick cow ? he would go and tell her we were there . In a few minutes she appeared attired in a short , rusty-black skirt , sabots on her feet and a black woollen shawl over her head and shoulders . She seemed quite pleased to see us ? was not at all put out at being caught in such very simple attire ? begged us to come in and ushered us through a long , narrow hall and several cold , comfortless rooms , the shutters not open and no fire anywhere , into her bedroom . All the furniture ? chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that it was her " lessive " ( general wash ) she had just made , that all the linen was dry but she had not had time to put it away . She called a maid and they cleared off two chairs ? she sat on the bed . It was frightfully cold ? we were thankful we had kept our wraps on . She said she 530 Chateau and Coun  |p530  supposed we would like a fire after our long , cold drive , and rang for a man to bring some wood . He ( in his shirt sleeves ) appeared with two or three logs of wood and was preparing to make a fire with them all , but she stopped him , said one log was enough , the ladies were not going to stay long ? so , naturally , we had no fire and clouds of smoke . She was very talkative , never stopped ? told us all about her husband 's political campaigns and how W. would never have been named to the Conseil General if M. B. had n't done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many questions , answering them all herself ; then said , " I do n't offer you any tea , as I know you always go back to have your tea at home , and I am quite sure you do n't want any wine . " There was such an evident reluctance to give us anything that I did n't like to insist , and said we must really be going as we had a long drive before us , though I should have liked something hot ; tea , of course , she knew nothing about , but even a glass of ordinary hot wine , which they make very well in France , would have been acceptable . Henrietta was furious ; she was shivering with cold , her eyes smarting with the smoke , and not at all interested in M. B. 's political career , or Madame 's servants , and said she would have been thankful to have even a glass of Vin de Chypre . It was unfortunate , perhaps , that we had arrived during the " lessive ; " that is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big houses in the country ( small ones , too ) that is the way they do their washing ; once a month or once every three months , according to the size of the establishment , the whole washing of the household is done ; all the linen : master 's , servants ' , guests ' ; house is turned out ; the linen closets cleaned and aired ! Everyone looks busy and energetic . It is quite a long affair ? lasts three or four days . I often went to see the performance when we made our " lessive " at the chateau every month . It always interested our English and American friends , as the washing is never done in that way in either of their countries . It was very convenient at our place as we had plenty of room . The " lavoir " stood at the top of the steps leading into the kitchen gardens ; there was a large , square tank sunk in the ground so that the women could kneel to their work , then a little higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just across the path there was a small house with a blazing wood fire ; in the middle an enormous tub where all the linen was passed through wood ashes . There were four " lessiveuses " ( washerwomen ) , sturdy peasant women with very short skirts , sabots and turbans ( made of blue and white checked calico ) on their heads , their strong red arms bared above the elbow . The Mere Michon , the eldest of the four , directed everything and kept them well at work , allowed very little talking ; they generally chatter when they are washing and very often quarrel . When they are washing at the public " lavoir " in the village one hears their shrill voices from a great distance . Our " lingere , " Mme. Hubert , superintended the whole operation ; she was very keen about it and remonstrated vigorously when they slapped the linen too hard sometimes with the little flat sticks , like spades , they use . The linen all came out beautifully white and smooth , had n't the yellow look that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very glad to get rid of us , and to begin folding her linen and putting it back in the big wooden wardrobes , beautifully carved , that one sees everywhere in France . Some of the old Norman wardrobes , with handsome brass locks and beautifully carved doors are real works of art ? very difficult to get and very expensive . Fifty years ago the peasant did not understand the value of such a " meuble and parted with it easily ? but now with railways everywhere and strangers and bric-a-brac people always on the lookout for a really old piece of furniture , they understand quite well that they possess a treasure and exact its full value . Our drive back was rather shorter , down hill almost all the way , the horses going along at a good steady trot , knowing they were going home . When we drew up at our own door Hubert remarked respectfully that he thought it was the first time that Madame and Mademoiselle had ever been received by a lady in sabots . We wondered afterwards if she had personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rubbing it . She certainly did n't wash her hands afterwards , and it rather reminded me of one of Charles de Bunsen 's stories when he was Secretary of Legation  |p531  at Turin . In the summer they took a villa in the country just out of the town and had frequent visitors to lunch or dinner . One day two of their friends , Italians , had spent the whole day with them ; had walked in the garden , picked fruit and flowers , played with the child and the dogs and the pony , and as they were coming back to the house for dinner Charles suggested that they might like to come up to his dressing-room and wash their hands before dinner ? to which one of them replied , " Grazie , non mi sporco facilmente " ( literal translation , " Thanks , I do n't dirty myself easily " ) , and declined the offer of soap and water . We paid two or three visits one year to the neighboring chateaux , and had one very pleasant afternoon at the Chateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known the late proprietor , the Vicomte de Courval , very well . They had been colleagues of the Conseil General of the Aisne , were both very fond of the country and country life , and used to have long talks in the evening , when the work of the day was over , about plantation , cutting down trees , preservation of game , etc . Without these talks , I think W. would have found the evenings at the primitive little Hotel de la Hure , at Laon , rather tedious . The chateau is not very old and has no historic interest . It was built by a Monsieur du Bois , Vicomte de Courval , at the end of the seventeenth century . He lived at first in the old feudal chateau of which nothing now remains . Already times were changing the thick walls , massive towers , high , narrow windows , almost slits , and deep moat which were necessary in the old troubled days , when all isolated chateaux might be called upon , at any time , to defend themselves from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more spacious residences of which Mansard , the famous architect of Louis XIV , has left so many chef d'cnuvres . It was to Mansard that M. de Courval confided the task of building the chateau as it now stands , while the no less famous Le Notre was charged to lay out the park and gardens . It was an easy journey from B ? ville to Pinon . An hour 's drive through our beautiful forest of Villers-Cotterets and another hour in the train . We stopped at the little station of Anizy just outside the gates of the park ; a brougham was waiting for us and a very short drive through a stately avenue brought us to the drawbridge and the iron gates of the " Cour d ' honneur . " The house looked imposing ; I had an impression of a very high and very long facade with two towers stretching out into the court-yard , which is very large , with fine old trees and broad parterres of bright-colored flowers on either side of the steps . There was a wide moat of running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers were principally salvias and chrysanthemums , as it was late in the season , but they made a warm bit of color . The house stands low , as do all houses surrounded by a moat , but the park rises a little directly behind it and there is a fine background of wood . We drew up at a flight of broad shallow steps ; the doors were open . There were three or four footmen in the ante-room . While we were taking off our wraps Mme. de Courval appeared ; she was short , stout , dressed in black , with that terrible black cap which all widows wear in France ? so different from the white cap and soft white muslin collar and cuffs we are accustomed to . She had a charming , easy manner and looked very intelligent and capable . It seems she managed the property extremely well , made the tour of the house , woods and garden every day with her " regisseur . " W. had the highest opinion of her business capacity ? said she knew the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old tree that must be cut down for timber to the cheeses the farmer 's wife made and sold at the Soissons market . She suggested that I should come upstairs to leave my heavy coat . We went up a broad stone staircase , the walls covered with pictures and engravings ; one beautiful portrait of her daughter the Marquise de Chaponay , on horseback . There were handsome carved chests and china vases on the landing , which opened on a splendid long gallery , very high and light ? bedrooms on one side , on the other big windows ( ten or twelve , I should think ) looking over the park and gardens . She took me to a large , comfortable room , bright wood-fire blazing , and a pretty little dressing-room opening out of it , furnished in a gay old-fashioned pattern of chintz . She said breakfast would be ready in ten minutes ? supposed I could find my way down and left me to my own devices . 532 Chateau and Conn  |p532  I found the family assembled in the big drawing-room ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marquise de Chaponay , a tall handsome woman , and two other ladies of a certain age ; I did not catch their names , but they looked like all the old ladies one always sees in a country house in France . I should think they were cousins or habituees of the chateau , as they each had their embroidery frame and one a little dog . I am haunted by the embroidery frames ? I am sure I shall end my days in a black cap bending over a frame making portieres or a piano-cover . We breakfasted in a large square diningroom running straight through the house , windows on each side . The room was all in wood panelling ? light gray ? the sun streaming in through the windows . Mme. de Courval put W. on her right , me on her other side . We had an excellent breakfast , which we appreciated after our early start . There was handsome old silver on the table and sideboard , which is a rare thing in France , as almost all the silver was melted during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very easy and animated . The Marquise de Chaponay told me she had known W. for years , that in the old days before he became such a busy man.and so engrossed in politics he used to read Alfred de Musset to her , in her atelier , while she painted . She supposed he read now to me ? which he certainly never did ? as he always told me he hated reading aloud . They talked politics , of course , but their opinions were the classic Faubourg St. Germain opinions : " A Republic totally unfitted for France and the French " ? " none of the gentlemen in France really Republican at heart " ( with evidently a few exceptions ) ? W. 's English blood and education having , of course , influenced him . As soon as breakfast was over one of the windows on the side of the moat was opened and we all gave bread to the carp , handed to us by the butler ? small square pieces of bread in a straw basket . It was funny to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them were enormous and very old . It seems they live to a great age ; a guardian of the Palace at Fontainebleau always shows one to tourists , who is supposed to have been fed by the Emperor Napoleon . Those of Pinon knew all about it , lifting their brown heads out of the water and never missing their piece of bread . We went back to the drawing-room for coffee , passing through the billiard room , where there are some good pictures . A fine life-size portrait of General Moreau ( father of Mme. de Courval ) in uniform , by Gerard ? near it a trophy of four flags ? Austrian , Saxon , Bavarian and Hungarian ? taken by the General ; over the trophy three or four " lames d'honneur " ( presentation swords ) with name and inscription . There are also some pretty women 's portraits in pastel ? very delicate colors in old-fashioned oval frames ? quite charming . The drawing-room was a very handsome room also panelled in light gray carved wood ; the furniture rather heavy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet , but it looked suitable in that high old-fashioned room ? light modern furniture would have been out of place . As soon as we had finished our coffee , we went for a walk ? not the two old ladies , who settled down at once to their embroidery frames ; one of them showed me her work ? really quite beautiful ? a church ornament of some kind , a painted Madonna on a ground of white satin ; she was covering the whole ground with heavy gold embroidery , so thick it looked like mosaic . The park is splendid , a real domain , all the paths and alleys beautifully kept and every description of tree ? M. de Courval was always trying experiments with foreign trees and shrubs and apparently most successfully . I think the park would have been charming in its natural state , as there was a pretty little river running through the grounds and some tangles of bushes and rocks that looked quite wild ? might have been in the middle of the forest but everything had been done to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little bridges thrown over the river in picturesque spots , and , on the highest point a tower ( donjon ) which was most effective , looked quite the old feudal towers of which so few remain now . They were used as watch towers , as a sentinel posted on the top could see a great distance over the plains and give warning of the approach of the enemy . As the day was fine ? no mists ? we had a beautiful view from the top , seeing plainly the great round tower of Coucy , the finest ruin in France ? the others made out quite well the  |p533  towers of the Laon Cathedral , but those I could n't distinguish , seeing merely a dark spot on the horizon which might have been a passing cloud . Coming hack we crossed the " Allee des Soupirs , " which has its legend like so many others in this country : It was called the " Allee des Soupirs " on account of the tragedy that took place there . The owner of the chateau at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on too intimate terms with his great friend and her cousin ; they fought in the Allee , and the Comte de Lamothe was killed by his friend . The widow tried to brave it out and lived on for some time at the chateau ; but she was accursed and an evil spell on the place ? everything went wrong and the chateau finally burnt down . The place was then sold to the de Courval family . At the end of an hour the Marquise had had enough ; I should not think she was much of a palker ; she was struggling along in high-heeled shoes and proposed that she and I should return to the house and she would show me her atelier . W. and Mme. de Courval continued their tour of inspection which was to finish at the Home Farm , where she wanted to show him some small Breton cows which had just arrived . The atelier was a charming room ; panelled like all the others in light gray wood . One hardly saw the walls , for they were covered with pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames . It was evidently a favorite haunt of the Marquise 's : books , papers and painting materials scattered about ; the piano open and quantities of music on the music-stand ; miniatures , snuff-boxes and little old-fashioned bibelots on all the tables and an embroidery frame , of course , in one of the windows , near it a basket filled with bright colored silks . The miniatures were , almost all , portraits of the de Courvals of every age and in every possible costume : shepherdesses , court ladies of the time of Louis XV , La Belle Ferronniere with the jewel on her forehead , men in armor with fine , strong y marked faces ; they must have been a handsome race . It is a pity there is no son to carry on the name . One daughter-in-law had no children ; the other one , born an American , Mary Ray of New York , had only one daughter , the present Princesse de Poix , to whom Pinon now belongs . We played a little ; four hands ? the classics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played at all were brought up on strictly classical music . She had a pretty , delicate , old-fashioned touch ; her playing reminded me of Madame A. 's . When it was too dark to see any more we sat by the fire and talked till the others came in . She asked a great deal about my new life in Paris ? feared I would find it stiff and dull after the easy happy family life I had been accustomed to . I said it was very different , of course , but there was much that was interesting , only I did not know the people well enough yet to appreciate the stories they were always telling about each other , also that I had made several " gaffes " quite innocently . I told her one which amused her very much , though she could not imagine how I ever could have said it . It was the first year of my marriage ; we were dining in an Orleanist house , almost all the company Royalists and intimate friends of the Orleans Princes , and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the loth of January and the women were all talking about a ball they were going to the next night , 21st of January ( anniversary of the death of Louis XVI ) . They supposed they must wear mourning ? such a bore . Still , on account of the Comtesse de Paris and the Orleans family generally , they thought they must do it ? upon which I asked , really very much astonished : " On account of the Orleans family ? but did not the Duc d'Orleans vote the King 's execution ? " There was an awful silence and then M. Leon Say , one of the cleverest and most delightful men of his time , remarked , with a twinkle in his eye : " Ma foi ; je crois que Mme. Waddington a raison . " There was a sort of nervous laugh and the conversation was changed . W. was much annoyed with me , " a foreigner so recently married , throwing down the gauntlet in that way . " I assured him I had no purpose of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently unwise . Mme. de Chaponay said she was afraid I would find it very difficult sometimes . French people ? in society at least ? were so excited against the Republic , anti-religious feeling , etc . " . It must be very painful for you . " " I do n't think so ; you see I am American , Republican and a Protestant ; my point of view must be very different from  |p534  that of a French woman and a Catholic . " She was very charming , however ; intelligent , cultivated , speaking beautiful French with a pretty carefully trained voice ? English just as well ; we spoke the two languages going from one to the other without knowing why . I was quite sorry when we were summoned to tea . The room looked so pretty in the twilight , the light from the fire danced all over the pictures and gilt frames of the mirrors , leaving the corners quite in shadow . The curtains were not drawn and we saw the darkness creeping up over the lawn ; quite at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising , which we love to see in our part of the country , as it always means a fine day for the morrow . We had a cheery tea . W. and Mme. de Courval had made a long " tournee , " and W. quite approved of all the changes and new acquisitions she had made , particularly the little Breton cows , We left rather hurriedly as we had just time to catch our train . Our last glimpse of the Chateau as we looked back from the turn in the avenue was charming ; there were lights in almost all the windows , which were reflected in the moat ; the moon was rising over the woods at the back , and every tower and cornice of the enormous pile stood out sharply in the cold clear light . We did n't move often once we were settled in the chateau for the autumn . It was very difficult to get W. away from his books and coins and his woods ; but occasionally a shooting party tempted him . We went sometimes about the Toussaint when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had a fine chateau and estate about three hours by rail from Paris , in the midst of the great plains of the Aube . The first time we went , soon after my marriage , I was rather doubtful as to how I should like it . I had never stayed in a French country house and imagined it would be very stiff and formal ; however , the invitation was for three days ? two days of shooting and one of rest ? and I thought I could get through that without being too homesick . We arrived about 4.30 for tea ; the journey from Paris was through just the same uninteresting country one always sees when leaving by the Gare de 1'Est . I think it is the ugliest sortie of all Paris . As we got near the chateau the Seine appeared , winding in and out of the meadows in very leisurely fashion . We just saw the house from the train , standing rather low . The station is at the park gates ? in fact , the railway and the canal run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not the only guests ) , and a covered cart for the maids and baggage . A short drive through a fine avenue of big trees skirting broad lawns brought us to the house , which looked very imposing with its long facade and rows of lighted windows . We drove through arcades covered with ivy into a very large court-yard , the chateau stables and coinmuns taking three sides . There was a piece d'eau at one end , a colombier at the other . There was no perron or stately entrance ; in one corner a covered porch , rather like what one sees in England , shut in with glass door and windows and filled with plants , a good many chrysanthemums , which made a great mass of color . The hall doors were wide open as the carriage drove up . Monsieur C. P and his wife waiting for us just inside , Mme. P , his mother , the mistress of the chateau , at the door of the salon . We went into a large , high hall , well lighted , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cheerful and comfortable on a dark November afternoon . We left our wraps in the hall , and went straight into the drawing-room . I have been there so often sinc ? that I hardly remember my first impression . It was a corner room , high ceiling , big windows , and fine tapestries on the walls ; some of them with a pink ground ( very unusual ) , and much envied and admired by all art collectors . Mme. P told me she found them all rolled up in a bundle in the garret when she married . A tea-table was standing before the sofa , and various people working and having their tea . We were not a large party ? Comte and Comtesse de S ( she a daughter of the house ) and three or four men , deputies and senators , all political . They counted eight guns . We sat there about 1 ' lr an hour , then there was a general move , and young Mme. P showed us our rooms , which were most comfortable , fires burning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the first bell would ring at seven . I was the only lady besides the family . I told my maid to ask some of the others what their mistresses  |p535  were going to wear . She said ordinary evening dress , with natural flowers in their hair , and that I would receive a small bouquet , which I did , only as I never wear anything in my hair , I put them on my corsage , which did just as well . The dinner was pleasant , the diningroom a fine , large hall ( had been stables ) with a fireplace at each end , and big windows giving on the court-yard . It was so large that the dinner table ( we were fourteen ) seemed lost in space . The talk was almost exclusively political and amusing enough . All the men were , or had been , deputies , and every possible question was discussed . Mme. P was charming , very intelligent , and animated , having lived all her life with clever people , and having taken part in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . She had been a widow for about two years when I first stayed there , and it was pretty to see her children with her . Her two sons , one married , the other a young officer , so respectful and fond of their mother , and her daughter perfectly devoted to her . The men all went off to smoke after coffee , and we women were left to ourselves for quite a long time . The three ladies all had work ? knitting or crochet ? and were making little garments , brassieres , and petticoats for all the village children . They were quite surprised that I had nothing and said they would teach me to crochet . The evening was not very long after the men came back . Some remained in the billiardroom , which opens out of the salon , and played cochonnet , a favorite French game . We heard violent discussions as to the placing of the balls , and someone asked for a yard measure , to be quite sure the count was correct . Before we broke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breakfast for all the men at eight o'clock in the dining-room , and an immediate start for the woods ; luncheon at the Pavilion d'Hiver at twelve in the woods , the ladies invited to join the shooters , and follow one or two battues afterward . It was a clear , cold night , and there seemed every prospect of a beautiful day for the battues . The next morning was lovely . I went to my maid 's room , just across the corridor ( such a good arrangement ? all our rooms looked out on the park , and just across the corridor were a succession of small rooms giving on the court-yard , that were always kept for the maids and valets of the guests ) , to see the shooters start . There were two carriages and a sort of tapissiere following with guns , servants , and cartridges . I had a message from Mme. P , asking if I had slept well , and sending me the paper ; and a visit from Comtesse de S , who , I think , was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before that the ploughed fields were something awful , and hoped I had brought short skirts and thick boots . I think the sight of my short Scotch homespun skirt and high boots reassured her . We started about 11.30 in an open carriage with plenty of furs and wraps . It was n't really very cold ? just a nice nip in the air , and no wind . We drove straight into the woods from the park . There is a beautiful green alley which faces one just going out of the gate , but it was too steep to mount in a carriage . The woods are very extensive , the roads not too bad ? considering the season , extremely well kept . Every now and then through an opening in the trees we had a pretty view over the plains . As we got near the pavilion we heard shots not very far off ? evidently the shooters were getting hungry and coming our way . It was a pretty rustic scene as we arrived . The pavilion , a log house , standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse and cart which had brought the provisions from the chateau tied to one of the trees . It was shut in on three sides , wide open in front , a bright fire burning and a most appetizing table spread . Just outside another big fire was burning , the cook waiting for the first sportsman to appear to begin his classic dishes , omelette au lard and ragodt de mouton . I was rather hungry and asked for a piece of the pain de menage they had for the traqueurs ( beaters ) . I like the brown country bread so much better than the little rolls and crisp loaves most people ask for in France . Besides our own breakfast there was an enormous pot on the fire with what looked like an excellent substantial soup for the men . In a few minutes the party arrived ; first the shooters , each man carrying his gun ; then the game cart , which looked very well garnished , an army of beaters bringing up the rear . They made quite a picturesque group , all dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the big  |p536  shoots , people imprudently firing at something moving in the bushes , which proved to be a man and not a roebuck , that M. P dresses all his men in white . The gentlemen were very cheerful , said they had had capital sport , and were quite ready for their breakfast . We did n't linger very long at table , as the days were shortening fast , and we wanted to follow some of the battucs . The beaters had their breakfast while we were having ours ? were all seated on the ground around a big kettle of soup , with huge hunks of brown bread on their tin plates . We started off with the shooters . Some walking , some driving , and had one pretty battue of rabbits ; after that two of pheasants , which were most amusing . There were plenty of birds , and they came rocketing over our heads in fine style . I found that Comtesse de S -- was quite right about the necessity for short skirts and thick boots . We stood on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross afterward on our way home , and I did n't think it was possible to have such cakes of mud as we had on our boots . We scraped off some with sticks , but our boots were so heavy with what remained that the walk home was tiring . Mme. P - was standing at the halldoor when we arrived , and requested us not to come into the hall , but to go in by the lingerie entrance and up the back stairs , so I fancy we had n't got much dirt off . I had a nice rest until 4.30 , when I went down to the salon for tea . We had all changed our outdoor garments and got into rather smart day dresses ( none of those ladies wore tea-gowns ) . The men appeared about five ; some of them came into the salon notwithstanding their muddy boots , and then came the livre de chasse and the recapitulation of the game , which is always most amusing . Every man counted more pieces than his beater had found . The dinner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two of the original party went off before dinner , two others arrived , one of them a Cabinet minister ( Finances ) . He was very clever and defended himself well when his policy was freely criticised . While we women were alone after dinner , Mme. P showed me how to make crochet petticoats . She gave me a crochet-needle and some wool and had wonderful patience , for it seemed a most arduous undertaking to me , and all my rows were always crooked ; however , I did learn , and have made hundreds since . All the children in our village pull up their little frocks and show me their crochet petticoats whenever we meet them . They are delighted to have them , for those we make are of good wool ( not laine de bienfaisance , which is stiff and coarse ) , last much longer than those one buys . The second day was quite different . There was no shooting . We were left to our own devices until twelve o'clock breakfast . W. and I went for a short stroll in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us over the farm , all so well ordered and prosperous . After breakfast we had about an hour of salon before starting for the regular tozzrnee de proprietaire through park and gardens . The three ladies ? Mme. P her daughter , and daughter-in-law ? had beautiful work . Mme. P --  was making portieres for her daughter 's room , a most elaborate pattern , reeds and high plants , a very large piece of work ; the other two had also very complicated work ? one a tablecover , velvet , heavily embroidered , the other a church ornament ( almost all the Frenchwomen of a certain monde turn their wedding dresses , usually of white satin , into a priest 's 7 ) e/orient . The Catholic priests have all sorts of vestments which they wear on different occasions : purple in Lent , red on any martyr 's fete , white for all the fetes of the Virgin . Some of the churches are very rich with chasubles and altarcloths trimmed with fine old lace , which have been given to them . It looks funny sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's son , with a heavy peasant face , wearing one of those delicate whitesatin chasubles . Before starting to join the shooters at breakfast Mme. P took me all over the house . It is really a beautiful establishment , very large , and most comfortable . Quantities of pictures and engravings , and beautiful Empire furniture . There is quite a large chapel at the end of the corridor on the ground-floor , where they have mass every Sunday . The young couple have a charming installation , really a small house , in one of the wings ? bedrooms , dressingrooms , boudoir , cabinet de travail , and a separate entrance ? so that M. P --  can receive anyone who comes to see him on business without having them pass through the  |p537  chateau . Mme. P -- has her rooms on the ground-floor at the other end of the house . Her sitting-room with glass door opens into a winter garden filled with plants which gives on the park ; her bed-room is on the other side , looking on the court-yard ; a large library next it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything admirably arranged . The evening mail goes out at 7.30 , and every evening at seven exactly the lettercarrier came down the corridor knocking at all the doors and asking for letters . He had stamps , too , at least French stamps . I could never get a foreign stamp ( twenty-five centimes ) ? had to put one of fifteen and two of five when I had a foreign letter . I do n't really think there were any in the country . I do n't believe they had a foreign correspondent of any description . It was a thoroughly French establishment of the best kind . We walked about the small parks and gardens in the afternoon . The gardens are enormous ; one can drive through them . Mme. P drove in her pony carriage . They stil had some lovely late roses which filled me with envy ? ours were quite finished . The next day was not quite so fine , gray and misty , but a good shooting day , no wind . We joined the gentlemen for lunch in another pavilion farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day . However , we were warm enough with our coats on , a good fire burning , and hot bricks for our feet . The battues ( aux cchelles ) that day were quite a new experience for me . I had never seen anything like it . The shooters were placed in a semicircle , not very far apart . Each man was provided with a high double ladder . The men stood on the top ( the women seated themselves on the rungs of the ladders and hung on as well as they could ) . I went the first time with W. , and he made me so many recommendations that I was quite nervous . I must n't sit too high up or I would geener him , as he was obliged to shoot down for the rabbits ; and I must n't sit too near the ground , or I might get a shot in the ankles from one of the other men . I ca n't say it was an absolute pleasure . The seat ( if seat it could be called ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun just over my head was decidedly trying ; still it was a novelty , and if the other women could stand it I could . For the second battue I went with Comte de S --  . That was rather worse , for he shot much oftener than W. , and I was quite distracted with the noise of the gun . We were nearer the other shooters , too , and I fancied their aim was very near my ankles . It was a pretty view from the top of the ladder . I climbed up when the battues were over . We looked over the park and through the trees , quite bare and stripped of their leaves , on the great plains , with hardly a break of wood or hills , stretching away to the horizon . The ground was thickly carpeted with red and yellow leaves , little columns of smoke rising at intervals where people were burning weeds or rotten wood in the fields ; and just enough purple mist to poetize everything . S is a very careful shot . I was with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed rather near each other , and every man was asked to keep quite to his own place and to shoot straight before him . After one or two shots S --  stepped back and gave his gun to his servant . I asked what was the matter . He showed me the man next , evidently not used to shooting , who was walking up and down , shooting in every direction , and as fast as he could cram the cartridges into his gun . So he stepped back into the alley and waited until the battase was over . The party was much smaller that night at dinner . Everyone went away but W. and me . The talk was most interesting ? all about the war , the first days of the Assemblee Nationale at Bordeaux , and the famous visit of the Comte de Chambord to Versailles , when the Marechal de MacMahon , President of the Republic , refused to see him . I told them of my first evening visit to Mme. Thiers , the year I was married . Mme. Thiers lived in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received every evening . M. Thiers , who was a great worker all his life and a very early riser , always took a nap at the end of the day . The ladies ( Mlle. Dosne , a sister of Mme. Thiers , lived with them ) , unfortunately had not that good habit . They took their little sleep after dinner . We arrived there ( it was a long way from us , we lived near the Arc de 1'Etoile ) one evening a little before ten . There were already four or five men , no ladies . We were shown into a large drawingroom , M. Thiers standing with his back to the fireplace , the centre of a  |p538  group of black coats . He was very amiable , said I would find Mme. Thiers in a small salon just at the end of the big one ; told W. to join their group , he had something to say to him , and I passed on . I did find Mme. Thiers and Mlle. Dosne in the small salon at the other end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really embarrassed . They did n't hear me come in , and were sleeping quite happily and comfortably . I did n't like to go back to the other salon where there were only men , so I sat down on a sofa and looked about me , and tried to feel as if it was quite a natural occurrence to be invited to come in the evening and to find my hostess asleep . After a few minutes I heard the swish of a satin dress coming down the big salon and a lady appeared , very handsome and well dressed , whom I did n't know at all . She evidently was accustomed to the state of things ; she looked about her smilingly , then came up to me , called me by name , and introduced herself , Mme. P ? , the wife of an admiral whom I often met afterward . She told me not to mind , there was n't the slightest intention of rudeness , that both ladies would wake up in a few minutes quite unconscious of having really slept . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly Mme. Thiers opened her eyes , was wide awake at once ? how quietly we must have come in ; she had only just closed her eyes for a moment , the lights tired her , etc . Mlle. Dosne said the same thing , and then we went on talking easily enough . Several more ladies came in , but only two or three men . They all remained in the farther room talking , or rather listening , to M. Thiers . He was already a very old man , and when he began to talk no one interrupted him ; it was almost a monologue . I went back several times to the Place St. Georges , but took good care to go later , so that the ladies should have their nap over . One of the young diplomat 's wives had the same experience , rather worse , for when the ladies woke up they did n't know her . She was very shy , spent a wretched ten minutes before they woke , and was too nervous to name herself . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We left the next morning early , as W. had people coming to him in the afternoon . I enjoyed my visit thoroughly , and told them afterward of my misgivings and doubts as to how I should get along with strangers for two or three days . I think they had rather the same feeling . They were very old friends of my husband 's , and though they received me charmingly from the first , it brought a foreign and new element into their circle . @#
