THE public questions now receiving most attention in America ? those of the labor trusts and the capital trusts ? are at bottom questions of competition . The topic is of peculiar importance to us , for it is universally admitted that competition , in both making money and spending it , is fiercer here than elsewhere . Our average man , and perhaps still more our average woman , wants to outdo her neighbor in clothes , housing , equipage , entertainment ? everything that money can be wasted on ; and the competition to make all that money is as fierce as the competition to spend it . This is largely because we are , as the London Nation justly calls us , " inordinately free from the conventions , restraints , distractions , and hypocrisies of the older civilizations . " For comparison we need glance at English conditions alone : those in Europe generally are enough like them . When an Englishman gets comfortably rich , he is apt to think of a place in the country , and a local magistracy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom cared for as giving an opportunity to serve the community or to gain political honors . Rank , too , ? not merely the title that a rich man may hope to gain , but rank derived through ancestry , and embedded in history and the system of things , ? is a constant reminder that wealth is not for him the highest earthly good . The aristocratic conditions also carry much tradition and habit of culture and refinement , and , it does not seem fanciful to believe , thus afford the main attraction that keeps relatively so many more Englishmen than Americans away from wealth-seeking , and in pursuit of the things of the spirit . The English church , too , has a great influence in this direction , not only because its endowments attract men from competitive pursuits , but also because of the leisure it gives for other pursuits . The American attaches little honor to political position . because our democracy so frequently ? is it too much to say so generally P ? gives such position to men with small claim to honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a real aristocracy , it is only in a derived sense , for it does not rule , and the general public knows nothing about it ; the public knows only our sham aristocracy of wealth . True , our unexampled diffusion of education fits more men than elsewhere to enter into the competition above manual labor ; but high ambition is the infirmity of only noble souls ; not one man in a thousand cares for the triumphs of art , or letters , or politics , or even of war . Yet every man is a snob , and there is no American country paper now without its social column ? even out in California and Oregon the papers copy the so-called society news from the New York papers ; and in them our American democrat sees almost entirely the names of people he has heard of as rich , seldom the name of anybody he has heard of as anything else . In short , wealth and its results are the only good yet conspicuous on the average American horizon . Hence our utterly unexampled rage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well illustrated by the wife of one of the great captains of industry , who lately said , " My husband hesitated between taking his present position and going to the Senate . If he had gone to the Senate , it would have wrecked his career . " Now , in this fierce competition , the sentiments regarding it are paradoxical to a degree that is hardly short of amusing . Nearly everybody is half the time crying out against competition , and the other half demanding it . Workingmen try to suppress it in labor , and to enforce it in commerce ; on the other hand , the leaders of the industrial world are trying to secure it in labor , and to get rid of it in commerce ; while the leaders of the regulative or political world are trying heartily to maintain it in commerce , and are comparatively indifferent to it in labor . Yet there is a , consistency pervading all these seemingly paradoxical conditions : each man tries to get rid of competition in what he sells , and secure it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants no competition in it : so he forms his labor trust , and tolerates all the other labor trusts ; he buys commodities , and wants all possible competition in them : so he attacks the capitalist trusts . The captain of industry buys labor : so he wants all possible competition in it , and therefore disapproves the labor trusts ; he sells commodities , and therefore wants no competition in them : so he forms his own trust , and tolerates the other capitalist trusts . The legislator , administrator , jurist , sells neither labor nor commodities , and buys both : so he favors competition in both , but tempers his advocacy of it in labor , by a tenderness for the labor vote . But while the statesman , so far as he is a patriot , is above competition , so far as he is a politician he knows it in perhaps its widest and intensest form , and against it makes his political trusts : the great national parties have many features in common with the trusts ? especially the Republican party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county organizations do not generally control plunder enough to justify close trust organization , the city political gangs do , and generally are trusts , Tammany being one of the best organized trusts in the world . Even the professional classes are not without organization against competition . The musicians ' trusts are as selfish , and apparently as foolish , as the hod-carriers ' trusts ; and even the bar associations and the medical societies , while their real object is the intellectual and ethical advance of their professions , can not entirely escape some incidental part in the virtually universal defenses against competition ? can not escape acting in some respects as trusts . Outside of all these classes is the large one of exchangers of commodities , who generally deal in too great a variety of articles to be tempted into trusts of their own . Yet they are all interested in transportation , and therefore naturally object to railroad trusts and teamsters ' trusts . To other trusts they are comparatively indifferent , but as individuals they compete as actively as anybody . As competition is attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also everywhere guarded against , it must have its evils , and so distinct are these evils that Mr. S. A. Reeve , the author of the only book on its general aspects which I know of , apparently thinks that to them are to , be attributed most of the sufferings that civilized humanity endures . With Henry George and Edward Bellamy , he belongs to a school ? or section outside of the schools ? which I am never sure that I understand , or that it does ; but if I understand him , he holds that competition does not naturally inhere in production , but is bred solely by exchange and other activities not directly productive ; and as a member of the noble army of panacea-makers , he offers , as his , the abolition of merchandizing , banking , and many other activities . But just how his panacea is to be administered , he shows no more dearly than do the other inventors of schemes for the millennium . Competition is certainly not an invention of the devil , unless the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all educated people know that competition was ingrained in nature long before there was merchandizing , or manufacturing , or individual tinkering , or savage hunting and fishing , or savages , or beasts , or birds , or fishes , or gastropods , or amcebas . The very plants , when probably there were no living things but plants , competed fiercely , and they compete still , for light and heat and moisture . To-day they are even competing for territory , with streams and ponds , and actually filling them up and obliterating them . They compete with men for the possession of the tropic zone , and have often beaten them ; and I know a case within a dozen miles of Chicago where they competed with an ice company for the possession of a stream , and forced it to use a little steamer with a sort of mowing machine attached . They limited the area of the company 's activities , and , for all I know , drove it off altogether , though now a mightier competitor than either ? the steel corporation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , the very amcebas , the lucky ones and lively ones and wise ones , floated into the best places , and kept the unlucky ones and lazy ones and stupid ones out . When tadpoles and fish were evolved , there began a mighty gobbling up of the weak by the strong ; later , reptiles ? big lizards with wings , and birds with teeth ? kept up the game , and made it livelier , perhaps , than ever before or since , even down to the days of Standard Oil . Some time along there , began the most interesting of all competitions , ? the one out of which has been evolved all that men most care for , and perhaps all that is most worth their caring for , ? the competition because of sex . In the struggle of brutes for mates , it was often competition in mere force ; but there was also higher competition , in the glowworm 's light , and the bird 's song and plumage . When man was evolved , it grew higher and higher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now does more than anything else to fill the opera houses and picture galleries , and fiction and poetry , and the very souls of the world ; and not only does art find in competition its mightiest theme , but art itself is a field of competition and struggle against competition , from rival primadonnas down to the musical unions already cited . There is nothing , from the deepest mine to the tallest church , ? or even the tallest skyscraper , ? from the dollars a man pays his valet to the devotion he pays his lady-love , that is not informed through and through by competition . One is often tempted to regard it as the motive power of the world . But it is not : it is only an incident of the motive powers ? often an exaggerated and destructive one , often not rising above the dignity of a foolish one . Nevertheless , with the evolution of intelligence , there has appeared a new set of factors : sympathy , mercy , justice , have begun to restrain and narrow competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in law . This new stage of the matter to-day absorbs a wide share of men 's interests and even of their enthusiasms ; and these , like all new enthusiasms , reach many extremes . Of these , later . With competition everywhere else , the idea of wiping it out of industry must , at best , be a counsel of perfection , and at worst the idea of making industry cease . Rarely , if at all , can there be an effort which is to be paid for , that does not tend to compete with every other effort which is to be paid for . Any man who heaves coal competes with every other man who heaves coal , and moreover he tends to lower the wages in coal-heaving , ? so that coal-heavers will tend to leave that profession and compete in others . These tendencies are not always realized in practice , because the individual effort is too small to overcome inertia and friction , or even to be measured by our currency and other instruments . But when such efforts " happen " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aggregate is sometimes important . As a rule , the only way to get rid of competition is , as already intimated , to get rid of work . Does not the most beneficent of inventions inevitably compete with all connected vested interests ? Can the merchant who sells the best goods at the lowest prices , continue without competing with all others and getting the biggest business ? Do not the men in the most unselfish pursuits inevitably compete for the best places in them ? Does not the most self-sacrificing physician compete for the best practice ? Does not even the most self-sacrificing clergyman compete for the best congregation ? Neither may have the end in view , but if he puts forth the best in him , is not the end inevitably forced upon him ? So unescapable is competition , that we find it cropping up in spite of the best efforts to suppress it . For instance : the very able and philanthropic chairman of the ' , United States Steel Corporation became impressed with the idea that steady prices would be a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , as anybody who thinks that a clear complexion is a good thing . But circumstances are frequent where a clear complexion can not be had , and where efforts to suppress eruption must end in disaster . So in the economic world , the unevenness in men 's judgments ? their making too much of one commodity and too little of another ? renders steadiness of price impossible , even the fixing of a normal price impossible except through competition . The only rational price ( if the versed reader , will be patient with a little A B C ) is that where the demand will just absorb the supply ; and this price will be found only by buyers competing for product when demand is good , and by sellers competing for custom when demand is slack . This of course makes high prices in good times . and low prices in had times ; the only way to get rid of high prices and low prices is to get rid of good times and bad times ; the only way to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazes and panics ; and the only way to get rid of crazes and panics is to get rid of intemperance in both hope and fear . But temperance is as remarkable by its absence from sundry schools of philanthropists as from the community in general ; nothing is more characteristic of that virtue than the ability to wait , and nothing is more characteristic of the philanthropists than to try to go faster than natural law . Last fall , when competition began bubbling to raise the safety-valve of prices , the benevolent Steel Corporation smilingly seated itself upon the valve , and the competition had to break out somewhere else . Among other evil consequences , the company got many more orders at the prevailing prices than it could fill . If they had raised prices , and so lowered the demand to equal the supply , the customers least in need , or least able profitably to use steel , would have dropped out , and the neediest and ablest would have been supplied ; the most important demands would have been satisfied , and nobody would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each order was filled in part , the most important and necessary enterprises were left unfinished along with the least important and the mistaken ones ; nobody was satisfied ; complaints were loud ; and some of the railroad companies met to devise their own rail-factories . But in thus suppressing the natural and salutary effects of competition , the Steel Corporation itself entered into competition ? and an injurious and unnatural competition , ? with the weaker companies : for , as it would not raise prices , the weaker companies could not avail themselves of the good times to strengthen themselves against bad times , and against the natural tendency of any great competitor to gobble up little competitors in bad times . That such was the deliberate intention of the Steel Corporation , however , I do not believe : for I have faith in the philanthropic intentions of its chairman . But the story is not ended : when the bad times came later last fall , in his desire to keep prices even , he exercised his wonderful powers of persuasion to prevent the other manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so the steel industries were kept idle or partly idle for many months , until they could bear the strain no longer , and the steel company itself had to lower prices , right on top of a declaration , the last of many , that it was not going to . This is the most recent , and perhaps the most remarkable , of the great illustrations of the utter impossibility , as men are now constituted and industries now organized , of avoiding competition . It is plainly impossible that a feature so ingrained in nature and human nature should be wholly bad . Now , wherein is it good , and wherein is it bad ? Like everything else ? food , wine , money , even such ethereal things as literature , art , or love , or religion itself ? it is good within bounds , and bad in excess . Where are the bounds ? As in every . thing else , at waste ? waste of strength , character , time , or resources . Of course the problem of what is waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that does not cancel the duty of solving it . Everybody who reads these words /knows that , within bounds , competition tends ( if union leaders , or ' *wealthy malefactors , " or philanthropists , will let it ) to keep prices reasonable ? where , as already said , they preserve the equation of supply and demand ; to keep quality good , and supply abundant and accessible ; that in advertising , it spreads a good deal of useful intelligence , though mixed with a good deal that is superfluous and even false ; and that in drumming , it is a great convenience and saving to dealers generally , and keeps the country hotels and railroad accommodations a great deal better than they otherwise would be . A benefit not as obvious as those , is its elimination of the unfit from industry . Theie are always hanging on to the outskirts of business , a lot of incapable men who are pestering and impeding the rest of the world with poor goods , poor service , unfulfilled engagements , bankruptcies , and prices broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confining business to the more capable , is a good service to the community . And it is even a good service to the eliminated men : for they are much better off under the guidance of the capable than in en ? during the responsibilities , anxieties , and privations inseparable from depending on the discharge of duties beyond them . Competition , then , so far as it regulates prices , increases products and services . and eliminates inefficiency , is an unmixed good . And here we approach the other side . The competition which drives out the incapable is a very different matter from the competition which drives out the capable . Effective competition of course Competition fiel destroys competition elsewhere , and so far as that is done by increasing goods and services , the good produced exceeds the good destroyed , and the world is still the gainer . But when the destruction through competition is an end in itself ? when one man , without improving product or service , sacrifices values and efforts merely to destroy another man 's competition , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These factS are obscured because such competition may bring benefit ? though probably only a specious benefit ? to the aggressor ; but it can at best bring the benefit only at the cost of his victims and the public , and at the sacrifice , in the aggressor himself , of that for which no money can compensate : for there is sure to be a moral waste . I know very directly of a capable and prosperous man in Pennsylvania who was driven out of business by the Standard Oil Company , and touching whom one of the Oil magnates remarked , " Oh , he was easy game . " And this case is said to be one of many . It is generally understood that probably the most effective literary onslaught ever made on the Standard Oil Company was by an author whose father was one of the victims . To continue with the unfavorable side : ruinous competition in prices still exists , though hardly to the extreme of fifty or sixty years ago , when frequently opposing stage lines carried their passengers free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even threw in meals . We do not often hear of anything like that now , though in my own trade I occasionally hear rumors of schoolbooks given away , and ruinous prices paid prominent authors ; and perhaps any man in any trade may hear similar rumors in it . But whatever foundation there may be for such rumors , there seems to have developed a sense of shame regarding such proceedings that makes men slower than they were a generation or two ago to indulge in them openly . On its unfavorable side , too , competi- tion , instead of stopping at cheapening by simpler processes and legitimate accounts , tends to inferior materials and labor . Though in ordering large works or large supplies , the practice is universal of trying to get the benefits of reasonable competition by seeking bids , people have of late grown so afraid of excessive competition that the right to reject the lowest bids is reserved , though not always exercised . Moreover , competition tends frightfully to run to waste , and , later . paying for this waste tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scant and inaccessible . One of the worst wastes is in advertising : everybody uses soap , and no amount of advertising can make people use materially more ; and yet those who use the finer kinds probably pay more for having it dinned into them to use a certain brand , than they pay for the soap itself . I want to use another illustration from my own trade . No apology should be needed for a writer thus illustrating from his own trade , if he happens to have one ; and the more I see of the conditions , the more I incline to believe that he should have one , and that writing should not be a trade . If it ever ceases to be one , however , it will be when trades are less infested by foolish competition . But the interesting question of literature being a trade is " another story , " and possibly may be the subject of another essay . But one would hardly be required to justify the writer who has a trade , in illustrating from it : for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential of good writing ? knowing what he is writing about . The second illustration I want to make from my trade is in the fact that the country probably pays more for having its elementary schoolbooks argued and cajoled and bribed into use , than for the books themselves . Leaving the bribery out , the same is probably true of high-school books ; and the increasing amount of interviewing , explanation , comparison , and argument regarding col- lege books , is rapidly making it true of them . But excessive expenses in competition are worse than wasteful and demoralizing : they are aggressive , and provoke retaliations equally objectionable . The competition in economized production , faithful service , reasonable prices , and reasonable and truthful publicity , is simply incidental to each man 's doing his best for himself ; but beyond this point it begins to mean each man 's doing his worst for his neighbor . Incidental competition contains what truth there is in the aphorism that competition is the life of trade ; but aggressive competition means war , waste , and death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces the wise man to play the fool when his competitors do , or suffer for his wisdom . When lie is thus between Scylla and Charybdis , what ought he to do ? I knew a man who , in a peculiar condition of his business , when a collateral business was making inroads on it , was often met by the proposition from those whose custom he needed , " If you wo n't concede so and so , I know a man who will . " His answer was , " That if I do n't make a fool of myself , some competitor will , is not a convincing argument . I 'll wait till he does , and the fools put themselves out of the race . " And wait he did , and his example prevented many other men from making fools of themselves , and did much to relieve his trade from a peculiarly unfair and abnormal competition . In competition , the call to do the brave thing arises because competition is war . But in war it is often braver not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been in aggression , but in self-defense ? little Holland against gigantic Spain . And where is the bully now ? Though non-resistance is ideal ethics , it should be fundamentally understood that ideal ethics apply only to an ideal world , and that often the attempt to introduce them into a practical world is not only futile , but wasteful and destructive . As already hinted , the point at which competition becomes abnormal , forced , and aggressive , is when it is wasteful ? when the cost of feeding it reduces profits below the average rate . But it is superficial to estimate profits as money alone : social considerations and the gratification of personal predilection are all profits in the broad sense . For " profits " substitute satisfactions , and the general proposition holds . This seems to hark forward to an ideal ? that it is for the greatest good of the greatest number that all men 's fortunes , estimated in satisfactions , should be equal ; and perhaps the most pronounced individualist would not object to that as an ideal , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freest opportunity for individual development that men 's fortunes can become equal ; and individual development is competition . The wastes of exaggerated competition of course prompt the question whether men would not be better off if , instead of competing , they were cooperating ? if instead of fighting each other , even incidentally , they were helping each other . As far as human nature has yet been evolved , the change is not possible to any great extent , and the question is too complicated to admit of an answer in the present state of human intelligence . Yet there are some little bits of experience in the cooperation of small groups , and also in occasional middle conditions where purposed competition has ceased , though cooperation has hardly begun . But they are conditions of unstable equilibrium which must soon disappear . I would illustrate this point , too , from my own trade , despite my having done so already in the Atlantic , ' Such a condition prevailed in the upper walks of the publishing business from about 1865 to 1875 , and contained sew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? nteresting . In the first place , it as a brief realization of the ideals of philosophical anarchism ? self-regulation without law . There was no international copyright to protect an American publisher 's property in an English book ; yet an intelligent self-interest , among a perhaps exceptional body of men , performed the functions of law . By mutual consent , when a publisher had a contract with an English author for a book , or even in the absence of a contract , when a publisher made the first announcement of an intention to print an English book , no other American publisher of standing would print it in opposition . This usage was called the courtesy of the trade , and for about ten years that courtesy was seldom violated . Moreover , the courtesy was extended to the relations of publishers with American authors . During that period , no publisher of standing would any more try to get away another 's client than a lawyer of standing would try to get away another 's client , or a physician another 's patient . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , than it has under contrary conditions . If that absence of direct purposeful competition could have been maintained , the prosperity could have been maintained . But it depended , as I have intimated , upon the trade happening to be at that time , in the hands of men of exceptional character ; and the results of peaceful ways were , as has been the case in all history , tempting to the outside barbarian . If the Harpers were making money for the author and themselves out of a book by George Eliot , the Appletons or the Scribners would not print it ; but soon an enterprising printer in the West awoke to the fact that there was no law to prevent his printing it in a cheaper edition , or to compel him to pay royalty to the author ; and print he did , right and left . His example was soon followed by others , and the peaceful and profitable conditions of philosophical anarchism were once more demonstrated impossible of duration in the present state of human nature . As always when men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be resorted to , and the International Copyright Law Of 1891 was the result . It is interesting further to note that the spirit of aggressive competition which grew up after the period of philosophical anarchy filled the business with waste in advertising , over-bidding for authors , and over-concession of discounts and credits to customers ; until , a few years ago . the competition reached extremes which were at last realized to be wasteful and ruinous , and are gradually being curtailed . But the curtailments have made almost as great demands on courage , and on the capacity to see future advantages in present sacrifices , as were required to make possible the decade of philosophical anarchism ; and the evolution of another period of non-competitive peace , economy , and mutual courtesy will probably be as slow as the evolution of human nature . And yet during that Arcadian period , or rather at about its falling away , there were many to claim that the established publishers were in a combine or trust ( though the actual word was not then current ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the predatory way . Yet in a libel suit instituted by one of the predatory people against the Evening Post , for calling him a pirate , I heard a successful publisher on the witness stand declare that he had entered the business about the beginning of the period referred to , had never reprinted another publisher 's book , and had never been the object of aggression by another publisher , but on the contrary had always been treated by the others with courtesy , and often had the benefit of their experienced advice . It should be further observed that during this absence of purposeful competition , incidental competition was inevitably going on all the while . At no time under my observation was there more emulation in economy of method and quality of product . During that period was established the great advance in the quality of bookmaking which distinguishes the American books of to-day from our crude products before the middle sixties . So far , then , as inferences regarding the whole industrial field can be drawn from a brief and exceptional experience in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some strong characteristics outside of pure industrialism , it would be a fair inference to conjecture that all forms of industry will gain in peace and prosperity from such advances in human nature as will do away with purposeful and aggressive competition , and that the incidental competition of emulation in methods and product will still be great enough to develop the effort on which progress must depend . These truths regarding the industrial world were long since realized by the superior minds in the professional world . The high-class medical practitioner does not try to get away his colleagues ' patients ; does not make his charges lower than those of other physicians ; derives no profit from his discoveries , but throws them open to the world ; does not tout for practice , and make his customers pay the expenses of the touting ; never disregards the call of mercy ; and tempers his fees to the shorn lamb , or rather lets the lamb go unshorn . High-class lawyers , too , have restricted their competition to rendering the best service they know how , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients , and even from advertising for clients . Now it could not have been merely what are usually termed moral considerations that long ago evolved these codes of professional ethics . These men have been intelligent enough to realize that undue competition must in the long run be no more productive than dog eating dog , and that peace and dignity are better worth having than superfluous money . The commercial world may be slowly feeling its way toward such conditions , but even in the professional world they are as yet but conditions of unstable equilibrium ; lately our terrible American commercialism , and love of ostentation and luxury and apparent equality , have been doing much to send professional ethics to the dogs . This , however , should not be laid entirely to the mere spirit of competition ; it must be laid largely to the moral breakdown that has followed the weakening of the old religious sanctions , and that will last until we get some new sanctions from our increasing knowledge of nature . But the professional world and the publishing world have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some years past , people in trade after trade have found that they were competing until they were making no money . Everywhere excessive enterprise or excessive avarice , and excessive lack of foresight and character , were defeating themselves . At last , many of the leaders of the respective trades began to meet to agree upon prices , discounts , sometimes number of drummers , and , for all I know , amount of advertising . But there was too much " enterprise , " or too little character , to make the agreements last : honest men held up prices while knaves undersold them . It was at length realized that the only effective plan was to put a whole industry under a central control . Hence the trust . This tended not only to stop waste , but to economize management and office administration ; and it was urged that part of these great economies could he given to the public through reductions in prices . This was the view of people who had things for sale . But the vast majority who had nothing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this majority , called these agreements schemes to benefit each particular trade at the expense of the community ? and said that , competition being destroyed , the public would be , in the matter of price , at the mercy of the combine . And , despite the wise and economical features of such arrangements , the Sherman law and its progeny have made them illegal . The crude new legislation has seldom attempted to attack the evils in such a way as to leave room for the possible benefits ; and has been largely futile and destructive . As a sample , it is now promoting the destruction of the bookstores : I am just mourning the fall of one of the oldest and best , in my little university town in Vermont . The department stores are killing the booksellers by selling the most popular new books at cost , and less than cost , for the sake of attracting custom for other things . When the publishers got together and tried to stop this , their counsel told them that the Sherman law would not permit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would permit them to try to limit it among others , by refusing to sell to dealers who cut prices . But the courts have recently decided that even this aid to the merchandising of culture has been restricted by our sapient lawmakers to copyright books : Homer and Shakespeare are beyond the pale of their assistance . The law of Illinois exempts day-laborers from the tutelage it imposes on the book-trade . In other words , it has exempted from its provisions the trust whose actions have been the most extreme , and have been most enforced by extreme methods ? such as withholding the general supplies of food and fuel ; obstructing transportation ; and boycott , violence , and murder . Moreover , the demagogues are agitating for the labor trust 's exemption from the United States Trust laws ; and since the Supreme Court has pronounced against the boycott , the labor trusts are also agitating for legislation to make them superior to the effect of the decision , ? superior to everybody else , ? to permit them to restrict competition by unlimited coercion . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of difficulty . The Illinois law is probably as bad a case of demagoguery and class legislation as was ever enacted . My writing of that paragraph was interrupted by the sneezing of one of my boys who has hay fever . The growing paternalization of our government , as illustrated in some features of the pure food act , has prevented my obtaining for him the medicine which cured one of his parents and one of his grandparents . Will people ever learn that legislation is the most difficult and dangerous of the arts , and that it is best , where not clearly impracticable , to leave the cure of social ills to the courts ? There , not only is the experience of the race digested and applied by learning and training , but it is applied only to the case in hand , instead of ( to give the metaphor a twist or two ) being sent out crude and unbroken to run amuck . There can be little doubt that men could make more by helping one another than by fighting one another ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can foresee , the application of non-competitive or cooperative policies to the commercial world can not in strictness be a practical question . When we imagine Utopias , as always when we try to go very far beyond our experience , we land in paradoxes and contradictions ; and when we try to realize Utopias in the present state of morality , we class ourselves with the ignorant or the purblind . Attempts to realize ideals that are merely imagined have probably been the most wasteful and destructive of all human efforts . Yet often , as in mathematics , much is gained for practical questions by reasoning from impossible hypotheses , so long as we regard them as impossible . We can at least ask a more or less skeptical question or two regarding Utopia . For instance , if no time is to be wasted in competition , what are the advertisers , drummers , revenue officers excluding foreign products , and other people now performing waste labor , going to do for a living ? It seems reasonable to assume 546 The New Nationalist Movement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful things that the world is now doing without . And perhaps something even wiser than that ? there may not , after all , be produced so many more things : for in Utopia competition in consuming useless things will have disappeared . Nobody will have useless clothes , food , wines , jewels , equipages , servants , simply because his competitors have them ? each man will be content with what he reasonably needs ; and in a cooperative world , he will spend his then superfluous powers in cooperating with the efforts of his less able neighbors to get needed things . Yet more ? in Utopia men will have time to devote their efforts to the industry we now most conspicuously neglect ? saving our souls : there will be time for geniuses to write their best , and restore literature , instead of hurrying and overworking for superfluous and even hurtful things ; and time for ordinary men to read and think ; to listen to music , and make it ; to look at pictures , and do a little with cameras and water-colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn enough of it to have some intelligent say about making our own homes ; time to potter over our gardens ; time to travel ; and even time to go fishing , at least with Isaak . A woman to whom I read this said , " And we 'll have time to have time . " It is needless to say that she lived in New York . More important still , in the non-competitive Utopia , there will be time to keep well , time to die at a decent old age , and time to go decently to each other 's funerals . But before that , and most important of all , there will be time to prevent our having to feel , when we do go to funerals , perhaps the bitterest regret of all : " If I only had had more of that friend while he was here ! " But all this is Utopia . Each man has his own way to Utopia , and wise men know that they will not in one lifetime get far on any way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , that there are ways in that direction ; and that , while the competition incidental to honest emulation tends to keep those ways open , the competition born of greed and envy tends to keep them closed .
