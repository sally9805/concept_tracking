txt Smoke Nuisance In the City . I desire to thank you for once more bringing up the subject of the smoke nuisance . The fever for its reform has passed , and the usual supine indifference of the New York people after every such spasm of virtue is over , has set in . ( Witness the spitting nuisance . ) Again and again have I thought I will write to THE TIMES , and as often the second thought , " What 's the use ? " gained the day . I am a poor sleeper , and any night a glance from my window about 12 o'clock or later shows me the foul black smoke rising from the chimney of a large apartment house in the near neighborhood . During the day no hint is given of this , and everything is most discreetly proper ; this but adds fuel to the flame of my wrath , for it is an added meanness as showing that they can but will not regard either the law or the decencies . Again -- Do not , I beg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to-day 's TIMES in reference to wetting the streets . I pity the poor horses truly , but they should be properly shod to fit such conditions , and nothing should stand in the way of keeping the streets wet -- deluged , if you please , for the benefit of the humans in this dirt and wind ridden city .
