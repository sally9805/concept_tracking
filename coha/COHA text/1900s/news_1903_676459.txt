txt No successor to Leo XIII . has yet been chosen . From the smoke which issued from the little chimney on the Sistine Chapel to-night the vast multitude gathered in St. Peter 's square learned that the second day of the conclave had been fruitless . The conclusion is drawn that the strength of the leading candidate remains unbroken and that no compromise candidate has yet appeared . And there is no indication as to how long this condition of affairs will continue . The prolongation of the contest has aroused tremendous public interest , if indeed it can not be called excitement . Every trace of that apathy which followed the death of Pope Leo has vanished , and instead there now.exists a burning interest in everything Pertaining to the election of his successor . To-night this culminated in the appearance of a great crowd which packed the square of St. Peter 's and presented a spectacle seldom witnessed even at this scene of so many historic ceremonies . The impenetrable seclusion which shrouds those engaged in determining who shall be at the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their decision . Princes , Princesses . Archbishops , Bishops , Monsignors , priests . well-to-do - business people , in short , people front every walk in life , from that of nobleman to street beggar , talk of nothing but " la sfumata , " ( the smoke from the burning ballots . ) Both this morning and this evening this was the lodestone which drew tens of thousands to the square of St. Peter 's . There for hours , with strained eyes and craned necks , they waited in the hope of seeing a tiny little stream of smoke , so insignificant that it was almost impossible to realize that a great issue was involved in its fleeting appearance . ST . PETER 'S SQUARE THRONGED . 1 The scene at St. Peter 's to-night was by far the most impressive that has been witnessed in Rome since the late Pope became ill . After the fruitless morning ballot a belief spread that a new Pontiff would surely be elected this evening ? All roads during the afternoon therefore led to the Vatican . Carriages and vehicles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The regular Sunday leisure was forgotten in tire anxiety to see the new head of the Holy See . The streets converging into St. Peter 's square became black I with the thousands who entered the square 1 with the ceaseless regularity of an incoming tide . From the barracks came large reinforcements of troops , who marched across the piazza and lined up at the foot of the steps of the Basilica , leaving only small spaces between the companies in order to prevent a sudden rush to get inside St. Peter 's to witness the new Pope give his blessing to the Catholic world . A strong force of cavalry was picketed near by in case of riot , and over 2,000 soldiers were posted in the square . But the troops made only an Insignificant , thin , blue line compared with the vast multitude around them . 1 IBy 6 o'clock it was estimated that 50,000 People occupied the vast amphitheatre . From the steps of the Basilica , which were black with those standing or sitting , across to the opposite side of the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an undulating sea of humanity , with every face riveted on the Sistine Chapel , waiting for the smoke of the ballots . Almost encircling this great audience rose the stately Pillars of the Colonnade , beneath which many rested and waited . Near by hundreds of cabs were drawn up , their occupants eagerly scanning through glasses the little smokestack of the chapel . Stretching away for over a quarter of a mile , a distance from which it was absolutely impossible to see the smoke , were other thousands waiting to know the result . The rays of the setting sun , glancing from the dome o1 St. Peter 's , lighted up the housetops at the opposite end of the square , and these also were crowded with anxious watchers . Among the vast throng in the square itself were many German students , whose scarlet cassocks formed vivid patches of color . FALSE RUMOR OF ELECTION . When the hour of 0 struck a tremor of expectancy ran through the multitude , because , according to yesterday 's programme , the burning of the ballots or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . When the quarter hour sounded the nervousness Increased , and a large number of , officials of the Vatican not 1 1 engagAl in the conclave emerged to watch the concourse . As the hand of the clock on St. Peter 's approached the half hour a rumor that a selection had been made developed in the minds of many into a certainty , and each one momentarily expected that some favored Cardinal would be announced as the new Pontiff . The crowd I might almost have been one in some Amer1 ican city awaiting the result of a Presidential election , but with this striking difference  --  no solitary sign had come as to how the vote had been going . Another quarter of an hour passed , and the anxiety grew more intense . Not a breath of air relieved the sultry heat of 1 I the evening , and scarcely a sound came from the vast multitude . Hundreds gathered below the window from which the new Pontiff will bestow his first blessing . Suddenly , at 6:40 P. M. , a sharp cry arose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up by 50,000 throats and grew and grew until the immense piazza fairly roared with - Ecco ! Ecco ! La sfumata ! " Then silence fell like a spell , while the thousands watched from the . tin smokestack of 1 the Sistine Chapel a tiny stream of lightgray-smoke curl lazily downward . With no wind to carry it away , the smoke hung heavily in the hot air , and then gradually ! disappeared . For a moment the crowd believed that the signal meant an election , for there is a tradition that the Cardinals are allowed to send up a little smoke as a notification of art election , and much smoke in the case of a disagreement . Any such hopes , however , were almost immediately dissipated when a cloud of very thick smoke emerged and continued for five minutes . With many ejaculations of disappoint. * ment the populace watched the last trace of the ballots disappear , and then dispersed , although it was a long time before the square of the Basilica resumed its normal quiet appearance . DISAPPOINTMENT IN ROME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great disappointment to Rome , and it is doubtful whether such an immense crowd will again assemble unless the conclave should continue until another Sunday , The mute signal showing that the morning ballot had been fruitless was seen at 11:20 A. M. by many thousands also , but the watchers in the morning , owing to the intense heat of the sun , were compelled to shelter themselves beneath the Colonnade . In the course of the day the Austrian and French Ambassadors called at the Vatican and were received by Prince Chigi , Marshal of the Conclave . Cardinals Cretoni and Vaszary continue to receive their meals from the outside . The other Cardinals who are indisposed are reported to be slightly better . The Spanish students , who are particularly anxious about the condition of Cardinal Herrero y Espinosa , asked Dr. Lapponi through the wicket to-day how his Eminence was , and the doctor replied that lie was a little better , but still confined to his bed , and that the condition of Cardinal Cretoni was unchanged . It is understood that Cardinal Cretoni did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to do so . He is now filled with doubts as to whether he should give a vote , being afflicted with a sort of mania that he is unworthy to interpret the Divine will by casting his vote for any one . Cardinal Gotti , as far as is known , is the only one of the Cardinals who has not made some complaint about his cell . Being . a monk , he would consider demands for comfort against his ideas of austerity . To a member of the Noble Guard who wished him success Cardinal Gotti merely replied : " Thank you , but I shall not be made Pope . " There are thousands of rumors and unverified statements afloat as to what happened in the conclave to-day , but the only thing which seems to be reliably known is that the entire Sacred College assisted at mass , which was conducted by Father Palmieri. the Cardinals ' confessor , and that the Veni Creator " was sung .                  @ @ @
