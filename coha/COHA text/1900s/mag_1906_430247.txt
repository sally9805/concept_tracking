The history of the American " university " as distinguished from the " college " can hardly be said to begin before the seventies of the last century ; and without the least disparagement of any other seat of learning , it may be said that the establishment of Johns Hopkins marked the opening of an era . In 1873 the will of a Baltimore merchant provided for the founding of a new university , and a propitious mood of fortune which had favored the selection of a sagacious body of trustees extended its favor to their appointment of a capable president . Daniel Coit Gilman , born at Norwich in Connecticut , became a graduate of Yale in 1852 , and continued his studies both there and at Harvard as well as in Europe . The following years saw him connected with the Sheffield Scientific School and holding a chair at Yale , until , in 1872 , he was called to the presidency of the University of California , where " he helped to rescue a State University from the limitations of a college of agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonwealth . " With this valuable training the first president of Johns Hopkins brought an invaluable spirit , ? a combination which made him not only a master craftsman before the final launching of the university , but a reliable and confidence-inspiring pilot for the first twenty-five years of the subsequent voyage . That the waters should always be smooth , and that favoring breezes should always swell the sails , no pilot could ensure . Of the stormy waters , however , only incidental mention is made in the present volume . The new president suggested the emphasizing of the idea of a " university " and the desirability of building up an institution quite different from a " college " ; he wished " to make an addition to American education , not introduce a rival . " The times were ripe . Opportunities for graduate study were then few ; the relation of the professional schools to the college of liberal arts was but ill adjusted ; research was largely a matter of individual initiative and pursuit ; facilities for the publication of original articles were inadequate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to profit by a better order of things . To the promotion of the new order , President Gilman devoted his exceptional ability and energy . Sparing himself at not a single turn , he exhibited a laudable self-reliance ; but he exhibited also that strength of the strong which can profit by the strength of others . As a people , we owe much to James B. Angell , Charles W. Eliot , and Andrew D. White ; but for no other service should we be more grateful than for their timely encouragement and practical helpfulness in the formative period of the new university . Their willing kindness is gratefully recognized in the dedication of the volume before us , and it will not be forgotten by future generations . The far-seeing head of the institution destined to be so important staked everything upon his faculty . Again and again he insists on the supreme importance of the teaching staff in a university , a fact not undeserving of notice in these days when the university president looms so large before the public eye and the ordinary professor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , " is not lost sight of , that the power of the university will depend upon the character of its resident staff of permanent professors . It is their researches in the library and laboratory ; their utterances in the classroom and in private life ; their examples as students and investigators , and as champions of the truth ; their publications , through the journals and the scientific treatises , which will make the University of Baltimore an attraction to the best students , and serviceable to the intellectual growth of the land . " But if President Gilman staked everything upon his faculty , he took good care that his stake should not be lost . The first professors were Sylvester , Gildersleeve , Remsen , Rowland , Morris , and Martin ; a few years later , Welch , Halsted , Kelly , and Osler formed the nucleus of the medical faculty . These ten names in themselves would constitute a eulogy on the wisdom of the trustees , which was doubtless in this connection the wisdom of the President . All of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ; for these giants may be said to have fashioned the mould for the future of the American university . To a cause , however , as to an individual , blessing comes but seldom unattended by bane ; and the new order of things was not productive solely of good . When the far-reaching benefits of Johns Hopkins and the other great universities became obvious , donations on a magnificent scale began to grow common , until , as our author points out , more than one institution to-day has an endowment larger than that of all the insti- tutions which were in existence in 1850 . But if a strong university is a great good , a nominal university is a great evil ; and we find the danger noted that the country will soon have a superfluity of feeble universities , as it has had a superfluity of endowed colleges . " When a searcher for real conditions in our higher education begins to peer behind the august mask of the word " university , " he finds everything from the highest type of an institution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? everything , in fact , from Harvard to an institution of which it can only be said that the dead are there . When a denominational university with a small faculty confers more advanced degrees than Yale , words lose their meaning . Flagrant cases , however , will ultimately defeat their own ends , by cheapening the donor 's degrees in competition with the degrees of standard institutions ; and on the whole we are doing better . Another danger , ? that graduate work , with its insistence on research and printed results , would lead to sterile investigation and unprofitable publication , ? is upon us . Too often we investigate the fluctuations in the price of woolen socks in New England during two colonial decades , when we might more profitably be acquiring a decent historical horizon and economic perspective ; nor should we be eager to put forth a thesis on the hiccough of Aristophanes in Plato 's " Symposium " before we have read the " Republic . " With regard to printing , we are the victims of a veritable cacoethes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and similar publications of such strange double power that in them a worthy article may be entombed or an unworthy article be given a temporary semblance of life . To change our author 's words a little , there should be less printing and more editing . Furthermore , the young instructor , fresh from the seminar , is sadly inclined to be a pedant rather than a pedagogue ; the minute investigator too often fails to become the inspiring teacher , and " it does not appear that the undergraduates receive better instruction than they received in the earlier days . " Howbeit , all of these features are incidental , and can be changed . As to any responsibility therefor on the part of Johns Hopkins , we may quote a characteristic statement made by Professor Gildersleeve years ago to the present writer . " Young man , " he said , " whatever benefits have accrued to American education from graduate work may be traced to Johns Hopkins ; the evils all came from . . . " " The Launching of a University , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided into two parts , the first ( chapters I. ? IX. ) being concerned more immediately with the Johns Hopkins University , the second ( chapters X. ? XXII. ) embodying various addresses . The previous publication of certain portions is mentioned in the preface . The thoroughly interesting first part , with chapters X. and XIV. , would have made a valuable volume . " Fundamental Principles , " " The Original Faculty , " " Some Noteworthy Teachers , " " Resignation , " " Remembrances , " and " Research " are the captions of chapters that prove to be as fruitful as the headings suggest . Indeed , there is no disappointment save in the sixth chapter , which includes an account of the establishment of the Carnegie Institution ; but here the disappointment is keen . It will be remembered that the original purpose of Mr. Carnegie was " to make the gift directly to the nation , and for that reason he communicated an outline of his plan to the President of the United States , by whom it was received with the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was about this reflection and change that we had hoped for enlightenment . Whatever title might have been given to an institution founded on the unchanged plans , it could have been made to mean a National University endowed with $10,000,000 as a mere beginning , admitting of correlation with existing governmental scientific departments and with other educational institutions of the country , incorporating the most advanced ideas and the highest ideals , and providing thoroughly adequate means for investigation and leadership . Such an institution appeared to many educators as a wellspring of almost unlimited possibilities . When " reflection led to a change , " it was widely charged that a few eminent university leaders , fearing possible competition for their own graduate schools , had fostered this reflection unduly ; it was , and is , generally believed that , at any rate , they could have ensured the success of the original conception of the " evangelist of beneficence " if they had deemed it best for our national educational interests . From President Gilman we expected the enlightening word ; but darkness is still upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not prove . That these eminent and honorable men must have been influenced by altruistic and compelling motives , we are all anxious to believe ; but it would have been pleasant to change faith for knowledge . In all ages the small have craved the confidences of the great .  | The second part of Dr. Gilman 's book inevitably suffers in comparison with the significant chapters of the first part . The topics include " Books and Politics , " " De Juventute , " " Greek Art in a Manufacturing Town , " " Hand-Craft and Rede-Craft , " " Civil Service Reform , " and so forth . In the treatment , of course , there are always manifested sanity , lucidity , breadth of view , and generosity of sentiment ; but one or two of the addresses must strike a careful reader as approaching dangerously near to hack-work . One . feels that the first part could have been written by but few men , whereas the second could have been written by many , and might better have appeared as a separate volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to submit that there are too many cases of the publication of miscellaneous essays and addresses under attractive titles suggestive of unity of theme . Publishers admit that they are only human , ? and on the whole it is perhaps desirable that university presidents should share that amiable weakness ; but the title on the cover ought to convey the same idea as the words on the title-page . It is needless to say that in the present instance the title-page is above reproach . Were the task not so uncongenial , it would be possible to point out a few slips of the pen or lapses from careful presentation . A volume containing an address on Greek Art should hardly be guilty of the following : " The touch of Phidias was his own , and so inimitable that not long ago an American , scanning with his practised eye the galleries of the Louvre , discovered a fragment of the work of Phidias long separated from the other fragments by that sculptor which Lord Elgin had sent to London . The artist 's stroke could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly as our sign-manuals , our autographs . " Our author can refer only to the discovery by Waldstein of the Lapith head in the Louvre and its relation to one of the Parthenon metopes , and he certainly leaves the impression that Phidias actually carved the metopes with his own hand . Of course , the metopes are the work of the great Athenian in a perfectly true sense ; but that they show the actual strokes of his chisel , few would venture to maintain . A slip of a different sort attached the heading " Incidents of the Early Years " to a chapter of which a fourth is devoted to the Carnegie Institution founded so recently . Minor lapses and an occasional awkward sentence in a volume of three hundred and eighty-six pages are pardonable even if undesirable . Our closing impression , however , should not be given by words suggestive of fault-finding . President Gilman 's book has been welcome reading , and will doubtless be warmly received by all interested in higher education and in the history of our great institutions of learning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present such a " sheaf of remembrances.
