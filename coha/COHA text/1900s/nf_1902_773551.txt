txt ANTICIPATIONS ample , furnishing , and indeed of almost all things that are not primarily produced " for the million , " as the phrase goes . And where that sort of thing comes in , then , so far as the trained and intelligent type of man goes , for many years yet it will be simply a case of the nether instead of the upper millstone . Just how far the influence and contagion of the share-holding mass will reach into this imaginary household of non-share-holding efficients , and just how far the influence of science and mechanism will penetrate the minds and methods of the rich , becomes really one of the most important questions with which these speculations will deal . For this argument , that he will , perhaps , be able to buy up the architect and the tailor and the decorator and so forth , is merely preliminary to the graver issue . It is just possible that the share-holder may , to a very large extent ? in a certain figurative sense , at least ? buy up much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those severe , capable , and probably by no means unhappy little establishments to which our typical engineers will tend , and so prevent many women from becoming mothers of a regenerating world . The huge secretion of irresponsible wealth by the social organism is certain to affect the tone of thought of the entire feminine sex profoundly . The exact nature of this influence we may now consider . The gist of this inquiry lies in the fact that , // while a man 's starting position in this world of today is entirely determined by the conditions of his birth and early training , and his final position the slow , elaborate outcome of his own sustained efforts to live , a woman , from the age of sixteen onward ? as the world goes now ? is essentially adventurous , the creature of circumstances largely beyond her control and foresight . A virile man ? though he , too , is subject to accidents ? may , upon most points , still hope to plan and determine his life ; the life of a woman is all accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and until that man is indicated her preparation for life must be of the most tentative sort . She lives , going nowhere , like a cabman on the crawl , and at any time she may find it open to her to assist some pleasure-loving millionaire to spend his millions , or to play her part in one of the many real , original , and only derivatives of the former aristocratic " society " that have developed themselves ' among independent people . Even if she is a serious and labor-loving type , some share-holder may tempt her with the prospect of developing her exceptional personality in ease and freedom and in " doing good " with his money . With the continued growth of the share-holding class , the brighter-looking matrimonial chances , not to speak of the glittering opportunities that are not matrimonial , will increase . Reading is now the privilege of all classes ; there are few secrets of etiquette // that a clever lower-class girl will fail to learn ; there are few such girls , even now , who are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide possibilities , of luxury and freedom ; there are still fewer who , knowing as much , do not let it affect their standards and conception of life . The whole mass of modern fiction written by women for women , indeed , down to the cheapest novelettes , is saturated with the romance of mesalliance . And even when the specific man has appeared , the adventurous is still not shut out of a woman 's career . A man 's affections may wander capriciously and leave him but a little poorer or a little better placed ; for the women they wander from , however , the issue is an infinitely graver one , and the serious wandering of a woman 's fancy may mean the beginning of a new world for her . At any moment the chances of death may make the wife a widow , may sweep out of existence all that she had made fundamental in her life , may enrich her with insurance profits or hurl her into poverty , and restore all the drifting expectancy of her adolescence . Now , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , in whom an unlimited ambition and egotism is as natural and proper a thing as beauty and high spirits , to deny herself some dalliance with the more opulent dreams that form the golden lining to these precarious prospects . How can we expect her to prepare herself solely , putting all wandering thoughts aside , for the // servantless cookery , domestic Kindergarten work , the care of hardy perennials , and low-pitched conversation of the engineer 's home ? Supposing , after all , there is no predestinate engineer ! The stories the growing girl now prefers , and I imagine will in the future still prefer , deal mainly with the rich and free ; the theatre she will prefer to visit will present the lives and loves of opulent people with great precision and detailed correctness ; her favorite periodicals will reflect that life ; her schoolmistress , whatever her principles , must have an eye to her " chances . " And even after Fate or a gust of passion has whirled her into the arms of our busy and capable fundamental man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . Unless he is a person of extraordinary mental prepotency , she will almost insensibly determine the character of the ' home in a direction quite other than that of our first sketch . She will set herself to realize , as far as her husband 's means and credit permit , the ideas of the particular section of the wealthy that have captured her . If she is a fool , her ideas of life will presently come into complete conflict with her husband 's in a manner that , as the fumes of the love potion leave his brain , may bring the real nature of the case home to him . If he is of that resolute strain to wham the world must finally come , he may rebel and wade through tears and crises to his appointed work again . The cleverer she is , and the finer and more loyal her // character up to a certain point , the less likely this is to happen , the more subtle and effective will be her hold upon her husband , and the more probable his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adventures of modern money-getting in pursuit of her ideals of a befitting life . And meanwhile , since " one must live , " the nursery that was implicit in the background of the first picture will probably prove unnecessary . She will be , perforce , a person not only of pleasant pursuits , but of leisure . If she endears herself to her husband , he will feel not only the attraction but the duty of her vacant hours ; he will not only deflect his working hours from the effective to the profitable , but that occasional burning of the midnight oil that no brainworker may forego if he is to retain his efficiency will , in the interests of some attractive theatrical performance or some agreeable social occasion , all too frequently have to be put off or abandoned . This line of speculation , therefore , gives us a second picture of a household to put beside our first ? a household , or rather a couple , rather more likely to be typical of the mass of middling sort of people in those urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably not live in a separate home at all , but in a flat in " town , " or at one of the subordinate centres of the urban region we have foreseen . The apartments will he more or less agreeably adorned in some decorative // fashion akin to , but less costly than , some of the many fashions that will obtain among the wealthy . They will be littered with a miscellaneous literature ? novels of an entertaining and stimulating sort predominating ? and with brit-d-brat ; in a childless household there must certainly be quaint dolls , pet images , and so forth , and perhaps a canary would find a place . I suspect there would be an edition or so of Omar about in this more typical household of " moderns , " but I doubt about the Bible . The man 's working books would probably be shabby and relegated to a small study , and even these overlaid by abundant copies of the Financial something or other . It would still be a servantless household , and probably not only without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and degree it would probably have social relations directly or intermediately through rich friends with some section , some one of the numerous cults of the quite independent wealthy . Quite similar households to this would be even more common among those neither independent nor engaged in work of a primarily functional nature , but endeavoring quite ostensibly to acquire wealth by political or business ingenuity and activity , and also among the great multitude of artists , writers , and that sort of people , whose works are their children . In comparison with the state of affairs fifty years ago , the child-infested household is already conspicuously rare in these classes . // These are two highly probable menages among the central mass of the people of the coming time . But there will be many others . The menage a deux , one may remark , though it may be without the presence of children , is not necessarily childless . Parentage is certainly part of the pride of many men ? though , curiously enough , it does not appear to be felt among modern European married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably achieve parentage , therefore , who will not succeed in inducing , or who may possibly even be very loath to permit , their wives to undertake more than the first beginnings of motherhood . From the moment of its birth , unless it is kept as a pet , the child of such marriages will be nourished , taught , and trained almost as though it were an orphan ; it will have a succession of bottles and foster-mothers for body and mind from the very beginning . Side by side with this increasing number of childless homes , therefore , there may develop a system of Kindergarten boarding-schools . Indeed , to a certain extent such schools already exist , and it is one of the unperceived contrasts of this and any former time how common such a separation of parents and children becomes . Except in the case of the illegitimate and orphans , and the children of impossible ( many public-house children , e.g. ) or wretched homes , boarding-schools until quite recently were used only for quite big boys and girls . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sees a multitude of preparatory schools , which are really not simply educational institutions , but supplementary homes . In many cases these are conducted , and very largely staffed , by unmarried girls and women , who are , indeed , in effect , assistant mothers . This class of capable school-mistresses is one of the most interesting social developments of this period . For the most part they are women who , from emotional fastidiousness , intellectual egotism , or an honest lack of passion , have refused the common lot of marriage , women often of exceptional character and restraint , and it is well that , at any rate , their intelligence and character should not pass fruitlessly out of being . Assuredly for this type the future has much in store . There are , however , still other possibilities to be considered in this matter . In these Anticipations it is impossible to ignore the forces making for a considerable relaxation of the institution of permanent monogamous marriage in the coming years , and of a much greater variety of establishments than is suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without attempting to refer to statistics , that our present society must show a quite unprecedented number and increasing number of male and female celibates ? not religious celibates , but people for the most part whose standard of personal comfort has such a relation to their earning power that they shirk or can not enter // the matrimonial grouping . The institution of permanent monogamous marriage ? except in the ideal Roman Catholic community , where it is based on the sanction of an authority which in real Roman Catholic countries a large proportion of the men decline to obey ? is sustained at present entirely by the inertia of custom and by a number of sentimental and practical considerations ? considerations that may very possibly undergo modification in the face of the altered relationship of husband and wife that the present development of childless menages is bringing about . The practical and sustaining reason for monogamy is the stability it gives to the family ; the value of a stable family lies in the orderly up-bringing in an atmosphere of affection that it secures in most cases for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indisputably been the civilizing unit of the pre-mechanical civilized state . It must be remembered that both for husband and wife in most cases monogamic life marriage involves an element of sacrifice ; it is an institution of late appearance in the history of mankind , and it does not completely fit the psychology or physiology of any but very exceptional characters in either sex . For the man it commonly involves considerable restraint ; he must ride his imagination on the curb , or exceed the code in an extremely dishonoring , furtive , and unsatisfactory manner while publicly professing an impossible virtue ; for the woman it // commonly implies many uncongenial submissions . There are probably few married couples who have escaped distressful phases of bitterness and tears , within the constrain of their , in most cases , practically insoluble bond . But , on the other hand , and as a reward that in the soberer , mainly agricultural civilization of the past , and among the middling class of people , at any rate , has sufficed , there comes the great development of associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established home , and particularly out of the linking love and interest of children 's lives . But how does this fit into the childless , disunited , and probably shifting menage of our second picture ? It must be borne in mind that it has been the middling and lower mass of people , the tenants and agriculturists , the shop-keepers , and so forth , men needing before all things the absolutely loyal help of wives , that has sustained permanent monogamic marriage whenever it has been sustained . Public monogamy has existed on its merits ? that is , on the merits of the wife . Merely ostensible reasons have never sufficed . No sort of religious conviction , without a real practical utility , has ever availed to keep classes of men , unhampered by circumstances , to its restrictions . In all times , and holding all sorts of beliefs , the specimen humanity of courts and nobilities is to be found developing the most complex qualifications of the code . In some quiet corner of Elysium the bishops // of the early Georges , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patriarchs of vanished Byzantium , will find a common topic with the spiritual advisers of the kingdoms of the East in this difficult theme ? the 11 theme of the concessions permissible and expedient to earnest believers encumbered with leisure and a superfluity of power . . . . It is not necessary to discuss religious development , therefore , before deciding this issue . We are dealing now with things deeper and forces infinitely more powerful than the mere convictions of men . Will a generation , to whom marriage will be no longer necessarily associated with the birth and rearing of children , or with the immediate co-operation and sympathy of husband and wife in common proceedings , retain its present feeling for the extreme sanctity of the permanent bond ? Will the agreeable , unemployed , childless woman , with a high conception of her personal rights , who is spending her husband 's earnings or income in some pleasant discrepant manner , a type of woman there are excellent reasons for anticipating will become more frequent ? will she continue to share the honors and privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old dispensation ? And , in particular , will the great gulf that is now fixed by custom between her and the agreeable unmarried lady who is similarly employed remain so inexorably wide ? Charity is in the air , and why should not // charming people meet one another ? And where is either of these ladies to find the support that will enable her to insist upon the monopoly that conventional sentiment , so far as it finds expression , concedes her ? The danger to them both of the theory of equal liberty is evident enough . On the other hand , in the case of the unmarried mother who may be helped to hold her own , or who may be holding her own in the world , where will the moral censor of the year 1950 find this congenial following to gather stones ? Much as we may regret it , it does very greatly affect the realities of this matter that with the increased migration of people from home to home amid the large urban regions that , we have concluded , will certainly obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social inconveniences do still attach to certain sorts of status , it will probably be increasingly difficult to determine the status of people who wish to conceal it for any but criminal ends . In another direction there must be a movement towards the relaxation of the marriage law and of divorce that will complicate status very confusingly . In the past it has been possible to sustain several contrasting moral systems in each of the practically autonomous states of the world , but with a development and cheapening of travel and migration that is as yet only in its opening phase , an increasing conflict between dissimilar moral restrictions must appear . Even at present , with only // the most prosperous classes of the American and Western European countries migrating at all freely , there is a growing amount of inconvenience arising out of these ? from the point of view of social physiology ? quite arbitrary differences . A man or woman may , for example , have been the injured party in some conjugal complication , may have established a domicile and divorced the erring spouse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with absolute local propriety , and may be a bigamist and a criminal in England . A child may be a legal child in Denmark or Australia , and a bastard in this austerer climate . These things are , however , only the first intimations of much more profound reactions . Almost all the great European powers , and the United States also , are extending their boundaries to include great masses of non-Christian polygamous peoples , and they are permeating these peoples with railways , printed matter , and all the stimulants of our present state . With the spread of these conveniences there is no corresponding spread of Christianity . These people will not always remain in the ring fence of their present regions ; their superseded princes , and rulers , and public masters , and managers , will presently come to swell the shareholding mass of the appropriating empire . Europeans , on the other hand , will drift into these districts , and , under the influence of their customs , intermarriages and inter - racial reaction will in- // crease ; in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local concessions , of localized recognition of the " custom of the country , " can not permanently avail . Statesmen will have to face the alternative of either widening the permissible variations of the marriage contract , or of acute racial and religious stresses , of a vast variety of possible legal betrayals , and the appearance of a body of self-respecting people , outside the law and public respect , a body that will confer a touch of credit upon , because it will share the stigma of , the deliberately dissolute and criminal . And whether the moral law shrivels relatively by mere exclusiveness ? as in religious matters the Church of England , for example , has shrivelled to the proportions of a mere sectarian practice ? or whether it broadens itself to sustain justice in a variety of sexual contracts , the net result , so far as our present purpose goes , will be the same . All these forces , making for moral relaxation in the coming time , will probably be greatly enhanced by the line of development certain sections of the irresponsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the share-holding rich man of the new time is in a position of freedom almost unparalleled in the history of men . He has sold his permission to control and experiment with the material wealth of the community for freedom ? for freedom from care , labor , responsibility , custom , local usage , and local attachment . He may // come back again into public affairs if he likes ? that is his private concern . Within the limits of the law and his capacity and courage , he may do as the imagination of his heart directs . Now such an experimental and imperfect creature as man , a creature urged by such imperious passions , so weak in imagination and controlled by so feeble a reason , receives such absolute freedom as this only at infinite peril . To a great number of these people , in the second or third generation , this freedom will mean vice , the subversion of passion to inconsequent pleasures . We have on record , in the personal history of the Roman emperors , how freedom and uncontrolled power took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one blood nor of one bias , but reinforced by the arbitrary caprice of adoption and political revolution . We have in the history of the Russian empresses a glimpse of similar feminine possibilities . We are moving towards a time when , through this confusion of moral standards I have foretold , the pressure of public opinion in these matters must be greatly relaxed , when religion will no longer speak with an unanimous voice , and when freedom of escape from disapproving neighbors will be greatly facilitated . In the past , when depravity had a centre about a court , the contagion of its example was limited to the court region , but every idle rich man of this great , various , and widely diffused class will play to a certain extent the moral // role of a court . In these days of universal reading and vivid journalism , every novel infraction of the code will be known of , thought about , and more or less thoroughly discussed by an enormous and increasing proportion of the common people . In the past it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret towards the lapses of the great , and even to co - operate in these lapses with a sympathetic privacy while maintaining a wholesome rigor towards vulgar vice . But in the coming time there will be no great but many rich ; the middling sort of people will probably be better educated as a whole than the rich , and the days of their differential treatment are at an end . It is foolish , in view of all these things , not to anticipate and prepare for a state of things when not only will moral standards be shifting and uncertain , admitting of physiologically sound menages of very variable status , but also when vice and depravity , in every form that is not absolutely penal , will be practised in every grade of magnificence and condoned . This means that not only will status cease to be simple and become complex and varied , but that outside the system of menages now recognized and under the disguise of which all other menages shelter , there will be a vast drifting and unstable population grouped in almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England was a world of homes ; // ANTICIPATIONS the world of the coming time will still have its homes , its real mothers , the custodians of the human succession , and its cared - for children , the inheritors of the future ; but , in addition to this home world , frothing tumultuously over and amid these stable rocks , there will be an enormous complex of establishments , and hotels , and sterile households , and fiats , and all the elaborate furnishing and appliances of a luxurious extinction . And since in the present social chaos there does not yet exist any considerable body of citizens ? comparable to the agricultural and commercial middle class of England during the period of limited monarchy ? that will be practically unanimous in upholding any body of rules or moral restraint , since there will probably not appear for some generations any body propounding with wide-reaching authority a new definitely different code to replace the one that is now likely to be increasingly disregarded , it follows that the present code , with a few interlined qualifications and grudging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice while being practically disregarded , glossed , or replaced in numberless directions . It must be pointed out that , in effect , what is here forecast for questions of menage and moral restraints has already happened to a very large extent in religious matters . There was a time when it was held ? and I think rightly ? that a man 's religious beliefs , and particularly // his method of expressing them , was a part not of his individual but of his social life . But the great upheavals of the Reformation resulted finally in a compromise , a sort of truce , that has put religious belief very largely out of intercourse and discussion . It is conceded that within the bounds of the general peace and security a man may believe and express his belief in matters of religion as he pleases , not because it is better so , but because for the present epoch there is no way nor hope of attaining unanimous truth . There is a decided tendency that will , I believe , prevail towards the same compromise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid all discussion of creeds in general social intercourse ; and a similar convention to avoid the point of status in relation to marriage , one may very reasonably anticipate , will be similarly recognized . But this impending dissolution of a common standard of morals does not mean universal depravity until some great reconstruction obtains , any more than the obsolescence of the Conventicle Act means universal irreligion . It means that for one morality there will be many moralities . Each human being will , in the face of circumstances , work out his or her particular early training as his or her character determines . And although there will be a general convention upon which the most diverse people will meet , it will only be with persons who have come to identical or similar con- // clusions in the matter of moral conduct and who are living in similar menages , just as now it is only with people whose conversation implies a certain community or kinship of religious belief that really frequent and intimate intercourse will go on . In other words , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such a process is probably already in operation , amid the deliquescent social mass . People will be drawn together into little groups of similar menages having much in common . And this ? in view of the considerations advanced in the first two chapters ? considerations all converging on the practical abolition of distances and the general freedom of people to live anywhere they like over large areas , will mean very frequently an actual local segregation . There will be districts that will be clearly recognized and marked as " nice , " fast regions , areas of ramshackle bohemianism , regions of earnest and active work , old - fashioned corners and hill - tops . Whole regions will be set aside for the purposes of opulent enjoyment ? a thing already happening , indeed , at points along the Riviera to-day . Already the superficial possibilities of such a segregation have been glanced at . It has been pointed out that the enormous urban region of the future may pre- i48 CERTAIN SOCIAL REACTIONS sent an extraordinary variety of districts , suburbs , and subordinate centres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very definite enforcement of that probability . In that previous chapter I spoke of boating centres , and horsy suburbs , and picturesque hilly districts , and living places by the sea , of promenade centres and theatrical districts ; I hinted at various fashions in architecture , and such like things , but these exterior appearances will be but the outward and visible sign of inward and more spiritual distinctions . The people who live in the good hunting country and about that glittering grand-stand will no longer be even pretending to live under the same code as those picturesque musical people who have concentrated on the canoe-dotted river . Where the promenaders gather , and the bands are playing , and the pretty little theatres compete , the pleasure-seeker will be seeking such pleasure as he pleases , no longer debased by furtiveness and innuendo , going his primrose path to a congenial , picturesque , happy , and highly desirable extinction . Just over the hills , perhaps , a handful of opulent share-holders will be pleasantly preserving the old traditions of a landed aristocracy , with servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what from the point of view of social physiology will really be an arrested contingent of the abyss , but all nicely washed and done good to , will pursue home industries in model cottages ; // in a quite old English and exemplary manner . Here the windmills will spin and the water-falls be trapped to gather force , and the quiet-eyed master of the machinery will have his office , and perhaps his private home . Here about the great college and its big laboratories there will be men and women reasoning and studying ; and here , where the homes thicken among the ripe gardens , one will hear the laughter of playing children , the singing of children in their schools , and see their little figures going to and fro amid the trees and flowers . And these segregations , based primarily on a difference in moral ideas and pursuits and ideals , will probably round off and complete themselves at last as distinct and separate cultures . As the moral ideas realize themselves in menage and habits , so the ideals will seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting together will pass over into a phase of more or less conscious and intentional organization . The segregating groups will develop fashions of costume , types of manners and bearing , and even , perhaps , be characterized by a certain type of facial expression . And this gives us a glimpse , an aspect of the immediate future of literature . The kingdoms of the past were little things , and above the mass of peasants who lived and obeyed and died there was just one little culture to which all must needs conform . Literature was universal within the limits of its // language . Where differences of view arose there were violent controversies , polemics , and persecutions , until one or other rendering had won its ascendency . But this new world into which we are passing will , for several generations at least , albeit it will be freely inter - communicating and like a whispering gallery for things outspoken , possess no universal ideals , no universal conventions ; there will be the literature of the thought and effort of this sort of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that. * Life is already most wonderfully arbitrary and experimental , and for the coming century this must be its essential social history , a great drifting and unrest of people , a shifting and regrouping and breaking-up again of groups , great multitudes seeking to find themselves . The safe life in the old order , where one did this because it was right , and that because it was the custom , when one shunned this and hated that , as // lead runs into a mould , all that is passing away . And presently , as the new century opens out , there will become more and more distinctly emergent many new cultures and settled ways . The gray expanse of life to-day is gray , not in its essence , but because of the minute , confused mingling and mutual cancelling of many colored lives . Presently these tints and shades will gather together here as a mass of one color , and there as a mass of another . And as these colors intensify and the tradition of the former order fades , as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new literatures grow in substance and power , as differences develop from speculative matter of opinion to definite intentions , as contrasts and affinities grow sharper and clearer , there must follow some very extensive modifications in the collective public life . But one series of tints , one color , must needs have a heightening value amid // this iridescent display . While the forces at work in the wealthy and purely speculative groups of society make for disintegration , and in many cases for positive elimination , the forces that bring together the really functional people will tend more and more to impose upon them certain common characteristics and beliefs , and the discovery of a group of similar and compatible class interests upon which they can unite . The practical people , the engineering and medical and scientific people , will become more and more homogeneous in their fundamental culture , more and more distinctly aware of a common " general reason " in things , and of a common difference from the less functional masses and from any sort of people in the past . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding the real pride of life , the real reason for the incidental nastiness of vice , and so they will be a sanely reproductive class , and , above all , an educating class . Just how much they will have kept or changed of the deliquescent morality of to-day , when in a hundred years or so they do distinctively and powerfully emerge , I can not speculate now . They will certainly be a moral people . They will have developed the literature of their needs , they will have discussed and tested and thrashed out many things ; they will be clear where we are confused , resolved where we are undecided and weak . In the districts of industrial possibility , in the healthier quarters // of the town regions , away from the swamps and away from the glare of the midnight lights , these people will be gathered together . They will be linked in professions through the agencies of great and sober papers . In England the Lancet , the British Medical journal , and the already great periodicals of the engineering trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what these papers may be . The best of the wealthy will gravitate to their attracting centres . . . . Unless some great catastrophe in nature break down all that man has built , these great kindred groups of capable men and educated , adequate women must be , under the operation of the forces we have considered so far , the element finally emergent amid the vast confusions of the coming time . THE LIFE-HISTORY OF DEMOCRACY IN the preceding four chapters there has been developed , in a clumsy , laborious way , a smudgy , imperfect picture of the generalized civilized state of the coming century . In terms vague enough at times , but never absolutely indefinite , the general distribution of the population in this state has been discussed , and its natural development into four great ? but in practice intimately interfused ? classes . It has been shown ? I know not how convincingly ? that as the result of forces that are practically irresistible , a world-wide process of social and moral deliquescence is in progress , and that a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained and having common ideals and interests , is likely to segregate and disentangle itself from our present confusion of aimless and ill-directed lives . It has been pointed out that life is presenting an unprecedented and increasing variety of morals , menages , occupations , and types , at present so // mingled as to give a general effect of grayness ? but containing the promise of local concentration that may presently change that grayness into kaleidoscopic effects . That image of concentrating , contrasted colors will be greatly repeated in this present chapter . In the course of these inquiries , we have permitted ourselves to take a few concrete glimpses of households , costumes , conveyances , and conveniences of the coming time , but only as incidental realizations of points in this general thesis . And now , assuming , as we must necessarily do , the soundness of these earlier speculations , we have arrived at a stage when we may consider how the existing arrangements for the ostensible government of the state are likely to develop through their own inherent forces , and how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast . So far , this has been a speculation upon the probable development of a civilized society in vacuo . Attention has been almost exclusively given to the forces of development , and not to the forces of conflict and restraint . We have ignored the boundaries of language that are flung athwart the great lines of modern communication ; we have disregarded the friction of tariffs , the peculiar groups of prejudices and irrational instincts that inspire one miscellany of share-holders , workers , financiers , and superfluous poor such as the English , to hate , exasperate , lie about , and injure another // such miscellany as the French or the Germans . Moreover , we have taken very little account of the fact that , quite apart from nationality , each individual case of the new social order is developing within the form of a legal government based on conceptions of a society that has been superseded by the advent of mechanism . It is this last matter that we are about to take into consideration . Now this age is being constantly described as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have affected art , literature , trade , and religion alike in the most remarkable ways . It is not only tacitly present in the great bulk of contemporary thought that this " democracy " is now dominant , but that it is becoming more and more overwhelmingly predominant as the years pass . Allusions to democracy are so abundant , deductions from its influence so confident and universal , that it is worth while to point out what a very hollow thing the word in most cases really is ? a large , empty object in thought , of the most vague and faded associations and the most attenuated content , and to inquire just exactly what the original implications and present realities of " democracy " may be . The inquiry will leave us with a very different conception of the nature and future of this sort of political arrangement from that generally assumed . We have already seen , in the discussion of the growth of great cities , that an analytical process may ab- ' 59 ANTICIPATIONS solutely invert the expectation based on the gross results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally possible to show cause for believing that the development of democracy also is , after all , not the opening phase of a world-wide movement going on unbendingly in its present direction , but the first impulse of forces that will finally sweep round into a quite different path . Flying off at a tangent is probably one of the gravest dangers , and certainly the one most constantly present , in this enterprise of prophecy . One may , I suppose , take the Rights of Man as they are embodied in the French declaration as the ostentatious of democracy ; our present democratic state may be regarded as a practical realization of these claims . As far as the individual goes , the realization takes the form of an untrammelled liberty in matters that have heretofore been considered a part of social procedure , in the lifting of positive religious and moral compulsions , in the recognition of absolute property , and in the abolition of special privileges and special restrictions . Politically , modern democracy takes the form of denying that any specific person or persons shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of the community as a whole . Its root-idea is representation . Government is based primarily on election , and every ruler is , in theory at least , a delegate and servant of the popular will . It is implicit in the democratic theory that there is such a thing as a pop-16o THE LIFE-HISTORY OF DEMOCRACY ular will , and this is supposed to be the net sum of the wills of all the citizens in the state , so far as public affairs are concerned . In its less perfect and more usual state the democratic theory is advanced either as an ethical theory which postulates an absence of formal acquiescence on the part of the governed as injustice , or else as a convenient political compromise , the least objectionable of all possible methods of public control , because it will permit only the minimum of general unhappiness .... I know of no case for the elective democratic government of modern states that can not be knocked to pieces in five minutes . It is manifest that upon countless important public issues there is no collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man except blank indifference ; that an electional system simply places power in the hands of the most skilful electioneers ; that neither men nor their rights are identically equal , but vary with every individual , and , above all , that the minimum or maximum of general happiness is related only so indirectly to the public control that people will suffer great miseries from their governments unresistingly , and , on the other hand , change their rulers on account of the most trivial irritations . The case against all the prolusions of ostensible democracy is , indeed , so strong that it is impossible to consider the present wide establishment of democratic institutions as being the outcome of // ANTICIPATIONS any process of intellectual conviction ; it arouses suspicion even whether ostensible democracy may not be a mere rhetorical garment for essentially different facts , and upon that suspicion we will now inquire . Democracy of the modern type ? manhood suffrage , and so forth ? became a conspicuous phenomenon in the world only in the closing decades of the eighteenth century . Its genesis is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state , through mechanism and a co-operative organization , as to point at once to a causative connection . The more closely one looks into the social and political life of the eighteenth century , the more plausible becomes this view . New and potentially influential social factors had begun to appear ? the organizing manufacturer , the intelligent worker , the skilled tenant , and the urban abyss , and the traditions of the old land-owning , non-progressive , aristocratic monarchy that prevailed in Christendom rendered it incapable ? without some destructive shock or convulsion ? of any reorganization to incorporate or control these new factors . In the case of the British empire an additional stress was created by the incapacity of the formal government to assimilate the developing civilization of the American colonies . Everywhere there were new elements , not as yet clearly analyzed or defined , arising as mechanism arose ; everywhere the old traditional government // and social system , defined and analyzed all too well , appeared increasingly obstructive , irrational , and feeble in its attempts to include and direct these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am inclined to attach very great importance . The new powers were as yet shapeless . It was not the conflict of a new organization with the old . It was the preliminary dwarfing and deliquescence of the mature old beside the embryonic mass of the new . It was impossible then ? it is , I believe , only beginning to be possible now ? to estimate the proportions , possibilities , and inter-relations of the new social orders out of which a social organization has still to be built in the coming years . No formula of definite reconstruction had been evolved , or has even been evolved yet , after a hundred years . And these swelling , inchoate new powers , whose very birth-condition was the crippling , modification , or destruction of the old order , were almost forced to formulate their proceedings for a time , therefore , in general affirmative propositions that were really in effect not affirmative propositions at all , but propositions of repudiation and denial . " These kings and nobles and people privileged in relation to obsolescent functions can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was the really essential question at that time , and since no other effectual substitute appeared ready made , the working doctrine of the infallible judgment of humanity in the gross , as // distinguished from the quite indisputable incapacity of sample individuals , became , in spite of its inherent absurdity , a convenient and acceptable working hypothesis . Modern democracy thus came into being , not , as eloquent persons have pretended , by the sovereign people consciously and definitely assuming power ? I imagine the sovereign people in France during the first revolution , for example , quite amazed and muddle-headed with it all ? but by the decline of old ruling classes in the face of the quasi-natural growth of mechanism and industrialism , and by the unpreparedness and want of organization in the new intelligent elements in the state . I have compared the human beings in society to a great and increasing variety of colors tumultuously smashed up together , and giving at present a general and quite illusory effect of gray , and I have attempted to show that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segregation of these mingled tints into recognizable , distinct masses again . It is not a monotony , but an utterly disorderly and confusing variety that makes this gray ; but democracy , for practical purposes , does really assume such a monotony . Like 00 , the democratic formula is a concretelooking and negotiable symbol for a negation . It is the aspect in political disputes and contrivances of that social and moral deliquescence the nature and possibilities of which have been // discussed in the preceding papers of this series . Modern democracy first asserted itself in the ancient kingdoms of France and Great Britain ( counting the former British colonies in America as a part of the latter ) , and it is in the French and English-speaking communities that democracy has developed itself most completely . Upon the supposition we have made , democracy broke out first in these states because they were leading the way in material progress , because they were the first states to develop industrialism , wholesale mechanisms , and great masses of insubordinate activity outside the recognized political scheme , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the nature of the superseded government , and the amount of stress between it and the new elements . But the detachment of a great section of the new middle-class from the aristocratic order of England to form the United States of America , and the sudden rejuvenescence of France by the swift and thorough sloughing of its outworn aristocratic monarchy , the consequent wars , and the Napoleonic adventure , checked and modified the parallel development that might otherwise have happened in country after country over all Europe west of the Carpathians . The monarchies that would probably have collapsed through internal forces and given place to modern democratic states were smashed // from the outside , and a process of political reconstruction , that has probably missed out the complete formal democratic phase altogether ? and which has been enormously complicated through religious , national , and dynastic traditions ? set in . Throughout America , in England , and , after extraordinary experiments , in France , political democracy has , in effect , legally established itself ? most completely in the United States ? and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the other countries in intellectual contact with it have been so considerable as practically to make their monarchies as new in their kind , almost , as democratic republics . In Germany , Austria , and Italy , for example , there is a press nearly as audible as in the more frankly democratic countries , and measurably akin in influence ; there are constitutionally established legislative assemblies , and there is the same unofficial development of powerful financial and industrial powers with which the ostensible government must make terms . In a vast amount of the public discussion of these states , the postulates of democracy are clearly implicit . Quite as much in reality as the democratic republics of America , are they based not on classes , but upon a confusion ; they are , in their various degrees and with their various individual differences , just as truly governments of the gray . It has been argued that the gray is illusory , and 166 must sooner or later pass , and that the color that will emerge to predominance will take its shape as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the older middleclasses , but replacing them . This class will become , I believe , at last consciously the state , controlling and restricting very greatly the three non-functional masses with which it is as yet almost indistinguishably mingled . The general nature of its formation within the existing confusion and its emergence may , I think , with a certain degree of confidence , be already forecast , albeit at present its beginnings are singularly unpromising and faint . At present the class of specially trained and capable people ? doctors , engineers , scientific men of all sorts ? is quite disproportionally absent from political life ; it does not exist as a factor in that life ; it is growing up outside that life , and has still to develop , much more to display , a collective intention to come specifically in . But the forces are in active operation to drag it into the centre of the stage for all that . The modern democracy , or democratic quasimonarchy , conducts its affairs as though there was no such thing as special knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who has taken the pains to know , and specifically to do , is occasionally to consult him upon specific points and override his counsels in its ampler wisdom , or to intrust to him some otherwise // impossible duty under circumstances of extreme limitation . The man of special equipment is treated always as if he were some sort of curious performing animal . The gunnery specialist , for example , may move and let off guns , but he may not say where they are to be let off ? some one a little ignorant of range and trajectory does that ; the engineer may move the ship and fire the battery , but only with some man , who does not perfectly understand , shouting instructions down a tube at him . If the cycle is to be adapted to military requirements , the thing is intrusted to LieutenantColonel Balfour . If horses are to be bought for the British army in India , no specialist goes , but Lord Edward Cecil . These people of the governing class do not understand there is such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ; they have been educated at schools conducted by amateur school-masters , whose real aim in life ? if such people can be described as having a real aim in life ? is the episcopal bench , and they have learned little or nothing but the extraordinary power of appearances in these democratic times . To look right and to be of good report is to succeed ? what else is there ? The primarily functional men are ignored in the ostensible political scheme ; it operates as though they did not exist , as though nothing , in fact , existed but the irresponsible wealthy , and the manipulators of irresponsible wealth , on the one hand , and a great , gray , politi- // cally indifferent community on the other . Having regard only to the present condition of political life , it would seem as though this state of affairs must continue indefinitely , and develop only in accordance with the laws of inter-action between our charlatan governing class on the one hand and the gray mass of governed on the other . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class of really educated persons that the continually more complicated mechanical fabric of social life is developing may be expected to come in . And in a very great amount of current political speculation the development and final emergence of this class is ignored , and attention is concentrated entirely upon the inherent process of development of the political machine . And even in that it is very easy to exaggerate the preponderance of one or other of what are really very evenly balanced forces in the machine of democratic government . There are two chief sets of parts in the machine that have a certain antagonistic relation , that play against each other , and one 's conception of coming developments is necessarily determined by the relative value one gives to these opposing elements . One may compare these two groups to the power and the work , respectively , at the two ends of a lever. * On the one hand there is // that which pays for the machine , which distributes salaries and rewards , subsidizes newspapers , and so forth ? the central influence. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , with certain prejudices and traditions , and certain laws and limitations of thought upon which the newspapers work , and which , within the confines of its inherent laws , they direct . If one dwell chiefly on the possibilities of the former element , one may conjure up a practical end to democracy in the vision of a state " run " entirely by a group of highly forcible and intellectual persons ? usually the dream takes the shape of financiers and their associates , their perfected mechanism of party control working the elections boldly and capably , and their public policy being directed towards financial ends . One of the common prophecies of the future of the United States is such a domination by a group of trust organizers and political bosses . But a man , or a group of men , so strong and intelligent as would be needed to hold an entire party machine within the confines of his THE LIFE-HISTORY OF DEMOCRACY or their collective ? mind and will , could , at the most , be but a very transitory and incidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exploitation of the central control will have to be covert and subtle beyond any precedent in human disingenuousness , or else its domination will have to be very amply modified , indeed , by the requirements of the second factor , and its proceedings made very largely the resultant of that second factor 's forces . Moreover , very subtle men do not aim at things of this sort , or aiming , fail , because subtlety of intelligence involves subtlety of character , a certain fastidiousness , and a certain weakness . Now that the garrulous period , when a flow of language and a certain effectiveness of mariner was a necessary condition to political pre-eminence , is passing away , political control falls more and more entirely into the hands of a barristerish , intriguing sort of person with a tough - wearing , leathery , practical mind . The sort of people who will work the machine are people with " faith , " as the popular preachers say ? meaning , in fact , people who do not analyze , people who will take the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ? saving their vanity ? work it as it wants to go . The man who will be boss will be the man who wants to be boss , who finds in being boss a complete and final satisfaction , and not the man who complicates things by wanting to be boss in order to be , or do , // something else . The machines are governed today , and there is every reason to believe that they will continue to be governed , by masterful-looking resultants , masters of nothing but compromise , and that little fancy of an inner conspiracy of control within the machine and behind ostensible politics is really on all fours with the wonderful Rodin ( of the , uif Errant ) , and as probable as anything else in the romances of Eugene Sue . If , on the other hand , we direct attention to the antagonistic element in the machine , to public opinion , to the alleged collective mind of the gray mass , and consider how it is brought to believe in itself and its possession of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons saying as much , we may also very readily conjure up a contrasted vision of extraordinary demagogues or newspaper syndicates working the political machine from that direction . So far as the demagogue goes , the increase of population , the multiplication of amusements and interests , the differentiation of social habits , the diffusion of great towns , all militate against that sufficient gathering of masses of voters in meeting - houses which gave him his power in the recent past . It is improbable that ever again will any flushed , undignified man with a vast voice , a muscular face in incessant operation , collar crumpled , hair disordered , and arms in wild activity , talking , talking , talking , talking copiously // out of the windows of railway carriages , talking on railway platforms , talking from hotel balconies , talking on tubs , barrels , scaffoldings , pulpits ? tireless and undammable ? rise to be the most powerful thing in any democratic state in the world . Continually the individual vocal demagogue dwindles , and the element of bands and buttons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the machine , grows . Mr. Harmsworth , of the London Daily Mail , in a very interesting article has glanced at certain possibilities of power that may vest in the owners of a great system of world-wide " simultaneous " newspapers , but he does not analyze the nature of the influence exercised by newspapers during the successive phases of the nineteenth century , nor the probable modifications of that influence in the years to come , and I think , on the whole , he inclines very naturally to over-estimate the amount of intentional direction that may be given by the owner of a paper to the minds and acts of his readers , and to exceed the very definite limits within which that influence is confined . In the earlier Victorian period , the more limited , partly educated , and still very homogeneous enfranchised class had a certain habit of thinking ; its tranquil assurance upon most theological and all moral and aesthetic points left political questions as the chief field of exercise for such thinking as it did , and , as a consequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss , and indeed were required to discuss , not only specific situations , but general principles . That , indeed , was their principal function , and it fell rather to the eloquent men to misapply these principles according to the necessity of the occasion . The papers did then very much more than they do now to mould opinion , though they did not direct affairs to anything like the extent of their modern successors . They made roads upon which events presently travelled in unexpected fashions . But the often cheaper and always more vivid newspapers that have come with the new democracy do nothing to mould opinion . Indeed , there is no longer upon most public questions ? and as I have tried to make clear in my previous paper , there is not likely to be any longer ? a collective opinion to be moulded . Protectionists , for example , are a mere band ; free-traders are a mere band ; on all these details we are in chaos . And these modern newspapers simply endeavor to sustain a large circulation , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , by firing where the crowd seems thickest , by seeking perpetually , and without any attempt at consistency , the greatest excitement of the greatest number . It is upon the cultivation and rapid succession of inflammatory topics that the modern newspaper expends its capital and trusts to recover its reward . Its general news sinks steadily to a THE LIFE-HISTORY OF DEMOCRACY subordinate position ; criticism , discussion , and high responsibility pass out of journalism , and the power of the press comes more and more to be a dramatic and emotional power , the power to cry " Fire ! " in the theatre , the power to give enormous value for a limited time to some personality , some event , some aspect , true or false , without any power of giving a specific direction to the forces this distortion may set going . Directly the press of to-day passes from that sort of thing to some specific proposal , some implication of principles and beliefs , directly it chooses and selects , then it passes from the miscellaneous to the sectarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general mind . It gives offence here , it perplexes and bores there ; no more than the boss politician , can the paper of great circulation afford to work consistently for any ulterior aim . This is the limit of the power of the modern newspaper of large circulation , the newspaper that appeals to the gray element , to the average democratic man , the newspaper of the deliquescence , and if our previous conclusion , that human society has ceased to be homogeneous and will presently display new masses segregating from a great confusion , holds good , that will be the limit of its power in the future . It may undergo many remarkable developments and modifications , * but // none of these tend to give it any greater political importance than it has now . And so , after all , our considerations of the probable developments // of the party machine give us only negative results so long as the gray social confusion continues . Subject to that continuance the party ma- ANTICIPATIONS chine will probably continue as it is at present , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run at the present time . of all sorts of things , representations of newly produced works of art , and an ample amount of ably written controversy upon everything under the sus . The correspondence columns , instead of being an exercising place for bores and conspicuous people who are not mercenary , will be the most ample , the most carefully collected , and the most highly paid of all departments in this paper . Personal paragraphs will be relegated to some obscure and costly corner next to the births , deaths , and marriages . This paper will have , of course , many pages of business advertisements , and these will usually be well worth looking through , for the more intelligent editors of the days to come will edit this department just like any other , and classify their advertisements in a descending scale of freshness and interest that will also be an ascending scale of price . The advertiser who wants to be an indecent bore , and vociferate for the tenmillionth time some flatulent falsehood , about a pill , for instance , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to print nasty and distressful advertisements about people 's insides at all . The entire paper will be as free from either grayness or offensive stupidity in its advertisement columns as the shop windows in Bond Street to-day , and for much the same reason ? because the people who go that way do not want that sort of thing . It has been supposed that , since the real income of the newspaper is derived from advertisements , large advertisers will combine in the future to own papers confined to the advertisements of their specific wares . Some such monopoly is already attempted ; several publishing firms own , or partially own , a number of provincial papers , which they adorn with strange " Book Chat " columns conspicuously deficient in their information ; and a well-known cycle-tire firm supplies " Cycling " columns that are mere pedestals for the Head-of-King-Charles make of tire . Many quack firms publish and give away annual almanacs replete with economical illustrations , offensive details , and bad jokes . But I venture to think , in spite of such phenomena , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the essential conditions of sound advertisement . Sound advertisement consists in perpetual alertness // Now , how will the emergent class of capable men presently begin to modify the existing form of government in the ostensibly democratic countries and democratic monarchies ? There will be very many variations and modifications of the methods of this arrival , an infinite complication of detailed incidents , but a general proposition will be found to hold good . The suppression of the party machine in the purely democratic countries and of the official choice of the rich and privileged rulers in the more monarchical ones , by capable operative and administrative men inspired by the belief in a and newness , in appearance in new places and in new aspects , in the constant access to fresh minds . The devotion of a newspaper to the interest of one particular make of a commodity or group of commodities will inevitably rob its advertisement department of most of its interest for the habitual readers of the paper . That is to say , the newspaper will fail in what is one of the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion will react upon all the other matter in the paper , because the editor will need to be constantly alert to exclude seditious reflections upon the **29;33;TOOLONG or Saved-by-Boiling Jam . His sense of this relation will taint his self-respect and make him a less capable editor than a man whose sole affair is to keep his paper interesting . To these more interesting rival papers the excluded competitor will be driven , and the reader will follow in his wake . There is little more wisdom in the proprietor of an article in popular demand buying or creating a newspaper to contain all his advertisements than in his buying a coal pit for the same purpose . Such a privacy of advertisement will never work , I think , on a large scale ; it is probably at or near its maximum development now , and this anticipation of the advertiser-owned paper , like that of hourly papers , and that wonderfully powerful cosmic newspaper syndicate , is simply another instance of prophesying based only on a present trend , an expansion of the obvious , instead of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , will come about ? peacefully and gradually as a process of change , or violently as a revolution ? but inevitably as the outcome either of the imminence or else of the disasters of war . That all these governments of confusion will drift towards war , with a spacious impulse and a final vehemence quite out of comparison greater than the warlike impulses of former times , is a remarkable but by no means inexplicable thing . A tone of public expression , jealous and patriotic to the danger-point , is an unavoidable condition under which democratic governments exist . To be patriotically quarrelsome is imperative upon the party machines that will come to dominate the democratic countries . They will not possess detailed and definite policies and creeds , because there are no longer any detailed and definite public opinions , but they will , for all that , require some ostensible purpose to explain their cohesion , some hold upon the common man that will insure his appearance in numbers at the polling - place sufficient to save the government from the raids of small but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort . Without moral or religious uniformity , with material interests as involved and confused as a heap of spelicans , there remains only one generality for the politician 's purpose , the ampler aspect of a man 's egotism , his pride in what he imagines to be his particular kind 18o THE LIFE-HISTORY OF DEMOCRACY his patriotism . In every country amenable to democratic influences there emerges , or will emerge , a party machine , vividly and simply patriotic ? and indefinite upon the score of any other possible consideration between man and man . This will hold true , not only of the ostensibly democratic states , but also of such reconstituted modern monarchies as Italy and Germany , for they , too , for all their legal difference , rest also on the gray . The party conflicts of the future will turn very largely on the discovery of the true patriot , on the suspicion that the crown or the machine in possession is in some more or less occult way traitorous , and almost all other matters of contention will be shelved and allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national mechanism . Now , patriotism is not a thing that flourishes in the void ? one needs a foreigner . A national and patriotic party is an anti-foreign party ; the altar of the modern god , democracy , will cry aloud for the stranger men . Simply to keep in power , and out of no love of mischief , the government or the party machine will have to insist upon dangers and national differences , to keep the voter to the poll by alarms , seeking ever to taint the possible nucleus of any competing organization with the scandal of external influence . The party press will play the watch-dog and allay all internal dissensions with its warning bay at some adjacent people , // and the adjacent peoples , for reasons to be presently expanded , will be continually more sensitive to such baying . Already one sees country yelping at country all over the modern world , not only in the matter of warlike issues , but with a note of quite furious commercial rivalry ? quiet furious , and indeed quite insane , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners , exporting everything and importing nothing , is obviously outside reason altogether . The inexorable doom of these governments based on the gray is to foster enmity between people and people . Even their alliances are but sacrifices to intenser antagonisms . And the phases of the democratic sequence are simple and sure . Forced on by a relentless competition , the tone of the outcries will become fiercer and fiercer ; the occasions of excitement , the perilous moments , the ingenuities of annoyance , more and more dramatic ? from the mere emptiness and disorder of the general mind ! Jealousies and anti-foreign enactments , tariff manipulations and commercial embitterment , destructive , foolish , exasperating obstructions that benefit no human being , will minister to this craving without completely allaying it . Nearer , and ever nearer , the politicians of the , coming times will force one another towards the verge , not because they want to go over it , not because any one wants to go over it , but because they are , by their very nature , compelled to go // that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break up and lose power . And , consequently , the final development of the democratic system , so far as intrinsic forces go , will be , not the rule of the boss , nor the rule of the trust , nor the rule of the newspaper ; no rule , indeed , but international rivalry , international competition , international exasperation and hostility , and at last ? irresistible and overwhelming ? the definite establishment of the rule of that most stern and educational of all masters ? War . At this point there opens a tempting path , and along it historical precedents , like a forest of noticeboards , urge us to go . At the end of the vista poses the figure of Napoleon , with " Caesarism " written beneath it . Disregarding certain alien considerations for a time , assuming the free working out of democracy to its conclusion , we perceive that , in the case of our generalized state , the party machine , together with the nation intrusted to it , must necessarily be forced into passionate national war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have an air of having accomplished its destiny . A party machine or a popular government is surely as likely a thing to cause a big disorder of war and as unlikely a thing to conduct it , as the wit of man , working solely to that end , could ever have devised . I have already pointed out why we can never expect an elected government of the modern sort to be guided by any far-I$3 ANTICIPATIONS reaching designs ; it is constructed to get office and keep office , not to do anything in office ; the conditions of its survival are to keep appearances up and taxes down , * and the care and management of army and navy is quite outside its possibilities . The military and naval professions in our typical modern state will subsist very largely upon tradition ; the ostensible government will interfere with rather than direct them , and there will be no force in the entire scheme to check the corrupting * One striking illustration of the distinctive possibilities of democratic government came to light during the last term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration of patriotism large sums of money were voted annually for the purpose of building warships , and the patriotic common man paid the taxes gladly with a dream of irresistible naval predominance to sweeten the payment . But the money was not spent on warships ; only a portion of it was spent , and the rest remained to make a surplus and warm the heart of the common man in his tax-paying capacity . This artful dodge was repeated for several years ; the artful dodger is now a peer , no doubt abjectly respected , and nobody in the most patriotic party so far evolved is a bit the worse for it . In the organizing expedients of all popular governments , as in the prospectuses of unsound companies , the disposition is to exaggerate the nominal capital at the expense of the working efficiency . Democratic armies and navies are always short , and probably will always be short , of ammunition , paint , training , and reserve stores ; battalions and ships , since they count as units , are overnumerous and go short-handed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device for multiplying units by fission , and counting men three times instead of twice in some ingenious and plausible way . And this must be so , because the sort of men who come inevitably to power under democratic conditions are men trained by all the conditions of their lives to so set appearances before realities as at last to become utterly incapable of realities . // influence of a long peace , to insist upon adequate exercises for the fighting organization or insure an adequate adaptation to the new and perpetually changing possibilities of untried apparatus . Incapable but confident and energetic persons having political influence will have been permitted to tamper with the various arms of the service ; the equipment will be largely devised to create an impression of efficiency in times of peace in the minds of the general voting public , and the really efficient soldiers will either have fretted themselves out of the army or have been driven out as political non - effectives , troublesome , innovating persons anxious to spend money upon " fads . " So armed , the new democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next great war will be the catastrophic breakdown of the formal armies , shame and disasters , and a disorder of conflict between more or less equally matched masses of stupefied , scared , and infuriated people . Just how far the thing may rise from the value of an alarming and edifying incident to a universal catastrophe depends upon the special nature of the conflict , but it does not alter the fact that any considerable war is bound to be a bitter , appalling , highly educational , and constitutionshaking experience for the modern democratic state . Now , foreseeing this possibility , it is easy to step into the trap of the Napoleonic precedent . One // hastens to foretell that either with the pressure of coming war , or in the hour of defeat , there will arise the man . He will be strong in action , epigrammatic in manner , personally handsome , and continually victorious . He will sweep aside parliaments and demagogues , carry the nation to glory , reconstruct it as an empire , and hold it together by circulating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather this from chance lights upon contemporary anticipations ? codify everything , rejuvenate the papacy , or , at any rate , galvanize Christianity , organize learning in meek , intriguing academies of little men , and prescribe a wonderful educational system . The grateful nations will once more deify a lucky and aggressive egotism . . . . And there the vision loses breath . Nothing of the sort is going to happen , or , at any rate , if it happens , it will happen as an interlude , as no necessary part in the general progress of the human drama . The world is no more to be recast by chance individuals than a city is to be lit by sky-rockets . The purpose of things emerges upon spacious issues , and the day of individual leaders is past . The analogies and precedents that lead one to forecast the coming of military one-mandominions , the coming of such other parodies of Caesar 's career as that misapplied , and speedily futile chess champion , Napoleon I. contrived , are false . They are false because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , the steady development of a new and quite unprecedented educated class as a necessary aspect of the expansion of science and mechanism ; and , secondly , the absolute revolution in the art of war that science and mechanism are bringing about . This latter consideration the next chapter will expand , but here , in the interests of this discussion , we may in general terms anticipate its gist . War in the past has been a thing entirely different in its nature from what war , with the apparatus of the future , will be ; it has been showy , dramatic , emotional , and restricted ; war in the future will be none of these things . War in the past was a thing of days and heroisms ; battles and campaigns rested in the hand of the great commander ; he stood out against the sky , picturesquely on horseback , visibly controlling it all War in the future will be a question of preparation , of long years of foresight and disciplined imagination ; there will be no decisive victory , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less on controlling personalities and driving emotions , and more and more upon the intelligence and personal quality of a great number of skilled men . All this the next chapter will expand . And either before or after , but , at any rate , in the shadow of war , it will become apparent , perhaps even suddenly , that the whole apparatus of power in the country is in the hands of a new class of intelligent and scientifically educated men . They // will probably , under the development of warlike stresses , be discovered ? they will discover themselves ? almost surprisingly with roads and railways , carts and cities , drains , food supply , electrical supply , and water supply , and with guns and such implements of destruction and intimidation as men scarcely dream of yet , gathered in their hands . And they will be discovered , too , with a growing common consciousness of themselves as distinguished from the gray confusion , a common purpose and implication that the fearless analysis of science is already bringing to light . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material apparatus of control entirely within their power . " Suppose , after all , " they will say , " we ignore these very eloquent and showy governing persons above , and this very confused and ineffectual multitude below . Suppose now we put on the brakes and try something a little more stable and orderly . These people in possession have , of course , all sorts of established rights and prescriptions ; they have squared the law to their purpose , and the constitution does not know us ; they can get at the judges , they can get at the newspapers , they can do all sorts of things except avoid a smash ? but , for our part , we have these really most ingenious and subtle guns . Suppose , instead of our turning them and our valuable selves in a fool 's quarrel against the ingenious and subtle guns of other // men akin to ourselves , we use them in the cause of the higher sanity , and clear that jabbering war tumult out of the streets .

It will be made quite evident then , what is now , indeed , only a pious opinion ? namely , that wealth is , after all , no ultimate power at all , but only an influence among aimless , police-guarded men . So long as there is peace the class of capable men may be mitigated and gagged and controlled , and the ostensible present order may flourish still in the hands of that other class of men which deals with the appearances of things . But as some supersaturated solution will crystallize out with the mere shaking of its beaker , so must the new order of men come into visibly organized existence through the concussions of war . The charlatans can escape everything except war , but to the cant and violence of nationality , to the sustaining force of international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is now their chief support must become at last their destruction . And so it is , I infer , that , whether violently as a revolution or quietly and slowly , this gray confusion that is democracy must pass away inevitably by // its own inherent conditions , as the twilight passes , as the embryonic confusion of the cocoon creature passes , into the higher stage , into the higher organism , the world-state of the coming years . WAR WAR IN shaping anticipations of the future of war there arises a certain difficulty about the point of departure . One may either begin upon such broad issues as the preceding forecasts have opened , and having determined now something of the nature of the coming state and the force of its warlike inclination , proceed to speculate how this vast , illorganized , four-fold organism will fight ; or one may set all that matter aside for a space , and having regard chiefly to the continually more potent appliances physical science offers the soldier , we may try to develop a general impression of theoretically thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state most likely to be superlatively efficient in such warfare , and so arrive at the conditions of survival under which these present governments of confusion will struggle one against the other . The latter course will be taken here . We will deal first of all with war conducted for its own sake , with a model army , as efficient as an imaginative training can make it , and with a model organization for warfare of the state behind it , and then // ANTICIPATIONS the experience of the confused modern social or-ganism . as it is impelled , in an uncongenial metamorphosis , towards this imperative and finally unavoidable efficient state , will come most easily within the scope of one 's imagination . The great change that is working itself out in warfare is the same change that is working itself out in the substance of the social fabric . The essential change in the social fabric , as we have analyzed it , is the progressive supersession of the old broad labor base by elaborately organized mechanism , and the obsolescence of the once valid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have already indicated , this takes the form of the progressive supersession of the horse and the private soldier ? which were the living and sole engines of the old time ? by machines , and the obliteration of the old distinction between leaders , who pranced in a conspicuously dangerous and encouraging way into the picturesque incidents of battle , and the led , who cheered and charged and filled the ditches and were slaughtered in a wholesale dramatic manner . The old war was a matter of long , dreary marches , great hardships of campaigning , but also of heroic conclusive moments . Long periods of campingsalmost always with an outbreak of pestilence ? of marchings and retreats , much crude business of feeding and forage , culminated at last , with an effect of infinite relief , in an hour or so of 194 WAR " battle . " The battle was always a very intimate , tumultuous affair ; the men were flung at one another in vast , excited masses , in living , fighting machines , as it were ; spears or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolong the climax , and the thing was over . The beaten force crumpled as a whole , and the victors as a whole pressed upon it . Cavalry with slashing sabres marked the crowning point of victory . In the later stages of the old warfare musketry volleys were added to the physical impact of the contending regiments , and at last cannon , as a quite accessory method of breaking these masses of men . So you " gave battle " to and defeated your enemy 's forces whereever encountered , and when you reached your objective in his capital the war was done . . . . The new war will probably have none of these features of the old system of fighting . The revolution that is in progress from the old war to a new war , different in its entire nature from the old , is marked primarily by the steady progress in range and efficiency of the rifle and of the field-gun ? and more particularly of the rifle . The rifle develops persistently from a clumsy implement , that any clown may learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate mechanism , easily put out of order and easily misused , but of the most extraordinary possibilities in the hands of men of courage , character , and high intelligence . Its precision at long range has made the business of its care , load- // ing , and aim subsidiary to the far more intricate matter of its use in relation to the contour of the ground within its reach . Even its elaboration as an instrument is probably still incomplete . One can conceive it provided in the future with crossthread telescopic sights , the focusing of which , corrected by some ingenious use of hygroscopic material , might even find the range , and so enable it to be used with assurance up to a mile or more . It will probably also take on some of the characters of the machine-gun . It will be used either for single shots or to quiver and send a spray of almost simultaneous bullets out of a magazine evenly and certainly over any small area the rifleman thinks advisable . It will probably be portable by one man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition , the demands of which may be met in other ways , why it should be the instrument of one sole man . It will , just as probably , be slung , with its ammunition and equipment , upon bicycle wheels , and be the common care of two or more associated soldiers . Equipped with such a weapon , a single couple of marksmen even , by reason of smokeless powder and carefully chosen cover , might make themselves practically invisible , and capable of surprising , stopping , and destroying a visible enemy in quite considerable numbers who blundered within a mile of them . And a series of such groups of marksmen so arranged as to cover the arrival of reliefs , provi-196 WAR sions , and fresh ammunition from the rear , might hold out against any visible attack for an indefinite period , unless the ground they occupied was searched very ably and subtly by some sort of gun having a range in excess of their rifle fire . If the ground they occupied were to be properly tunnelled and trenched , even that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but to attack them by an advance under cover either of the night or of darkness caused by smoke-shells , or by the burning of cover about their position . Even then they might be deadly with magazine fire at close quarters . Save for their liability to such attacks , a few hundreds of such men could hold positions of a quite vast extent , and a few thousand might hold a frontier . Assuredly a mere handful of such men could stop the most multitudinous attack or cover the most disorderly retreat in the world , and even when some ingenious , daring , and lucky night assault had at last ejected them from a position , dawn would simply restore to them the prospect of reconstituting in new positions their enormous advantage of defence . The only really effective and final defeat such an attenuated force of marksmen could sustain would be from the slow and circumspect advance upon it of a similar force of superior marksmen , creeping forward under cover of night or of smokeshells and fire , digging pits during the snatches of cessation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearer and getting a completer and completer mastery of the defender 's ground until the approach of the defender 's reliefs , food , and fresh ammunition ceased to be possible . Thereupon there would be nothing for it but either surrender or a bolt in the night to positions in the rear , a bolt that might be hotly followed if it were deferred too late . Probably between contiguous nations that have mastered the art of war , instead of the pouring clouds of cavalry of the old dispensation , * this * Even along such vast frontiers as the Russian and Austrian , for example , where M. Bloch anticipates war will be begun with an invasion of clouds of Russian cavalry and great cavalry battles , I am inclined to think this deadlock of essentially defensive marksmen may still be the more probable thing . Small bodies of cyclist riflemen would rush forward to meet the advancing clouds of cavalry , would drop into invisible ambushes , and announce their presence ? in unknown numbers ? with carefully aimed shots difficult to locate . A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprise at the most advantageous moment , and they would be able to make themselves very deadly against a comparatively powerful frontal attack . If at last the attack were driven home before supports came up to the defenders , they would still be able to cycle away , comparatively immune . To attempt even very wide flanking movements against such a snatched position would be simply to run risks of blundering upon similar ambushes . The clouds of cavalry would have to spread into thin lines at last and go forward with the rifle . Invading clouds of cyclists would be in no better case . A conflict of cyclists against cyclists over a country too spacious for unbroken lines would still , I think , leave the struggle essentially unchanged . The advance of small unsupported bodies would be the wildest and most unprofitable adventure ; every advance would have to be made behind a screen of scouts , and , given a practical equality in the numbers and manhood of the two forces , these screens would speedily become simply very attenuated lines . 198 WAR will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duel all along the frontier between groups of skilled marksmen , continually being relieved and refreshed from the rear . For a time quite possibly there will be no definite army here or there ; there will be no controllable battle ; there will be no great general in the field at all . But somewhere far in the rear the central organizer will sit at the telephonic centre of his vast front , and he will strengthen here and feed there , and watch , watch perpetually , the pressure , the incessant , remorseless pressure , that is seeking to wear down his countervailing thrust . Behind the thin firing line that is actually engaged , the country for many miles will be rapidly cleared and devoted to the business of war ; big machines will be at work making second , third , and fourth lines of trenches that ay be needed if presently the firing line is forced ? ck , spreading out transverse paths for the swift teral movement of the cyclists , who will be in rpetual alertness to relieve sudden local pressres , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketched , there will be a vast d rapid shifting to and fro of big and very long nge guns . These guns will probably be fought ith the help of balloons . The latter will hang above the firing line all along the front , incessantly ascending and withdrawn ; they will be continually determining the distribution of the antagonist 's forces , directing the fire of continually shift- // ing great guns upon the apparatus and supports in the rear of his fighting line , forecasting his night plans and seeking some tactical or strategic weakness in that sinewy line of battle . It will be evident that such warfare as this inevitable precision of gun and rifle forces upon humanity will become less and less dramatic as a whole , more and more as a whole a monstrous thrust and pressure of people against people . No dramatic little general spouting his troops into the proper hysterics for charging , no prancing merely brave officers , no reckless gallantry or invincible stubbornness of men will suffice . For the commander-in-chief on a picturesque horse sentimentally watching his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will have to be a loyal staff of men , working simply , earnestly , and subtly to keep the front tight ; and at the front every little isolated company of men will have to be a council of war , a little conspiracy under the able man its captain , as keen and individual as a football team , conspiring against the scarcely seen company of the foe over yonder . The battalion commander will be replaced in effect by the organizer of the balloons and guns by which his few hundreds of splendid individuals will be guided and reinforced . In the place of hundreds of thousands of more or less drunken and untrained young men marching into battle ? muddle-headed , sentimental , dangerous , and futile hobbledehoys 200 X14 WAR there will be thousands of sober men braced up to their highest possibilities , intensely doing their best ; in the place of charging battalions , shattering impacts of squadrons and wide harvest fields of death , there will be hundreds of little rifle battles fought up to the hilt , gallant dashes here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint gleam of nocturnal bayonets , brilliant guesses that will drop catastrophic shell and death over hills and forests suddenly into carelessly exposed masses of men . For eight miles on either side of the firing - lines ? whose fire will probably never altogether die away while the war lasts ? men will live and eat and sleep under the imminence of unanticipated death . . . . Such will be the opening phase of the war that is speedily to come . And behind the thin firing line on either side a vast multitude of people will be at work ; indeed , the whole mass of the efficients in the state will have to be at work , and most of them will be simply at the same work or similar work to that done in peace time ? only now as combatants upon the lines of communication . The organized staffs of the big road managements , now become a part of the military scheme , will be deporting women and children and feeble people and bringing up supplies and supports ; the doctors will be dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeding and treatment of the shifting masses of people and guarding the valuable man-20I ANTICIPATIONS hood of the fighting apparatus most sedulously from disease ; the engineers will be intrenching and bringing up a vast variety of complicated and ingenious apparatus designed to surprise and inconvenience the enemy in novel ways ; the dealers in food and clothing , the manufacturers of all sorts of necessary stuff , will be converted by the mere declaration of war into public servants ; a practical realization of socialistic conceptions will quite inevitably be forced upon the fighting state . The state that has not incorporated with its fighting organization all its able-bodied manhood and all its material substance , its roads , vehicles , engines , foundries , and all its resources of food and clothing ; the state which at the outbreak of war has to bargain with railway and shipping companies , replace experienced station-masters by inexperienced officers , and haggle against alien interests for every sort of supply , will be at an overwhelming disadvantage against a state which has emerged from the social confusion of the present time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between official and governed , and organized every element in its being . I imagine that in this ideal war , as compared WAR with the war of to-day , there will be a very considerable restriction of the rights of the non-combatant . A large part of existing international law involves a curious implication , a distinction between t lie belligerent government and its accredited agents in warfare and the general body of its subjects . There is a disposition to treat the belligerent government , in spite of the democratic status of many states , as not fully representing its people , to establish a sort of world-citizenship in the common mass outside the official and military class . Protection of the non-combatant and his property comes at last ? in theory , at least ? within a measurable distance of notice boards : " Combatants are requested to keep off the grass . " This disposition I ascribe to a recognition of that obsolescence and inadequacy of the formal organization of states which has already been discussed in t his book . It was a disposition that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century , and stronger now than , in the steady and irresistible course of strenuous and universal military preparation , it is likely to be in the future . In our imaginary twentieth-century state , organized primarily for war , this tendency to differentiate a non-combatant mass in the fighting state will certainly not be respected ; the state will be organized as a whole to fight as a whole ; it will have triumphantly asserted the universal duty of its citizens . The military force will be a much am- // pier organization than the " army " of to-day ; it will be not simply the fists , but the body and brain fl of the land . The whole apparatus , the whole staff engaged in internal communication , for example , may conceivably not be state property and a state service , but if it is not it will assuredly be as a whole organized as a volunteer force , that may instantly become a part of the machinery of defence or aggression at the outbreak of war. * The men may very conceivably not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this curious and transitory phase of restriction , but they will have their orders and their universal plan . As the bells ring and the recording telephones click into every house the news that war has come , there will be no running to and fro upon the public ways , no bawling upon the moving platforms of the central urban nuclei , no crowds of silly , useless , able-bodied people gaping at inflammatory transparencies outside the offices of sensational papers because the egregious idiots in control of affairs have found them no better employment . Every man will be soberly and intelligently setting about the particular thing 204 WAR he has to do ? even the rich share-holding sort of person , the hereditary mortgager of society , will be given something to do , and if he has learned nothing else he will serve to tie up parcels of ammunition or pack army sausage . Very probably the best of such people and of the speculative class will have qualified as cyclist marksmen for the front ; some of them may even have devoted the leisure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons . Recruiting among the working classes ? or , more properly speaking , among the people of the abyss ? will have dwindled to the vanishing point ; people who are no good for peace purposes are not likely to be any good in such a grave and complicated business as modern war . The spontaneous traffic of the roads in peace will fall now into two streams , one of women and children coming quietly and comfortably out of danger , the other of men and material going up to the front . There will be no panics , no hardships , because everything will have been amply prearranged ? we are dealing with an ideal state . Quietly and tremendously that state will have gripped its adversary and tightened its muscles ? that is all . Now the strategy of this new sort of war in its opening phase will consist mainly in very rapid movements of guns and men behind that thin screen of marksmen , in order to deal suddenly and unexpectedly some forcible blow , to snatch at // some position into which guns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ground against some portion of the enemy 's line . The game will be largely to crowd and crumple that line , to stretch it over an arc to the breaking point , to secure a position from which to shell and destroy its supports and provisions , and to capture or destroy its guns and apparatus , and so tear it away from some town or arsenal it has covered . And a factor of primary importance in this warfare , because of the importance of seeing the hoard , a factor which will be enormously stimulated to develop in the future , will be the aerial factor . Already we have seen the captive balloon as an incidental accessory of considerable importance even in the wild country warfare of South Africa . In the warfare that will go on in the highly organized European states of the opening century , the special military balloon used in conjunction with guns , conceivably of small caliber but of enormous length and range , will play a part of quite primary importance . These guns will be carried on vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as will enable them to traverse almost all sorts of ground. * The 2o6 WAR : aeronauts , provided with large-scale maps of the hostile country , will mark down to the gunners below the precise point upon which to direct their lire , and over hill and dale the shell will fly ? ten t t a Iles it may be ? to its billet , camp , massing night ; t t tack , or advancing gun . Great multitudes of balloons will be the Argus eves of the entire military organism , stalked eyes with a telephonic nerve in each stalk , and at night 1 hey will sweep the country with search-lights and come soaring before the wind with hanging flares. ( ' ertainly they will be steerable . Moreover , when the wind admits , there will be freely moving , steerable balloons wagging little flags to their friends below . And so far as the resources of the men on the ground go , the balloons will be almost invulnerable . The mere perforation of balloons with shot does them little harm , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practically unascertainable distance and height so precisely as to blow it to pieces with a timed shell , and to do this in the little time before it is able to give simple and precise instructions as to your range // and position to the unseen gunners it directs , is certainly one of the most difficult and trying undertakings for an artilleryman that one can well imagine . I am inclined to think that the many considerations against a successful attack on balloons from the ground will enormously stimulate enterprise and invention in the direction of dirigible aerial devices that can fight . Few people , I fancy , who know the work of Langley , Lilienthal , Pilcher , Maxim , and Chanute but will be inclined to believe that long before the year A. D. 2000 , and very probably before 1950 , a successful aeroplane will have soared and come home safe and sound . Directly that is accomplished the new invention will be most assuredly applied to war . The nature of the things that will ultimately fight in the sky is a matter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against that the navigable balloon will presently operate . I am inclined to think the practicable navigable balloon will be first attained by the use of a device already employed by nature in the swimmingbladder of fishes . This is a closed gas-bag that can be contracted or expanded . If a gas-bag of thin , strong , practically impervious substance could be inclosed in a net of closely interlaced fibres ( interlaced , for example , on the pattern of the muscles of the bladder in mammals ) , the ends of these fibres might be wound and unwound , and the effect of contractility attained . A row 208 WAR of such contractile balloons , hung over a long car which was horizontally expanded into wings , would not only allow that car to rise and fall at %v ill , but if the balloon at one end were contracted and that at the other end expanded , and the intermediate ones allowed to assume intermediate conditions , the former end would drop , the expanded wings would be brought into a slanting c ondition over a smaller area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glide downward in that direction . The projection of a small vertical plane upon either side would make the gliding mass rotate in a descending spiral , and so we have all the elements of a controllable flight . such an affair would be difficult to overset . It would be able to beat up even in a fair wind , and then it would be able to contract its bladders and fall down a long slant in any direction . From some such crude beginning a form like a soaring , elongated , flat-brimmed hat might grow , and the possibilities of adding an engine-driven screw are obvious enough . It is difficult to see how such a contrivance could carry guns of any caliber unless they fired from the rear in the line of flight . The problem of recoil becomes a very difficult one in aerial tactics . It would probably have at most a small machine-gun or so , which might fire an explosive shell at the balloons of the enemy , or kill their aeronauts with distributed bullets . The thing would be a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture something of the struggle the dead-locked marksmen of 1950 , lying warily in their rifle-pits , will see . One conceives them at first , each little hole with its watchful , well - equipped couple of assassins , turning up their eyes in expectation . The wind is with our enemy , and his captive balloons have been disagreeably overhead all through the hot morning . His big guns have suddenly become nervously active . Then , a little murmur along the pits and trenches , and from somewhere over behind us , this air-shark drives up the sky . The enemy 's balloons splutter a little , retract , and go rushing down , and we send a spray of bullets as they drop . Then against our aerostat , and with the wind driving them clean overhead of us , cone the antagonistic flying-machines . I incline to imagine there will be a steel prow with a cutting edge at either end of the sort of aerostat I foresee , and conceivably this aerial ram will be the most important weapon of the affair . When operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air as swiftly as possible , and then , with a rapid contraction of its bladders , fling itself like a knife at the sinking war-balloon of the foe . Down , down , down , through a vast , alert tension of flight , down it will swoop , and , if its stoop is successful , slash explosively at last through a suffocating moment . Rifles will crack , ropes tear and 2I0 WAR snap ; there will be a rending and shouting , a great thud of liberated gas , and perhaps a flare . Quite certainly those flying machines will carry folded parachutes , and the last phase of many a struggle will be the desperate leap of the aeronauts with these in hand , to snatch one last chance of life out of a mass of crumpling , fallen wreckage . But in such a fight between flying-machine and flying-machine as we are trying to picture , it will be a fight of hawks , complicated by bullets and little shells . They will rush up and up to get the pitch of one another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the blood comes to eyes and nails . The marksmen below will strain at last , eyes under hands , to see the circling battle that dwindles in the zenith . Then , perhaps , a wild , adventurous dropping of one close beneath the other , an attempt to stoop , the sudden splutter of guns , a tilting up or down , a disengagement . What will have happened ? One combatant , perhaps , will heel lamely earthward , dropping , dropping , with half its bladders burst or shot away , the other circles down in pursuit . . . . " What are they doing ? " Our marksmen will snatch at their field-glasses , tremulously anxious , " Is that a white flag or no ? . . If they drop now we have ' em ! " But the duel will be the rarer thing . In any affair of ramming there is an enormous advantage for the side that can contrive , anywhere in the // field of action , to set two vessels at one . The mere ascent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two on the other , until the manoeuvring squadrons may be as thick as starlings in October . They will wheel and mount , they will spread and close , there will be elaborate manoeuvres for the advantage of the wind , there will be sudden drops to the shelter of intrenched guns . The actual impact of battle will be an affair of moments . They will be awful moments , but not more terrible , not more exacting of manhood than the moments that will come to men when there is ? and it has not as yet happened on this earth ? equal fighting between properly manned and equipped ironclads at sea . ( And the well- bred young gentlemen of means who are privileged to officer the British army nowadays will be no more good at this sort of thing than they are at controversial theology or electrical engineering , or anything else that demands a well-exercised brain . ) Once the command of the air is obtained by one of the contending armies , the war must become a conflict between a seeing host and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle will tower with pitilessly watchful eyes over his adversary , will concentrate his guns and all his strength unobserved , will mark all his adversary 's roads and communications , and sweep them with sudden incredible disasters of shot and shell . The moral effect 2I2 WAR of this predominance will be enormous . All over the losing country , not simply at his frontier but everywhere , the victor will soar . Everybody , everywhere , will be perpetually and constantly looking up , with a sense of loss and insecurity , with a vague stress of painful anticipations . By day the victor 's aeroplanes will sweep down upon the apparatus of all sorts in the adversary 's rear , and will drop explosives and incendiary matters upon them , * so that no apparatus or camp or shelter will any longer be safe . At night his high , floating search-lights will go to and fro and discover and check every desperate attempt to relieve or feed the exhausted marksmen of the fighting line . The phase of tension will pass , that weakening opposition will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and petty combat will develop into the collapse of the defensive lines . A general advance will occur under the aerial van ; ironclad road fighting-machines may , perhaps , play a considerable part in this , and the enemy 's line of marksmen will be driven back or starved into surrender , or broken up and hunted down . As the superiority of the attack becomes week by week more and more evident , its assaults will become more dashing and far-reaching . Under the moonlight and the watching balloons there will be swift , noiseless rushes of cycles , precipitate dismounts , and the // never-to-be-quite abandoned bayonet will play its part . And now men on the losing side will thank God for the reprieve of a pitiless wind , for lightning , thunder , and rain , for any elemental disorder that will for a moment lift the descending scale ! Then , under banks of fog and cloud , the victorious advance will pause and grow peeringly watchful and nervous , and mud-stained , desperate men will go splashing forward into an elemental blackness , rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primordial savagery of nature that can still set aside the wisest devices of men , and give the unthrifty one last , desperate chance to get their own again or die . Such adventures may rescue pride and honor , may cause momentary dismay in the victor and palliate disaster , but they will not turn back the advance of the victors , or twist inferiority into victory . Presently the advance will resume . With that advance the phase of indecisive contest will have ended , and the second phase of the new war , the business of forcing submission , will begin . This should be more easy in the future even than it has proved in the past , in spite of the fact that central governments are now elusive , and small bodies of rifle-armed guerillas far more formidable than ever before . It will probably be brought about in a civilized country by the seizure of the vital apparatus of the urban regions ? the water supply , the generating stations for electricity ( which will 214 WAR supply all the heat and warmth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food distribution . Through these expedients , even while the formal war is still in progress , an irresistible pressure upon a local population will be possible , and it will be easy to subjugate or to create afresh local authorities , who will secure the invader from any danger of a guerilla warfare upon his rear . Through that sort of an expedient an even very obdurate loser will be got down to submission , area by area . With the destruction of its military apparatus and the prospective loss of its water and food supply , however , the defeated civilized state will probably be willing to seek terms as a whole , and bring the war to a formal close . In cases where , instead of contiguous frontiers , the combatants are separated by the sea , the aerial struggle will probably be preceded or accompanied by a struggle for the command of the sea . Of this warfare there have been many forecasts . In this , as in all the warfare of the coming time , imaginative foresight , a perpetual alteration of tactics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other things being equal , victory will rest with the force mentally most active . What type of ship may chance to be prevalent when the great naval war comes is hard guessing , but I incline to think that the naval architects of the ablest peoples will concentrate more and more upon speed , and upon range and penetration , // and , above all , upon precision of fire . I seem to see a light type of iron-clad , armored thickly only over its engines and magazines , murderously equipped , and with a ram ? as alert and deadly as a striking snake . In the battles of the open she will have little to fear from the slow , fumbling treacheries of the submarine ; she will take as little heed of the chance of a torpedo as a barefooted man in battle does of the chance of a fallen dagger in his path . Unless I know nothing of my own blood , the English and Americans will prefer to catch their enemies in ugly weather or at night , and then they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between any two naval powers ( except , perhaps , the English and American , who have both quite unparalleled opportunities for coaling ) will not last more than a week or so . One or other force will be destroyed at sea , driven into its ports and blockaded there , or cut off from its supply of coal ( or other force-generator ) , and hunted down to fight or surrender . An inferior fleet that tries to keep elusively at sea will always find a superior fleet between itself and coal , and will either have to fight at once or be shot into surrender as it lies helpless on the water . Some commerce-destroying enterprise on the part of the loser may go on , but I think the possibilities of that sort of thing are greatly exaggerated . The world grows smaller and smaller , the telegraph and telephone go everywhere , wireless telegraphy 216 WAR opens wider and wider possibilities to the imagination , and how the commerce-destroyer is to go on for long without being marked down , headed off , cut off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not see . The commerce-destroyer will have a very short run ; it will have to be an exceptionally good and costly ship in the first place , it will be finally sunk or captured , and altogether I do not see how that sort of thing will pay when once the corn'nand of the sea is assured . A few weeks will carry the effective frontier of the stronger power up to the coast-line of the weaker , and permit of the secure resumption of the over-sea trade of the former . And then will open a second phase of naval warfare , in which the submarine may play a larger part . I must confess that my imagination , in spite even of spurring , refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea . It must involve physical inconvenience of the most demoralizing sort simply to be in one for any length of time . A first-rate man who has been breathing carbonic acid and oil vapor under a pressure of four atmospheres becomes presently a second - rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few miles out of port ; imagine that you have headache and nausea , and that some ship of the Cobra type is flashing itself and its search-lights about whenever you come up to the surface , and promptly tearing down // on your descending bubbles with a ram , trailing perhaps a tail of grapples or a net as well . Even if you get their boat , these nicely aerated men you are fighting know they have a four to one chance of living ; while for your submarine to be " got " is certain death . You may , of course , throw out a torpedo or so , with as much chance of hitting vitally as you would have if you were blindfolded , turned round three times , and told to fire revolver-shots at a charging elephant . The possibility of sweeping for a submarine with a seine would be vividly present in unpleasant complication in a hurried dive . There would , probably , very soon be boats out , too , seeking with a machine-gun or pompom for a chance at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more than purblind ; it will be , in fact , practically blind . Given a derelict ironclad on a still night within sight of land , a carefully handled submarine might succeed in groping its way to it and destroying it ; but then it would be much better to attack such a vessel and capture it boldly with a few desperate men on a tug . At the utmost , the submarine will be used in narrow waters , in rivers , or to fluster or destroy ships in harbor , or with poor-spirited crews ? that is to say , it will simply be an added power in the hands of the nation that is predominant at sea . And , even 218 WAR then , it can be merely destructive , while a sane and high-spirited fighter will always be dissatisfied if , with an indisputable superiority of force , he fails to take. * No ; the naval warfare of the future is for light , swift ships , almost recklessly not defensive , and with splendid guns and gunners . They will hit hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on land will abandon it at sea . And the captain , and the engineer , and the gunner will have to be all of the same sort of men : capable , headlong men , with brains and no ascertainable social position . They will differ from the officers of the British navy in the fact that the whole male sex of the nation will have been ransacked to get them . The incredible stupidity that closes all but a menial position in the British navy to the sons of those who can not afford to pay a hundred a year for them for some years , necessarily brings the individual quality of the British naval officer below the highest possible , quite apart from the deficiencies that must exist on account of the badness of secondary education in England . The British naval officer and engineer are not made // the best of , good as they are ; indisputably they might be infinitely better , both in quality and training . The smaller German navy , probably , has an ampler pick of men relatively ; is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the abstract navy I am here writing of will be superior to either of these , and , like the American , in the absence of any distinction between officers and engineers . The officer will be an engineer . The military advantages of the command of the sea will probably be greater in the future than they have been in the past . A fleet with aerial supports would be able to descend upon any portion of the adversary 's coast it chose , and to dominate the country inland for several miles with its gun-fire . All the enemy 's sea-coast towns would be at its mercy . It would be able to effect landing and send raids of cyclist-marksmen inland , whenever a weak point was discovered . Landings will be enormously easier than they have ever been before . Once a wedge of marksmen has been driven inland they would have all the military advantages of the defence when it came to eject them . They might , for example , encircle and block some fortified post , and force costly and disastrous attempts to relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tethered against any effective counterblow , keeping guns , supplies , and men in perpetual and distressing movement to and fro along its sea-frontiers . Its soldiers would get uncertain 220 WAR rest , irregular feeding , unhealthy conditions of all sorts in hastily made camps . The attacking fleet would divide and re-unite , break up and vanish , amazingly reappear . The longer the defender 's roast the more wretched his lot . Never before in tile world 's history was the command of the sea worth what it is now . But the command of the sea is , after all , like military predominance on land , to be insured only by superiority of equipment in the hands of a certain type of man , a type of man that it becomes more and more impossible to , improvise , that a country must live for through many years , and that no country on earth at present can be said to be doing its best possible to snake . All this elaboration of warfare lengthens the kale between theoretical efficiency and absolute unpreparedness . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready for war , d any tribe that had some cunning or emotion t command might hope to discount any little sparity in numbers between itself and its neighr . Luck and stubbornness and the incalculable nted for much ; it was half the battle not to ? ow you were beaten , and it is so still . Even ay , a great nation , it seems , may still make army the plaything of its gentlefolk , abandon ? portant military appointments to feminine inue , and trust cheerfully to the homesickness essential modesty of its influential people , and 22I ANTICIPATIONS the simpler patriotism of its colonial dependencies when it comes at last to the bloody and wearisome business of " muddling through . " But these days of the happy-go-lucky optimist are near their end . War is being drawn into the field of the exact sciences . Every additional weapon , every new complication of the art of war , intensifies the need of deliberate preparation , and darkens the outlook of a nation of amateurs . Warfare in the future , on sea or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever been in the past ? much more of a foregone conclusion . Save for national lunacy , it will be brought about by the side that will win , and because that side knows that it will a win . More and more it will have the quality of surprise , of pitiless revelation . Instead of the see - saw , the bickering interchange of battles of the old time , will come swiftly and amazingly blow , and blow , and blow ? no pause , no time for recovery , disasters cumulative and irreparable . The fight will never be in practice between equal sides , never be that theoretical deadlock we have sketched , but a fight between the more efficient and the less efficient , between the more inventive and the more traditional . While the victors , disciplined and grimly intent , full of the sombre yet glorious delight of a grave thing well done , will , without shouting or confusion , be fighting like one great national body , the losers will be taking that pitiless ; . exposure of helplessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and character may determine . War for the losing side will be an unspeakable , pitiable business . There will be first of all the coming of the war , the wave of excitement , the belligerent shouting of the unemployed inefficients , the flag-waving , the secret doubts , the eagerness for hopeful news , the impatience of the warning voice . I seem to see , almost as if he were symbolic , the gray old general ? the general who learned his art of war away in the vanished nineteenth century , the altogether too elderly general with his epaulettes and decorations , his uniform that has still its historical value , his spurs and his sword ? riding along on his obsolete horse , by the side of his doomed column . Above all things he is a gentleman . And the column looks at him lovingly with its countless boys ' faces , and the boys ' eyes are infinitely trustful , for he has won battles in the old time . They will believe in him to the end . They have been brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their mothers have mingled respect for the gentlefolk with the simple doctrines of their faith , their first lesson on entering the army was the salute . The " smart " helmets His Majesty , or some such unqualified person chose for them , lie hotly on their young brows , and over their shoulders slope their obsolete , carelessly-sighted guns . Tramp , tramp , they march , doing what they have been told to do , incapable of doing anything they have not been // told to do , trustful and pitiful , marching to wounds and disease , hunger , hardship , and death . They know nothing of what they are going to meet , nothing of what they will have to do ; religion and the ratepayer and the rights of the parent working through the instrumentality of the best club in the world have kept their souls and minds , if not untainted , at least only harmlessly veneered with the thinnest sham of training or knowledge . Tramp , tramp , they go , boys who will never be men , rejoicing patriotically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly armed , badly clothed , badly led , to be killed in some avoidable quarrel by men unseen . And beside them , an absolute stranger to them , a stranger even in habits of speech and thought , and at any rate to be shot with them fairly and squarely , marches the subaltern ? the son of the school-burking , share-holding class ? a slightly taller sort of boy , as ill-taught as they are in all that concerns the realities of life , ignorant of how to get food , how to get water , how to keep fever down and strength up , ignorant of his practical equality with the men beside him , carefully trained under a clerical headmaster to use a crib , play cricket rather nicely , look all right whatever hap .. pens , believe in his gentility , and avoid talking " shop . " . . . The major you see is a man of the world , and very pleasantly meets the gray general 's eye . He is , one may remark by the way , something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , to the court people or the government people . His prospects ? if only he were not going to be shot ? are brilliant enough . He has written quite cleverly on the question of recruiting , and advocated as much as twopence more a day and billiard-rooms under the chaplain 's control ; he has invented a military bicycle with a wheel of solid iron that can be used as a shield ; and a war correspondent , and , indeed , any one who writes even the most casual and irresponsible article on military questions , is a person worth his cultivating . He is the very life and soul of army reform , as it is known to the governments of the gray ? that is to say , army reform without a single step towards a social revolution . So the gentlemanly old general ? the polished drover to the shambles ? rides , and his doomed column march by , in this vision that haunts my mind . I can not foresee what such a force will even ttempt to do against modern weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pitiful killing of these poor lads , who make up the infantry battalions , the main mass of all the European armies of to-day , whenever they me against a sanely organized army . There is nowhere they can come in ; there is nothing they n do . The scattered , invisible marksmen with their supporting guns will shatter their masses , ? irk them off individually , cover their line of re- // l ANTICIPATIONS treat and force them into wholesale surrenders . It will be more like herding sheep than actual fighting . Yet the bitterest and cruellest things will have to happen , thousands and thousands of poor boys will be smashed in all sorts of dreadful ways and given over to every conceivable form of avoidable hardship and painful disease , before the obvious fact that war is no longer a business for half-trained lads in uniform , led by parson-bred sixth-form boys and men of pleasure and old men , but an exhaustive demand upon very carefully educated adults for the most strenuous best that is in them , will get its practical recognition. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this haunting tragedy of innumerable avoidable deaths is but an incidental thing . They die , and their troubles are over . The larger fact , after all , is the inexorable tendency in things to make a soldier a skilled and educated man , and to link him , in sympathy and organization , with the engineer and the doctor , and all the continually developing mass of scien- // tifically educated men that the advance of science and mechanism is producing . We are dealing with the inter-play of two world-wide forces , that work through distinctive and contrasted tendencies to a common end . We have the force of invention insistent upon a progress of the peace organization , which tends on the one hand to throw out great useless masses of people , the 228 WAR people of the abyss , and on the other hand to develop a sort of adiposity of functionless wealthy , a speculative elephantiasis , and to promote the development of a new social order of efficients , only very painfully and slowly , amid these growing and yet disintegrating masses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a social body , the inevitable intensification of international animosities in such a body , the absolute determination evident in the scheme of things to smash such a body , to smash it just as far as it is such a body , under the hammer of war , that must finally bring about , rapidly and under pressure , the same result as that to which the peaceful evolution slowly tends . While we are as yet only thinking of a physiological struggle , of complex reactions and slow absorptions , comes war with the surgeon 's knife . War comes to simplify the issue and line out the thing with knifelike cuts . The law that dominates the future is glaringly plain . A people must develop and consolidate its educated efficient classes or be beaten in war and give way upon all points where its interests conflict with the interests of more capable people . It must foster and accelerate that natural segregation , which has been discussed in the third and fourth chapters of these Anticipations , or perish . The war of the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities , wherever // men write and read and talk together . The nation that produces in the near future the largest proportional development of educated and intelligent engineers and agriculturists , of doctors , schoolmasters , professional soldiers , and intellectually active people of all sorts ; the nation that most resolutely picks over , educates , sterilizes , exports , or poisons its people of the abyss ; the nation that succeeds most subtly in checking gambling and the moral decay of women and homes that gambling inevitably entails ; the nation that by wise interventions , death duties and the like , contrives to expropriate and extinguish incompetent rich families while leaving individual ambitions free ; the nation , in a word , that turns the greatest proportion of its irresponsible adiposity into social muscle , will certainly be the nation that will be the most powerful in warfare as in peace , will certainly be the ascendant or dominant nation before the year 2000 . In the long run no heroism and no accidents can alter that . No flag-waving , no patriotic leagues , no visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashing of the windows of outspoken people nor siezures of papers and books , will arrest the march of national defeat . And this issue is already so plain and simple , the alternatives arc becoming so pitilessly clear , that even in the stupidest court and the stupidest constituencies , it must presently begin in some dim way to be felt . A 230 WAR time will come when so many people will see this issue clearly that it will gravely affect political and social life . The patriotic party ? the particular gang , that is , of lawyers , brewers , landlords , and railway directors that wishes to be dominant ? will be forced to become an efficient party in profession at least , will be forced to stimulate and organize that educational and social development that may at last even bring patriotism under control . The rulers of the gray , the democratic politician and the democratic monarch , will be obliged year by year by the very nature of things to promote the segregation of colors within the gray , to foster the power that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scientifically educated , disciplined specialist , and that finally is the power of sanity , the power of the thing that is provably right . It may be delayed , but it can not be defeated ; in the end it must arrive ; if not to-day and among our people , then to-morrow and among another people who will triumph in our overthrow . This is the lesson that must be learned , that some tongue and kindred of the coming time must inevitably learn . But what tongue it will be , and what kindred that will first attain this new development , opens far more complex and far less certain issues than any we have hitherto considered . // WE have brought together thus far in these Anticipations the material for the picture of a human community somewhere towards the year 2000 . We have imagined its roads , the type and appearance of its homes , its social developments , its internal struggle for organization ; we have speculated upon its moral and aesthetic condition , read its newspaper , made an advanced criticism upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine it at war . We have decided in particular that , unlike the civilized community of the immediate past , which lived either in sharplydefined towns or agriculturally over a wide country , this population will be distributed in a quite different way ? a little more thickly over vast urban regions , and a little less thickly over less attractive or less convenient or less industrial parts of the world . And , implicit in all that has been written , there has appeared an unavoidable assumption : t the coming community will be vast , something geographically more extensive than most , and geographically different from almost all existing // communities ; that the outline its creative forces will draw not only does not coincide with existing political centres and boundaries , but will be more often than not in direct conflict with them , uniting areas that are separated and separating areas that are united , grouping here half a dozen tongues and peoples together , and there tearing apart homogeneous bodies and distributing the fragments among separate groups . And it will now be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing divisions , the political boundaries of today , and the still older contours of language and race . It is first to be remarked that each of these sets of boundaries is superposed , as it were , on the older sets . The race areas , for example , which are now not traceable in Europe at all , must have represented old regions of separation ; the language areas , which have little or no essential relation to racial distribution , have also given way long since to the newer forces that have united and consolidated nations . And the still newer forces that have united and separated the nineteenth - century states have been , and in many cases are still , in manifest conflict with " national " ideas . Now , in the original separation of human races , in the subsequent differentiation and spread of languages , in the separation of men into nationalities , and in the union and splitting of states // and empires , we have to deal essentially with the fluctuating manifestations of the same fundamental shaping factor which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every boundary of the ethnographical , linguistic , political , and commercial map ? as a little consideration will show ? has , indeed , been traced in the first place by the means of transit , under the compulsion of geographical contours . There are evident in Europe four or five or more very distinct racial types , and since the methods and rewards of barbaric warfare and the nature of the chief chattels of barbaric trade have always been diametrically opposed to racial purity , their original separation could only have gone on through such an entire lack of communication as prevented either trade or warfare between the bulk of the ifferentiating bodies . These original racial types re now inextricably mingled . Unobservant , overscholarly people talk or write in the profoundest manner about a Teutonic race and a Keltic race , and institute all sorts of curious contrasts between these phantoms ; but these are not races at all , if physical characteristics have anything to do with race . The Dane , the Bavarian , the Prussian , the Frieslander , the Wessex peasant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , the Norwegian , the Swede , and the Transvaal Boer , are geralized about , for example , as Teutonic , while the short , dark , cunning sort of Welshman , the tall // and generous Highlander , the miscellaneous Irish , the square-headed Breton , and any sort of Cornwall peasant are Kelts within the meaning of this oillamp anthropology. * People who believe in this sort of thing are not the sort of people that one attempts to convert by a set argument . One need only say the thing is not so ; there is no Teutonic race , and there never has been ; there is no Keltic race , and there never has been . No one has ever proved or attempted to prove the existence of such races , the thing has always been assumed ; they are dogmas with nothing but questionable authority behind them , and the onus of proof rests on the believer . This nonsense about Keltic and Teutonic is no more science than Lombroso 's extraordinary assertions about criminals , or palmistry , or the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several races intermingled in the European populations ? I am inclined to suspect the primitive European races may be found to be so distinct as to resist confusion and pamnyxia through hybridization ? but there is no THE CONFLICT OF LANGUAGES inkling of a satisfactory analysis yet that will discriminate what these races were and define them in terms of physical and moral character . The fact remains there is no such thing as a racially pure and homogeneous community in Europe distinct from other communities . Even among the Jews , according to Erckert and Chantre and J. Jacobs , there are markedly divergent types ; there may have been two original elements and there have been extensive local intermixtures . Long before the beginnings of history , while even language was in its first beginnings ? indeed , as another aspect of the same process as the beginning of language ? the first complete isolations that established race were breaking down again , the little pools of race were running together into less homogeneous lagoons and marshes of humanity , the first paths were being wornwar-paths , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without frequent intercourse , frequent interchange of women as the great factor in that intercourse , the tribes and bands of mankind would still go on separating , would develop dialectic and customary , if not physical and moral differences . It was no longer a case of pools , perhaps , but they were still in lakes . There were as yet no open seas of mankind . With advancing civilization , with iron weapons and war discipline , with established paths and a social rule , and presently with the coming of the horse , // what one might call the areas of assimilation would increase in size . A stage would be reached when the only checks to transit of a sufficiently convenient sort to keep language uniform would be the sea or mountains or a broad river or ? pure distance . And presently the rules of the game , so to speak , would be further altered and the unifications and isolations that were establishing themselves upset altogether and brought into novel conflict by the beginnings of navigation , whereby an impassable barrier became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closing phases of what was probably a very long period of a foot and ( occasional ) horseback state of communications ; the adjustments so arrived at being already in an early state of rearrangement through the advent of the ship . The communities of Europe were still , for the larger part , small , isolated tribes and kingdoms , such kingdoms as a mainly pedestrian militia , or at any rate a militia without transport , and drawn from ( and soon drawn home again by ) agricultural work ? might hold together . The increase of transit facilities between such communities , by the development of shipping and the invention of the wheel and the made road , spelled increased trade perhaps for a time , but very speedily a more extensive form of war , and in the end either the wearing away of differences and union , or conquest . Man is the creature of a // struggle for existence , incurably egoistic and aggressive . Convince him of the gospel of selfabnegation even , and he instantly becomes its zealous missionary , taking great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fellowcreatures do not include physical force ? and if that is not self-abnegation , he asks , what is ? So he has been , and so he is likely to remain . Not to be so , is to die of abnegation and extinguish the type . Improvement in transit between communities , formerly for all practical purposes isolated , means , therefore , and always has meant , and , I imagine , always will mean , that now they can get at one another . And they do . They inter-breed and fight , physically , mentally , and spiritually . Unless Providence is belied in His works , that is what they are meant to do . A third invention which , though not a means of transit like the wheeled vehicle and the ship , was yet a means of communication , rendered still larger political reactions possible , and that was the development of systems of writing . The first empires and some sort of written speech arose together . Just as a kingdom , as distinguished from a mere tribal group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empire without writing and post-roads . The history of the whole world for three thousand years is the history of a unity larger than the small kingdom of the Heptarchy type , endeavoring to establish itself under // ANTICIPATIONS the stress of these discoveries of horse-traffic and shipping and the written word , the history that is of the consequences of the partial shattering of the barriers that had been effectual enough to prevent the fusion of more than tribal communities through all the long ages before the dawn of history . East of the Gobi Pamir barrier there has slowly grown up under these new conditions the Chinese system . West and north of the Sahara Gobi barrier of deserts and mountains , the extraordinarily strong and spacious conceptions of the Romans succeeded in dominating the world , and do , indeed , in a sort of mutilated way , by the powers of great words and wide ideas , in Caesarism and Imperialism , in the titles of Czar , Kaiser , and Imperator , in Papal pretension and countless political devices , dominate it to this hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large extent organized empire over very much of this space . But at its stablest time , this union was no more than a political union , the spreading of a thin layer of Latin-speaking officials , of a thin network of roads and a very thin veneer , indeed , of customs and refinements , over the scarcely touched national masses . It checked , perhaps , but it nowhere succeeded in stopping the slow but inevitable differentiation of province from province and nation from nation . The forces of transit that permitted the Roman imperialism and its partial successors to establish wide ascendencies , were not 242 THE CONFLICT OF LANGUAGES sufficient to carry the resultant unity beyond the political stage . There was unity but not unification . Tongues and writing ceased to be pure without ceasing to be distinct . Sympathies , religious and social practices , ran apart and rounded themselves off like drops of oil on water . Travel was restricted to the rulers and the troops and to a wealthy leisure class , commerce was for most of 1 he constituent provinces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? except for Italy , which latterly became dependent on an over-seas food supply ? was in all essential things : autonomous , could have continued in existence , rulers and ruled , arts , luxuries , and refinements just as they stood , if all other lands and customs had been swept out of being . Local convulsions and revolutions , conquests and developments , occurred indeed , but though the stones were altered the mosaic remained , and the general size and character of its constituent pieces remained . So it was under the Romans , so it was in the eighteenth century , and so it would probably have remained as long as the post-road and the sailingship were the most rapid forms of transit within the reach of man . Wars and powers and princes came and went , that was all . Nothing was changed , there was only one state the more or less . Even in the eighteenth century the process of real unification had effected so little that not one of the larger kingdoms of Europe escaped a civil war // not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one part of itself and another , in that hundred years . In spite of Rome 's few centuries of unstable empire , internal wars , a perpetual struggle against finally triumphant disruption seemed to be the unavoidable destiny of every power that attempted to rule over a larger radius than at most a hundred miles . So evident was this that many educated English persons thought then , and many who are not in the habit of analyzing operating causes , still think to-day , that the wide diffusion of the Englishspeaking people is a mere preliminary to their political , social , and linguistic disruption ? the eighteenth-century breach with the United States is made a precedent of , and the unification that followed the war of Union and the growing unification of Canada is overlooked ? that linguistic differences , differences of custom , costume , prejudice , and the like , will finally make the Australian , the Canadian of English blood , the Virginian , and the English Africander , as incomprehensible and unsympathetic one to another as Spaniard and Englishman or Frenchman and German are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most foolish defiance of the inevitable , the maddest waste of blood , treasure , and emotion that man ever made . So , indeed , it might be ? so , indeed , I certainly think it would be ? if it were not that the epoch of post-road and sailing- // ship is at an end . We are in the beginning of a new time , with such forces of organization and unification at work in mechanical traction , in the telephone and telegraph , in a whole wonderland of novel , space-destroying appliances , and in the correlated , inevitable advance in practical education , as the world has never felt before . The operation of these unifying forces is already to be very distinctly traced in the check , the arrest , indeed , of any further differentiation in existing tongues , even in the most widely spread . In fact , it is more than an arrest even ; the forces of differentiation have been driven back and an actual process of assimilation has set in . In England , at the commencement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the common man of Yorkshire , the Sussex peasant , the Caithness cottar and the common Ulsterman , would have been almost incomprehensible to one another . They differed in accent , in idiom , and in their very names for things . They differed in their ideas about things . They were , in plain English , foreigners one to another . Now they differ only in accent , and even that is a dwindling difference . Their language has become ampler because now they read . They read books ? or , at any rate , they learn to read out of books ? and certainly they read newspapers and those scrappy periodicals that people like bishops pretend to think so detrimental to the human mind , periodicals that it // is cheaper to make at centres and uniformly , than locally in accordance with local needs . Since the newspaper can not fit the locality , the locality has to broaden its mind to the newspaper , and to ideas acceptable in other localities . The word and the idiom of the literary language and the pronunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage . And , moreover , there is a persistent mixing of peoples going on , migration in search of employment and so on , quite unprecedented before the railways came . Few people are content to remain in that locality and state of life " into which it has pleased God to call them . " As a result , dialectic purity has vanished , dialects are rapidly vanishing , and novel differentiations are retarded or arrested altogether . Such novelties as do establish themselves in a locality are widely disseminated almost at once in books and periodicals . A parallel arrest of dialectic separation has happened in France , in Italy , in Germany , and in the states . It is not a process peculiar to any one nation . It is simply an aspect of the general process that has arisen out of mechanical locomotion . The organization of elementary education has no doubt been an important factor , but the essential influence working through this circumstance is the fact that paper is relatively cheap to type-setting , and both cheap to authorship ? even the commonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a periodical or book serves , the bigger , more attractive , and better it can be made for the same money . And clearly this process of assimilation will continue . Even local differences of accent seem likely to follow . The itinerant dramatic company , the itinerant preacher , the coming extension of telephones and the phonograph , which at any time in some application to correspondence or instruction may cease to be a toy , all these things attack , or threaten to attack , the weeds of differentiation before they can take root . And this process is not restricted to dialects merely . The native of a small country who knows no other language than the tongue of his country becomes increasingly at a disadvantage in comparison with the user of any of the three great languages of the Europeanized world . For his literature he depends on the scanty writers who are in his own case and Rite , or have written , in his own tongue . Necessarily they are few , because necessarily with a small public there can be only subsistence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse case . His country can produce neither teachers nor discoverers to compare with the numbers of such workers in the larger areas , and it will neither pay them to write original matter for his instruction nor to translate what has been written in other tongues . The larger the number of people reading a tongue , the larger ? other things being equal ? will be not only the output of more or // less original literature in that tongue , but also the more profitable and numerous will be translations of whatever has value in other tongues . Moreover , the larger the reading public in any language the cheaper will it be to supply copies of the desired work . In the matter of current intelligence the case of the speaker of the small language is still worse . His newspaper will need to be cheaply served , his home intelligence will be cut and restricted , his foreign news belated and second hand . Moreover , to travel even a little distance or to conduct anything but the smallest business enterprise will be exceptionally inconvenient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own may travel well-nigh all over the world and everywhere meet some one who can speak his tongue . But what of the Welsh-speaking Welshman ? What of the Basque and the Lithuanian who can speak only his mother tongue ? Everywhere such a man is a foreigner and with all the foreigner 's disadvantages . In most places he is for all practical purposes deaf and dumb . The inducements to an Englishman , Frenchman , or German to become bilingual are great enough nowadays , but the inducements to a speaker of the smaller languages are rapidly approaching compulsion . He must do it in self-defence . To be an educated man in his own vernacular has become an impossibility ; he must either become a mental subject of one of the greater languages or // sink to the intellectual status of a peasant . But if our analysis of social development was correct , the peasant of to-day will be represented to-morrow by the people of no account whatever ? the classes of extinction , the people of the abyss . If that analysis was correct , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say , the essential nation will speak some dominant language or cease to exist , whatever its primordial tongue may have been . It will pass out of being and become a mere local area of the lower social stratum ? a problem for the philanthropic amateur . The action of the force of attraction of the great tongues is cumulative . It goes on , as bodies fall , with a steady acceleration . The more the great tongues prevail over the little languages the less will be the inducement to write and translate into these latter , the less the inducement to master them with any care or precision . And so this attack upon the smaller tongues , this gravitation of those who are born to speak them towards the great languages , is not only to be seen going on in the case of such languages as Flemish , Welsh , or Basque , but even in the case of Norwegian and of such a great and noble tongue as the Italian , I am afraid that the trend of things makes for a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French book . French wins its way more and more there , as English , I understand , is doing in Norway , and English and German in Holland . And // in the coming years when the reading public will , in the case of the Western nations , be practically the whole functional population , when travel will be more extensive and abundant , and the interchange of printed matter still cheaper and swifter ? and , above all , with the spread of the telephone ? the process of subtle , bloodless , unpremediated annexation will conceivably progress much more rapidly even than it does at present . The twentieth century will see the effectual crowding out of most of the weaker languages ? if not a positive crowding out , yet at least ( as in Flanders ) a supplementing of them by the superposition of one or other of a limited number of world-languages over the area in which each is spoken . This will go on not only in Europe , but with varying rates of progress and local eddies and interruptions over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Japan , where there may be a unique development , the peoples of the world will escape from the wreckage of their too small and swamped and foundering social systems , only up the ladders of what one may call the aggregating tongues . What will these aggregating world-languages be ? If one has regard only to its extension during the nineteenth century , one may easily incline to overrate the probabilities of English becoming the chief of these . But a great part of the vast extension of English that has occurred has been due to the rapid reproduction of originally English-speak- // ing peoples , the emigration of foreigners into English-speaking countries in quantities too small to resist the contagion about them , and the compulsion due to the political and commercial preponderance of a people too illiterate to readily master strange tongues . None of these causes have any essential permanence . When one comes to look more closely into the question one is surprised to discover how slow the extension of English has been in the face of apparently far less convenient tongues . English still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its ascendency is doubtful to-day in South Africa , after nearly a century of British dominion . It has none of the contagious duality of French , and the small class that monopolizes the direction of British affairs , and probably will monopolize it yet for several decades , has never displayed any great zeal to propagate its use . Of the few ideas possessed by the British governing class , the destruction and discouragement of schools and colleges is , unfortunately , one of the chief , and there is an absolute incapacity to understand the political significance of the language question . The Hindoo who is at pains to learn and use English encounters something uncommonly like hatred disguised in a facetious form . He will certainly read little about himself in English that is not grossly contemptuous , to reward him for his labor . The possibilities that have existed , and that do still in a dwindling // degree exist , for resolute statesmen to make English the common language of communication for all Asia south and east of the Himalayas , will have to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may quite probably pass away . There is no sign that either the English or the Americans have a sufficient sense of the importance of linguistic predominance in the future of their race to interfere with natural processes in this matter for many years to come . Among peoples not actually subject to British or American rule , and who are neither waiters nor commercial travellers , the inducements to learn English , rather than French or German , do not increase . If our initial assumptions are right , the decisive factor in this matter is the amount of science and thought the acquisition of a language will afford the man who learns it . It becomes , therefore , a fact of very great significance that the actual number of books published in English is less than that in French or German , and that the proportion of serious books is very greatly less . A large proportion of English books are novels adapted to the minds of women , or of boys and superannuated business men ? stories designed rather to allay than stimulate thought ? they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to publisher and author alike . In this connection they do not count , however ; no foreigner is likely to learn English for the pleasure of reading Miss // Marie Corelli in the original , or of drinking untranslatable elements from The Helmet of Navarre . The present conditions of book-production for the English-reading public offer no hope of any immediate change in this respect . There is neither honor nor reward ? there is not even food or shelter ? for the American or Englishman who devotes a year or so of his life to the adequate treatment of any spacious question , and so small is the English - reading public with any special interest in science , that a great number of important foreign scientific works are never translated into English at all . Such interesting compilations as Bloch 's work on war , for example , must be read in French ; in English only a brief summary of his results is to be obtained , under a sensational heading. * Schopenhauer , again , is only to be got quite stupid1v Bowdlerized , explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made into English are made only to sell ; they are too often the work of sweated women and girls ? very often quite without any special knowledge of the matter they translate ? they are difficult to read and untrustworthy to quote . The production of books in English , except the author be a wealthy amateur , rests finally upon the publishers , and publishers to-day stand a little lower than ordinary tradesmen in not caring at all whether the goods they ANTICIPATIONS sell are good or bad . Unusual books , they allege ? and all good books are unusual ? are " difficult to handle , " and the author must pay the fine ? amounting , more often than not , to the greater portion of his interest in the book . There is no criticism to control the advertising enterprises of publishers and authors , and no sufficiently intelligent reading public has differentiated out of the confusion to encourage attempts at critical discrimination . The organs of the great professions and technical trades are as yet not alive to the part their readers must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore all but strictly technical publications . A bastard criticism , written in many cases by publishers ' employes ? a criticism having a very direct relation to the advertisement columns ? distributes praise and blame in the periodic press . There is no body of great men , either in England or America , no intelligence in the British court , that might by any form of recognition compensate the philosophical or scientific writer for poverty and popular neglect . The more powerful a man 's intelligence , the more distinctly he must see that to devote himself to increase the scientific or philosophical wealth of the English tongue will be to sacrifice comfort , the respect of the bulk of his contemporaries , and all the most delightful things of life , for the barren reward of a not very certain righteous self-applause . By // brewing and dealing in tied houses , * or by selling pork and tea , or by stock-jobbing , and by pandering with the profits so obtained to the pleasures of the established great , a man of energy may hope to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of anything attainable through the most splendid intellectual performances . Heaven forbid I should overrate public honors and the company of princes ! But it is not always delightful to be splashed by the wheels of cabs . Always before there has been at least a convention that the court of this country , and its aristocracy , were radiant centres of moral and intellectual influence , that they did to some extent check and correct the judgments of the cab-rank and the beer-house . But the British crown of to-day , so far as it exists for science and literature at all , exists mainly to repudiate the claims of intellectual performance to public respect . These things , if they were merely the grievances i the study , might very well rest there . But they . must be recognized here because the intellectual // decline of the published literature of the English language ? using the word to cover all sorts of books ? involves finally the decline of the language and of all the spacious political possibilities that go with the wide extension of a language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt were made to provide sound instruction in English to all who sought it , and to all within the control of English - speaking governments , if honor and emolument were given to literary men instead of being left to them to most indelicately take , and if the present sordid trade of publishing were so lifted as to bring the whole literature , the whole science , and all the contemporary thought of the world ? not some selection of the world 's literature , not some obsolete encyclopaedia sold meanly and basely to choke hungry minds , but a real publication of all that has been and is being done ? within the reach of each man 's need and desire who had the franchise of the tongue , then by the year 2000 I would prophesy that the whole functional body of human society would read , and perhaps even write and speak , our language . And not only that , but it might be the prevalent and everyday language of Scandinavia and Denmark and Holland , of all Africa , all North America , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal international language , and in a fair way to be the universal language of mankind . But such an enterprise demands a resolve and // intelligence beyond all the immediate signs of the times ; it implies a veritable renascence of intellectual life among the English-speaking peoples . The probabilities of such a renascence will be more conveniently discussed at a later stage , when we attempt to draw the broad outline of the struggle for world-wide ascendency that the coming years will see . But here it is clear that upon the probability of such a renascence depends the extension of the language , and not only that , but the preservation of that military and naval efficiency upon which , in this world of resolute aggression , the existence of the English-speaking communities finally depends . French and German will certainly be aggregating languages during the greater portion of the coming years . Of the two , I am inclined to think French will spread further than German . There is a disposition in the world , which the French share , to grossly undervalue the prospects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can gather , from the facts that the French were beaten by the Germans in 187o , and that they do not breed with the abandon of rabbits or negroes . These are considerations that affect the dissemination of French very little . The French reading public is something different and very much larger than the existing French political system . The number of books published in French is greater than that published in English ; there is a critical reception // ANTICIPATIONS for a work published in French that is one of the few things worth a writer 's having , and the French translators are the most alert and efficient in the world . One has only to see a Parisian book-shop , and to recall an English one , to realize the as yet unattainable standing of French . The serried ranks of lemon-colored volumes in the former have the whole range of human thought and interest ; there are no taboos and no limits ; you have everything up and down the scale , from frank indecency to stark wisdom . It is a shop for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a translation of that most wonderful book , the Text-book of Psychology of Professor William James , in a shop in 1'Avenue de l'Opera ? three copies of a book that I have never seen anywhere in England outside my own house ? and I am an attentive student of book-shop windows ! And the French books are all so pleasant in the page , and so cheap ? they are for a people that buys to read . One thinks of the English book-shop , with its gaudy reach-me-downs of gilded and embossed cover , its horribly printed novels still more horribly " illustrated , " the exasperating pointless variety in the size and thickness of its books . The general effect of the English book is that it is something sold by a dealer in brit-a-brac , honestly sorry the thing is a book , but who has done his best to remedy it , anyhow ! And all the English shopful is either brand new fiction or illustrated travel ( of Buns // with the Grand Lama type ) , or gilded versions of the classics of past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book-shop reeks of contemporary intellectual life ! These things count for French as against English now , and they will count for infinitely more in the coming years . And over German , also , French has many advantages . In spite of the numerical preponderance of books published in Germany , it is doubtful if the German reader has quite such a catholic feast before him as the reader of French . There is a mass of German fiction probably as uninteresting to a foreigner as popular English and American romance . And German , compared with French , is an unattractive language ; unmelodious , unwieldy , and cursed with a hideous and blinding lettering that the German is too patriotic to sacrifice . There has been in Germany a more powerful parallel to what one may call the " honest Saxon " movement among the English , that queer mental twist that moves men to call an otherwise undistinguished preface a " foreword , " and find a pleasurable advantage over their fellow - creatures in a familiarity with " eftsoons . " This tendency in German has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked the development of new words of classical origin . In particular it has stood in the way of the international use of scientific terms . The Englishman , the Frenchman , and the Italian have a certain community of tech- // nical , scientific , and philosophical phraseology , and it is frequently easier for an Englishman with some special knowledge of his subject to read and appreciate a subtle and technical work in French than it is for him to fully enter into the popular matter of the same tongue . Moreover , the technicalities of these peoples , being not so immediately and constantly brought into contrast and contact with their Latin or Greek roots as they would be if they were derived ( as are so many " patriotic " German technicalities ) from native roots , are free to qualify and develop a final meaning distinct from their original intention . In the growing and changing body of science this counts for much . The indigenous German technicality remains clumsy and compromised by its everyday relations ; to the end of time it drags a lengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the limited qualification , that a Frenchman or Englishman can attain with a mere twist of the sentence , the German must either abandon or laboriously overstate with some colossal wormcast of parenthesis . . . . Moreover , against the German tongue there are hostile frontiers ? there are hostile people who fear German preponderance , and who have set their hearts against its use . In Roumania , and among the Slav , Bohemian , and Hungarian peoples , French attacks German in the flank , and has as clear a prospect of predominance . 26o
