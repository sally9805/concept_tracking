 |p1297  THE good things of the world , even when they are physical , are not attainable off-hand . We make them our own and enter into their uses by much painstaking and wisdom , and so come to understand them . This is especially conspicuous in spiritual gifts . We approach them in many ways on many sides before we come to master them . Democratic society is at once the best gift of God and the highest human attainment . We more frequently seem to reach it on the side of political institutions , but before we are well in possession it lifts , like a rare bird disturbed in its haunts , and only leaves behind the shadow of a liberty we have not attained . Democratic society means a diffusion of powers ; if it be complete democracy , a universal participation in the activities and enjoyments incident to human life . It means the winning by all , of every class , the blessings of existence ; a sharing of all that life requires and bestows . This diffusion of power is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who are simply partaking in effort . It means a free contact of mind with mind , all having something to give and something to receive in this extension of our thoughts , actions , feelings to the limits of the spiritual world . Races and classes as boundary lines are abolished , and the commerce of life goes on everywhere ; everywhere as one wishes it and can profit by it . The South still bears the burden of slavery so far as it can not rejoice in the welfare of the colored race , and the North still suffers from the indifference which estranges it from the races of mankind . We believe in democratic society because of an antecedent belief in the inexhaustible capacity of the spirit , in its inheritance of the world as one immeasurable product ; because of our belief that no good thing or form of life obstructs or burdens the world , but that all make the world better for themselves and for others ; because of an abiding conviction that the spiritual world is as wide as and beneficent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no better than that race . The idea along which men travel into this fullness of spiritual experience is often exprest as an equality of rights , of opportunities , between men ; and it is carped at under this form of expression as if equality contradicted all experience . It does contradict the experience in which the power , wealth , honor of the world are gathered in a few hands ; it does not contradict that experience by which we approach the Kingdom of Heaven , a kingdom that takes all men into its embrace , blesses all and leaves no outcast , no alien , no disinherited one among the sons of men . The spirit of man is so true to itself as to return again and again to this notion of equality , no matter what absurdities and inadequacies may seem to inhere in it . Equal opportunities mean a free approach of all men to the blessings of life , blessings so varied and so expansive as to leave no man poor , no man robbed of good , no matter how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These possibilities , into the midst of which every man is dropt , are the promised land into which he is simply to go up and possess it . If , in a place of exercise , apparatus stood ready , fitted to every man 's strength , we could talk of the equality of opportunity , no matter how little or great one 's present improvement might be . Such is the ideal that lies before democracy , participation in the world , tinder existing and growing capacity , for each man 's benefit and for the benefit of all . Democratic society is such an extension of life that it becomes truly the commonwealth , not by division but by participation , under which every  |p1298  man reaches his own with no trespass on another ; nay , by an addition to every other man 's wealth . Not only must something of this idea be present to the mind before we start in pursuit of democracy ; it must be with us in every estimate of what constitutes democracy .. Democracy rests on individual life . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wherever intelligence and self-guidance halt ? there democracy halts . Every man must find a place , his own eligible place , in the community , and from that place must minister to the community , and in that place the community must minister to him . We need to understand that personal quality does not interfere with aidfulness and goodwill . Beneficence has its highest expression between active participants . The passive recipient receives and gives only half the benefit of a gift . True giving reaches the center of life , and thence extends itself to all enjoyments . A man must have his own position in which to receive and from which to return favor , as much as in the first instance to set it agoing . It is the distinctive idea of democracy that men in society are capable of this reciprocal intercourse and thrive under it . If we cherish this conception of the self-sustaining relation of men to each other , we must adapt our goodwill to it . We can not feed a pauper merely as a pauper . We must convert him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is against pauperism , and involves the full supply of all a man 's wants . There are various forms of goodwill which come under the censure of democracy as hostile to it . Pensions for the old and needy may seem a most desirable benevolence , but they may tend to confirm rather than remove a great evil . Our true effort should be to enable the workman to provide for himself . It is far better to anticipate the evils of old age before they arrive than it is to relieve them when they have reached us . Preeminently is this true when the provision we make is relied on as a resource , and so encourages the improvidence on the one side and the hardness on the other out of which the destitution of old age arises . An extended and conclusive trial and failure of external aid are found in English history . For a considerable period the poor rates were made easily accessible to all forms of poverty . The result was that many , partially supported by these rates , were able to take and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an unambitious and dependent class grew apace . This principle of participation leads us to regard with suspicion the Carnegie fund in relief of college professors whose work has brought insufficient returns . The character of both parties to this provision being of the highest , may serve to give it a false color . Is it not better that each man , in the labor he has chosen , should accept the work and the pay of the work , bringing both , if need be , into more just consideration by the community to which they pertain , than that he should turn his life into a charity , taking it out of the ordinary conditions of toil . What the community truly needs is good work fittingly rewarded , and till this relation obtains among men democracy is not reached . This singling out the highest teachers for a charitable reward leaves the mass of teachers where they are , and helps to reduce the motives for general relief , if such relief is called for . I observe that a recent report of those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingness with which men of eminence and ability have accepted this aid . Indeed , many colleges have made haste to discard any religious affiliations or special inabilities which might deprive their teaching corps of this gratuity . All this is hostile to the true temper of democracy , to that cheerful acceptance of one 's own lot in the community tinder the common laws of production . It may be doubted whether teachers as a class are more prest by inadequate wages than are the other classes from whose earnings they derive their pay . It is not a gain in democracy to throw any class either on the forced contribution or charity of any other class for support . Support is each man 's problem , to be wrought out as he is best able under the common conditions of production . If it is true that teachers are relatively poorly paid , the correction should come under the laws of production applicable to all . and not as a charity to those , in the body             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
