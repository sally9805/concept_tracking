txt Mr. BRYAN is wasting his time , and Wasting the time of the public and of the Democratic Party . His advocacy of an eight-hour day for labor does not interest the country . Everybody knew , or could have guessed , his views upon labor questions . The thoughts he has expressed about international arbitration and universal peace are as old as the hills . But his plan for the transfer of all the railroads in the country to the Federal and State Governments is ' new , yet he does not explain how the Momentous change is to be brought about , presents no plan even in outline , tells us nothing about it , in fact , save that it ought to be done . If Mr. BRYAN wishes the country to take him and his public ownership plan seriously he must without any further delay come down to specifications . When he accepted the Democratic nomination to the Presidency ten years ago and began to advocate the free , unlimited , and independent coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation . - *He told the country precisely what he meant . Everybody understood that-under the coinage laws &a; he would shape them a man having 100 ounces of silver could take the metal to the United States Mint and get it coined into 120 silver dollars . As silver could at that time be bought in the open market for about 67 cents an ounce , every mind could grasp in an instant the meaning and scope of the change proposed by Mr. ** in our financial policy and currency laws . His supporters could understand him , his opponents could get at him . They did get at him , for in the course of his manifold expositions of the free-coinage policy he propounded so many false doctrines that his ignorance was exposed day by day throughout the campaign , and the ruinous effect of his hoticy was made so plain to the country , or at least to the thinking men of the country , that his defeat followed Mr. BRYAN now asks the Democratic Party to accept him upon a platform of Government ownership and operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way tell us how the Federal and State Governments are to come into possession of the thirteen billions ' worth of railroad property now privately owned . Absurdities are not infrequent in politics , and electorates sometimes behave as if they were deprived of reason and without foresight . But there is a limit , and Mr. BRYAN is pushing himself and his unexplained new doctrine perilously near to the verge of toleration , if he has not already passed it . If Mr. BRYAN had returned from his journeyings with the news that the " overshadowing evil " that now besets this country was lack of room and opportunity for our National development , and had advocated as an immediate cure  --  the only possible cure  --  the building of a bridge to the moon , it is conceivable that an audience might have ' been brought together in Madison Square Garden that would have applauded the idea of a lunar bridge . Those Americans who really believe in Mr. BRYAN believe in him so unreservedly that we are inclined to think that they would accept from his lips almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in their jackknife trades . But , really , there are not enough Americans to form a party who would consent to embody in a platform the demand for a bridge to the moon until Mr. BRYAN had favored them with further details . They would ask to see his plans , to know the names of his engineers , to examine their computations of strain and stress , and , above all , they would be moved by a deep and legitimate curiosity'about the cost of the structure and the means proposed for raising the money . Mr. BRYAN might deliver the greatest oration of his life in the attempt to set forth the advantages of access to the moon . He might demonetrate that our population would soon need large tracts , of lunar territory as an escape from terrestrial overcrowding ; be might point out that the opening up of a vast new source of raw material would be the greatest possible boon for our manufacturing interests , and that the utilizing of the undeveloped resources of the moon would broaden and extend through uncounted ages the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . The nblic Would still clamor for shop drawings financial prospectus . In practitice a bridge to the moon is useful only ** an illustration . It does illustrate , we thiiill , - the entire unreasonableness of Mr. BRYAN 'S present position before the American people . The undertaking he advocates is so gigantic that the unaided imagination can not supply the missing details . Nobody except Mr. BRYAN could present a working plan for carrying this rpolicy into effect that would not be at once destroyed by the fire of criticism . Since he is the only man in a position of responsibility who has proposed public ownership , a decent respect for him compels us to assume that he has worked out the plan , and that he knows how the railroads can be taken over by the Federal and State Governments . If he has a plan he must immediately make it known . If he has none he may as well retire from American politics and resume his wandering . For certainly nobody who had proposed " in the air " and without any Consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment could hope to retain standing and public confidence . Nor can Mr. BRYAN hope to hold a place in the Democratic Party as its prospective candidate if he ' pOStpones indefinitely a statement of the method by which his policy of public ownership is to be carried into effect . The Democratic Party has of late shown disturbing symptoms of senility , but it is not altogether a fool . It has the right to know - how its candidate is going to build his- bridge to the moon , and it will insist on knowing .
