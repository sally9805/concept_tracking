txt 6o AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . tain object with that conception . This illustrates the sense in which geometry is a real science . As expressing the figures that may be drawn in consistency with the conception of space as homogeneous and continuous , geometry enables us to make precise judgments in regard to the quantitative relations of real things . It tells us what are the conditions under which one given figure can alone be an object of our knowledge , and thus enables us to determine how far the figure of a given object deviates from the figure conceived . Geometry does not say that the edge of any object is straight , but it gives us a means of determining with absolute precision its deviation from straightness ; in other words , it tells us what the character of an object would be if there were no other relations of things than those of position . So in other cases . There is an abstraction even within geometry itself . There can be no position of objects without figure , but figure does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered by itself . Then we advance from the point to the line , from the line to the surface , from the surface to the solid . But even if we could determine all the possible figures that are consistent with the conception of space , we should not completely determine reality . There are many other aspects of things besides the geometrical . Geometry , therefore , deals with abstractions in this sense , that it determines the conditions under which objects can be known as extended magnitudes , without determining the other conditions . The elements of reality with which it deals are real as elements , but they have no reality if they are supposed to be real purely by themselves . The only adequate conception of reality is that which implies a knowledge of // all the conditions of reality , and such a conception takes us a long way beyond geometry . I think we may now conclude that Mill 's denial of the accuracy of geometry has no real foundation . The definitions of geometry merely express the simplest relations between sensible objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of relations is that they are real without being sensible . If there were no law by which the relative position of bodies could be determined , we could say nothing in regard to their position , and so as to other relations of the same kind . Straight lines are what geometry defines them to be , circles have all their radii equal . The next question is whether the propositions of geometry are universal and necessary . Mill , as we know , answers that they have no wider application than is warranted by observation . To say that " two straight lines can not enclose a space " merely means that " all the straight lines that we have observed are such that they do not enclose a space . " But we have no ground for saying , in the strict sense , that two straight lines can not enclose a space . " We should probably have no difficulty in putting together the two ideas supposed to be incompatible , if our experience had not first inseparably associated one of them with the contradictory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only be given by showing that the supposition of a world which is spatially determined , and yet admits of the coexistence of elements that in the world as present to our consciousness are incompatible , is a self-contradictory supposition . To attempt the proof of this view would at present lead us too far ; I shall therefore merely endeavour to show that // if there is a world in which straight lines enclose a space , at any rate it is not a world of which we can ever have any experience . If this is proved , it will follow that the propositions of geometry are true , not merely as state-ments of what we have experienced , but as laws of what we always shall experience . We propose to show , in other words , that the nature of our consciousness is such that any experience of the enclosure of a space by two straight lines is an impossible experience . Mill holds that , as a matter of fact , we have never found the two ideas of intersecting straight lines and en-closure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the reason why we suppose them to be necessarily dis-connected . He assumes , therefore , that the picture or image of intersecting straight lines is a picture of which we have repeatedly been conscious . How did this image get into our consciousness ? To this Mill would of course answer that it is due to an effort of abstraction by which we attend only to the direction of the two lines . But the lines as we perceive them are sensible lines : let us , for the sake of simplicity , say visible or coloured lines . We have , then , the image of two coloured lines as inter-secting , i.e. , as not enclosing a space . On the other hand we may have the image of two coloured lines as meet-ing at both their extremities , i.e. , as enclosing a space . But we never have the picture of two coloured lines that at once intersect and meet . Yet we might , Mill maintains , have such an image . Now , the question is this . What is implied in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A picture or image is necessarily individual . I can not have // the image of a line that is neither straight nor curved , for such an object , whatever it might be , would not be an image . Nor , again , can I have an image of a line that is not sensible ; for a non-sensible line would not be an image , but a relation or abstraction . We have , then , before our minds the image of a line . What does this imply ? The line is coloured , but the line can not be defined as colour , for the colour may be changed while yet the image is in other respects the same . Suppose the image is that of a coloured straight line . How do we come to have such an image ? We must be conscious of a colour as disposed in a certain direction , i.e. , as disposed so as to be straight . Now this image of a straight line can not be present to our consciousness as straight unless we mentally draw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the other . And each part as coloured will , when it is produced , be a succession of colours , i.e. , we must have one sensation of colour after the other . Unless , therefore , we have a succession of colours , we can have no image of a coloured line . The succession of colours , however , is not the line ; what constitutes the line is the manner in which these colours are disposed in the image ; and that manner is that of uniform direction . It is therefore evident that the image of a line can be present to our consciousness only if we arrange the colours in a certain fixed way . If the colours are disposed irregularly , we shall have no image of a straight line . At first sight it seems as if the colours might be disposed in any order ; but , on closer examination , it becomes obvious that there are fixed limits to their disposition . If I am to have the image of a coloured object at all , the colours must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight and partly curved , In other words , there is a fixed law in regard to the disposition of colours , if they are to form an image . The law is this : that they must be arranged as out of one another or as mutually external , and as mutually external in the three dimensions of space . If , e.g. , there were no mutual externality of the colours , they would vanish in a point , and a point can not form an image . Every part of an image must therefore be of such a nature that any part of it is external to any other part . Hence , to have the image of a line is to produce each part as external to the others . But our image must also be individual , i.e. , the parts produced as mutually external must be in a straight line or in a curved line . The image we have been considering is that of a straight line . The condition of the consciousness of a straight line is the mental production or construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unity . Now this combination of mutually external parts is not given in the successive feelings of colour : it is an act of thought due to the activity of our minds . The image of a coloured straight line can therefore be present to our consciousness only if there is an act of combination which takes place in accordance with the principle , that all the parts of the line are ( r ) mutually external , ( z ) together , ( 3 ) homogeneous , ( 4 ) in one direction . ( r ) Suppose mutual externality absent , and we should have no line , but a number of detached points . ( 2 ) Suppose they are not together , and we should have a vanishing series like the moments of time . ( 3 ) Suppose they are not homogeneous , and we should have parts of // different length , i.e. , we should really have a line of discrete parts . ( 4 ) Suppose they are not all in one direction , and we should have not a straight but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can have no image of a straight line that contradicts any of these conditions . But if two straight lines enclosed a space , it must be because one or other of them , or both , is not straight . Thus we affirm and deny straightness . But if we deny straightness , we can have no image of a straight line , because the straightness is not in the sensations of colour , but in the manner in which they are disposed . Now , if we could have experience of two straight lines which enclosed a space , i.e. , of a line that was in two directions at once , it must be because we can form images that have none of the characteristics of those we do form . For a straight line that encloses a space is the same as one that is in two opposite directions at once . Such a line could not be a determination of space as we know it , but of a totally different space . Thus it would not be an image of the kind we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have as belonging to the same world . What Mill overlooks is , that all images of extended magnitudes are formed in consonance with the principle of the homogeneity of the parts of space . To suppose that we can have a sensible image which contradicts this homogeneity is to suppose that we can have an image which contradicts the fundamental condition of such images . The condition is not one that lies in the sensations , but one that lies in the manner in which they must be combined . We can not present to ourselves the image of a coloured line that is in two directions at once E // because such a colour would not appear to us as colour , every coloured line being necessarily pictured as in one direction or another . If a line may be in two directions at once , this means that it is not an image , and if there is no image there can be no " association " of images . All determinateness vanishes , and we are in a ghostly world in which we can present nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible , Mill 's reason for denying the absoluteness of the connection of images vanishes . Where there is no possibility of making images at all there can be no association of images . Deny images , and Mill 's objection falls to the ground . His argument in reference to the judgment , " Two straight lines can not enclose a space , " amounts to this , that we have never found subject and predicate together in our experience , but have only found repeated associations of subject and predicate . But there can be no repetition of an association where there is nothing to associate . Hence , if we deny the universality of the elements implied in our judgment , we are denying the possibility of both subject and predicate . To have either we must have both , i.e. , the relation is not variable , because its invariability is the condition of any image . A relation which is the condition of any object of consciousness about which we can judge at all is not variable but fixed . Hence we do not obtain geometrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment is universal . Let us now state somewhat more freely what we regard as the true view of the proof of mathematical judgments . Wnatever we can present before our consciousness as an // extended magnitude is external to all other magnitudes , and if we distinguish parts in this extended magnitude , each of these is external to all the other parts , and to all parts that we can distinguish in any other extended magnitude . Now , we can not perceive any part by simply apprehending it as in a particular or separate space . For , firstly , the particular space in which the part is can not be regarded as a unit which admits of no further division ; so regarded it would be a point , and that which is in a point , if there could be such a thing , would not be extended . Secondly , we can not perceive space as a whole , and fix the position of the part by reference to this whole . To perceive space as a whole would be to have a perception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond it ; and such a perception is impossible . We can only perceive one space as surrounded by another wider space , this by a still wider , and so on ; but we can never reach a space beyond which there is no wider space . How then can we perceive an object as external to other objects ? Only by combining data of sense in such a way as to present them as a single image , the parts of which are mutually external , i.e. , by relating the data of sense in such a way as to present them as in space . If this is not done there is no sensible image , and therefore no perception of an extended sensible object . So far in regard to the perception of individual sensible images , e.g. , this desk , this chair . We may , however , reach a further stage of knowledge by neglecting the peculiarities of this and that sensible object , and directing our attention solely to the relation of mutual externality itself . This is what geometry does . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every part of space is homogeneous with every other , but when we make space itself an object we become conscious of this principle . The reason , then , why geometry applies to all sensible magnitudes is that it simply states explicitly the principle that the mind must make use of in having the perception of any object as extended . From these considerations we may see that Mill 's account of the manner in which geometrical judgments are formed is unsatisfactory . Is every geometrical judgment particular ? Is any such judgment particular ? His view may be stated as follows : In my experience I observe two sensible straight lines meet and then diverge further and further from each other . Thus I make the particular judgment : the straight lines AB do not enclose a space . On another occasion I again perceive two straight lines which do not enclose a space , and this yields another particular judgment : the straight lines CD do not enclose a space . Nor have we in our sensible experience ever found two straight lines enclosing a space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the straight lines AB do not enclose a space , " states more than is warranted by perception . For these lines are finite in length : " we can not follow them to infinity ; for aught our senses can testify , they may immediately beyond the furthest point to which we have traced them begin to approach and at last meet . " Thus the judgment warranted by perception would seem to be , not that the straight lines AB do not enclose a space , but that the straight lines AB , so far as we have observed them , do not enclose a space . Such a proposition , so far from being // identical with the axiom of Euclid , that " two straight lines can not enclose a space , " i.e. , that no two straight lines can enclose a space , will not even warrant the judgment that the straight lines AB can not enclose a space . Geometrical propositions would thus seem to be doubly particular , firstly , as not warranting a judgment about all straight lines ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines to what has been observed . The subject , " no two straight lines , " must run , " these two straight lines , " and the predicate , " can enclose a space , " must be modified to " enclose a space so far as our perception goes . " Mill , however , refuses to limit the predicate of the judgment . It is true , he says , that we can not perceive two infinite straight lines , but we can yet affirm that they do not enclose a space . For , if the two lines which we perceive to diverge ever do meet , it must be at a finite distance , and hence we can picture in imagination the manner in which they would present themselves to perception . Now , we can not imagine two straight lines as diverging and then meeting at a finite distance ; and hence we can say that the two straight lines AB can not enclose a space . We are entitled , then , it would seem , to make such judgments as , AB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EB , , etc. ; but we are not entitled to say unconditionally , No two straight lines can enclose a space . For the only warrant we have for our particular judgments is that of particular experiences , and no number of particular experiences can carry us beyond those experiences . A universal judgment is merely a short-hand statement or summary of a number of par ticular judgments , and no summation of particulars can reach the infinite . The precise meaning of the axiom AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . " Two straight lines can not enclose a space , " is , " No two straight lines observed by us have enclosed a space . " But this is not equivalent to the judgment , " No two straight lines can enclose a space . " Generality is not necessity . There is nothing to hinder us from supposing that we might in our observation find two straight lines enclosing a space . Hence the axioms of geometry are not necessary truths , but generalizations from sensible experience . According to Mill , then , the particular judgment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , " is legitimate , but the universal judgment , " Two straight lines can not enclose a space , " is illegimate . It is , in fact , the assumption of the validity of the former which is made the basis for the denial of the latter . We have therefore to ask whether , on Mill 's premises , we are entitled to make even a particular geometrical judgment . It might be pointed out , as a contradiction in Mill 's own theory , that he here assumes the possibility of two sensible lines being straight , whereas he has before maintained that no sensible lines are straight . This objection , however , we shall not press . Let it be granted that sensible lines are observed by us , and are observed to be straight . Now , it must be carefully borne in mind that the question here is not in regard to any sensible lines which may be supposed to exist in nature independently of our observation . Any one who affirms that there are such lines must be prepared to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No doubt there are many things in nature of which we have no knowledge , but if we affirm nature to be constituted in a certain way , we must be able to show that we have a knowledge of how it is constituted . It would therefore seem that the lines // affirmed , to be straight are lines actually present to sense . Obviously such lines can not extend beyond the visible lines perceived . How , then , can we say that the lines AB can not enclose a space ? This would mean , as Mill admits , that they would not meet however far they were produced . But we can not have a perception of sensible lines beyond the point where they cease to be visible . Hence it does not seem that we are entitled to say , The lines AB , if followed out , do not enclose a space , but only that , so far as they have been followed out , they do not enclose a space . Mill is aware of this difficulty , and tries to meet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , yet we can imagine them to be produced beyond the point of vision , and we are sure that the imaginary lines exactly resemble the real ones . No doubt ; but there is no guarantee of reality in imaginary lines if Mill is right in holding all real lines to be objects of sense . If the sensible lines AB are one foot in length , the lines imagined as continuing these are not real , and to show that the latter do not meet tells us nothing in regard to the former . We can not therefore consistently hold that the straight lines AB do not enclose a space ; our judgment must be that the straight lines AB so far as our observation has gone do not enclose a space . When we look more closely , however , we shall find that even this judgment goes further than is warranted by the data on which it rests . Mill evidently assumes that the sensible lines AB are shown to be real properties of objects , accessible to the observation of any one who looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I have no guarantee that two straight lines do not meet beyond the point observed by me , what guarantee // have I that they do not meet beyond the moment of my observation ? It thus appears that my judgment must be still further limited . I must now say , not that two straight lines can not enclose a space , but that these two straight lines , so far as perceived , and so long as perceived , do not enclose a space . For aught I can tell they may take a sudden freak when I am looking the other way , and alter their whole nature . A still further limitation has to be made . When I say that the two lines now before me do not enclose a space , I am tacitly distinguishing between the lines as real and my perception of them . Such a distinction is not possible unless I regard my individual state of the moment as indicating a reality not determined by that state . I can not indeed affirm that the lines in question are as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I must distinguish their appearance from their reality . But if I have no other guarantee for their reality than the sensation of the moment , I can not go beyond that sensation . I am thus limited to the judgment : I have now before my consciousness two straight lines which do not enclose a space . Only one step more has to be taken . Two straight lines as meeting and diverging is a complex image , in which there are at least two elements , the colour of the lines and their direction . But sensation can give only the colour : the direction of the lines , as we have already seen , is a relation involving an act of thought . Exclude this act of thought , and we are reduced to the mere sensation of colour , which is not a possible image at all but merely an element in an image . Thus the subject of the judgment disappears , and with it the whole judgment . // Mill 's theory , then , does not explain even the judgment , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a space , " but is inconsistent with the possibility of any judgment whatever . But if there are no particular judgments , there can of course be no general judgments , which on his doctrine depend upon an inference from particular judgments . The conclusion to which we have been brought confirms the result of our inquiry into the accuracy of geometry . If the assumption that a real line is merely sensible leads to the denial of all judgments , we can not explain even the appearance of knowledge . A flux of sensations , supposing it to be possible , would not yield even the consciousness of the sensations forming the flux , much less the consciousness of any fixed nature in their content . A real line , in other words , is just one of the fixed relations by which perceptible objects are determined . Like all geometrical relations it rests upon the conception of pure externality . When we get at the right point of view it becomes obvious that no geometrical proposition is based upon induction , in Mill 's sense of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a belief generated by repeated experiences of particular lines as not enclosing a space ; it is a necessary proposition implied in the simplest perception . The reason we are apt to think otherwise no doubt is , that in our ordinary experience we make use of universal principles of which we are not explicitly conscious . Take the familiar experience of the two lines in a railway track . We speak of these as parallel to each other , because when we apply a measure at any point we find // that the distance between them is the same . What is implied in this inference ? It is manifestly implied that there is outness between bodies , and that this outness is exactly the same wherever we measure it . Now , this is implicitly the judgment that parallel lines will never meet . We do not come to this conclusion by frequently observing that given parallel lines do not meet , but assuming constancy in the relations of outness , we affirm that these particular lines are parallel . Our direct interest , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the particular objects in question . If we are constructing a railway track , we are concerned to make the lines parallel , not to lay down the principle implied in parallel lines . Thus we seem to be making the merely particular judgment : These lines are parallel . In reality , however , the universal judgment that all equidistant lines are parallel is presupposed , and , if it were not presupposed , the particular judgment would not be true . It is not by accumulating particular judgments about parallel lines that we reach the general judgment ; but the general judgment is implied in each of the particular judgments . Geometry simply states in the form of an explicit judgment the conception implied in every one of the particular judgments . Thus the propositions of geometry are universal , because they explicitly formulate the fixed relation which in the particular judgment is implicit . No induction or accumulation of particular judgments is needed , because the universal principle is already present in the particular judgment . Hence it is not surprising that Mill is at last driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are , properly speaking , universal judgments , but even to resolve particular judgPHILOSOPHY // ments into an association of particular mental states or images . Thus the judgment that two straight lines can not enclose a space , merely means that we have frequently had the experience of the image of two straight lines accompanied by the image of their divergence , while we have never had the experience of such an image accompanied by the image of their enclosure of a space . The fundamental objection to this view is that it assumes as possible what it tacitly affirms to be impossible . If the image of straight lines is possible at all , as it is assumed to be , the image of their enclosure of a space is impossible . This may not prove that there can not be a world in which straight lines enclose a space , but it at least proves that no such world can possibly be an object of our experience . The judgment is therefore not due to an association of images that are independent of one another , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not be conscious of it as other than it is . In other words , every image implies the conception of an unalterable relation in the elements of sense . CHAPTER IV . PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE ( CONTINUED ) . ARITHMETIC AND ALGEBRA . IN his Theory of Numbers Mill has two main objects in view : first , to show that arithmetic and algebra rest upon inductions from sensible observations ; second , to prove that their supposed accuracy and precision arises from their hypothetical character . First . The Science of Numbers rests upon Induction. ? Mill does not here , as in the case of geometry , directly examine the a priori view , which maintains that arith-metic and algebra rest in no way upon sensible observation but upon pure conceptions ; but indirectly he seeks to overthrow it by showing that their only basis is sensible observation . We can easily , if we choose , supply the missing disproof of the a priori view . The a priori philo-sopher , Mill would say , must hold that the proposition z + z = 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is identical with the subject z + 2 ; in other words , that it is impossible to conceive z + 2 as forming anything but 4 . Now to this view Mill would of course answer , that no real proposition can be based upon the inconceivability of the opposite , as has been shown in the case of geometry , for there is nothing to hinder us from supposing that in some other planet 2 +2 might =5 . In fact Mill , when 76 // he is dealing with the question of inconceivability , expressly says that the proposition z + z = 5 is not self-contradictory , since we should " probably have no difficulty in putting together the two ideas supposed to be incompatible , if our experience had not first inseparably associated one of them with the contradictory of the other . " Assuming , then , that the theory of numbers is not an a priori science , it must rest upon inductions from sensible observations . Now this means that it can not be based upon " logical definitions , " i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +1= 3 , if it is a logical definition , merely means that z + r is another name for what is more neatly expressed by the term 3 . This in fact is the view of the nominalists , who maintain that the only real things are individual things , and that the propositions of arithmetic and algebra are but an elaborate system of naming these things . If I see three chairs or three tables , each chair and each table is real ; but when I call them three , I only mean that I give the name three to a group of three tables or a group of three chairs . Now Mill 's objection to this view is , that it virtually denies the theory of numbers to be based upon induction . For , if we are limited to particular observations in this way , there is no transition from the known to the unknown , and therefore no induction . The nominalist therefore denies all general propositions , and thus makes a science of numbers impossible . Mill therefore has to show that arithmetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from particular observations to general propositions . He agrees with the nominalist in holding that the theory of numbers must rest upon particular observations , but he differs in maintaining that // from these particular observations general propositions are derived by a process of inductive inference . What then , he asks , has led the nominalist to suppose that there are no general propositions in regard to numbers , or , in other words , that a general proposition is merely verbal ? The reason is that in arithmetical or algebraic operations we deal with symbols of sensible objects as distinguished from actual sensible perceptions or copies of these in imagination . In geometry we have before us either a sensible figure on paper or on a blackboard , or we form a mental image of a sensible figure ; and thus it is evident that all our reasonings are about real sensible things . But in arithmetic and algebra we have no sensible object , and no image of a sensible object before us , and therefore we do not seem to be dealing with real sensible things at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process but the symbols or names , and hence it is natural to suppose that it is with the symbols or names that he is dealing . If that were the case , there would of course be no induction , for every induction is the process by which we pass from particular observations to a new truth not contained in these observations . Mill must therefore show that in every step of an arithmetical or algebraical calculation there is " a real inference of facts from facts . " Now the word ten represents an actual fact of sensible observation : it really means ten bodies , or ten sounds , or ten beatings of the pulse , and apart from such particular sensible observations the word ten would be meaningless . But the peculiarity of numbers is , that whatever is true of ten bodies is true also of every object of which we can have sensible observation . In this respect arithmetic differs // from geometry ; for such a geometrical proposition as that two straight lines do not enclose a space is true only of lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas the proposition that 2 +1=3 1S true of all sensible objects , since every such object consists of parts which can be numbered . Thus the number one will serve as a representative of any sensible object whatever , and hence the inferences we draw will hold of every such object . Accordingly , arithmetical propositions are based upon inductions from the observation of actual sensible things , and are not merely verbal . There is another thing which gives plausibility to the nominalist view , that the theory of numbers deals only with names : the predicate seems to be identical with the subject . If we take a special case , such as " two pebbles and one pebble are three pebbles , " we seem to be stating , not that the two collections of pebbles are equal in quantity , but that they are precisely the same or identical . But , in point of fact , what is really affirmed is not identity but equality . For what is meant is , that the same objects produce a different set of sensations when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fact which holds good in all cases , we can say quite generally 2 + I =3 . The science of number thus rests upon principles which , like those of geometry , are generalizations from experience . Second . The science of number rests upon inductions which are not exactly true , but true only under the hypothesis that actual sensible objects are what they are assumed to be . In numerical calculations it is taken for granted that the objects numbered are identical as regards quantity . " But this is never practically true , for one 8o AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . actual pound weight is not exactly equal to another , nor one mile 's length to another ; a nicer balance , or more accurate measuring instrument , would always detect some difference . " ( I ) Mill 's first proposition is , that the science of number rests upon induction , i.e. , it contains inferences drawn from sensible observations ; and in seeking to make good this proposition he is led to reject ( a ) the doctrine of the a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from experience , but are self-evident ; and ( b ) the doctrine of the nominalists , who hold that its judgments are purely verbal . Now ( a ) Mill is undoubtedly right in rejecting the doctrine that the truths of arithmetic and algebra are independent of all experience , and can be proved to be so by the logical principle of contradiction , i.e. , by the impossibility of conceiving the opposite . No proposition can be proved to be true on the ground that its opposite is inconceivable . The opposite of every proposition is inconceivable so long as we assume that the proposition is true , but not otherwise . Thus the opposite of the proposition , " Light is due to the transmission of material particles , " is inconceivable so long as we assume the truth of the proposition ; but if we deny its truth , there is no inconceivability in its opposite . Similarly we can not conceive z + I to be-4 , so long as we assume the truth of the proposition , a + I = 3 ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its opposite . It is thus evident that we can not base the truth of a proposition upon its inconceivability , but , contrariwise , the inconceivability depends upon its truth . The opposite of every true // proposition is inconceivable , but not the opposite of a false proposition . The a priori philosophers , therefore , in assuming that the truth of numerical propositions can be established by the inconceivability of their opposite , have really committed themselves to the view that such propositions are mere analyses of conceptions , or , in other words , merely state what is already conceived to be true . But manifestly the question still remains whether the conceptions are really true , and this question can only be solved by showing that real things are as they are conceived to be . ( b ) Mill is also right in rejecting the nominalist doctrine , that the only realities are particular things , and that general propositions are purely verbal . The question is whether his own doctrine can consistently avoid the imperfections of nominalism . Mill evidently assumes that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct from each other , and therefore as numerable , and that the process of induction consists in inferring that all particular things are similarly distinct from each other , and therefore numerable . To this explanation two objections have to be made . In the first place , pure sensation can give no distinction of one thing from another , because , as we saw in the case of geometry , each sensation is a purely individual feeling , and is therefore capable of revealing nothing but itself . It is only in so far as one sensation is discriminated from another that there is any consciousness of distinction . But this discrimination is an act of thought . Hence in the simplest form of knowledge the operation of the distinguishing and relating activity of thought is already implied . Now , number presupposes this activity of thought , and hence it is not correct F // to say that by sense we obtain a knowledge of particular things as distinct from each other , and therefore as numerable . What is called sensible observation already implies the distinguishing activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is implicitly a numerical judgment . But though all perception implies such a judgment , it is only when attention is directed to the quantitative element implied in every such judgment that we form explicit numerical judgments . And , when attention is so directed , we set aside all the qualitative aspects of things and concentrate our thought purely upon their quantitative aspects , or rather upon that quantitative aspect of them in which they are viewed as distinct or discrete , abstracting from all other aspects . The science of number is thus , from its very nature , abstract , i.e. , it sets aside for its purpose all other aspects of the real world except its numerical aspect . Hence the science of number never deals with the concrete objects of perception as concrete ; it does not deal with pebbles and boxes as pebbles and boxes , but only with these in so far as they are identical , i.e. , as discrete units capable of being discriminated from each other , and therefore of being counted . If the objection is raised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it will be no science , but a mere fiction , the answer is that no science deals with real things in their completeness , but only with real aspects of real things , and that number is therefore a science in the same sense as other sciences . Mill 's mistake is in assuming that number must deal either with sensibles or with mere abstractions , whereas it really deals with the sensible as abstract , i.e. , with an abstract but real element of existence . // But , secondly , bearing this in mind we have no difficulty in seeing that number does not rest upon induction , in Mill 's sense of the word . On his view , we must suppose that we have a number of particular observations of sensible things as numerable , and then infer that all sensible things are numerable . For induction , as he explains it , is the process of inference by which we pass from some to all . If this were a true account of the nature of induction , every general proposition would be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justification . For how can we legitimately conclude that all possible sensible things are numerable if our data give us only some sensible things ? Mill , therefore , if he were consistent , would limit himself to particular numerical propositions , and deny that there are any true general propositions , i.e. , he would take the same view as the nominalists . This may be shown in another way , if we consider his admission that 2 + I might make 4 in another planet , for this startling conclusion is just the legitimate inference from his doctrine that all general propositions are in ferences from particular propositions . Here , in fact , he tacitly admits that beyond those particular propositions we have no right to go , and that general propositions are due merely to the illegitimate extension of particular propositions under the influence of association . Mill 's doctrine , then , that number rests upon induction from particular propositions can not be accepted . The true view is , that in the simplest numerical judgment the universal judgment is already implied . For since discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its necessary condition , number is implicit in every act of consciousness . In other // words , we can give no explanation of consciousness at all , and therefore no explanation of a particular numerical judgment , unless we admit that every distinguishable element of consciousness is numerable . The numerical relation of things is therefore shown to be absolutely necessary , because without it there would be no consciousness at all . It is , in other words , a fixed and unchangeable relation of every possible element of reality that each element is not identical with any other element of reality , i.e. , that it must be counted as a unit among other units . In numerical judgments , then , we do not pass from some to all , but in each judgment all is implied . ( 2 ) After what has been said , we need not spend much time upon Mill 's second point , viz. , that the theory of number rests upon a hypothesis which is not strictly true . The hypothesis is , that each unit is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature any two units exactly the same . The whole force of this reasoning evidently rests upon the assumption , that the science of number can be a real science only if its judgments are derived from sensible things . But if , as we have maintained , its aim is to state what holds good of all things only in so far as they are looked at from the point of view of discrete magnitude , the fact that any given object differs in its size or in its weight can not in any way affect the absoluteness of the science of number . And not only so , but no difference in the size or weight of a particular object could be discerned , unless we presupposed the absoluteness of quantitative relations . We could not possibly tell that one pound or one mile was not equal to another pound or another mile , unless the standard of measurement were absolute . There is therefore no // hypothetical element in the mathematical sciences , unless we falsely assume that these sciences formulate the complete nature of things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our knowledge of real things , mathematics is not a hypothetical but a necessary science . CHAPTER V , PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE ( CONTINUED ) . THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES . INDUCTION . WE have seen that , according to Mill , mathematics rests upon sensible observation ; and we naturally expect to find him giving the same explanation of the foundation of other sciences . But first of all he seeks to distinguish the inductive process by which the generalizations of science are reached from various logical processes which are often confounded with it . In the first place , induction is not the mere registration in language of a given number of individual observations . No single observation , and no number of single observations , is an induction , because here there is no inference from the known to the unknown . The observation , that the moon shines by the sun 's light , no one would call an induction ; nor can there be any induction in the successive observations that Mars , Neptune , Saturn , and the other planets each shine by the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations in the proposition , that " all the planets shine by the sun 's light , " we are merely recalling what we already know , not advancing to any new truth . In the second 86 // place , there are certain mathematical propositions which are improperly called inductions ; as , for instance , the proposition that a straight line can not meet any section of a cone in more than two points . And , lastly , the description of a set of observed phenomena is not induction . Thus Kepler , after observing a number of the places successively occupied by the planet Mars , found that when joined together they formed an ellipse . The proposition that Mars described an ellipse was therefore merely the summary of a number of different observations , not the inference to a new truth not contained in those observations ; and hence it can not be called an induction . What , then ; is an induction ? It is defined by Mill as the process by which we infer that what we know to be true in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which resemble the former in certain assignable respects . The " resemblance " may be either ( a ) that of individuals belonging to a class , or ( b ) that of the same individual at different times ; but , in either of these cases , the essence of the induction consists in making a really " general " proposition , i.e. , one which holds good , when we pass from the particular to the universal . Thus , the conclusion that " all men are mortal " is an induction , because we pass from what we know of some men to all men , Similarly , when Kepler inferred that , as the orbit of Mars had hitherto been elliptical , it would always be elliptical , he made a genuine induction . Now , if induction implies in all cases a transition from the particular to the universal , it is naturally asked by what right the transition is made . It is obvious that , in every case of real induction , we tacitly assume that what holds good in the cases observed will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in other words , that the course of nature is uniform . What , then , is the justification of that assumption ? Mill answers that it is itself an instance of induction , and by no means one of the most obvious or the earliest . But , before attempting to prove this , he asks what precisely is meant by the " uniformity of nature . " ( I ) It is obvious that by the uniformity of nature it is not meant to exclude infinite diversity . Nobody expects one day to be the mere repetition of the previous day . Yet there is a natural tendency in the human mind to expect that phenomena which have frequently presented themselves in combination will always recur in the same combination . This method of inductia per enumerationem simplicem is rightly condemned by Bacon . It would be legitimate only if we were certain that we had exhausted all the instances , and such certitude is practically not obtainable . The truth is that induction to be valid does not depend upon the number of instances observed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient in one case , a million may not be enough in other cases . ( a ) If , then , the uniformity of nature does not mean invariability , what is its true meaning ? The first thing to observe is that by the uniformity of nature we should understand a number of uniformities . These uniformities , when reduced to their simplest expression , are called laws of nature . Three such laws are these : ( i ) that air has weight , ( a ) that pressure on a fluid is propagated equally in all directions , ( 3 ) that pressure in one direction , not opposed by equal pressure in the contrary direction , produces motion , which does not cease until // equilibrium is restored . From these three laws or uniformities the rise of mercury in the Torricellian tube might be predicted . But this is not properly a law of nature , but a result of the three laws of nature mentioned . Every true induction is therefore either a law of nature , or a result of laws of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of nature , and to follow them into their results . CAUSATION . Now , laws of nature are of three kinds : they are either ( a ) laws which apply indifferently to synchronous or successive phenomena ; ( b ) laws which hold only of synchronous phenomena ; or ( c ) laws which hold only of successive phenomena . ( a ) The first sort of laws are those of number , which hold whether the phenomena are synchronous or successive . Thus , a + z =4 , whether we are speaking of two coexistent objects or of two events . ( b ) The second set of laws are those contained in geometry , which apply only to coexistent objects . ( c ) The third set of laws are those which express uniformities in the way of succession . It is with these only that we have here to deal . It has already been shown that the laws of number and of geometry are inductions , and the question is as to the inductions which concern the succession of phenomena , or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That principle is causation . The ground of induction , so far as successive phenomena are concerned , is the law of causation , which may be thus stated : " Every fact which has a beginning has a cause . " What , then , is a " cause " ? By a " cause " is to be understood in all cases a // phenomenon , i.e. , a particular fact or event . Whether there are causes which are not themselves phenomena we shall not inquire . There are certain thinkers ( the Cartesians , for example ) who hold that , besides physical causes , there are also efficient causes , i.e. , causes which , without being themselves events , produce events . But , whether there are such causes or not , at any rate these are not at present in question . In affirming that every event has a cause , we are only affirming that every phenomenon in nature is invariably preceded by some other phenomenon . Now , as there are at any given instant many phenomena , each of these is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cause is thus an " invariable antecedent " or " set of antecedents , " an effect , an " invariable consequent . " There are many antecedents or sets of antecedents =A , B , C , D , etc. , and many consequents =a , p , y , S , etc. , and each of these is separate and distinct from the others . To find out such antecedents is to perform an induction , so far as the succession of phenomena is concerned . If there were any event which had no such antecedent , no induction could take place . The universality and certainty of the law of causation is therefore the basis of all induction as to successive phenomena . A cause , then , is an antecedent or set of antecedents . But it seldom , if ever , happens that there is only one antecedent of a given consequent . In ordinary language one of these antecedents is singled out and called the cause , the others being distinguished as conditions . But the real cause is the whole of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequent would not exist . The reason why one antecedent is specially // selected as the cause , is , that it alone is an event , the others being states , which existed prior to the effect , but did not begin to exist immediately prior to it . It thus seems that a cause is the sum of antecedents without which a given event does not take place , but that of those antecedents the greater number are not themselves events . It has to be added that in considering the sum of conditions , we must take into consideration the negative as well as the positive conditions , i.e. , those facts which must be absent if the consequent is to take place . The full definition of cause , therefore , is , " the sum total of the conditions , positive and negative , taken together , upon which the consequent invariably follows . " This view of causation does away with the absolute distinction of agent and patient . A stone falls to the earth , and it is said that the earth acts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as correct to say that the stone attracts the earth , as that the earth attracts the stone . The distinction between agent and patient is purely verbal , since patients are always agents . All the positive conditions of a phenomenon are agents , in the sense that without the whole of them the consequent could not take place . The cause of anything is " the antecedent which it invariably follows , " but it is not " the antecedent which it invariably has followed in our past experience . " The sequence must be not only invariable but unconditional . Hence we may define a cause as " the antecedent , or the concurrence of antecedents , on which a phenomenon is invariably and unconditionally consequent . " It may be admitted that there are cases in which the cause may not be antecedent to an effect , but simul92 AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . taneous with it . But this is a matter of minor importance . To avoid the difficulty , a cause may be defined as " the assemblage of phenomena , which occurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at any rate , never precedes a cause , though perhaps it may be simultaneous with it . Among the causes of phenomena some are permanent , i.e. , have subsisted ever since the human race has been in existence , and for an indefinite time previous . Such are the sun , the earth , and planets , with their various constituents , air , water , and other substances . We can not account for the origin of these causes themselves , nor can we tell why they are distributed as they are , or why they are commingled in certain proportions . These permanent causes are sometimes not objects but recurring events , such as the rotation of the earth . But though we can not trace these causes back to others , all other things or events are the immediate or remote effects of those primeval causes . Hence the state of the whole universe is the consequence of its state at the previous instant , and if any particular state could ever occur a second time all subsequent states would also recur , and history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fact that no two states of the universe are identical . How far can Mill 's account of induction , and especially of that form of induction which consists in the discovery of causes , be accepted ? So far as induction is maintamed to be an inference from some ' to all ' resting upon resemblance , it is inadequate . Induction always consists in the discovery of identity , not of resemblance . It is of // course true that in every instance in which an identity has been discovered there must be resemblance , but the induction is not , and can not be , based upon resemblance . The reason why " all men are mortal " is not that they resemble one another in other ways , and therefore also in the way of " mortality , " but because they are identical in the possession of a body which can not permanently resist the external influences against which it reacts . Certainly , there never is any identity of nature between two things which in no way resemble each other ? for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain respects and different in others ? but the closest resemblance will not entitle us to affirm identity , and without identity there is no induction . Is Mill 's account of causation more satisfactory than his account of reduction ? ( r ) Mill is undoubtedly right in rejecting the conception of a mysterious " power " in one thing to bring another into existence . A body falls to the ground if unsupported , but the earth does not contain within itself any occult " power " by which it draws the stone to itself , nor does the stone contain any occult power of gravitation by which it moves to the earth . The fact is this , that when a body is placed at a certain distance from the earth it begins to move towards the earth at a certain velocity . If it were beyond a certain distance it would not so move . The fact we may state by saying , either that the stone is attracted by the earth , or that the stone falls by its own weight ; but the essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed conditions . Given these conditions and the effect takes place . ( 2 ) Mill , however , goes on to say that a " cause " is an AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . 94 " invariable antecedent " or " set of antecedents , " an effect , an " invariable consequent . " Two questions arise here therefore : I. Is a cause an " antecedent " ? II . Is it an " invariable " antecedent ? I. ( a ) At first sight it seems as if every effect were a consequent , seeing that it is an event or change . But it is to be observed that we can not affirm an event to be a " consequent " merely because it is sequent on something else . No doubt there can be no event that does not imply sequence ; but it is not proved to be a consequent merely because it is an event . To call an event a consequent is to imply that its cause is antecedent to it , or existed prior to it . But this assumes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , in the course of his inquiry , Mill admits that a cause may not be antecedent to its effect , though he says that the point is of little or no importance . Whether it is of importance or not , it at least compels us to revise the first definition which Mill gives of cause . We can no longer say that a cause is an " invariable antecedent " : we must now say that a cause is that which invariably precedes or accompanies a certain event , an effect that which invariably follows or accompanies its cause . ( b ) Can we accept this revised definition ? It is obvious that it presupposes a separation between cause and effect , such that each is an independent phenomenon , not depending for its reality upon the causal relation . Whether the phenomenon or sum of phenomena called the cause precedes or accompanies the phenomenon called the effect , the one exists apart from the other . Thus , the formation of water is one phenomenon , and the bringing together of oxygen and hydrogen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather sum of phenomena . Here the cause seems to precede the effect . Again , fire is the cause of warmth , but the fire is one phenomenon and the warmth is another , though here the cause and the effect seem to be simultaneous , not successive . If , however , we look more closely , we shall find , I think , that the supposed distinction and independence of cause and effect can not be maintained . Take the case of the formation of water . It is true that oxygen and hydrogen may exist as separate phenomena , and that as long as they are separate they are distinct from water . But oxygen and hydrogen in their separation are not the cause of water . As Mill himself points out , the cause is the sum total of the conditions . Hence oxygen and hydrogen must be brought together before they can be the cause of the formation of water . When do they become the cause ? Only at the moment when the formation of water takes place . Obviously , therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least be simultaneous with it . But is even this account correct ? What has become of the hydrogen and oxygen at the moment when the water is formed ? They have ceased to be hydrogen and oxygen , and become water . In other words , the formation of water is precisely the same fact as the union of oxygen and hydrogen ; i.e. , the cause neither precedes nor accompanies the effect but is identical with it . Thus in discovering the cause of the event we are simply discovering an identical relation . The difference between a cause and an effect is not the difference between one phenomenon and another , but consists in the discovery of the fixed nature of the one single fact or phenomenon . Take the other instance of fire and heat . Nothing seems to be more certain than that we have here two distinct phenomena . The fire does not cease to exist because no one feels its heat ; the heat does not at once cease when one is out of range of the fire . Thus the cause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only externally related to each other . But here again it must be observed that the fire is not a cause of heat except in so far as heat is actually produced . Not only so , but , as Mill himself tells us , the cause is the sum of conditions without which the effect could not take place . Now among these conditions the sensitive organization of the subject is indispensable . There is no sensation of heat in any but a living being . The cause of heat is thus the excitation of the living organism , under certain physical conditions . But the excitation of the living organism is the sensation of heat , i.e. , the cause is simply the effect resolved into its constituent elements or conditions . Wherever these conditions are present , heat exists ; in other words , heat is a fixed relation obtaining between distinguishable phenomena . And as there is no meaning in saying that the relation called the cause precedes or accompanies the relation called the effect , the cause neither precedes nor accompanies the effect , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be shown that every instance of causation is the apprehension of a fixed relation . II . If then a cause is identical with an effect , it is plain that we can not say that a cause invariably precedes , or even that it invariably accompanies , its effect . What then is the meaning of " invariable " ? It can only mean necessary or universal . Hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of two to one necessarily form water , because their union is involved in the unchanging constitution of things . That it is so is a fact , and a fact grasped , not by sensible observation , but by thought . There is no difference in principle between the chemical law , H2O , and the geometrical proposition that the interior angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles . The one fact is as necessary as the other . This is virtually admitted by Mill when he tells us that a cause is not only " invariable " but " unconditional " ; for " unconditional ' ' can only mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore belonging to the unchangeable nature of things . A cause , then , is neither an invariable nor an unconditional antecedent , but an unchangeable fact . Mill says that the distinction of agent and patient is purely verbal , since the patient is in all cases an agent , in the sense of being one of the antecedents . It would be more correct to say , that the whole distinction of agent and patient is false . When a stone falls to the earth , neither the stone nor the earth can be regarded as agents . This way of looking at the matter supposes that the stone and the earth have each a separate and independent existence , and that each would be what it is even if the other did not exist . Now , it is of course true that the whole nature of the earth is not exhausted in its relation to the stone , or the whole nature of the stone in its relation to the earth . But when we are seeking for the cause of the fall of the stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stone except the fact of the motion of each towards the other . The fact to be explained is therefore purely the approximation of a body of a certain mass to another G // of a much greater mass , and this fact stated in its precision constitutes the cause . The cause is discovered when it is seen that bodies move towards each other ( unless there is some negative or counteracting condition ) in proportion to their mass and inversely as the square of their distance . This is a fixed relation , and therefore it applies in all cases . But as it is a relation , there can be no more meaning in calling either of the masses the agent or the patient than in calling either the antecedent of the other . Neither , taken by itself , is a cause or an effect ; the cause is the relation between the two masses viewed as unchangeable , and the effect is the same relation viewed as manifested in the particular movement of the one towards the other at a certain rate . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession to establish causal connection . If Mill were right in saying that a cause is an " invariable antecedent , " all invariable antecedents ought to be causes . But , if a cause is never an antecedent , we at once understand why we distinguish invariable succession from causal connection . Night and day have invariably succeeded each other in all human experience , but the one is never supposed to be the cause of the other . The reason is that they are not related as cause and effect , but as distinct facts , each having its own cause . The conditions under which night occurs are as unchangeable as those under which day occurs , but they are not identical , and therefore the one is not the cause or the effect of the other . Each involves an identity , but it is a different identity . The last distinction drawn by Mill is between permanent and changeable causes . The sun , the earth , the planets // are permanent causes , as also the rotation of the earth ; the phenomena of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the origination of living beings . In drawing this distinction Mill has gone entirely beyond the question of causation and has introduced a new problem . All that causation tells us , is , that no event occurs which does not imply fixity of conditions : that wherever the same conditions exist the same event must occur ; but it does not tell us that the same conditions have always existed , or will always exist . Thus , if living beings with an organism so differentiated as to have the senses of sight , hearing , taste , smell , and touch exist , the sensations relative to their senses will occur according to fixed laws ; but it by no means follows that such beings have always existed or always will exist . The causes of sensation are therefore not permanent in the sense of continuing through all time : they are only permanent in the sense that they are always the same when they occur . But the same holds good of what Mill calls permanent causes . No doubt the earth existed prior to the appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were causes which took the form of the relations of material masses to one another , before there were causes which took the form of the relations implied in the sensations of living beings . Whether material masses have always existed the law of causation can not determine : that is a question which takes us beyond the point of view of causation , and compels us to ask what is the ultimate condition of the existence of any reality . Scientific men are therefore justified in refusing to say whether the material world did or did not begin to be , and limiting themselves to an investigation of the conditions of particular facts . Ioo AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . leaving the question of the ultimate explanation of reality to philosophy . The distinction of permanent and nonpermanent causes is therefore irrelevant and misleading . Since every cause is on its particular side an event , no cause can be permanent ; and as every cause on its universal side is a fixed relation or unchangeable fact , in whatever sense one cause is permanent all are permanent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , or the totality of relations constituting these events , i.e. , the system of relations constituting nature as a whole . But what is the ultimate condition of there being such a system or whole we can not tell without going beyond the conception of causality . CHAPTER VL PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE ( CONTINUED ) . BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE . WE have now dealt with two of the three philosophical problems that arise in regard to the knowledge of nature : we have inquired into the nature of mathematical and of physical knowledge , and we have found that in both cases alike knowledge rests upon the discovery of certain fixed relations implied in the very constitution of the world as known to us . Our next step is to ask whether our knowledge of nature is exhausted in the apprehension of mathematical and physical relations , or whether there are not certain facts which force us to employ a different conception of things . That there are such facts seems to be implied in the distinction between organic and inorganic beings , between living things and things without life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense seems to be one of the most obvious and certain , has been denied , and that from two opposite points of view . According to one set of thinkers there is no absolute distinction between organic and inorganic beings , for all the facts of life can be explained In the same way Iot // as we explain the changes which take place in the material world . If we adopt this view , obviously no conception but that of mechanical causation will be required . Another set of thinkers take exactly the opposite view , maintaining that , instead of saying that organic beings are in no way different in their nature from inorganic beings , we ought to say that inorganic beings are of the same nature as organic ; in other words , though there seem to be objects which are entirely destitute of life , this is an illusion : all things are living , and nowhere in the whole world can there be found beings which are inorganic . It is therefore maintained that the conception of mechanical causation is not the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these two sets of thinkers may be expressed by saying that the former " level down , " and the latter " level up " ; the one class reduce organic beings to the level of inorganic , the other class raise inorganic beings to the level of organic . In the presence of such opposite views , it is obvious that we can not assume the popular distinction between organic and inorganic beings , but must first deal with the preliminary question , whether such a distinction is justifiable at all . On the other hand , supposing it to be proved that the characteristic phenomena of living beings can not be explained by the conception of mechanical causation , I do not think that we need encumber ourselves with the question , whether even those things which seem to be inorganic are not in reality organic . Our problem , then , is this . Is there anything in the nature of those beings ordinarily distinguished as living or organic , which compels us to apply to them a conception different from that which we employ in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a biological as distinguished from a physical knowledge of nature ? or is biology simply a branch of physics ? DEFINITION OF LIFE . If we direct our attention to beings usually distinguished as living , can we state wherein their life consists ? Mr. Spencer defines life as " the power of continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations . " This definition is so far true , that it emphasizes one aspect of the living being , viz. , that it is perpetually going through changes which do not leave it unaltered , but involve new relations to its environment . Thus the living being in one point of view exhibits a great degree of instability . It is continually changing , and the more complex the being , the greater is the number of changes through which it passes in a given time . Mr. Spencer 's definition , however , implies that the living being not only changes , but that there is a series of adjustments to new conditions . The relations of a stone to things external to itself are of a comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than mechanical and chemical relations . After the lapse of an indefinite time it displays the same essential features as at the first . It is otherwise with the living being , which not only exhibits relations to external circumstances , but presents continually new relations from moment to moment . So far therefore , we may regard Mr. Spencer 's definition as true . But there is one aspect of life which it does not sufficiently accentuate . For not only does the living being display continual adjustment in its relations to the environment , changing as they change , but it preserves its unity through all the changes which it undergoes . External forces are // perpetually acting upon it , and threatening to destroy its unity , but so long as life continues the being recovers its unity . Thus a living being is a unity in a different sense from that in which we can speak of the unity of a stone . The unity of a stone consists in the fixed unchanging identity of the mechanical forces by which its parts are held together : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains itself by continuous adaptation to external forces which it can not avoid . In other words , life implies not only adjustment to external relations , but the persistence of unity or individuality . We may therefore define life as the principle by which a being maintains its individuality by a continuous adaptation to external conditions . Now , the unity or individuality of a living being is dependent upon the organization of its parts . If we break up a stone into parts , each part retains the same properties as it had prior to the separation . A living being , or at least a living being which exhibits a definite organization , can not be thus broken up into parts without losing its character as a living being . If a limb is severed from the body , it ceases to display the function which it possessed when it formed part of the body . Hence its function does not belong to it in its isolation from the other parts , but only in its relation to them . And this is true of every part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to the individuality of the being by asking what is incapable of being severed from the whole without losing its characteristic function . A hand can not grasp , an eye can not see , an ear can not hear , ' the lungs can not breathe , the heart can not beat , unless the hand , the eye , the ear , the lungs , the heart , form parts of one individual unity . It is not the mere juxtaPHILOSOPHY // position of the parts which determines the unity of the living being , but a union so close and intimate that none can be what it is apart from its relation to all the rest . Now , this mutual dependence of parts as regards their functions is what we mean by organization . An organism is a union of parts , but the parts are what they are only in their relations to one another , and hence we say that each part is an organ of the whole . That this conception of an organic unity is the basis of our distinction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that where there is little differentiation of organs , we find it hard to say whether there is one being or several . The lowest form of animal is simply a mass of tissue , with no distinction of head and foot , digestive and nervous system . Such a being we regard as living at all mainly because it has the capacity of assimilating material , and loses this capacity when it dies . But though there is thus in it a certain unity of parts which cooperate in securing an end , the unity is of such an external character that a part will perform the same function as the whole . Such a being may be cut into parts , and the parts still have life . On the other hand , we find that the greater the division of labour between the parts , the closer is the relation by which the parts are bound together in the unity of the whole . Thus the differentiation of the organism is correlative to its integration . This principle is displayed even in beings which have a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog , the spinal cord or the lower part of the brain is capable of discharging functions which in higher animals are devolved upon the higher part of the brain . Thus the more truly individual a being is , the Io6 AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . greater is the complexity of its organs , and the more highly specialized their functions . There is another characteristic which distinguishes living beings from other objects : not only are they organized individuals , with the faculty of self-maintenance by adaptation to changing external conditions , but they produce other individuals of the same general type as themselves . Now , if living beings have the power of adaptation to external conditions , and if they exhibit such an organization of parts as tends to their own maintenarnce , and the maintenance of their species , it seems as if we were forced to apply to them a different conception from that which was adequate so long as we were viewing the world from the purely physical point of view . For a being which not only passes through changes , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , it would seem , be properly understood without the conception of final cause . The conception of causality as employed in the physical sciences does not require us to say more than that there are certain fixed conditions under which all the changes in the world take place . The conception of final cause adds that , in the case of living beings at least , those fixed conditions are of such a nature that they are subservient to an end . Thus the conception of external causation tells us that under certain conditions there arises the sensation of light ; the conception of final cause affirms that this sensation of light subserves the preservation of the sentient being for whom it exists . If this is so , we must widen our conception of the world by saying that it not only implies unchanging mathematical relations and unchanging physical relations , but also unchanging biological relations . In other words , not only // is the world a connected system , but it is an organic system . For , if the living being has the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these conditions must be of such a nature as to admit of such self-adaptation . The world must therefore be conceived as an organic whole , in which each part is related to all the other parts , i.e. , the world must be conceived from a teleological , and not from a mechanical point of view . Accordingly , the physical as well as the mathematical sciences must be regarded as true only in so far as they express what holds good of the world from their limited point of view . Just as there are no separate lines or figures in nature , so there can be no separate objects which are purely mechanical . It may be said , however , and indeed it has been said , that , while the teleological view of the world has much plausibility so long as we suppose living beings to form separate and distinct species , this plausibility vanishes when we find that they have all originated in a purely natural and therefore mechanical way . In other words , it is maintained that the theory of development , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , and hence we must regard the conception of mechanical causation as the ultimate view of things . We must , therefore , ask whether the theory of development confirms , or casts doubt upon , the conclusions reached independently of it . THE DARWINIAN THEORY . As stated by Darwin himself , the theory of development assumes that there is a line of demarcation between organic and inorganic beings ; and no attempt is made to derive SOS AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . the former from the latter . What Darwin maintained in his Origin of Species was , that all living beings have been derived from " one or more primordial forms " ; but these " primordial forms " he regarded as themselves living . What Darwin denied was the older biological doctrine that certain animals are clearly distinguishable by peculiarities of form , size , colour , etc. , and produce offspring that closely resemble their parents , these peculiarities being permanent . Thus , the rook and the crow were regarded as distinct species , because ( I ) they differ from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because ( 2 ) rooks always produce rooks , and crows crows , and they do not interbreed . It was therefore supposed that all existing crows were descended from a single pair of crows , and all the rooks from a single pair of rooks . How the primitive pairs were formed was a " mystery . " In opposition to this view , Darwin maintains that " species are not immutable , but that those belonging to what are called the same genera ( e.g. , the crow and the rook ) are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species , in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species . " There are two fundamental principles which explain how species have originated . In the first place , all living beings multiply in a geometrical progression . In the second place , the offspring differ slightly from the parents , though generally they closely resemble them . ( I ) Now , it is impossible that all the beings born into the world should live , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence arises a struggle for existence , resulting in the extinction , on an average , of as many as survive . They kill one another , they starve // one another , and the forces of nature carry many of them off . Which of them survive ? Naturally , those that are stronger , or swifter , or hardier , or more cunning . " The fittest always survive " ? not necessarily the strongest , but those which have some peculiarity that enables them to escape destruction . ( z ) There is also another principle at work , the principle of heredity or transmission of variations . In the case of plants or domestic animals , we can improve the stock by carefully selecting the best seed and the finest animals . After a time they may have so improved that it is hard to recognize them as identical with the primitive stock . So , in a state of nature , the beings that have some peculiarity that gives them a superiority in the struggle for existence , survive ; but when this variation is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new quality or modification more favourable to their continuance will gradually displace the old . It is in this way that new species originate . The general conclusion reached by such considerations is , that all plants and animals have been gradually evolved from " one or more primordial forms . " This doctrine , however , is applied not only to plants and the lower animals , but to man . The most superficial examination of man 's body shows that it agrees in all essential features with the bodies of other mammalia . " Every detail of structure which is common to the mammalia as a class is found also in man , while he only differs from them in such ways and degrees as the various species or groups of mammals differ from one another . " Now , if it is reasonable to conclude that all mammalia originally descended from some primitive type , are we not compelled rro AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . to suppose that man also must trace his origin back to that type ? Granting that man has originated in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that as an animal he must be classed with other animals : the question arises whether his mental and moral faculties have also been derived by gradual modification and development from the lower animals . Now , in his Descent of Man , Darwin does not say in express terms that the spiritual nature of man has been derived from the lower animals , " in the same manner and by the action of the same general laws as his physical structure " ; but the whole of his argument tends to that conclusion . " The rudiments of most , if not all the rnental and moral faculties of man can be detected in some animals . They exhibit curiosity , imitation , attention , wonder , and memory ; they display kindness to their fellows , pride , contempt , and shame . " Some are held to possess a mdimentary language , because they utter several different sounds , each of which has a definite meaning to their fellows or to their young ; others possess the rudiments of arithmetic , because they seem to count and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They seem to have some sense of beauty , and certain animals are said to have imagination , because they appear to be disturbed by dreams . Even an approach to religion is said to be exhibited in the deep love and complete submission of a dog to his master . Again , if we compare the lowest races of man with the higher animals , we find that the mental and moral qualities of the former are very little higher than those of the latter . In the lowest savages there is not a distinct moral sense , but merely certain social instincts PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE  --  BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE . I1I which develop through circumstances into a moral sense . Those actions which are regarded as contrary to the interests of the tribe excite its disapprobation and are held to be immoral ; those actions which as a rule are beneficial to the tribe meet with its approval , and are considered moral . Naturally , the individual has a feeling of satisfaction when he acts so as to gain general approbation , and of discomfort when he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these feelings originates his consciousness of right and wrong . Conscience arises from the struggle between the desire to do what will benefit oneself and injure others , and the desire to obtain the general approbation of the tribe . The social instincts are thus the foundation of morality . Now , you will observe that in this argument two things are implied : firstly , that there has been a continuous development of intellectual and moral faculties , from the lower animals up to savages , and from savages up to civilized man ; and secondly , that this development may be explained by the same law of natural evolution that has been employed to account for the natural descent of man from lower forms of being . It will therefore be well to point out clearly the distinction between these two things . Let us ask , therefore , What is the precise nature and value of the proof that man has descended from the lower animals , granting that proof to be as irresistible as scientific men usually suppose it to be ? I do not propose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers in support of the natural descent by inheritance of all living beings from one or more primitive forms . Even if I were competent to give an authoritative opinion on that question , II2 AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . it would not be my place to do it . I shall therefore assume , with the majority of scientific men , that as a matter of fact the old doctrine of the immutability of species is false , and that in the principle of natural evolution we have found the true explanation of the phenomena of organized existence . In other words , we must , in my opinion , be prepared to accept the extension of natural law to living beings . On this view , natural evolution is in the organic world very much what gravitation is in the sphere of the inorganic . What I wish you to consider is , whether , accepting the theory of development as the only tenable explanation of the characteristics and changes of living beings , we have reached an ultimate explanation , or whether we have only solved a subordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt that the principle of natural evolution , as conceived by biologists , is inconsistent with the conception that any organ or organism has been specially constructed with the design of performing a particular function . Paley , in his celebrated argument from design , compares the various organs of a living being to the parts of a watch . Just as the watch is put together by the watchmaker so as to fulfil the purpose of showing the time , so the organs of a living being have been constructed by the supreme Artificer in order to secure its existence and well-being . The same adaptation of means to ends is exhibited , he argues , in such an organ as the eye , which has been constructed with the express purpose of enabling the individual to see . This argument therefore rests upon the idea that the // organs of living beings have been specially designed to subserve a particular purpose . Now , this conception of design is not consistent with the doctrine of natural evolution . It assumes that the peculiar adjustment of organisms and organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to the hypothesis of an artificer external to them , who specially adapted them to their environment . It assumes , in other words , that in the ordinary operation of natural law there is nothing to account for the peculiar character of living beings . For the whole force of the argument lies in this , that there is nothing in the nature of living beings themselves , or in the action of circumstances upon them , to explain the wonderful adjustment of the one to the other . It is because the operation of natural law does not explain the adaptation of an organism to its environment that recourse is had to the conception of an external designer . Just as the parts of a watch would never come together as they are found in the watch , unless they were brought together and arranged by the watchmaker : so the organs of a living being would never come together spontaneously without the special interposition of a designing intelligence external to them . But this is exactly what Darwin denies . He refuses indeed to say how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in existence ? whether by " special creation " or by evolution from non-living things ? but , in regard to the adaptation of all subsequent beings to external conditions , he maintains that the operation of the law of natural evolution explains the facts quite irrespective of any hypothesis of special design . A teleologist like Paley would say that an organism H // exists because it was made for the conditions in which it is found ; the Darwinian , that " an organism exists because , out of many of its kind , it is the only one which has been able to persist in the conditions in which it is found . " 1 The ordinary teleologist would say that cats have been made in order to catch mice ; the Dar-winian , that cats exist because they catch mice well . The effect of the Darwinian theory therefore is to exclude from the realm of science all explanation by final causes , and to bring the organic world like the inorganic , under the sway of inviolable law . Nor can there be any doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of the other sciences , which have discarded the hypothesis of the special interposition of supernatural agency , and have sought only to find out the fixed laws according to which phenomena occur . Darwinism , then , seeks to show , firstly , that each living being is fitted for some external conditions , not because it has been externally and artificially constructed for the purpose of living under those conditions , but because it would not have existed at all had it not possessed naturally the organs essential to such existence . Secondly , it explains the existence of all the varieties of living beings , and more particularly the " wonderful development of the highest , by means of the action and reaction between the environment and the simplest organic forms . " 1 do not think that any fruitful results in philosophy are to be obtained by attempting to reinstate the conception of external design . Our problem rather is this : granting that the Darwinian theory has made it impossible for us any longer to hold to the idea of the external // and artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must we not seek for a new and higher conception of the relation of the various parts of the universe to one another , and more particularly of the various organized beings to their environment ? This is , in fact , the special problem of philosophy as distinguished from science . Science is content to start from the assumed independent existence of individual objects , and to treat them as if they were only externally related to one another . This assumption , however , philosophy can not allow to pass without criticism , but goes on to ask whether there is not a principle of unity which explains the differences of things by showing that they all belong to one intelligible system . In examining the view of Comte , that knowledge is limited to particulars , I tried to show that such a doctrine is inconsistent with the nature of knowable existence . All things that can be observed are related to one another by the fact that they exist in space . We can therefore say , that no sensible object can possibly be known that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question therefore arises , whether we are not compelled to hold that all living beings in like manner belong to a single system of things , and whether , therefore , we are not forced to return to a teleological conception of the world if we are to bring the theory of development into harmony with the rest of our knowledge . I shall begin by pointing out some of the presuppositions with which the theory starts ; and I shall then inquire whether those presuppositions do not take us beyond the theory , and compel us to regard the universe from a teleological point of view . I16 AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . In the first place , the theory assumes that the laws of inorganic nature are inviolable . The environment , to which living beings must conform on pain of extinction , involves all the ordinary laws of dynamics , physics , and chemistry . Now , these laws rest upon such principles as the indestructibility of matter , the equality of action and reaction , the affinity of elements for each other . The first of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensible properties of things , the quantity of their matter is unchangeable . When a piece of wood is burned , it changes in its sensible properties , but its weight remains the same . So if one body impinges upon another , both alter their position , but the total quantity of energy is the same . Two chemical elements will combine only if they have an affinity for each other , and this affinity is not a mere accident but belongs to the very constitution of the elements . Secondly , the Darwinian theory assumes that in each living being there is a tendency or impulse to maintain itself , and to continue its species . This is implied in the " struggle for existence , " which is the main principle of the whole doctrine . Unless living beings possessed the impulse towards self-maintenance , and the impulse to continue their species , there would be no struggle for existence . In the very nature of living beings , there is therefore implied a purposive tendency . It is true that the impulse can only be realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not account for the facts unless we also presuppose the tendency to self-maintenance and race-maintenance . Thirdly , the theory also assumes that the variations in the several parts of the living being are consistent // with the impulse to self-maintenance and race-maintenance . For however strong that impulse might be , it would be powerless unless the being by inheritance possessed the organs enabling it to maintain itself under the external conditions in which it is placed . These three assumptions , then , are clearly implied in 6e doctrine of evolution . If the laws of inorganic nature were not constant , there could be no continuous development of living beings . If living beings had no impulse to self-maintenance , there would be no struggle to live under given external conditions . And , lastly , if the were no law of inheritance by which offspring resembled their parents and yet varied slightly from them , there would be no development of organisms exhibiting an ever more perfect correlation of parts . Now , I think it may be shown that these assumptions , when we ask what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world is a system , or , in other words , that we can not explain existence apart from some form of teleology . It is virtually assumed by Darwin that a denial of teleology in the sense in which Paley affirmed it is the same thing as a denial of teleology in any sense . This , however , does not seem to me to follow . On the contrary , Ithe more clearly we see that no species of living being has been directly formed for a special set of circumstances , the more manifest it becomes that between the inorganic and the organic world there is so close a connection that the one can not exist without the other . No doubt , if we look at a particular set of circumstances and a particular species of living being , there seems to be no connection except a purely accidental one . Plants that happen to be well armed with spines or hairs may ITS A.N OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY , escape being devoured ; a much stronger plant without this accidental advantage may perish . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall we not have to say that in the construction of the other species there was a failure in foresight ? At first sight it therefore seems as if there were no adaptation between the environment and the organism except what is accidental . If an organism happens to possess a peculiarity that gives it an advantage in the struggle for existence it survives , if not it dies ; but the law of inheritance by which the advantageous peculiarity arises seems to have no necessary relation to external conditions , but to be purely accidental . - . But , when we look more closely , we shall find , I think , that the connection between the organism and the environment can not be called accidental , For ( r ) if there were no harmony whatever between an organism and its environment , the organism could not exist at all . Before a being can live , there must be a certain adjustment of the external conditions t the internal ; death , in fact , arises when that adjustment is no longer possible . Even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessarily a certain degree of harmony between them and the conditions in which they are found . The struggle for existence is a struggle le to maintain the initial harmony . But , because in some organisms the capacity of adaptation to given conditions is made possible by a peculiar feature not found i others , the harmony of organism and environment is maintained and the being lives and grows . To suppose , therefore , that there is no harmony between living beings and external conditions is to suppose that life is impossible ; in other words , it is to contradict the fact from which the // development theory starts . The relation between the inorganic and the organic world is therefore not an accidental relation , but one that is implied in the very existence of the organic world . Now , if this is true , we can no longer oppose the organic to the inorganic world as if they were two independent spheres of existence , only externally and accidentally connected ; we must , on the contrary , regard them as belonging to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance that some living beings are incapable of continuous adjustment to the external conditions , and others succeed in effecting an adjustment : it is a matter of necessity . Were the external conditions totally different from what they are , living beings could not exist : that they do exist is sufficient evidence of an essential harmony between them and the conditions of their existence . What the development theory really proves is , not that the relation of organized beings to their environment is a purely accidental one , but that the adjustment is in the case of many living beings imperfect , and ultimately in all . ( 2 ) We have seen that the theory implies in each living being an impulse to maintain itself . If this were absent there would be no struggle for existence . Hence we can not regard the relation of organic beings to the environment as the mere action of the environment on the organism , but we must add that the tendency to selfmaintenance and to race-maintenance is an essential factor in the case . That is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their very existence implies a tendency to continue their own existence and the existence of their species . It is true that this tendency is in many individuals never realized , on account of an imperfect relation between the organism and the environment ; but it is not less true , that while the individual is sacrificed , the tendency to self-maintenance is actually realized on the whole . Thus , while the world is not fitted for the realization of the impulse to self-maintenance in every individual , it is fitted for the existence and perpetuation of life on the whole . We can no longer hold that each living being , or even each species , has been specially constructed with a view to its existence under certain definite external conditions ; but we can say , that between organic and inorganic things as a whole there is a necessary harmony . This becomes even clearer if we consider ( 3 ) That living beings have not only a tendency to se lf  - -  maintenance , but a tendency to organization . This t end  - -  ency to organization is explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduces itself with slight va riations in its offspring , and that those living beings which possess a variation harmonious with the external conditions of existence survive , and , reproducing their type with a new variation , give rise to a form of being having a still more perfect capacity of adjustment to the environment . Now , it is true that this mode of explanation is inconsistent with the idea of an external construction of a certain type of organism out of a preexistent material ; for , in the living being itself is found the variation which accounts for its adaptation to the environment . But this only shifts the problem , and forces us to ask what is meant by this hereditary tendency to variation . If there were no such tendency , there would be no possibility of development , since that tendency is essential to the existence of certain forms , and to the gradual development of higher forms . While , therefore , the relation of organism and environment is incompatible with the perpetuation of certain forms , it is compatible with others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very incompatibility of lower forms with the conditions of existence that explains the development of higher forms . If the simplest and lowest forms of life were better adapted to the environment than the more complex and higher forms , there could have been no evolution of the higher out of the lower . It is just because some beings are less adapted to the environment than others that a perpetual development of higher forms has taken place . The environment , in other words , is opposed to the continued existence of lower forms of being and harmonious with the continued existence of higher forms . Thus the idea of purpose comes back in another and higher form . It is now seen to be implied in the very nature of existence , not to be something external and arbitrary . The organic forms with the inorganic world a systematic unity in which every part is related to every other . We find , in fact , in the evolution of living beings , the same unifying principle that is at work in the inorganic world , only that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the latter . The parts of a stone , e.g. , seem to be only externally related to one another . Break it up and there is in the stone no tendency to a restoration of the unity that has been destroyed . In the living being , on the contrary , there is a perpetual conflict with external forces , resulting , as we have seen , in the development of ever higher forms of life . Hence it is that , in life , as Kant said , the idea t22 AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . of purpose first clearly presents itself . Apart from the tendency to organization and unity , there is no life ; and this tendency , in its widest sweep , is exhibited in the gradual ascent of life from its simplest to its most complex forms . The higher a being is , the greater is its power of adaptation , and the more perfect its unity . CHAPTER VH . RELATIONS OF BIOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY . WE find , therefore , that , when it is interpreted from the philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that organized existence exhibits the continual evolution of living beings towards a more and more perfect form of unity ; in other words , it implies that the form of existence is necessarily ruled by the idea of unity , and is a realization of unity . And this is the same as saying that the world is in no sense a product of chance or of external necessity , but must be conceived from the point of view of immanent teleology . I am well aware that many objections may be raised to this conclusion , and these we shall afterwards have to consider . At present my aim merely is to indicate in general the point of view from which , as I think , the question must be regarded . Assuming , then , that the world is in no sense given over to chance , or , in other words , that it constitutes a systematic unity in which every element is striving towards a definite end , we have next to ask what is the ultimate nature of this unity ; we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world implies or does not imply intelligence . It is 123 I2 ? AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . one thing to say that the world is a unity and exhibits in its changes a continual tendency towards a more perfect unity , and it is another thing to say that this unity and tendency to perfection necessarily implies intelligence . It may even be plausibly argued , that as the teleological conception of existence implies absolute fixity in the relations of things , or , in other words , the reign of inviolable law , there is no necessity for the hypothesis of intelligence at all . This is the question which lies at the basis of all philosophy , and we must give our best efforts towards its solution . The only satisfactory answer will consist in the whole system of philosophy , but some preliminary idea of it may be given now . We have seen that Darwin not only traces the physical descent of man down from some primitive form of living being , but he seems to find in the principle of natural evolution a sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole tenor of his thought in the Descent of Maya is that the great gulf supposed to be fixed between man and the animals can not be shown to exist . If , therefore , we can explain all the characteristics of the animals by the principle of natural evolution , why should we not also explain in the same way all the characteristics of man ? Here , then , two main propositions are asserted or implied by Darwin : first , that man as regards mental qualities differs from the animals only in degree , not in kind ; second , that the mental qualities of both man and the animals may be accounted for by the law of natural evolution . Can these two propositions be maintained ? Now , it is asserted or implied that the mental qualities of man are generically identical with those of the animals : // Darwin brings man and the animals closer together , first , by lifting up the animals , and , second , by lowering man . ( a ) The higher animals , he contends , exhibit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. , curiosity , wonder , memory , imagination ; some possess a rudimentary mathematics , language , aesthetics , morality , and religion . We must , therefore , correct our preconception that the animals are destitute of intelligence . The facts show that they possess in an elementary form all that has hitherto been supposed to be distinctive of man . ( b ) On the other hand , we must recognize that man in his lowest stage of development is very little superior in mental qualities to the most developed of the animals . The savage has social instincts which bind him to his fellows , but the same instincts are exhibited by the higher animals . The difference between the highest animal and the savage is no greater , if even so great , as that between the savage and the civilized man . Now , the difference between the civilized man and the savage is only one of degree , and , by parity of reasoning , the difference between the higher animals and the savage must also be one of degree . The general conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals is found the same kind of intelligence as in man , just as their organism differs from man 's only in its being less developed . There is no break in the continuity of development : the high intelligence of civilized man has come out of the low intelligence of the savage , as the latter has been evolved from the still lower intelligence of the animals . Man used to be defined as a " rational animal , " and it was supposed that " rationality " differentiated him from the lower animals . This definition I26 AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . we must now extend to other beings besides man , and we must say that " all animals are rational . " Now , it is not my intention to dispute the facts upon which Darwin bases his view of the essential identity in mental as in bodily powers of man and the animals . There can , I think , be no doubt that the higher animals exhibit qualities that must be regarded as implying an elementary intelligence . Granting this , I propose to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done . If , in the animals nearest to man , we find traces of a rudimentary intelligence , must we not expect to find in less developed animals traces of an intelligence still more rudimentary ; nay , must we not hold that even plants exhibit intelligence in a still more rudimentary form ? Nor does it seem possible to stop here . Following out the same line of thought , must we not go still further back , and look for inchoate intelligence even in inorganic things ? This is the direction in which many men of science have recently gone . It is a revival , in a new form , of a doctrine that was advanced in his day by Leibnitz . Perhaps , therefore , it may help to clear the way , if we first consider the Leibnitzian theory of the essential identity of all forms of existence . THE MONADS OF LEIBNITZ . Every real thing is held by Leibnitz to be an individual substance , or , in other words , to have a unique existence of its own , separating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the universe is made up of an infinite number of distinct individuals , which , like crystal spheres , are exclusive of one another and mutually repellent . The universe is therefore a collection of separate individuals , // not an organic unity , in which each individual is only ideally separable . " There can be nothing real or substantial in the collection , unless the units be substantial . " Each is a little world of its own ; developing by itself , " as if there were nothing else in existence . " This , however , is only one side of the Leibnitzian doctrine . Pushed to its logical extreme it would dissolve the universe into fragments . Each " monad , " as Leibnitz calls the individual , is in its existence unrelated to every other . There is no really continuous existence , but only discrete existence . Leibnitz naturally had some difficulty in satisfying himself that material things are separate and distinct . For every material thing is in space , and as such it seems to be infinitely divisible . How then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If the supposed ultimate atom occupies space , it must be divisible , and therefore it can not be a real individual . To obtain a real individual atom , it would seem as if we required a space that was itself made up of separate parts , and of such a space we can form no conception whatever . Leibnitz gets over this difficulty by boldly denying that space has a real existence , and consequently by denying that material things are really extended . The ancient Atomists , he says , made " the mistake of supposing that there are real material atoms existing in space ; and hence they were forced to hold the selfcontradictory doctrine that there are real material atoms which have no parts . Real units , then , are not extended at all ; they are individual " monads " having an independent existence , but not an existence in space . The idea of space is a " confused idea , " i.e. , an idea resting // upon the first or apparent view of things . At the stage of sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were extended ; but , when we reflect on the nature of reality , and bring our knowledge to the clearness of thought , we see that real things are not in space . The same thing is true of time : there is no real time , nor are real existences in time . Yet the external world is not a mere illusion : it has its own definite laws , and , what is more , there is a perfect correspondence between the real relations of " monads " to one another , and the connection of phenomena in time and space . The law of phenomena is different from the law of real things . Phenomena are connected by the law of efficient causes , monads by the law of final causes . The monads are determined by their own inner nature , not by the action upon them of external causes , but there is a correspondence between the connection of phenomena and the self-determination of monads . The reason of this correspondence is that the activities of the real monads are refracted in passing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in a fixed way . For example , if I will to raise my arm , the volition proceeds entirely from me : I am self-determined . But , on the other hand , the movement of the arm seems to be sufficiently explained by the cerebral movement , which itself is excited by sense-perception . I am myself the real cause of the action , but from the point of view of perception the cause is a bodily movement . But why , it may be asked , are monads compelled to represent things in the " confused " form of perception ? if perception is an inadequate view of things , can it be . // said that the monads are determined purely from them-selves ? A monad that represented reality as it is would always view things from the point of view of thought ; and hence for it there would be no space or time , no extended or temporal world , no efficient causes . In attempting to meet this difficulty , Leibnitz is forced to modify his first unqualified assertion of the absolute self-determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from within , but each has a certain limit in its own nature to its ; activity . It is because of this limit that it does not represent the universe to itself as it truly is , but always in a more or less confused form . It presents to itself a picture of the whole world , but a picture blurred and indistinct . But all monads do not represent the world with equal clearness . There is a regular gradation . God , the " monad of monads , " whose activity is absolutely unlimited by any passive element , apprehends all things in the clearness of pure thought . Finite spirits like men apprehend the world partly in the light of thought , partly in the confusion of sense . Animals have only sense perception , while plants and inorganic things represent the world in a still more confused way . Observe , however , that on Leibnitz ' view the distinction between man and the animal , between the animal and the plant , and between the plant and the mineral , is one of degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perception . Every monad is an individual , and there is no individual that has not an ideal centre of perception , in which it re-presents all other existence . It is a " living mirror gifted with an internal activity , whereby it represents the whole universe according to its particular point of view , I // and in such a way that its ideal universe has all the regularity of the real one . " In this doctrine of Leibnitz we have a suggestion of the manner in which the Darwinian conception of the distinction between the animals and man must be completed . As the animals differ from man only in the degree of their mental qualities , so we must suppose the plant and the mineral to differ in a similar way . This view has been put forward , though with some hesitation , by Tyndall , and Haeckel adopts it without any hesitation . It is pointed out by Tyndall that in the tendency to crystallization of the mineral world we have an anticipation of the organized form of living beings . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is any fundamental distinction between different orders of existence . The mineral exhibits in an implicit form the same characteristics as are presented in man in an explicit form . We can therefore readily understand why Tyndall says that in matter he discerns the " promise and potency of all kinds and qualities of life . " As Darwin denies any generic distinction between man and the animals , so Tyndall would deny any generic distinction between man and the mineral . And the same line of argument is applied by both . As Darwin seeks to show that the higher animals come much nearer to man than is commonly supposed , so Tyndall maintains that in the wonderful symmetry of the crystal we have a close approximation to organized existence . The inference would therefore seem to be , that there is no break in the continuity of existence , but all existence is of the same fundamental nature . 1 // If we examine this conception closely , I think we shall find that it really involves two radically different views of the world , which have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that there is nothing in the nature of intelligence as found in man that is not contained in lower forms of existence ; in other words , it is implied that intelligence must be reduced to the same level as other modes of existence . The second view is , that all forms of existence imply intelligence , since even in the mineral we find implicitly what in man we find explicitly . The first view levels down , the second levels up . It is one thing to say that all the characteristics of man as an intelligent being can be explained by the operation of the same laws as those which account for the form and movements of inorganic things , and another thing to say that the laws of inorganic nature properly understood are really laws of intelligence . We must therefore inquire which of these opposite views is really held by men like Darwin and Tyndall , and which is true . Now , I think there can be no doubt that the tendency of Darwin 's theory of the nature of man is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rather certain of his followers than Darwin himself who hold that the mental and moral qualities of man may be explained on the principle of natural evolution alone . I think that this extreme view may readily be shown to be untenable . The evolution of all forms of life , as we must suppose , has taken place in this way , that the advantageous peculiarities received by inheritance enable certain forms to survive . But these peculiarities simply come to the indi132 AN OUTLINE OF PHILOSOPHY . vidual by natural inheritance . No living being can change its inherited qualities . The external conditions are in like manner beyond the control of the individual . Now , whether an individual will survive or not depends upon its power of adaptation to the environment , and this depends entirely upon the natural adaptation of its inherited peculiarities to the circumstances in which it is placed ; hence there seems to be , on this view , no place for any spontaneous activity on the part of the individual living being . If therefore , we apply the doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim for his freedom , either of intelligence or of action , quite unintelligible . Man , we are to suppose , inherited from his animal progenitors such qualities as curiosity , wonder , memory , imagination . But these are purely natural tendencies which the individual can neither make nor unmake ; they come to him by inheritance , like his bodily powers , and their direction is determined by the external conditions in which he is placed . Thus the curiosity of primitive man we may suppose to have been excited by something he could not explain , but the feeling itself was due to an inherited tendency , and was called out by the external circumstances . If , therefore , we follow the evolution of man from his primitive to his civilized condition , we shall still find nothing but the reaction of the individual on his environment , ? a reaction determined simply by the peculiarities of his inherited disposition . ( a ) There is on this view no more room for any free activity in knowledge on the part of man than on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural constitution an affinity for oxygen . but it would // be regarded as a pure fiction to endow the hydrogen with any capacity of freely selecting the oxygen as its mate . For , it would be said , hydrogen can not refuse to unite with oxygen under certain conditions : the union is absolutely determined by the natural characteristics of both . In the same way it must be denied that in man there is any freedom in knowledge ; he can know only that which his inherited disposition fits him to know : to suppose that he could have a different disposition , or react differently under the conditions , is incompatible with the principle of natural evolution . ( b ) Nor can there be any freedom of action . Primitive man inherited certain tendencies from his animal ancestors . Thus , like them , he has a selfish tendency and a social tendency . Which of these shall be predominant will be determined by the interaction between the organism and the environment . The moral sense is developed by the conditions under which man is placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of punishment  --  both inherited peculiarities ? the savage comes to have a feeling of pain when he follows the selfish desire for his own pleasure . Right and wrong are therefore names for the pleasure of approbation and the pain of disapprobation respectively . But the individual man can no more determine which of these shall predominate than he can alter his bodily stature or endow himself with new senses . We must suppose that in the majority of men the love of social approbation is stronger than the love of individual pleasure ; because , otherwise , the extension and development of the social bond would be impossible . But this only shows that the inherited disposition and the environment tend on the whole to the evolution of higher // sociality : it does not show that in the individual there is any free activity . Thus the theory of natural evolution , when it is employed to account for the mental and moral qualities of man , leads to the conclusion that there is no freedom either of knowledge or of action . Now , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the doctrine of natural evolution , we can not help asking whether a grave mistake has not been made in attempting to explain intelligence and morality by a principle which necessarily excludes all freedom either in knowing or in willing . May it not be that natural evolution is only a limited or partial explanation , true within its own sphere , but inadequate and untrue when extended to the explanation of conscious beings ? In attempting to answer this question , I must begin by reminding you that the theory in question brings man nearer to the higher animals , and the higher animals nearer to man . For it is held that in the higher animals are to be found the same characteristics as in man , and that the savage possesses these characteristics in a degree only a little superior to the higher animals . Now , in this contention , it is implied that mental and moral qualities are purely natural characteristics , received by inheritance , and called out by the reaction of the organism on the environment . It is assumed , in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of natural evolution , and , as it is held that there is no essential difference between man and the animals in respect of those qualities , it follows that the intelligence of man can be explained in the same way . That is to say , the fact that the higher animals possess qualities similar // to man 's is not regarded as a reason for doubting whether natural evolution is an adequate explanation even of them ; but it is inferred that , as the explanation is adequate when applied to the animals , it must also be adequate when applied to man . I propose to approach the problem from the other side , and to ask whether the principle of natural evolution is adequate to the explanation of the facts of intelligence and morality as these exist in man . If we see reason to deny its adequacy as regards man , we shall have reason to doubt whether it is adequate even when applied to the animals . DOES NATURAL EVOLUTION EXPLAIN KNOWLEDGE ? Let us first ask whether natural evolution explains the fact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man inherited from his non-human ancestors such mental characteristics as curiosity , wonder , and memory . What is curiosity ? It implies an interest in some object , and a concentration of attention upon it for the purpose of discovering what are its properties . It is further implied in curiosity that the subject believes in the intelligibility of the object . Now interest , attention , belief in the intelligibility of the object , all involve the faculty of distinguishing one object from another by an apprehension of the properties of each ; and this again implies that the apprehending subject is capable of separating between himself and the immediate impression that he has from moment to moment . For if , as each impression arose , it vanished for ever , it would be impossible for the subject to distinguish one impression from another , and therefore impossible for him to identify an object // by its peculiar properties . Primitive man was no doubt engaged mainly in a fierce fight for existence , a fight to preserve himself from the destructive influence of the elements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was therefore necessary for him to learn to some extent the properties of the elements and the habits of the lower animals . To do this he had to discriminate things by their properties ; to learn the nature of fire , tempest , cold , sunshine , and to find out how the animals might be overcome or captured . But the victory over objects he could achieve only if he had the faculty of grasping the different properties of things . To this end all his energies were directed , and if he made a serious mistake , the forfeit was his life . He had therefore to free himself from the first impressions of the nature of things , by attention , comparison , and discrimination ; that is , he had to separate between his impression of things and their actual nature . Such a faculty of distinguishing between the apparent and the real is the pre-requisite of all knowledge ; and it implies that man was not the sport of the fleeting impression of the moment , but was in some sense its master . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties of things , a comprehension of which was essential to his very existence . Primitive man had no scientific interest in nature ; he did not study its phenomena with a view to understanding it for itself . Yet we can readily see in the undeveloped and limited curiosity which he possessed the rudiments of the scientific curiosity of civilized man . For , as I have said , he assumed that what he sought to understand was capable of being understood . That is to say , he assumed that in his own intelligence could be found the key to the interpretation of // things . Knowledge , then , even as it existed for primitive man implied ( I ) the consciousness of a distinction between the apparent and the real , and ( 2 ) the capacity of apprehending the real in virtue of intelligence . It is plain , then , that any attempt to reduce knowledge to the mere flow of impressions in a subject that passively receives them , makes even the simplest knowledge unintelligible . If consciousness could be described as a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no knowledge . The successive positions taken up by a moving body may perhaps be so described , but the consciousness of man refuses to be expressed in such terms . The moving body is not aware of the successive positions it occupies : man not only has impressions , but he is aware that he has them . To the conscious subject we must therefore attribute much greater complexity than to the unconscious thing . Consciousness always involves the opposition of what seems and what is ; or , what is the same thing , it implies that impressions as they occur are only the sign or index of what does not occur . Consciousness also involves the capacity on the part of the subject of contrasting the stream of occurrences with the permanent nature of the object . It presupposes , in other words , that the objective world is not a mere series of occurrences , but a fixed system of things , and that the subject is capable of finding out what that system is . Knowledge always consists in grasping things from a universal point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations . This is the real force of Bacon 's contention , that man must come to the study of nature free from all preconceptions . For what this implies is , that only in freeing oneself from the accidental // impressions of the moment , and putting oneself at the point of view of existence as it actually is , can knowledge be obtained . the CARTESIAN CONCEPTION OF MIND . What has just been said may also be put in this way , that no knowledge is derivable from mere impressions , but only from impressions that have been brought to the unity of conception . For it is by conception , i.e. , by the mental apprehension of the meaning of individual impressions when these are viewed by reference to the whole system of things , that we obtain knowledge . We must be careful to observe , however , that we can not absolutely oppose the conceptions of our own minds to the actual nature of things . Descartes , e.g. , maintained that there are certain " innate conceptions , " which belong to the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , our particular experiences come to us from without . But if we suppose the mind to supply conceptions purely out of itself , what guarantee can we have that these express the real nature of existence ? This whole mode of thought rests upon the supposition , that knowledge is partly obtained by the mind 's contemplation of itself , and partly by the mind 's passive apprehension of what is without itself . Now , this involves a double misapprehension . In the first place , the mind has no nature when it is separated from all objects actual or possible ; and , in the second place , there is no apprehension by the mind of what is without it . ( I ) Suppose the mind to be absolutely separated from all objects , and it has no conceivable nature . If we try to think of such a mind , we can only describe it by // negations : we can say , that it is not extended or movable or ponderable : in short , that it has none of the predicates by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly enough perceived by Descartes ; and therefore he went on to say , that mind has none of the attributes of matter , but must be defined as a purely thinking substance . It may be shown , however , that mind in complete isolation from matter can not be defined even as a thinking substance . For about what is it to think ? It can not be a mind which perceives , because perception is of a world of objects whose properties are those of extension , motion , weight , etc. , and , by hypothesis , the mind in itself is a substance that has none of these properties and is entirely removed from all contact with them . And if it can not perceive , neither can the mind remember or imagine ; for remembrance and imagination presuppose perception . I can not remember what I have never perceived , nor can I imagine anything that is not a re-arrangement of what has been perceived . In this difficulty Descartes falls back upon the view that there are certain conceptions which the mind has by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . But the conception of God or the Infinite is not possible apart from the conception of the Finite . If we think of God we must think of Him as the Being who is the source of all existence , and that is impossible if we have no consciousness of any existence . Shall we then say , that although the mind has no conception of any object ? whether that object is the world or God ? it yet has a conception of itself as a pure thinking activity ? But a pure thinking activity which thinks nothing is just as inconceivable as a world beyond consciousness or the Infinite in absolute
