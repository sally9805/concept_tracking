txt // drink more than seven glasses of alcoholic liquor at one time , and that not oftener than twice a day . Seventy years later , our English philosopher , Hobbes , whose ethical system ranks with that of Bacon and Locke , evidently thought himself a miracle of moderation when he boasted he had " not been drunk above a hundred times " in the whole of his long life . Even two centuries ago the prevailing vice of drunkenness had evidently forced itself on the public notice ; for a composition of 1,5oo lines was recently discovered in an old book ( from which these few have been selected as a fair sample of the whole ) , the earliest of teetotal poems known : THE DRUNKARD 'S PROSPECTIVE , OR BURNING GLASSE . Composed by Joseph Rigbie , Gentleman , Clerke of the Peace of the County Palatine of Lancaster .

" Superfluity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever since we have mixed ourselves with the Low Countries is counted honourable ; but before we knew their lingering wars , was held in the highest degree of hatred . Then , if we had seen a a variety of modes and customs , freaks and extravagances , and enough technical language , to raise it almost to an art . It was against this bestial indulgence , this national drunkenness , that the numerous severe statutes passed in the reign of James I. were aimed . 164 // Drinking terms derived from Dutch , Danish , and German sources abounded in the language of the period . Some of them are interesting because met with in the literature of the time . Half-seas-over , signifying " nearly drunk , " is a phrase said to be derived from the maritime Dutch . Op-zee , in their language , means literally " over-sea , " and was a name given to a stupefying beer introduced into England from the Low Countries . Freezen , in German , signifies to " swallow greedily . " Thus , in Ben Jonson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eye , It hath a heavy cast , ' t is upsee Dutch . " Another dramatist of the period , Fletcher , uses the term upsee freeze to signify " a tipsy draught , " " a swallowing of liquor till drunk . " Another commentator , while deriving this term from Frieseland beer , agrees that the meaning was " to drink swinishly like a Dutchman . " Our spirited Tom Nash in another passage discloses a few other mysteries of the drinking craft . " Now , he is nobody that can not drink super nagulum ; carouse the hunter 's hoope ; quaff upse freze crosse ; with healths , gloves , rnumpes , frolickes , and a thousand such domineering inventions . " For many of these terms of jollity we are indebted to the Danes , and some of them need rather elaborate explanation ? " healths , " " frolicker , " and " mumpes , " however , being good English , the lastnamed meaning grimaces . Super nagulum literally means " on the nail , " and relates to the custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinker has quaffed the whole contents , to make a pearl , with the last drop left in the vessel , upon his thumb-nail ; if more than a spot remained the drinker was to drink again as a penance . In the observance of this Bacchic freak the cry of the challenger // would be , " Supernaculum , supernaculum ! " A drinking ceremony embodying the same idea , was that in which the host filled a silver cup to the brim , held it towards the guest sitting next him , and desired him to take off the cover and assure himself that the cup was quite full , before drinking the health of the company . Each guest in turn went through the same ceremony , emptying the cup and inverting it , placing the edge upon his thumb-nail to prove he had swallowed every drop ; any defaulter having to fill the cup again and drink it off a second time . Carouse and rouse are terms derived from the Danes . A rouse was a large glass , in which a health was given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a carouse . There could be no carouse unless the glasses were emptied ; and though we have lost the terms we have not lost the practice , as we are reminded in the time-honoured call of the chairman of a present-day banquet , " Gentlemen , charge your glasses ! " The " hunter 's hoop " alludes to the practice of marking a drinking-pot with hoops by which each successive drinker could measure his draught . The practice would seem to be very much older than the Protestant Wars . Does not that Shakespearean demagogue , Jack Cade , promise his supporters furious reformation in this direction ? " There shall be in England , " he exclaims , " seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny ; the three-hooped pot shall have ten hoops ; and I will make it felony to drink small beer . " In the sixteenth century a seasoned and practised tippler was hailed as " a good fellow , " " a boon companion , " " a mad Greek , " " a true Trojan , " " a stiff blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " a Low Country soldier , " " one who drinks deep though it be a mile to the bottom , " " one that knows how the cards are dealt , " // " one that will be aflush of all four , " " one that bears up stiff , " " one whom the brewer 's horse hath bit , " " one that drinks upsefreeze , " " one that lays down his ears and drinks , " and so on , and so on ; as a lively wit and a fecund fancifulness inspired . " Ale-knight " is perhaps one of the oldest of these nicknames . When old " Sir John Sack-and-Sugar " compares himself to a brewer 's horse ( I Henry IV. , act iii . scene 2 ) , he no doubt has in his mind the slang phrase about being bitten by a brewer 's horse . The language is certainly more appropriate to the period than the many allusions to Sack ? which seems to have been an anachronism , and perhaps an intentional one , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and does infinite credit to the inventiveness of the band of good fellows to whom we are indebted for this great wealth of figurative language . One who is intoxicated is said to be fuddled or flustered ; tipsy , top-heavy , or boozy ; to be chockfull or pot valiant ; in drink , or in his cups ; to be elevated or overtaken ; under the table , or in a merry pin ; to be a little in the suds , or in a quandary . At Oxford he is said to be cup-sprung , or if he has taken liquor till it seems to run out of his eyes in tears , to be maudlin ? which is allusive to Magdalen the Penitent . At Cambridge the affected one is said to have business on both sides of the street , or to be unable to sport a right line . The sailor says of him that he is groggy , or breezy ; that he is slewed ( in his hammock ) or cast away ( if dead drunk ) ; that he heels a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or has been in a storm . With the sportsman the obfuscated individual is winged , or has got a spur in his head ; he shows his hobnails , or he chases geese . Among other phrases expressive of the same idea , and common to all classes , are those which tell that the drunken person sees double , or can not see a hole // through a ladder ; that he has had a drop too much , or ( in a phrase of more recent coinage ) that he has copped the brewer . These few specimens by no means exhaust the list of equivalent colloquialisms . " There are five reasons why men drink , " says Dean Aldrich " Good wine , a friend , or being dry ; Or lest you should be by-and-by ; Or any other reason why . " We all know the old rule : " Not drunk is he who from the floor Can rise again and still drink more , But drunk is he who prostrate lies , Without the power to drink or rise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commented upon by a certain London policecourt magistrate , who is as well known for his wit and the keenness of his observation as for his common-sense judgments . First , says our authority , is the " Perky " period ; then comes the Irritable succeeded by the Mellow ; then alternate the Pugnacious with the Affectionate ; sixthly comes the Lachrymose , and finally the Collapse . Commenting upon this the British Medical youruaal said : " Dr. Magnan , who was one of the first to begin the scientific study of the physiological action of alcohol , distinguished five stages : First , slight excitement and a feeling of well-being , in which speech and gestures became more animated ; in the second stage ideas become crowded together and confused , the mood being , without any very obvious reason for the difference , gay , or sad , or full of tender emotion ; in the third stage the confusion of ideas was greater , and accompanied by incoherence , perversion of taste and smell , illusions , thick speech , vacant countenance , and staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth death . " // If the degree of inebriation needs to be indicated colloquially he is three sheets in the wind ; he may be as drunk as an owl or as drunk as a pig ; as drunk as a beggar or as drunk as a lord , as drunk as a piper or as drunk as a fiddler , or again as drunk as a tinker ; he may be as fuddled as a ape , as merry as a grig , or as happy as a king . A curious treatise was written by " George Gascoigne , Esquier , " in 1576 , to prove " all dronkardes are beasts " ; and his contemporary , the satirist Nash , has left a fanciful sketch very similar in its humour . " The first is ape-drunk , and he leaps and sings and hollows and danceth for the heavens ; the second is lyon-drunk , and he flings the pots about the house , calles the hostess w ? e , breaks the glass windows with his dagger , and is apt to quarrel with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy , lumpish and sleepy , and cries for a little more drink and a few more clothes ; the fourth is sheep-drunk , wise in his own conceit when he can not bring forth a right word ; the fifth is maudlin-drunk , when a fellow will weep for kindness in the midst of his drink , and kiss you , saying , " By God , Captain , I love thee ; go thy ways ; thou dost not think so often of me as I do of thee , " and then he puts his finger in his eye and cries . The sixth is martin-drunk , when a man is drunk , and drinks himself so sober ere he stir ; the seventh is goat-drunk , when in his drunkenness he path no mind but on lechery . The eighth is fox-drunk , when he is crafty drunk , as many of the Dutchmen be , which will never bargain but when they are drunk . " On the frontispiece of this old work the beast-drunkards are represented as men with the heads of apes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocatives of thirst have been employed from the earliest days of civilisation Horace informs us that " Stew 'd shrimps and Afric cockles shall excite The jaded drinker 's languid appetite . " // Says the inimitable " Ingoldsby " " We bore him home and put him to bed And we told his wife and daughter To give him , next morning , a couple of red Herrings , with soda-water . " Shoeing-horns , sometimes called gloves , were the means resorted to for renewing or increasing a toper 's waning thirst . Says Bishop Hall in " Mundus alter et idem " : " Then , sir , comes up a service of shoeing-horns of all sorts ; salt cakes , red herrings , anchovies , and gammon of bacon , and abundance of such pullers-on . " It was through a surfeit of Rhenish and pickled herrings and such-like shoeing-horns or drawers-on , as these incitements to appetite were called , that Robert Greene , the Elizabethan dramatist and congenial wit , lost his life so ingloriously . Curious contrivances for exciting the flagging efforts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies fired at one end and floated in a glass of liquor , which an experienced toper deftly swallowed unharmed while it was yet blazing . Falstaff in describing Poins 's dexterity in ingratiating himself with the prince , says that , " he drinks off candleends for flap-dragons . " Beaumont and Fletcher in " Monsieur Thomas " have " Carouse her health in cans And candle 's ends . " Shakespeare again in Love 's Labour Lost says " Thou art easier swallow 'd than a flap-dragon . " Surely a display of dexterity and prowess in the manipulation of flap-dragons was the dernier ressort of the accomplished boozer . XVII OLD TAVERN LIFE A TAVERN ( says an old writer ) , " is a common consump-tion of the afternoon and the murderer or making away of a rainy day . To give you the total reckoning of it , it is the busy man 's recreation , the idle man 's business , the melancholy man 's sanctuary , the stranger 's welcome , the scholar 's kindness , and the citizen 's country . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canary their book " ? which last sentence shows that the term " tavern " was once equivalent to wine-shop , a fact to be kept steadily in mind . The rule , however , was not universal ; in mediaeval times , though ale was the beverage of the household , the " Good Wyf taughte her Daughter " that " she must not visit the tavern " ( here meaning an ale-171 // house ) , and that always she was to partake " measurably " of the good ale . A large field for the study of national manners is opened out by the tavern life of old London ; for these public resorts were the recognised rendezvous of politicians and traders , they were the only places of convenient sojourn and pleasant sociality . The taverns of old England have played no unimportant part in the social history of the country ; they were the meeting-places of poets and wits from the days of Shakespeare to those of Addison and Johnson ; and , says a recent writer on the subject , English literature to-day would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings inspired by the " flowing bowl " at such gatherings . " The flow of soul and the feast of reason " which characterised some of those convivial meetings of our greatest literary heroes constituted a phase of English tavern life which has left an indelible mark on the literary history of the English people . " A tavern , " says another authority , " is a rendezvous , the exchange , the staple of good fellows . " Was not the immortal Shakespeare traditionally reckoned among the pot-house roysterers ? Does not the old doggrel of the period inform us how he attended the fairs , the Church Ales , and all the merrymakings at the neighbouring villages around Stratford-on-Avon ? ? The local Shakespearean legend is to the effect that in the days of Good Queen Bess the small Warwickshire town of Bidford possessed two teams of drinkers , the first team being called the topers and the second the sippers , both remarkable for their prowess in the drinking contests of those days . A team from Stratford , in which Shakespeare was included , journeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Evesham , but the sippers offered to defend the honour of the little // town , and they easily defeated the Stratfordians , who made for home , but were forced to spend the night under a crab-tree a mile outside Bidford . In the morning some were for returning to the charge , but Shakespeare said he had had enough , the sequel to it all being the epigram : " I have drunk with " Piping Pebworth , Dancing Marston , Haunted Hillborough , Hungry Grafton ; Dodging Exhall , Papist Wixford Beggarly Broom , and Drunken Bidford . " It is a well-known tradition that the crab-tree when cut down served to supply mementos of Shakespeare in the shape of snuff-boxes and other articles . The Falcon Inn at Bidford is claimed as the scene of these legendary drinking bouts . Robert Greene also , the talented but unhappy dramatist , could not keep away from the alehouses and the drinking-booths , and died from his excesses in 1592 ? In the time of Shakespeare , the places principally honoured by genius were the Sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fleet Street , close to Temple Bar ; and the famous one called the " Mermaid , " which was situated in Cornhill . There , as Beaumont tells us " Hath been shown , Wit able enough to justify the town For three days past ? wit that might warrant For the whole city to talk foolishly Till that were cancelled ; and when that was gone , We left an air behind us , which alone Was able to make the two next companies Right witty ; though but downright fools , - more wise . " The celebrated club at the " Mermaid , " originated with Sir Walter Raleigh ; and , as that eminent man of letters , William Gifford , has truly observed , " combined more // talents and genius , perhaps , than ever met with , before or since . " Here , for many years , regularly repaired Shakespeare , Ben Jonson , Beaumont , Fletcher , Selden , Cotton , Carew , Martin , Donne , and many others , whose names , even at this distant period call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , in the full flow and confidence of friendship the lively and interesting " wit combats " as Fuller calls them , took place between Shakespeare and Jonson ; and hither , in probable allusion to them , Beaumont let his thoughts wander , in his letter to Jonson , from the country : " What things have we seen Done at the Mermaid ! heard words that have been So nimble , and so full of subtle flame , As if that every one from whom they came , Had meant to put his whole wit in jest , " &c.; There were temperamental reasons why the great Puritan poet would not have been found among this tavern-haunting crew , even supposing he had been precisely contemporaneous with them . But though Milton was quite a small boy when Shakespeare was a frequenter of the Mermaid Tavern , a meeting between the two poets was not altogether impossible . John Milton lived with his parents , close by the tavern , in Bread Street ; and a conjectural encounter has been thus surmised by Professor Masson : " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , we may fancy those meetings going on close to his father 's house , at which , over a board covered with cups of Canary , and film room well filled , surely , with tobacco-smoke , the seated gods exchanged their flashes . Nay , and if we will imagine the precise amount of personal contact that there was or could have been between Shakespeare and our poet , how else can we do so but by sup-posing that , in that very year 1614 when the dramatist paid his last known visit to London , he may have spent an evening with his old // comrades at the Mermaid , and , going down Bread Street with Ben Jonson on his way , may have passed a fair child of six playing at his father 's door , and , looking down at him kindly , have thought of a little grave in Stratford Churchyard and the face of his own dead Hamnet ? " The sallies of the wit combatants are not unfrequently placed on record by their admiring auditors . Jonson confesses he kept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard , with a view to future use . Some repartees there are on record , which are said to have been launched at the " Mermaid " ; but none of them have the least pretension to the character of wit ; and the authenticity of the whole is most doubtful . One example may suffice : " Mr. Ben Jonson and Mr. William Shakespeare being merrie at a tavern , Mr. Jonson begins this for his epitaph " Here lies Ben Jonson , Who was once one ? " He gives it to Mr. Shakespeare to make up , who presently writ " That while he lived was a slow thing , And now , being dead , is nothing . " This lacks the true ring , certainly . The Devil 's Tavern , near Temple Bar , has been immortalised by Ben Jonson , who wrote his " Leges Conviviales " for a club of wits that assembled in its chief room , an apartment he dedicated to Apollo , and over the chimney-piece of which the laws of the club were preserved . As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , here are a few extracts from an old manuscript of the poet , preserved at Dulwich College . " MEM. ? I laid the plot of my Volpone and wrote most of it , after a present of ten dozen of palm sack from my very good lord T ? ; // that play I am positive will last to posterity and be acted when I and envy be friends , with applause . " " MEi i. ? The first speech in my Cataline , spoken by Sylla 's ghost , was writ after I parted with my friends at the Devil 's Tavern ; I had drank well that night , and had brave notions . There is one scene in that play which I think is flat ? I resolve to drink no more water in my wine . " " MEM. ? Upon the loth May the King ( heaven reward him ) sent me a hundred pounds . At that time I went oftentimes to the Devil ; and before I had spent forty of it , wrote my Alchymist . " " MEM. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tub , and some other comedies which did not succeed ( written by me ) ; in the winter honest Ralph died ; when I and my boys drank bad wine at the Devil . " Ben Jonson candidly confesses he owes some inspiration to the wine and conviviality of the tavern . Among other well-frequented taverns of the Metropolis of Tudor times few were more renowned than the " White Rose " ( the symbol of the York party ) in Old Palace Yard , Westminster , which stood near the chapel of our Lady , behind the high altar of the abbey church . The gloomy manners of Puritanism gave a severe check to these temples of jollity ; but the restoration of Charles again revived their popularity . The cavaliers and adherents of the Royal party , for joy of that event , were , for a time , incessantly drunk ; and from a picture of their manners , in Cowley 's comedy of The Cutter of Coleman Street , it may be collected that taverns were places of much more frequent resort than churches and conventicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abated , taverns , especially those in the City , became places for the transaction of almost all descriptions of business . There accounts were settled , conveyances executed ; and there attorneys sat , as at inns in the country on market-days , to receive their clients . In the space near the Royal Exchange , which is encumbered by Lombard , Gracechurch , part of Bishopsgate , and Thread1 OLD // needle Streets , the number of taverns exceeded twenty ; and on the site of the Bank there stood no less than four . At the " Crown , " which was one of them , it was not unusual , in the course of a single morning , to draw a " butt of mountain " ( 120 gallons ) in gills . How much taverns were frequented by the literati in the early part of the eighteenth century , the Spectator , the Tatler , and other British essayists , bear abundant evidence ; and there is little doubt but many of these papers were produced at a tavern , or originated at the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such . Although Sir Richard Steele was extravagant in his uxoriousness , yet who has not admired that passage in one of his letters to his wife , written from a tavern , in which he assures her that he will be with her " within half a bottle of wine " ? By the close of the eighteenth century , when boxing and pugilism had taken so remarkably a firm hold on the sporting section of the community , many taverns became the recognised resorts of the fighting fraternity , among whom there was no higher hall-mark of goodfellowship than a pair of black eyes . Not the least famous of these resorts was the Castle Tavern ( known later as the Napier Tavern ) in Holborn . It was kept by a succession of well-known heroes of the prize-ring ? Belcher , Tom Cribb , and Tom Spring ? and till its demolition in quite recent times , the marks were shown on the floor of the " back parlour " where the ring-posts used to be set up for the pugilistic encounters for which the house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackwood 's Magazine of June , 1892 , says " We may be certain that Coleridge and Lamb did not toil up Ilampstead Hill to drink water at the ' Salutation ' and ' Cat , ' and the 12 // merry coffee-housing of the club was mellowed by potations which stimulated the talk of Burke and Goldsmith and the appreciation of Reynolds . " We see Dickens and Forster and Stanfield and Maclise at their early dinners before the play , or at their suppers after the curtain fell , and we know that there was just enough liquor among them to warm , but not heat , and to set their tongues going with free but decorous elasticity . " Tavern life in its latest and final phase was not unknown to Charles Dickens . One of his finest characters , Charles Darnay , is said to have been founded on a real personage whom he met , in the crowded life of London , at " The Grotto " ? a clever writer of Bohemian habits named Whitehead , who haunted that resort in the " forties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cider Cellars in Maiden Lane , frequented by the fast young " swells " of the City and the West End after the theatres were closed ; rivalling as a place of low , if not immoral , resort , the " Coat Hole " in Drury Lane , and the notorious " Judge and Jury . " The Cider Cellar is still to be found , and its spacious and fine saloon , little changed from its old form , is let for concerts and entertainments . " In the same building , " says Mr. J. Ashby-Sterry , " was at one time a notable institution , namely , the Fielding Club ( which must not be confused with another short-lived but select circle of modern times in King Street , bearing the same name ) , whereat Thackeray , Albert Smith , W. H. Russell , Wilkie Collins , Beverley , Shirley Brooks , Edmund Yates , Peter Cunningham , John Leech , Leigh Murray , Robert Keeley , Benjamin Webster , and other notable people of that time used to assemble of an evening and frequently remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old London opens a large field for the study of our national manners and customs ; more than mere places of sojourn for travellers and traders , they became the rendezvous of politicians and publicists , // the recognised meeting-places for much social intercourse , and especially for that pleasant form of sociability which is accompanied by friendly entertainment . How useful they were in the days when travelling was difficult and newspapers scarce , and all means of intercommunication were correspondingly slow , is indicated by the extraordinary number of taverns with which the main thoroughfares of old London were lined . XVIII THE OLD-TIME POPULARITY OF INNS IN Dryden 's time everybody who travelled used inns , for travelling was impossible without them . Hence the poet 's figure of speech in the line " The world 's an inn , and death the journey 's end . " The use of inns has even entered into the imagery of the epitaph writer , as thus at Richmond in Yorkshire an epitaph on an infant runs " Into this world as strangers to an inn This infant came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found no entertainment worth her stay , She only broke her fast and went away . " 180 // The Act passed in the first year of James I. ( 1603 ) defined " the antient , true , and principal use of inns , alehouses , and victualling houses " to be for the " resort , relief , and lodging of wayfaring people , travelling from place to place , and for such supply of the wants of such people as are not able by greater quantities to make provision of victual . " The preamble then proceeds to lay down that such inns " are not meant for entertainment and harbouring of lewd idle people , to spend and consume their time and their money in lewd and drunken manner . " Every one has heard the old gibe about the village inn being close to the church , and that the thirsty wayfarer in search of a place whereat to quench his thirst has only to look out for the nearest steeple . There is much truth in the scoff . The old inn and the weather-beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while some village inns stand almost within the churchyard ; and at such public-houses not only did " ringers " or " singers " of a bygone generation obtain surreptitious drinks during divine service , but at not a few of them vestry meetings and other official gatherings of the congregation were commonly held as a mere matter of course . In England the public-house is as universal as the place of worship ; and under healthy conditions is a natural and a useful institution . These old inns gave , a relish to travel ; the stoppages made at them for the reasonable refreshment of man and horse were always pleasurable interludes in the journey ; and not unfrequently the welcome of the cheery host amidst novel and pleasant surroundings made the traveller almost forget the comforts of home . This was the heyday of the English intl . The roads were then good . But previous to this era , when the // lumbering stage-wagon and the carrier 's van monopolised the roads ? which they did for almost two centuries , in succession to the pack-horse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wayside inn was but a rude kind of halting-place , and generally comfortless in its sleeping accommodation if not in all other respects . Notwithstanding this , if the old ballad is to be believed , one could make himself jolly in an old wayside inn . " When first I went a-waggoning , a-waggoning did go , I filled my parents ' hearts with grief , with sorrow and with woe , And many are the hardships that I have since gone thro ' , And say wo , my lads , say wo ! Drive on , my lads , heigh-ho ! And who wo n't lead the merry life we jolly waggoners do ? It is a cold and stormy night , I 'm wetted to the skin , But I 'll bear it with contentment until I reach the inn , And then I 'll get a drinking with the landlord and his kin , And say , " &c.; The inn-yards assumed greater importance when wheeled vehicles took the place of pack-horses for road traffic ; and they were further improved both as regards accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fast coaches which superseded the old slow coaches and carriers ' wagons . Till a century ago , or less , travelling was very different from what it is now . Long journeys on horseback , in post-chaises , or in stage-coaches , all had a smack of the open air in them , involved a certain measure of hardihood , and occasionally were not without a spice of adventure and romance . That was the time when the old English hostel of the superior kind , with its solid comforts , its old English cheer , dispensed by a genial landlord of the ideal John Bull type , was truly a national institution . // In the times when all travelling that was not done afoot was accomplished on horseback , the yard with its stabling was an adjunct indispensable to every inn on the road . " As soon as a passenger comes to an inn , " says an old writer , " the servants run to him , and one takes his horse and walks him till he be cold , then rubs him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger his private chamber " ? and so both man and beast were properly cared for at every well-regulated inn . That humble functionary , the ostler , was then indispensable to the traveller . The word " ostler " was derived by Dr. Johnson from the French hostelier , which signified the host of the inn or hostel , and not the ostler or stableman . This use of the term , it will be seen , came from the time before people travelled in carriages , and when the innkeeper was required not only to tend his guests , but to take care of their horses , and when , therefore , the " hosteller " was actually the horse-keeper as well as the host . The wits have derived ostler from " oat stealer I " When a road was turnpiked , inns sprang up along its route almost as a matter of course . And inns played a very important part in the evolution of the mails . Not till 1784 did the condition of the roads permit the introduction of the fast mail-coach , as distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the mails had been carried by post-boys , the " boys " often enough being men of fifty or sixty years of age . Mounted on ponies , these weather-beaten messengers jogged along the roads as fast as their animals would carry them , always as ready for the snug welcome of an inn fire as their jaded beasts were for the warm stable ; the postoffice generally being a stable as well , the term " postmaster " often bearing a double significance . The coming of the fast coach , with its scarlet-coated // mail guard , gave that impetus which raised the status of the better class of inn , as previously described . There were a number of celebrated houses along every main coach-road ; and a ballad , or more correctly a popular song of the period , entitled " The Mail Coach Guard , " introduced the names of all the famous coaching inns , very cleverly hitting off the propensities of the mail guards for carrying gossip as well as news . Where could have been found a finer or more typical specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in Aldersgate Street ? The scene presented by a coach-yard in full activity was always an animated and interesting one . The coach , a handsome , well-built vehicle , in all the brilliancy of a highly-varnished claret ground , or it may be of bright yellow , when ready , would stand well in the middle of the drive . The four beautiful , spirited animals attached to it , with their glossy , velvety skins , covered with cloths till the moment of " putting to , " would be under the charge of two stablemen in corduroy breeches and heavy boots ? men typical of " Robin Ostler , " with slouching gait , the complexion of dried rosy apples , and rasping voices such as men get by habitually talking to horses through their teeth . Then the coachman , mounted on the box , getting his whip and his ribbons adjusted exactly to his mind . He is well buttoned up to the throat in an enormous box-coat of whitish drab colour , fastened with immense mother-o ' - pearl buttons ; and having muffled round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nether lip and covering well the tips of his ears . There is a rakish brim to his hat , which goes well with the air of nonchalance he affects ? for is he not the skipper , as it were , not only in command of the gallant equipage , but controlling , for the time at least , the destiny of all his passengers ? To see him gather up the reins in // that leisurely , masterful way , as he signals the ostlers to " give ' em their head , " is to inspire confidence in every breast . And when the impatient animals are released , clear the gateway in a few brisk steps , and break into a good round pace immediately they turn on to the road , every one feels as the coach bowls away to the lively tooting of the guard 's horn , that they have assisted at one of the day 's " events . " Such were the daily scenes in a busy inn-yard during the coaching period , which after all was a brief one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang out when stage-coaches and post-chaises were in vogue was " In this tavern you may find Everything to suit your mind Good wine , good fish , and flesh in courses ; Coaches , chaises , harness , horses . " The inn-yard was by no means an unimportant part of the establishment , and still observed the code of rules which had come down through generations of hosts and ostlers . It can readily be understood that the " laws of the inn-yard " would call , among other things , for protection against fire , and the preservation of the purity of the household water-supply . In fact the rules started off with enumerating the forfeits imposed on any who " dabbled the water cistern " or " carried lighted candles about the stables " ? and so on . But while that period lasted , the yard of a coachinghouse was always interesting if not picturesque . At many hours of the day , as in a modern railway station , it was a scene of animation and bustle , with the arrival and departure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that of the " Golden Cross " in the Strand , the great coaching-house from which the illustrious Pickwickians , in company with their newly-made acquaintance , Mr. Jingle , started that bright May morning // in 1827 , by the Commodore coach , for Rochester . 1 t had the usual low archway over the entrance , against which Mr. J. kindly cautioned the passengers when they started ? " Heads ! Heads ! Take care of your heads ! " ? after which that voluble and irrepressible gentleman proceeded to relate the tragic episode of the " head of the family " being removed " through unfortunately forgetting the arch . " ... " Dangerous work ? other day ? five children ? mother ? tall lady eating sandwiches ? forgot the arch ? crash ? knock ? children looked round ? mother 's head off ? sandwich in her hand ? no place to put it in ? shocking ! shocking ! " It was thus the talkative passenger would mark the beginning and end of each stage , even when volubility failed to beguile the tedium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the yard of the " White Hart , " in Southwark , when the novelist first introduces Sam Weller to our notice : " The yard presented none of that bustle and activity which are the usual characteristics of a large coach inn . Three or four lumbering wagons , each with a pile of goods beneath its ample canopy , about the height of a second-floor window of an ordinary house , were stowed away beneath a lofty roof , which extended over one end of the yard ; and another , which was probably to commence its journey that morning , was drawn out into the open space . A double tier of bedroom galleries , with old clumsy balustrades , ran round two sides of the straggling area , and a double row of bells to correspond , sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof , hung over the door leading to the bar and coffee-room . Two or three gigs and chaise-carts were wheeled up under different little sheds and pent-houses ; and the occasional heavy tread of a cart-horse , or rattling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , announced to anybody who cared about the matter that the stable lay in that direction . When we add that a few boys in smock frocks were lying asleep on heavy packages , woolpacks , and other articles that were scattered about on heaps of straw , we have described as fully as need be the general appearance of the yard . " // This inn-yard may be regarded as typical of its class , and the verbal picture here given us of it is just as vivid as words can make it . Then for upwards of another half-century after the extinction of the stage-coach and the post-chaise , the high-roads of the country were practically deserted , the wayside inn was neglected , and the once-flourishing posting-house languished till it fell gradually into decay . The railway hotel took the place of both . A new era of prosperity for roadside inns and hotels with commodious yards is manifestly dawning with the ever-growing popularity of the pneumatic-tyred wheel . The bicycle begets thirst and the motor-car fills the mouth and the nostrils with dust ; the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old inns once provided stabling , promises to be in greater demand than ever . There may occasionally be seen , even at the present day when the cycle and the motor-car have all but superseded the traveller on horseback or in horsed vehicle , on the walls of wayside inns , the once familiar legend , " Bait and Livery Stables . " The word " bait " is derived from the Anglo-Saxon baton , " to feed , " and was used to designate a meal taken by travellers to refresh them on a journey . " Livery " is connected with the word delivery , and stood for the stabling accommodation to which a traveller delivered his horse . A passage in the writings of Edmund Spencer well illustrates this point . " What livery is we know well enough ; it is the allowance of horse-meate to keep horses at livery ; the which word , I guess , is derived from delivering forth their nightly food . " The use of the other word is well illustrated in the couplet from Jenyns " A Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Inn , where travellers bait , then post away . " XIX IN PRAISE OF INNS THE social status of the inn in the eighteenth century , the position it then held in the estimation of the public , is clearly indicated by that oft-quoted quatrain of the poet Shenstone , which he is said to have scratched on the window-pane of an inn at Henley . The " Red Lion " at Henley-on-Thames has contended for the honour of having inspired the verse , and at a recent sale of the property it was announced that " the window and record were still in existence " ; but the famous stanza was really written on the window of the " White Swan " at Henley-in-Arden , which was not many miles from the poet 's home at Halesowen , near Birmingham . Shenstone was not unknown in London , where his favourite haunt was George 's Coffee House , near 188 // Temple Bar . Here is the whole poem " Written at an Inn , " of which the last stanza is by far the best known : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From flattery , feasting , dice and din ; Nor art thou found in domes much higher Than the lone cot or humble Inn . ' T is here with boundless power I reign , And every health which I begin , Converts dull port to bright champagne ; For Freedom crowns it , at an Inn . I fly from pomp , I fly from plate , I fly from falsehood 's specious grin ; Freedom I love , and form I hate , And choose my lodgings at an Inn . Here , waiter ! take my sordid ore , Which lacqueys else might hope to win ; It buys what Courts have not in store , It buys me Freedom , at an Inn . And now once more I shape my way Through rain or shine , through thick or thin , Secure to meet , at close of day , With kind reception at an Inn . Whoe'er has travelled life 's dull round , Where'er his stages may have been , May sigh to think how oft he found The warmest welcome ? at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way who goes to a good inn , " says the proverb of our great-grandfathers ' days . How the Colonial of early times , in his new-made country across the Atlantic , imitated the old English inn , almost with a detail which bespoke his affection for it , is eloquently told in the words of the American // poet . Longfellow 's description of " The Wayside Inn " begins : " One Autumn night , in Sudbury Town , Across the meadows bare and brown The windows of the wayside inn Gleamed red with firelight through the leaves Of woodbine hanging from the eaves , Their crimson curtains rent and thin . As ancient is this hostelry As any in the land may be , Built in the old Colonial days When men lived in a grander way , With ampler hospitality . A kind of old Hobgoblin Hall , Now somewhat fallen to decay , With weather-stains upon the wall And stairways worn , and crazy doors , And creaking and uneven floors , And chimneys huge and tiled and tall , A region of repose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remote among the wooded hills ! Across the road the barns display Their lines of stalls , their mows of hay ; Through the wide doors the breezes blow ; The wattled cocks strut to and fro ; And , half effaced by rain and shine , The Red Horse prances on the sign . " Some hundred years or more ago , Dr. Johnson , at Chapel House , expatiated to Boswell " on the felicity of England in taverns and inns , and triumphed over the French for not having in any perfection the tavern life . " He dwelt on the independence of the place , the alacrity of the attendance , the oblivion of care and freedom from solicitude which he himself enjoyed whenever he entered a tavern door . " There is nothing , " he concluded , " which has yet been contrived by man by which so much happiness has been produced as by a good tavern or inn , " // And when the tired traveller does take his ease within the comfortable walls of the hospitable inn , he becomes the undisputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an armchair his throne , and the poker his sceptre . The whole secret of the success , the attractiveness of the inn , is revealed in this panegyric of the " Great Chain . " The disclosure should remove from the minds of many misguided persons the notion that men are drawn to the public-houses primarily by a taste for strong drink . This is a mistake too many would-be reformers have made in the past and which some continue to make . Men are mainly attracted to the public-houses by the cheerfulness , light , and warmth which are invariably offered there , and which too many of the lower class miss at home ; by a longing for congenial society , and by a desire to be free , if only for a little while , from the pressure of domestic worries and daily cares . " How oft doth man , by care oppressed , Find in an inn a place of rest ! " These simple wants are still met in some remote country inns which , preserving the traditions of the past , leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beer , if they so please ; but it is to be feared that in many others , and certainly in the gin palaces of the towns , the repeated order is the condition of a continued welcome . This attitude of the management is betrayed by the inhospitable seatless bar , specially designed for " perpendicular drinking . " In a work entitled , " As We Are and As We May Be , " that great social reformer , the late Sir Walter Besant , than whom no man was more intimately acquainted with the working classes , has said of the modern public192 INNS , ALES , AND DRINKING CUSTOMS house , in its relationship to the daily lives of the people " Perhaps the workman spends , night after night , more than he should upon beer . Let us remember , if he needs excuse , that his employers have found him no better place and no better amusement than to sit in a tavern , drink beer ( generally in moderation ) , and talk and smoke tobacco . Why not ? A respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets there is the society of the workman ; it is his life ; without it he might as well have been a factory hand of the good old time ? such as hands were forty years ago ; and then he should have made but two journeys a day ? one from bed to mill , and the other from mill to bed . " Commodious hotels of a newer type , fitted with every up-to-date convenience , and adapted to all present-day requirements , have risen up in most large towns and places of resort , because they have become a necessity in an age of travel . The importance of a good hotel system in these day of touring clubs can not be denied . Everywhere , as tourists and travellers , the home-loving English people are daily becoming more and more reconciled to hotel life and are no longer shy , as they once were , of eating in public . But admirable as a good hotel system may be , there is something after all in the personality which directs the management of any house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sojourn . A welltravelled Englishman has recently said , " A good innkeeper is worth more than a big hotel . A prepossessing appearance , a cordial reception , is better than all the modern improvements of the big caravanserais , whose steam heat does not suffice to warm up the heart . " A magazine writer , treating the same subject , contrasts the inns of the old days with the hotels of the present day . " The cosy inns of the coaching days ? which went out about the middle of last century , and experienced a revival lately through // cyclist and motorist ? with smiling host and hostess , blazing fires and substantial good cheer , has developed in some cases into the smart modern hotel , where one loses individuality , and becomes a number , and where the telegraph and telephone and bustling ways of modern life have killed old-fashioned leisure . " Yet a more recent writer , although treating of London only , expresses himself with anything but tenderness for the hotels the last generation of travellers had to put up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sixties " and " seventies , " he says their disappearance calls for but few regrets . Notwithstanding the halo of romance which Dickens had thrown over the country inns of a few decades earlier , this writer declares the London hotels of his own time were dingy and in reality none too comfortable ? but then he is obviously comparing them with the palatial and luxuriously appointed hotels of the present day . " An old-world air of quaintness certainly hung over them , " says our critic , " but this was poor compensation for the dinginess and dirt which were its occasional concomitants . The old-world English waiter , too , though a character in his way , was , as a rule , none too temperate ; whilst the rest of the staff was usually of a somewhat happy-go-lucky disposition , more or less addicted to tolerated inebriety . Bath-rooms " ( he continues ) , " such as abound in modern hotels were , for the most part , non-existent ; and where one did exist , it was usually of a none too efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooms , mops , and the like articles of domestic necessity . " In London the providing of a public midday dinner , commonly known as an " ordinary , " and so very different from the French table cd'hote , never became quite naturalised as it did in the country . There was till recent times a good ordinary at the " Saracen 's Head " in Snow Hill , at which the landlord presided ; and there were the famous " fish dinners " at Billingsgate . It was more of a success in the suburbs among the retired City 13 // tradesmen ? such as had used the City chop-houses , perhaps ? and Goldsmith is recorded to have frequented one of these . " There was a very good ordinary of two dishes and a pastry , kept at this time at Highbury Barn , at tenpence per head , including a penny for the waiter . " Which allusion to that venerable institution , the waiter 's tip , is not the least interesting item in this extract , which is taken from Forster 's Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the character of the accommodation provided at the larger hotels . The old-fashioned hotel drawing-room has long been without occupants . Modern ladies away from home dislike the coldness and formality of a public drawing-room ; they prefer to assemble with their men-folk , and so we now have the hotel lounge , where the men may smoke ? and the ladies , too , may take their cigarettes , if they affect the habit ? while they enjoy each other 's society , listen to music , chat , take their coffee , or even receive their visitors , under the most luxurious conditions that modern furnishing permits of . Another great change the student of hotel life may observe in the commercial houses . When the commercial traveller was a power in the land and railway facilities were much less than they are now , compelling him to spend more nights as well as days in hotels , the commercial-room of the hotel was sacred to him . He had the best of living at the cheapest of rates , and a sort of divinity hedged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His status was far above that of the ordinary uncommercial traveller , who was relegated to the coffeeroom ; or who , if permitted within the sacred precincts of the commercial-room , was graciously allowed to pay for his share of the wine , whether he consumed any or not , was expected to pay great deference to the chair ? occupied by a seniority calculated on length of stay in // the house ? to contribute to various table collections , and altogether to feel the honour conferred by being permitted to sit at table in such august company . The " Commercial " of those days was a well-salaried man , with an allowance of thirty shillings a day for expenses , and he always sat down to a " wine dinner " ? a pint of sherry to each man . But where is the old-fashioned commercialroom now ? At some establishments those old-time institutions , the " Bar " and the " Tap " are also being abolished ; and everywhere the employment of waiters , invariably looking out for tips , is becoming more universal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to modern hotels , restaurants , and tea-rooms ; has , in fact , become practically universal wherever guests or patrons have need to utilise the services of the underpaid staff of a caterer . The origin of the custom is said to be traceable to the practice in old coaching inns of having a money-box displayed on the sideboard of the chief guest-room for customers to drop in their gratuities intended for the servants . This box was labelled " To Insure Promptitude , " the initials of these three words being always painted in large capitals and forming the word TIP . In Japan , where inn tariffs are exceedingly low by force of law , it is the practice to give the largest tip to the innkeeper himself ! ONLY a few centuries ago the inn played many parts in the social economy of this country . In a more primitive state of society , when public buildings other than those devoted to ecclesiastical or military purposes were few and far between , the inn as a place of resort , as a common 196 // meeting ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of public purposes . The theatre , with its tier of boxes , was an architectural arrangement copied from the old inn-yards , in which travelling mountebacks and strolling performers of all kinds were wont , four or five centuries ago , to give their shows in the presence of the inn guests assembled in the galleries which ran round the yard on every bedroom floor . The ancient inns having the open courts with bedchambers round them , gallery above gallery , are supposed to have been constructed in the Roman fashion . Specimens of this form of inn architecture were plentiful enough in London a century ago . There were the " Belle Sauvage " in Ludgate Hill , the " Saracen 's Head " in Snow Hill , the " George " and the " Ram " in Smithfield , the " Swan with Two Necks , " the " Green Dragon " in Bishopsgate Street , and others . Fragments of these spacious old hostelries remained latest in Aldgate , Holborn , and Southwark . In Southwark the " King 's Head , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and the " George " particularly deserve mention . The music-hall is a direct product of the tavern . Before music licences had to be taken out numbers of public-houses in every part of the country utilised their large club-rooms for the holding of concerts on some regular evening in each week , every item of which was volunteered by members of the company present . Whether such meeting was called a " free-and-easy , " or what not , it was usually under the direction of a sort of perpetual chairman , who was either the host himself or some regular habitue of the house with a talent for presiding at such convivial assemblages . He was generally a loud-voiced gentleman , and one not only quick to discern latent talent , but an autocrat to whom it could not be denied . And then the heartiness ? or the loudness // ? with which , at the conclusion of the novice 's performance , he led the applause , was always in itself a sufficient reward . The intermediate stage , between the tavern " sing-song " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be occupied by professional instead of amateur performers ; but it was with the dominating presence of the chairman still in the rostrum to announce the " turns " in stentorian tones , and to hammer the applause at the beginning and end of each effort . Members of the audience if not then allowed to contribute to the harmony , always had the privilege of asking the chairman to drink with them ; an honour he seldom refused ? " for the good of the house . " The use of licensed houses as exhibitions and show places is still common enough . Bird Shows , Bird Singing Contests , Pipe Smoking Competitions , Dog and Poultry Shows , and similar exhibitions , although now frowned upon by licensing authorities , have long been held on licensed premises in some parts of the country . The use of licensed premises for markets , exchanges , and other forms of trading is an ancient one , and one not altogether obsolete . Adjacent to the entrance to Stationers Hall Court , in London , is a doorway upon which few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a long passage , at the end of which was to be found a roomy old tavern with quaint corners , and originally known by the sign of the " King 's Head , " at which time it was a fashionable coffee and chop-house . At the beginning of the nineteenth century the famous fat man , Daniel Lambert , took up his lodgings at this house , and here he held public receptions , at which visitors , for a modest fee , might look upon his fifty-two stone of human flesh . For years after Lambert had departed this life his portrait // in oils hung upon the tavern walls , and his walking-stick was also preserved as a curiosity . From that time this house , which had been used as his show place , became known as the " Daniel Lambert . " Recently the premises of this once famous chop-house have been acquired by a well-known firm of caterers for a modern cafe , and the old portrait , put up at auction , fetched the sum of 5 1os . The conversion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common practice during the past century ; but under the stricter regime of the present day , licensing magistrates look upon it as a mere device to attract customers to drink , and a persistence in it would probably endanger the licence of the house . Numbers of public-houses have acquired local fame as museums of antiquities , or museums of natural history specimens , or other collections . No doubt the primary object of these collections was to attract customers rather than visitors ; but they were none the less useful or instructive on that account , being frequently the bestconducted houses in the neighbourhood , and the neighbourhood generally too poor to boast of , or hope for , publicly supported institutions of like character . At Wednesbury and at Birmingham respectively were " museum " taverns , which obtained the name because when first opened , their walls were lined with cases of stuffed birds and other trophies of the taxidermist 's art . At Sutton Coldfield there was also a good public-house museum of natural history . But perhaps the best example of this type of licensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Gloucestershire , which had a most interesting - collection , since dispersed , of fossils , ancient flint weapons , old coins , pictures , and a perfect medley of curiosities . The association of sport with public-houses is too well
