 | THE short name for this Act is the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act , 1907 , and this name correctly describes it , for it is an act whose purpose is , not arbitration , but conciliation , investigation , and publicity . The industries to which the Act applies are all mining properties and all agencies of transportation or communication , including railways , however operated , steamships , telegraph and telephone lines , gas , electric lights , water and power works . By Industrial Dispute is meant any dispute or difference between an employer and one or more of his employees , including disputes about wages or prices to be paid in respect to employment ; hours and conditions of employment ; refusals to employ any person or class of persons ; preferences in employment for one class over another ; allegations that materials are bad or unsuitable ; customs or usages in any trade or district ; and , finally , the interpretation of agreements or of particular clauses in an agreement . The Minister of Labor for the Dominion of Canada has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Registrar of Boards of Conciliation and Investigation , who conducts correspondence and keeps records of ' proceedings under the Act . Canada has an advantage over the United States in that the regulation of industries , and of all strifes which arise in industries , falls inevitably to the national administration , and not to the provincial ; but the principles of this Act could be made to apply in the several States which constitute the United States . The most striking feature of the Act is this : Whenever a dispute arises between an employer and any of his employees , and the parties thereto are unable to adjust it , either of the parties to the dispute may make application to the Minister for the appointment of a Board of Conciliation and Investigation , to which Board the dispute shall be referred under the provisions of this Act , if applicable . The Minister must , within fifteen days from the date at which an application is received , establish such a Board , if satisfied that the provisions of the Act apply . Every Board consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of these three members one must be appointed on the recommendation of the employer , one on the recommendation of the employees , and the third on the recommendation of the first two members . If either of the parties fails to nominate its representative within five days , the Minister must appoint a fit person to represent that party in the Board ; if the two members fail to select a third member , the Minister must appoint a fit person to be the third member of the Board , and this third member is chairman of the Board . The Act , therefore , secures a public inquiry into any industrial dispute concerning mines or public utilities , provided one out of the two parties to the dispute asks for such an investigation . The Department of Labor is authorized to provide any Board of Conciliation and Investigation with a secretary , stenographer , and other necessary clerical assistance , in order to secure complete publicity for the inquiry . In making application for the appointment of a Board , the party which desires the inquiry must set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the dispute , including any claims or demands made by either party upon the other , an estimate of the number of persons likely to be affected , and the efforts made by the parties themselves to adjust the dispute .  | The application must be accompanied by a declaration that , failing the adjustment of the dispute under the Act , to the best of the knowledge and belief of the declarant , a lockout or strike will ensue . The party making application for the appointment of a Board must transmit by sure means to the other party to the dispute a copy of the application , and of the accompanying statement and declaration . The object of the Board , once constituted , is to endeavor to bring about a settlement of the dispute , and to this end the Board must proceed at once to inquire expeditiously and carefully into the dispute , and into all matters affecting the merits and right settlement thereof ; but in the course of such inquiry the Board may use every means for inducing the parties to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties to agree upon terms of settlement . If such a settlement be arrived at before the Board 's inquiry is completed , a memorandum of the settlement must be drawn up by the Board , signed by the parties , and forwarded to the Minister of Labor . If a settlement of the dispute is not arrived at during the operations of the Board , the Board must make a full report thereon to the Minister , setting forth the various proceedings taken by the Board for ascertaining the facts and circumstances of the disputes ; and also setting forth such facts and circumstances , and its findings therefrom , including the Board 's recommendation for the settlement of the dispute according to the merits of the case . This recommendation must state in plain terms what , in the Board 's opinion , ought , or ought not , to be done by the parties concerned . This report is to be sent , free of charge , to the parties to the dispute and to the representative of any newspaper published in Canada who applies therefor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report in such manner as to him seems most desirable as a means of securing a compliance with the Board 's recommendation . Moreover , the report and recommendation of the Board , and any minority report , shall , without delay , be published in The Labor Gaette , monthly issued by the Canadian Department of Labor . Every Board of Conciliation and Investigation has all the powers of summoning witnesses , administering oaths , and of requiring witnesses to give evidence and to produce books and papers which are ordinarily vested in a court . Any party to the proceedings is competent , and may be compelled , to give evidence as a witness . In railroad cases , witnesses summoned by a Board are entitled to free transportation . The Board , or any member thereof , or any other person authorized in writing by the Board , may , without any other warrant than this Act , at any time , enter any building , mine , mine-workings , ship , vessel , factory , workshop , place or premises of any kind which has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Board must be conducted in public , unless the Board itself direct that certain of its proceedings be conducted in private . The Board may , with the consent of the Minister , employ experts to examine the books or official reports of either party to a dispute , but shall not disclose the reports of such experts without the consent of both parties to the dispute . Members of a Board are paid a moderate per diem , and are prohibited from accepting any perquisite or gratuity of any kind from any corporation or individual interested in a matter brought , or about to be brought , before the Board . Such being the method of organizing the Board , and its powers and duties when organized , the next interesting feature of this important Act relates to strikes-or lockouts prior to , or pending , reference to a Board . Under this Act , it is " unlawful for any employer to declare or cause a lockout , or for any employee to go on strike on account of any dispute prior to , or during , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Investigation . " But nothing in the Act prohibits the discontinuance of any industry , or of the working of any persons therein , for any cause not constituting a lockout or strike , and nothing in the Act restrains any employer from declaring a lockout , or any employee from going on strike , in respect to any dispute which has been duly referred to a Board and dealt with thereby , through investigation , publicity , and recommendation of a just settlement . Ultimate freedom to strike or to lock out is therefore preserved under this Act , but only after investigation by a public authority which secures complete publicity for the causes of the dispute and the claims of the disputants , and makes its own recommendation of a just settlement . The Act also requires employers and employees to give at least thirty days ' notice of an intended change affecting conditions of employment with respect to wages or hours ; and in every case where a dispute has been referred to a Board , neither of the parties nor the employees affected shall alter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or be concerned in doing , directly or indirectly , anything in the nature of a lockout or strike until the dispute has been finally dealt with by the Board . It is provided , however , that " if , in the opinion of the Board , either party uses this , or any other , provision of this Act for the purpose of unjustly  | maintaining a given condition of affairs through delay , and the Board so reports to the Minister , such party shall be guilty of an offense , " and be liable to fines . The penalties imposed by this Act are as follows : Any employer who declares or causes a lockout contrary to the provisions of the Act is liable to a fine of not less than $too nor more than $1,000 a day while such lockout exists ; any employee who goes on strike contrary to the provisions of this Act is liable to a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $50 a day while such employee is on strike ; and any person who incites , encourages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $1,000 . The procedure for enforcing these penalties is that described by Part 15 of the Canadian Criminal Code relating to summary convictions . The main points covered by this Act are , therefore , no change in wages or hours without thirty days ' notice ; no lockout or strike without a previous investigation of causes and demands by an impartial public authority , which secures complete publicity ; and therefore no lockout or strike unless it has been carefully considered by the parties most nearly concerned through a period which can hardly be less than two months , and has been publicly debated for a period which , under ordinary circumstances , will not be less than one month , and may easily he more . The Act applies directly only to certain specified industries , namely , mines and those connected with public utilities ; but the Act further provides that in the event of a dispute arising in an industry or trade not expressly included under the provisions of the Act , and such dispute threatens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike , either of the parties may agree in writing to allow such dispute to be referred to a Board of Conciliation and Investigation under the provisions of this Act ; and this agreement having been communicated : o the other party to the dispute , if that other Tarty agrees in like manner to allow the dispute to be referred to a Board , the dispute may be so referred , and the Board constituted in the manrer prescribed for mines and industries concerning public utilities . If a Board be constituted under the provisions of the Act , the lockout or strike , when in existence , shall forthwith cease . This novel and prudent Act went int ( effect on the 22d of March last , and has theref ) re been in effect at the time of this writing ( the 28th of August ) a little ever five months . Knowledge of the provisions of the Act , however , penetrated but slowly to the remoter or more isolated parts of Canada , and accordingly some strikes took place in the Dominion which were really unlawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge that they had become unlawful . The first application under the new Act was received by the Department of Labor on the 8th of April , on behalf of the Cumberland Railway and Coal Company of Spring Hill , Nova Scotia , the application bearing date of the 4th of April . The cause of the application by the Company was the demand of two lodges of the Provincial Workmen 's Association ( at Spring Hill ) that all the employees of the company become members of this association , and , to enforce this demand , the men had struck work . On the day , however , on which the application was received , the following telegram was also received by the Minister of Labor from the management of the company : " I have pleasure in advising you that all the men at Spring Hill Collieries have returned to work , and no question was raised on their return as to open or closed shop . Under the circumstances it will not be necessary to take further steps on the application for reference submitted by Cumberland Railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , in suspending work in the mines at Spring Hill , had been under the impression that the new legislation did not apply to Nova Scotia . A few days after their return to work the non-Unionists were persuaded to join the Provincial Workmen 's Association , and the object of the Unionists was thus attained . The second case which arose under the Act was a dispute between the Western Coal Operators ' Association and their employees , which took place during April of the present year , and involved about 3,500 employees . The Association had an agreement with their employees which expired on April 1 , and in consequence the greater part of March was spent in endeavoring to arrive at a new joint agreement . These conferences , however , failed to achieve their purpose . The existence of the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act having become known to both parties of the dispute , no strike was declared on April 1 , as would otherwise have been done . Since the Canadian Pacific and other railways operating in the Canadian West are largely dependent on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mining and smelting companies in British Columbia ,  --  a strike in these mines would have created widespread and serious embarrassment to the transportation and business interests of the country , and privation to thousands of families as well . On April 5 the employees of one of the companies represented in the Association asked , in proper form , for the appointment of a Board of Conciliation and Investigation , and applications  | to the same effect were soon after received from the employees of the other companies concerned . The employers at first protested against the statement of the case which the employees had made in applying for a Board , but shortly joined in the application for a Board , and named their representative on the Board . The members of the Board already appointed having failed to agree upon a third member , the Minister of Labor appointed the third member . Some of the companies belonging to the Association had , at the time of making their application for a Board , given notice of an intended reduction of wages , and this notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon by some of the employees as a declaration of war , and in consequence work was discontinued at several of the collieries at various times between April 15 and April 21 , so that by the 21st work had practically ceased at all the mines belonging to the companies comprising the Western Coal Operators ' Association , and in consequence general and wide-spread alarm was occasioned throughout the community . The Boards of Trade of many localities made immediate and strenuous representations to the Minister of Labor , who thereupon despatched the Deputy Minister to Fernie , in the mining region , four days distant from Ottawa . He found on the ground two members of the Board appointed , but the chairman had not arrived . The Union officials unanimously represented to him that the men had quit work in ignorance of the provisions of the new Act and not in defiance thereof . They suggested that a mass-meeting of the miners should be called at which the Deputy Minister should explain fully the provisions of the law . Meantime , a conference was being held at Fernie between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hoped might result in an agreement . Two days were allowed for the continuance of this conference , which , however , suddenly terminated without an agreement . Thereupon a mass-meeting of the miners was called , at which the Deputy Minister explained the provisions of the law and its bearings on the existing situation . In the evening a meeting was held behind closed doors to vote on the question of whether or not work should be resumed pending the inquiry by the Board . Between the public meeting held in the afternoon and the meeting in the evening , the Deputy Minister received the following letter on behalf of the Western Coal Operators ' Association : DEAR SIR : We beg to inform you that We hereby agree to reinstate to their respective places immediately all employees who have suspended work since April 1 , and agree that work shall be carried on under the prices , wages , and conditions of employment that were in existence in and around the various mine previous to April I , 1907 , and continue to work under these conditions until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Investigation appointed under the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act as to the merits of the dispute between the several companies comprising the Western Coal Operators ' Association and the employees of the said companies . Yours truly , THE WESTERN COAL OPERATORS ' ASSOCIATION . In the evening the Fernie Union unanimously decided that the men should return to work and await the finding of a Board of Investigation . On the following day votes on the resumption of work were taken at the remaining mines of the district , with the unexpected result that the district as a whole was not in favor of immediate resumption of work . The camps , within reach had been visited by Union officials who had attended the meetings at Fernie ; but some of the camps were more than two hundred and fifty miles distant from Fernie , and telegrams were the only communications possible . In some of the camps a large proportion of the miners were foreigners , and until the day on which the vote was taken many of them were not aware of the existence of the Act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that , had the existence and the provisions of the law been known and understood , there would have been no cessation of operations at the outset , and the vote on the resumption of work pending the investigation would not have resulted as it did . The Board of Investigation could not be fully organized before the 3oth of April , because its designated chairman could not arrive until that day . In the meantime , the general alarm of the public throughout the entire district was becoming hourly more acute . The Deputy Minister , therefore , promptly undertook to effect a settlement of the differences in advance of the actual organization on the spot of the Board of Investigation . In two days of negotiation he brought about an agreement acceptable both to the Operators and to the United Mine Workers , and procured assent to this agreement from both parties . The Union officials , however , wished a vote to be taken in all the unions of the district on the acceptance of this agreement . By the 4th of May the favorable result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed by the operators on the afternoon of that day . The Union officials promptly notified all the camps that an agreement had been concluded , and requested that work should be immediately resumed in all the mines . Accordingly work was promptly resumed . The  | agreement was for two years , and included the establishment of a permanent board , composed of representatives of both parties , before which disputes may be brought for final settlement . Important increases in wages were also provided for . The signed agreement contained no mention of the question of discrimination between Union and non-Union men ; but it was distinctly understood between the parties that there should be no discrimination on the part of the companies against Union men , or on the part of Union men against non-Union employees . The appointed Board of Conciliation and Investigation first met on the 30th of April , after the real settlement of the disputes had been effected , but adjourned from time to time to await the action of the operators and the unions . On the 6th of May they recorded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the oath of office , or to further proceed with the matters referred to them . " The good effects of the new Act were thus strikingly illustrated in the second case which arose under it , and a great disaster for employers , employees , and the public alike was prevented . The third request for the establishment of a Board of Conciliation and Investigation was received by the Acting Registrar at Ottawa on Saturday , April 20 , on behalf of certain machinists in the employ of the Grand Trunk Railway Company , who wanted a collective agreement in accordance with the terms of a schedule they had submitted to the company , and the company had refused to concede . About four hundred men were affected by the dispute . The machinists , through their representatives , had endeavored to arrive at an arrangement with the company , but without avail . In this case a Board was promptly constituted , and , in accordance with the provisions of the Act , met in Montreal on May 16 , 17 , and 18 , and concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving at an agreement on all points comprised in the dispute , accepted and signed by both parties to the dispute , and good for the period of one year from May 1 , 1907 . The matters in dispute covered many common features of industrial strifes , including wages , hours ( night and day work ) , overtime , classification of employees , number of apprentices , promotions , reinstatement of men on strike.or lockout , ? some of them had been out for over two years , ? and the recognition of the Union . As the investigation proceeded , concessions were made , in turn , by employers and employees , and a settlement was eventually reached that received the cordial approval of both parties . In this case a complex labor dispute , which had existed in part for several years , was satisfactorily ended without the loss of a day 's work to the men or a dollar to the company , and without injury to the business interests of the country or to the public . The award of the Board included the schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railway . The time required for the whole process from the application for the appointment of a Board to the giving of the award was one month . It is worthy of notice that the chairman of this Board was a professor of political economy at Queen 's University . On the 8th of May a lodge of the Provincial Workmen 's Association , consisting of the employees of the Cumberland Railway and Coal Company , applied for a Board of Conciliation and Investigation , the application setting forth that two disputes existed between the said workmen and their employer , and that the number of persons likely to be affected was 1,700 . A Board was quickly constituted under the provisions of the Act , and met at Spring Hill on the 23d of May , and sat again on May 24 . Evidence was presented by both sides , and the Board adjourned to meet on May 29 at Truro . The subjects of the dispute were highly technical , relating to the terms of payment respectively for " level crossing work " and " local stone in pillar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive at a conclusion without a further session and the hearing of additional evidence , and this further session was appointed for June 27 . A full public investigation was ultimately made ; but the Board was not unanimous in its decision , and the miners were unwilling to accept the findings of the majority . They subsequently struck , but not until the provisions of the Act had been fully complied with in every particular . Their right to strike after public investigation , if they were not satisfied with the award , is secured to them by the Act itself . These were the men who , on an earlier occasion , returned to work as soon as they found out that they had violated the Act in ignorance of its provisions . The first prosecution instituted against employees under the Act was brought during the month of May at Marble Bay , Texada Island , B. C. , it being alleged that the defendants , certain miners in the employ of the Texada Steel Company , had gone on strike prior to a reference of their dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken before a magistrate on the 30th of the month , both the company and the men being represented by counsel . The facts elicited before the magistrate clearly showed that there had been ignorance of the provisions of the Act and  | misunderstanding between the parties , and the case was adjourned to give opportunity for settlement . With the assistance of the magistrate and counsel , a settlement was effected , the prosecution dropped , and the strike declared at an end . The circumstances of this case were peculiar . A demand for higher wages had been made by the men on the 18th of March . On the 19th a telegram was sent from Tacoma from the office of the company to the manager at the mine , telling him to discontinue shipments temporarily because of a strike at the smelter in Tacoma . Some of the men were thereupon laid off on the 25th , whereupon all the employees struck ? three days after the Industrial Disputes Act came into effect . There had been great heat on both sides during the dispute ; the miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , on the other hand , the prosecution was equally sure of obtaining conviction . The case brings out clearly the great virtue of the Act in that it gives a fair and public opportunity for explanations and the clearing up of misunderstandings . The Department of Labor received during May another application for a Board , which illustrates in a different way from any of the preceding cases the merits of the Act . The application was on behalf of the employees of the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company , being miners , for the settlement of a dispute with the employing company . The company had refused to concede certain demands relating to wages and conditions of work , and the number of persons affected by the dispute was declared to be about four hundred miners , as well as the population of the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan . The plan set forth by the miners included a joint agreement for a period commencing June 1 , 1907 , and terminating March 31 , 1909 , and the agreement covered full recognition of the United Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hours from bank to bank , wages , and a scheme for the settlement of disputes during the life of the agreement . The Minister of Labor decided to establish a Board of Conciliation and Investigation , and so notified both parties to the dispute by telegraph . The company at first protested against the appointment of a Board ; but the Minister insisted that the public interests required the immediate establishment of a Board . The company still objected ; but the Minister pointed out that the appointment of a Board would in no way prevent the company from amicably discussing and arranging terms with its employees , and proceeded with the establishment of a Board . Only one member of the Board had been appointed when the following telegram was received at the Ministry from that member : Satisfactory agreement signed to-day with Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company . No need of Board now , thanks , to Industrial Disputes Investigation Act . Congratulations . This member was the miner who was nominated for membership on the Board by the applicants . It is evident that the prompt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry involved was due to the influence of the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act . When the machinery provided by the Act was set in motion , the parties to the dispute came together and adjusted their differences . One of the most important disputes during the month of May was that between the Shipping Federation of Canada and the Canadian Pacific Railway and Steamship Company , and the longshoremen of Montreal . This dispute concerned about i , 600 men , and was caused by a demand by the men for an increase of wages of five cents per hour . The application for a Board of Conciliation and Investigation came from the Shipping Federation of Canada , composed of fifteen different steamship lines , and was received by the Minister of Labor on the evening of May 14 . The longshoremen decided to strike on the evening of May 13 , and during the , next few days a large number of longshoremen ceased to work , and some of the strikers interfered with and intimidated other men of the same class who were willing to work . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act , but also in violation of a written agreement then in force between the steamship lines and the longshoremen . The Minister decided to establish a Board at once ; but , thinking that the newness of the Act had probably prevented the longshoremen of Montreal from becoming acquainted with its features , sent the Acting Deputy Minister to Montreal with instructions to explain the provisions of the Act , and to endeavor to persuade the men to conform to its requirements by resuming work pending the investigation before the Board to be established . The Deputy Minister discovered at once that the Act had been imperfectly understood by the men , but that it was going to be extremely difficult , in view of the existing crisis , to induce the men to return to work . He therefore thought it prudent to endeavor to effect an immediate settlement between the parties to the dispute . He succeeded in procuring a conference on May 16 between the committee of the men and the Shipping Federation , and a satisfactory basis of settlement seemed to be in view . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | canceled all propositions to the men , and telegraphed the Minister of Labor withdrawing their application for a Board . Their reasons are stated concisely in the following extract from a letter of explanation dated May 22 : In view of the situation , and more especially owing to the longshoremen not having returned to work , and being still on strike notwithstanding the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act , 1907 the men still declaring they were not on strike , and also owing to the two offers of the Shipping Federation and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company above mentioned an immediate increase of two and a half cents per hour worked and the submission of the claim of a further increase of two and a half cents per hour to arbitration having been refused by the longshoremen ; and , further , owing to it having become necessary to employ other men , and to enter into arrangements to engage other men , it was decided to telegraph you and the Registrar , desisting from the application for a Board of Conciliation and Investigation . On Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longshoremen Marine and Transport Workers of Canada agreed to return to work on May 20 on the terms offered by the Shipping Federation ; but the Shipping Federation answered that they could not take action on a communication signed on behalf of the Union . On May 21 , in the afternoon , the Acting Deputy Minister was informed by representatives of the men that the men had decided to return to work at once , and , in view of withdrawal by the Shipping Federation of its application for the appointment of a Board , that they themselves would make application for the establishment of such a Board . In the meantime , the Federation had issued a new schedule of wages , offering an increase of two and a half cents per hour to all comers , and the men , in returning to work , were able to avail themselves of this increase of wages . The men accordingly returned to work on Tuesday evening , May 21 , so far as employment could be found for them . The constitution of the Board was proceeded with immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Archbishop of Montreal being the third member and chairman of the Board . They were in session for several days , morning and afternoon , the sessions of June i 1 , 12 , and 13 being wholly given up to the hearing of evidence from the parties interested . On June ii the Shipping Federation , fourteen steamship lines , and the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company notified the Minister of Labor that they agreed to be bound by the recommendation of the Board during the present season of St. Lawrence navigation ( 1907 ) as if the same were an award of arbitrators , as provided by Section 62 of the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act , provided that the appliW . ELIOT 155 cants file forthwith with the Registrar an agreemeat in writing to be also bound in like manner . The Department thereupon sent letters to each of the parties to the dispute urging the desirability of each party agreeing to be bound by the award of the Board , and also suggesting that it would be greatly in the interest of both parties and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of years . The longshoremen , however , declined to be bound by the award of the Board . The Board reported to the Minister the causes of the dispute and some of the prominent features of the situation , and recommended moderate increases of wages after July 1 , 1907 , and for the season of 19o8 , with an agreement that any change of wages affecting the future shall take place between the first day of December , 1908 , and the first day of March , 1909 , fifteen days ' written notice to be given by either party to the other . A copy of this report was immediately forwarded by the Minister to each of the parties to the dispute , with a letter expressing the hope that the recommendations of the report would be accepted by the parties concerned . On June 25 the Department was notified that Local 373 of the International Longshoremen Marine and Transport Workers of Canada refused to accept the award , and on June 27 a communication was received from the shipping companies indicating that their attitude was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice was posted by the shipping companies : NOTICE TO LONGSHOREMEN OF THE PORT OF MONTREAL Commencing 1st July , 1907 , in order to give present effect to the decision of the Board of Conciliation and Investigation on the question of the longshoremen 's wages at the Port of Montreal . the undermentioned steamship lines , in addition to the present rates paid to longshoremen , will give such longshoremen as may register their names and addresses at the wharf office of the lines by which they are employed , and are prepared to work for the undersigned , when so requested to do , from 1st July until their last steamer of the season of 1907 leaves the port , a bonus of two and a half cents ( 2ki ) for each hour worked by them after 1st July to close of navigation , 1907 , said bonus to be paid . on application , by the lines by which they were employed after the sailing of the last steamer , but prior to 5th December , 1907 . Early in the month of July the Department was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 and 600 men had so far registered their names under the conditions stated in the above notice , and that the remainder of the men were expected to do so . It is worthy of notice that in this case , first , the men returned to work upon an understand-  | ing that the matter in dispute would be referred to a Board of Investigation under the Industrial Disputes Act ; and , secondly , that they have been working since under an agreement which has secured for them an increase of wages and is good for another year . The longshoremen in New York were also out on strike last spring , with the result that they were deprived of employment for a considerable number of weeks , and gained nothing in the end . A strike which took place at the silver-mines at Cobalt in July afforded no opportunity for observing the working of the Industrial Disputes Act , for neither the owners nor the men wished an inquiry , and , since the strike did not affect the public generally , an investigation was not pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent to Cobalt to explain the working of the Industrial Disputes Act , and to report whether a further inquiry on the part of the Department of Labor was desirable . His report made it clear that no further investigation was necessary . The Industrial Disputes Act has had a further good influence which is unquestionable , although it can not be demonstrated through public official records . There is every reason to believe that strikes would have taken place in Canada during the last spring and summer in many other instances but for the existence of this measure compelling public inquiry . The newspapers of Toronto , for example , were filled with reports about two months ago of a long-drawnout dispute and threatened strike , in which the Toronto Street Railway Company and its employees were concerned . The employees decided to ask for the appointment of a Board under the provisions of the Act , and a Board would have been promptly appointed had not an agreement been speedily effected between the company and its employees . In face of an inquiry under the Act , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Act , the company might have preferred to endure a strike , relying on sympathy for the company created through the inconvenience caused the public by an interruption of its service . A serious strike which would have tied up the Grand Trunk Railway system over a large portion of the Dominion was averted in June and July through the provisions of the Act , and a settlement was effected in August . This was a dispute between the Grand Trunk Company and its engineers . The negotiations between the parties had been broken off , and the strike would have been declared but for the provision of the Act requiring notice and investigation by a Board . A Board was appointed in the usual manner , and made a full report , which is not accessible at this writing ; but the result was an agreement between the parties in regard to conditions of employment , an agreement which covered a period of three years . As in the previous case of the machinists , this result was effected without loss to employees or employers , and without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would have been a sympathetic strike of telegraphers in Canada this summer but for the existence of this Industrial Disputes Act , which renders liable to punishment any persons who advocate a strike in this calling prior to a reference to a Board . It is an interesting question how the penal clauses of the Act are to be enforced . It was never intended that the Government should take upon itself the duties of a public prosecutor in this connection . If the law is violated , it is the duty of the persons aggrieved to take action . The case of the miners at Texada Island , to which reference has already been made , shows how the penal clauses may be evoked with effect . The advantages which this Canadian law has over any legislation existing in the United States may be briefly stated as follows : ( 1 ) There is no arbitration in it , compulsory or other . ( 2 ) It prevents sudden blows aimed by capital at labor or by labor at capital .
