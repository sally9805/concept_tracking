 |p571  IT is not a question of ambition , but a matter of necessity , that Japan should become a great power on the Asiatic continent . Should she fail in that , there is but one thing left for her ? national death . Our very existence depends upon her attainment of this object . It is forced upon us as a means of self-defence . As for our relation with Korea , that is not a matter of a single day . From the most remote period we have always been more or less together . A number of anthropologists are to-day gathering evidence proving that the race peopling the southern part of the peninsula of Korea is of the same stock as that whence we of Japan have sprung . Dr. Betz , in particular , spent a long time in Korea ; and , as a result of his scientific investigations , he tells us of the radical difference between the people of southern and those of northern Korea . They differ in their bony structure , for example ; those of northern Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south are kin to our own race . In ancient times , the famous chieftain of Kyushu , called Kumaso , raised the standard of revolt against the imperial house . He was in sympathy with Korea , whose cause he endeavored to serve . This it was which animated our heroic Empress Jingo to tear out the rebellion by the roots , declaring that the Kyushu rebels must be fought in Korea ; and the famous punitive expedition of Shinra , as a portion of the Korean peninsula was then called , has become one of our most cherished historical traditions . Our relations with Korea are therefore the inheritance of fifteen centuries . When the Tartars conceived the idea of conquering Japan , they began their process of subjugation with the Tartar tribes on the northern borders of the Korean peninsula , and thence proceeded southward . When their conquest over Korea was complete , they took offensive measures against the Kyushu coast . This , the Tartar expedition of the period of Tokimune , in the Hojo Shogunate , fell short of its object . Japan did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her first step was an expedition for the subjugation of Korea . For us as for the Tartar , Korea was the highway by which the goal of military glory was to be reached . Happily for Korea and the Mongol Empire , and unfortunately for us , the downfall of the Hojo Shogunate rang down the curtain upon this expedition , which might have been of far-reaching historic importance . Although the dream of that age failed to materialize , it was revived after  |p572  three hundred years . Under the leadership of the great military genius Toyotomi Hideyoshi , the Japanese army then made a victorious march through Korea , which , however , was arrested by the death of the great commander . Japan was also at that time rent by constant feuds at home . Everywhere military chieftains divided the Empire and struggled for the mastery . At last the unification of feudal Japan was brought about under Togugawa Isyasu , who founded the Togugawa Shogunate , which inaugurated nearly three hundred years of peace . In the tranquillity and ease of a fenced-in land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then came the present regime . In the early days of the restoration the old attitude on the Korean question was resumed . Kido wished to send a punitive expedition to the peninsula , as did Saigo in the sixth year of Meiji ( 1873 ) . Thus we see that , despite the changes wrought by time , the spirit remained the same . In the month of March of the ninth year of Meiji ( 1876 ) , we concluded a treaty of amity with the government of Korea , and so came into the relationship of a treaty power with her . Now , this , the famous treaty of Ko-Kwa , was the first treaty that Korea had ever concluded with any independent foreign state , with the single exception of China . A few years later , in 1882 , Seoul saw riotous outbreaks . The mob attacked our legation and burnt it . Our minister , Mr. Hanabusa , was forced to flee for his life , and by means of a surveying vessel of the British government off the coast managed to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , summoned a council to meet before the throne . Opinions were divided . While some of the members of this conference were for war , others declared for peace . Finally the peace party won the day . Yet it was impossible to ignore the whole affair . Our government therefore landed forces at Chemulpo as an armed escort to our minister , Mr. Hanabusa . Thereupon China also sent soldiers . For a time the whole world anxiously watched these proceedings . In the end , however , through the treaty of Saibutsuko , a peaceful settlement of the affair was reached . Two years later , in 1884 , a difference arose between our minister , Takezoe , and the Chinese minister to Korea ; and the soldiers of China and of Japan crossed swords in the very palace of the Korean king . This misunderstanding was adjusted by the treaty of Tien-Tsin , which enabled us to exact from China the admission that Korea was an independent state . It further stipulated that neither China nor Japan was to send soldiers into Korea without cause , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high contracting parties should notify each other of the movement of troops . The treaty was concluded through Marquis Ito , who acted as our envoy .  |p573  A matter of great significance in connection with the Tien-Tsin treaty is that here , for the first time in two thousand years , Japan changed her policy toward Korea . Prior to the treaty of Ko-Kwa , we had looked upon Korea as our enemy . We were ever on the alert for a favorable opportunity and justifiable cause for taking revenge upon her . After the conclusion of the treaty , however , the policy of revenge and invasion was entirely out of the question . For the first time the policy of Japan toward Korea changed in the direction of developing Korea and of leading her in the path of enlightenment . The first concrete expression of a radical change of policy , therefore , was the treaty of Tien-Tsin . In that treaty Japan forced China ? always savage in her attitude toward Korea and always looking down upon that country as one of her dependencies ? to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debarred China from carrying out at will rigorous measures of repression and of spoliation . There is no question as to the sincerity and uprightness of Japan in this regard . In 1894 , however , there arose , hornet-like , a band of men who styled themselves the Tong-haku party . Desolation , devastation , and bloodshed seemed to them mere pastime . Acts of positive savagery multiplied rapidly , and the Korean government seemed powerless . Indeed , it looked as if that government itself was encouraging this mad lawlessness of the Tong-haku . China at once found in this disturbance an excuse to send a large armed force into Korea . We also despatched troops , according to our right . This was the beginning of the war between Japan and China . Happily , in the following year , after gaining a complete victory , we saw the restoration of peace by the treaty of Shimonoseki . The peace secured by that treaty was , however , of a very temporary nature . The occupation of the Liao-tong peninsula by Japan was not at all favorable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of a Far Eastern empire . Evidently she felt that a protest proceeding from herself alone would prove ineffectual . She therefore sought to bring to her assistance two powers who had no great interests in that portion of the Far East , namely , France and Germany . As these powers could find no valid reason for protesting , they hit upon the idea of spreading the report that the occupation of the Liao-tong peninsula by Japan would be injurious to the peace of the Far East . As for Japan , she was powerless against this triple alliance . The Liao-tong peninsula , which she had bought with the blood and tears of her people , was restored to China . It is true that , in the treaty of Tien-Tsin , China had acknowledged the independence of Korea . But that was merely the text of a treaty . The fact is that China subsequently dealt with Korea precisely as if that  |p574  country were still one of her dependencies . After the war with Japan , however , China definitely recognized the independence of Korea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these services rendered in her behalf , did Korea show the slightest gratitude toward or confidence in Japan ? During the war with China , and for some time after the successful termination of that war , Korea did appear to be friendly toward us . Immediately upon the restoration of the Liao-tong peninsula , however , through the coercion of the triple alliance before referred to , there came a sudden and complete change in the attitude of the Korean government and its people toward Japan . Instead of putting their trust in Japan , instead of being friendly to her , they looked upon her with suspicion , indeed , with decided disfavor . Hardly had we relieved Korea from the domination of China , and that , too , at great cost , when the peninsula was invaded by another power , much more remorseless and cruel , and naturally more dangerous . Russia now took the place of China at the court of Seoul . The ambition of Russia was not to be compared with that of China . Such was its madness that it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend its policy of aggression against Japan as well . For ten years we exhausted every means to bring about a happy settlement in order to avoid a crisis and to persuade Russia to change her mind . We tried commercial treaties and numerous other methods of pacification in vain . Finally , in February , 1904 , diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed , and the world witnessed one of the greatest wars of modern times . It is evident , therefore , that the cause both of the Chino-Japanese and of the Russo-Japanese war was the independence of Korea . The two wars differ , so far as we are concerned , in details only . With China we had cultivated pleasant relations for two thousand years ; as regards Russia , hatred of one hundred years ' standing had been nurtured . After this brief historic review , I wish to say something of the geographical position of Korea . Judged by her area , Korea is not a great country . Being a peninsula , her coastline is exceedingly long . The climate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is extremely cold because of the Arctic tides which wash the coast at that point . There the climate is something like that of our Hokkaido , or of Karafuto . The southern and western shores of the country , however , receive the benefit of the equatorial current , as does our own favored coast of Kyushu . In the fisheries there is a source of great wealth . Moreover , the small islands that dot the seas here like stepping-stones contribute to the convenience of her fishermen . Along her northeastern littoral the marine products are much like those of our northern waters , and herring and salmon abound . Along her southern and western coast , the waters teem with fish similar to p 575 those which exist in the waters of Kyushu . During the recent war , a large number of people derived a considerable income from the fishery enterprises in the Korean waters and in the Yellow Sea , with the product of which they supplied the navy and army . It has been reported that , in this section of the seas , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none can deny the wealth of the marine products of the Korean waters . With the introduction of modern methods and appliances , a great revenue could be derived from this source . Although a small country , Korea on land has the advantage of being connected with a great continent . Her rivers , for example , are large . Owing to the absence of industrial education , the Koreans , at present , are not deriving as much benefit from their navigable streams as they otherwise might . By the application of enterprise and intelligent effort , the Korean streams can be converted into a valuable system of communication ; and the numerous harbors , situated as they are on an extensive coastline , may in time become valuable centres of commerce . With the establishment of transportation facilities , both by sea and on land , Korea will see the advent of a new day . Some have declared the soil of Korea to be sterile , and the yield but half of that of Japan . I have not , found reason to put any faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Korean farms is scanty at present as compared with that produced on a similar area in our own land . At the same time , it must always be kept in mind that agriculture in Korea is still primitive . I am of the opinion that it is not so much to the soil itself , but to waste and carelessness , as well as the absence of scientific methods , that the present agricultural conditions must be attributed . As soon as suitable improvements , both in implements and methods of agriculture , shall have been secured , it will be seen that , after all , the difference between the Korean and Japanese soils is not so great as at present supposed . I have learned indeed , from a number of people who have come home from their investigations in Korea , that , in a large part of the peninsula , the soil is much richer than in Japan . It should also be borne in mind that the neglected and uncultivated area is very extensive . Perhaps , therefore , one is justified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same as that of Japan . Taking the present population of Korea at 10,000,000 , the country should be able to support about 30,000,000 additional population . Placing the annual increase of our population at half a million , Korea should therefore be able to absorb our surplus population for fifty or sixty years to come . Placer mining in Korea is yielding much profit . In this field there is large room for the introduction of modern methods and machinery ; and there can be no question as to the vast increase of production that would  |p576  follow such improvements . Forestry , like agriculture , is not developed in Korea . The timber business has not been very prosperous of late . Still , there are many forests in the peninsula which have not seen an axe in a hundred , or perhaps a thousand , years , because of the lack of transportation facilities . Korea is in the position of the miser who hoards his treasure , fearing to put it to use . Should the waterway transportation facilities of Yalu once become an established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great treasure-house in the thickly wooded stretch of northern Korea . On the plains of Korea , cattle raising has been tried . The methods , as in other industrial activities , are quite elementary , and , of course , the stock is not very select . Yet , notwithstanding these obstacles , the Koreans raise cattle for export , although they themselves consume considerable meat . As for minerals , the fame of the Korean mines has travelled far . The country is especially rich in coal and iron ; and these two minerals are an acknowledged factor in the civilization of a people . Besides , a great majority of the iron works of Japan are in Kyushu , that portion of our country which is nearest to the peninsula . To us , therefore , the development of these minerals in Korea would prove very advantageous . Altogether , the work to be performed here is one of great promise . Since the beginning of the recent war , owing to the unbroken series of victories which Japan gained over Russia , the influence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned , are things of the past . And now , what is our own policy toward Korea ? What should that policy be ? Younger men would say : Conquer Korea and occupy her territory at once . They neither understand the national policy of Japan , nor do they appreciate what she has learned in the past . For many years , the failure and impotency of the Korean government have been the root of all the political troubles in the Far East . The neighbors of Korea have always been the victims of her lamentable weakness , the sufferers from her abuses and blunders . This is true particularly of our own country . We have been forced to take up arms against China and against Russia ? all because of her . It is plain , then , that the work of superintending and guiding into the path of righteousness and health the sadly tangled affairs of Korea , both domestic and international , is more than a mere measure of self-defence on the part of Japan ; it is a matter of world-wide significance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East of its political sins , she will be entitled to the respect and gratitude of the world , far permanent peace in this portion of the globe will thereby be established .. Korea will then , in truth , become an independent state . This is the only policy for Japan to pursue with regard to the troublesome Korean ques/ tion . Indeed , it is a positive duty imposed upon the power which has taken up the guardianship of the Far Eastern balance of affairs . Of the many and varied problems which call for solution , the economic one is of paramount importance . To-day almost all else depends upon the economic health of a state . If , therefore , we should fail to solve this problem , all our efforts toward a settlement of Korean politics and the establishment of order in the military and foreign affairs of the peninsula would end in failure . Korea would fail , just as Spain and Portugal have failed . To conquer another land through the might of arms is a very temporary affair . If successful , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an achievement of ages . On the other hand , success in the upbuilding of the economic affairs of a land is not at all of a temporary nature : it exerts a long and permanent influence . All history shows this . If our policy toward Korea is to be attended with permanent results , it must be carried out first of all along the lines of economic advancement . Nothing else would be able to place Korea in the position of maintaining her independence , and nothing else would permit us to hope for the permanence of peace in the Far East . Her gain is our gain . Truly profitable dealings between individuals are always mutual ; and this is true also of nations . In a deeper sense , and looking at it from the larger aspect of things , we can never achieve greatness for our own country at the expense of our neighbors , especially of Korea . As we keenly study the interests of Japan , we must necessarily at the same time recognize the rights and interest of the peninsula . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of colonization . Now , there are people who would have you believe that the Japanese are not at all successful as colonizers . They submit as proof the Hokkaido colonization scheme , which failed in spite of every encouragement offered by the government . They also point to the fact that America , Hawaii , and Mexico are trying to exclude our laboring classes from their shores . It is undeniable that the colonization work in Hokkaido was not very successful . But why ? The question may be easily answered . The densest population of Japan is in the southwest . As one goes north , the population decreases in density . Now , the only colonists who could have made the Hokkaido colonization work successful would have been people accustomed to similar climatic conditions ? the people of northern Japan , for instance . But in that portion of our country there was no need for emigration ; there was plenty of room at home . Moreover , the question of travelling expenses entailed by a journey from the southern portion of our empire to the extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonists .  |p578  So much for Hokkaido . The hostile attitude of the nations of North America is not due to the fact that our laboring classes are lacking in the qualities which go to make the successful colonist : it is due to an entirely different cause . It is feared there that the presence of Japanese laborers would bring about a competition between these and the working classes of the respective countries involved , to the financial detriment of these latter . This hostility against Japanese immigrants furnishes a rather eloquent commentary on the superior endowment of the Japanese laborer , which enables him to stand out as the fittest in a keen competition . The distance between Japan and Korea is such that a person standing on a certain point on our coast can discern the outline of our neighbor 's domain through a fairly powerful telescope . From Karatsu , Kyushu , to Pusan , Korea , is only six or seven hours ' steaming . Karatsu , in the distant days of Hideyoshi , was the base of operations which that chieftain chose when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of dense populations . It is situated in that southwestern district where , from time immemorial , could always be found a large number of fishermen . When the fisheries in the Korean waters shall be developed , Karatsu will , in all probability , become a large depot and distributing centre for marine products , commanding the markets of Korea . Colonization work in Korea will confer a twofold benefit . On the one hand , it will provide a home and a field of activity for the ever increasing population of our own country , and thus lessen among us the number of idlers , those parasites of human society . On the other hand , it will help materially to develop the resources of Korea , and so increase the wealth of that country . Moreover , with the increase of the Japanese population there , our foreign trade with the peninsula will of necessity become more extensive and more prosperous . Nor is this all . Our industrious farmers and skilful fishermen can not fail to exert a favorable influence upon the Koreans themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of our frugal race may lead the Koreans in the direction of work and of economy , and encourage them to save their earnings . When the administration is corrupt , it naturally comes about that the officials also become more and more avaricious and lawless . Under such circumstances , the question of saving earnings on the part of the workingmen is a mere farce . What little money they may be able to put by is taken away from them as soon as their savings are covered by the officials . Let the old order of things once be removed , and the corrupt officials will have no opportunity for further spoliation at pleasure ; and let the property rights of the people be respected and their persons held sacred in the eyes of the law , and a new era in economic conditions of the Korean people will have dawned.  |p579  The economic salvation of Korea depends much upon the establishment of transportation facilities and the installation of better means of communication . Nature has been partial to her . The sea surrounds her on three sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yalu covers with its waters a large portion of the territory which adjoins Manchuria . Therefore steamship lines are of paramount importance with her . As for railways , one line starts from Fusan and runs to Seoul ; the other line runs westward from Seoul to Wiji . The Seoul and Fusan Railway , which covers about 274 miles , was completed on the 10th of November , 1904 , and on the 1st of January , 1905 , it was opened for traffic . The line was undertaken by a private company at first , which did not expect to have it in operation until 1907 . Upon the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War , however , the requirements of military transportation hastened its completion . By means of this railroad line , the distance between Tokio and Seoul has been materially shortened . There are 1,118 miles between the two capitals . Before the construction of the railway , it took nearly a week to make the journey . To-day , it can be made in two days and eight hours . When everything shall be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty hours . One hardly realizes how much this will affect the economic condition of Korea and our industrial enterprises there . Nor should the political and diplomatic significance of having Seoul within fifty hours of Tokio be overlooked . After all , however , the Seoul-Fusan line , with its steamship connections , is but one of many lines which will have to be established . From Tokio , through Fusan , Seoul , and Chemulpo , the line is extending its way to Wiji . But it must not stop there . From Wiji , it must cross the Yalu to Yinkan . It should be in touch with the East China Railway , and so come into direct connection with Vladivostock and St. Petersburg on the north . At the same time it may be brought into direct connection with Peking via the the Tien-Tsin Railway . I am of the opinion that Peking is to be a great railway centre in the future . A European railway , such as the CentralAsiatic line proposed by Russia , or one which , coming through Constantinople , would pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with and beyond the present Bagdad line ? any or all of such roads could run to Peking as a terminus . When our Korean line shall have a direct connection with Siberia and Europe to the north , and with Peking on the south , the port of Fusan will find itself one of the principal gateways of eastern Asia . As for the island empire of Japan , that country would find in Fusan the connecting link between her own territories and the two great continents of Asia and Europe . The Korean Railway will in this way become part  |p580  and parcel of the machinery of world-communication . Although it differs materially from our lines at home , the men in charge of our administration virtually regard it as one of these . They have , however , unfortunately permitted it to become partly a private line . The fact that the East China Railway , ceded by Russia , is government property , whereas the Korean Railway is to some extent a private enterprise , presents a very anomalous condition , which may lead to considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-governmental property makes matters still more complicated . Here then , in the very centre of a system , world-wide in its ramifications , we have a line governed partly by private interests and partly by governmental policy . As the state has a vital interest in maintaining unity of management and control , I earnestly hope that the trans-Korean railway will become a government line , fitly commemorating our recent victorious campaign against Russia .
