txt A long distance telephone message , received at Police Headquarters last night from Detective sergeant McConville , at Elkton , Md. , told of the arrest there of Charles Augustus Seton , the broker and promoter . Seton was arrested on a farm near Elkton as a fugitive , from justice . He has waived extradition , and the message said that he would start with McConville for - New York at once . The promoter was working as a laborer on a small farm a few miles from Elkton . Seton is under suspicion in connection with forging of Norfolk and Western Railway stock certificates . He was arrested last September on a charge of . grand larceny , the allegation being that he , with ' Harrison and Ropert H. Waldron , had got $6,675 from the incorporators of the Houton and Galveston Interurban Railway Company by pretending that they , as promoters , were able to float $3,000,000 worth of bonds of the company among clients in Philadelphia . Seton and his associates , it was charged , assured William B. Slosson , W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. Whitcomb , who represented/ he incorporators of the Texas corporation , that the Equitable Trust Company would certify the bonds and act as transfer agent . The 80,675 was alleged to have been obtained from the railway Incorporators as advance charges for the printing of the bonds , &c.,; although the bonds were never delivered . Seton was released on $5,000 bail and his trial was set for next Monday . After furnishing the bail he disappeared from his usual haunts in this city , and his offices at 41 Wall Street were abandoned . Then s spicion turned on him last week in the orfolk and Western bond frauds . Detective Sergeant McConville went to I Elkton a day or two ago with Assistant Superintendent Mulholland of the Pinkerton , . Detective Agency in Philadelphia . The Pinkertons have had track of Seton I ever since he was admitted to bail last Fall . Superintendent George Dougherty of I the Pinkertons went to the District Attorney 's Office on Monday to find what had been taken from Seton when he was arrested on the swindling Charge . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's - effects had come upon , selithographer 's proof of a hundred ' share certificate of the Norfolk and Western common stock . The proof bore corrections . In one place it was marked " print in blue ink . " Along with the proof was a letter on paper of the Waldor-Astoria purporting to have been written by an official of the Norfolk and Western . It was addressed to Seton , and authorized him to have the certificates printed . Seton had given the Hamilton Bank Note Company an order for 500 of the blank certificates , ordering them in books of 250 each .. This was a fatal mistake on his part , because the genuine certificates are not bound in books , but are issued with cut edges . The marks of the perforations where the false certificate had been torn was perhaps the principal point that led to the detection of the forgeries . The Pinkertons ever since they took the case have been going through the trade trying to find the lithographer who owned the vignette of the locomotive facing the wrong way , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this they have not succeeded . From counsel for the Hamilton Bank Note Company Supt. Dougherty has learned that that concern received and executed the order for 500 certificate blanks . No further forged certificates are known to have been floated beyond those discovered in this city by the Guaranty Trust Company and that Which has been traced from Cleveland to Boston . EQUITABLE MAY BUILD ANEW . Insurance Company Now Owns- a Whole Block on Lower Broadway . By the purchase of 17 Nassau Street , adjoining the northwest corner of Pine Street , an eight-story building , on a plot 25 by 68 , the Equitable Life Assurance Society has completed its ownership of the entire block , bounded by Broadway , Nassau , Pine and Cedar Streets . The property was sold by Sohn Egmont Schemerhorn , represented by his cousin , A. E. Schemerhorn . Broker John N. Golding negotiated the deal . The Equitable Life has been In control of the property for nearly twenty years , under a lease made through Mr. Golding in 1887 , arid that there was any parcel in the entire-block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even to many real estate men . The purchase of the small lot on Nassau Street probably brings a little nearer the project for the erection of a new modern skyscraper covering the whole of the Equitable block . So far as could be learned yesterday , the scheme is just ' where it has always been  --  among future possibilities  --  but it is generally admitted that the present buildings on this property yield a comparatively small return on the great value represented by the ground itself . The Equitable Life 's first purchases in this block , made nearly thirty-five years ago , covered the property at the southeast corner of Broadway and Cedar Street . The block 's area is nearly 50,000 square feet , or about twenty full city lots , with frontage of 167.11 feet on Broadway , 310.1 feet on Cedar Street , 152.3 feet on Nassau Street , and 005.5 feet on Pine Street . Estimates of the present value of the . property , if it were to be sold as a whole , vary from 817 , - 000,000 to $20,000.000. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
