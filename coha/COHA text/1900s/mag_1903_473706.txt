WHEN Emerson was born , in Bos ? ton , on the twenty-fifth day of May , one hundred years ago , the country was provincial in culture , taste , and attitude ; it had separated from the Old World on political grounds , but its spiritual fortunes were bound up in the fortunes of the older societies ; it sat at the feet of Europe , and its in ? tellectual life was essentially derivative . To Emerson more than to any other single person or force was due the spiritual emancipation of the new nation . He first interpreted the growing demo ? cratic community , not only to the world , but to itself , by defining its fundamental conception of the place and value of the individual man , by developing its con ? sciousness of historical unity with the older races at the same time that he declared its spiritual independence , by showing in his own life and thought and speech how the culture of the race , accumulated with infinite toil , self-denial , and self-expression , could be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have come to many who beard the address on " The American Scholar , " delivered in Cambridge on the last day of August , 1837 , a sense of some ? thing great and prophetic ; Lowell de ? scribed it as " an event without any former parallel in our literary annals , a scene to be always treasured in the memory for its picturesqueness and its inspiration . What crowded and breath ? less aisles , what windows clustering with eager heads , what enthusiasm of ap ? proval , what grim silence of foregone dissent . " The address was not only an epitome of Emerson 's view of life ; it was a quiet , well-poised , but perfectly articulate , declaration of intellectual independence . It is the second great formal document in the history of the emancipation of the American people . It announced the mo ? ment when " the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expecta ? tion of the world with something better than the exertions of mechanical skill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the learning of other lands , draws to a close . . . We will walk on our own feet ; we will work with our own hands ; we will speak our own minds ... . A nation of men will for the first time exist , because each believes himself in ? spired by the Divine Soul which also in ? spires all souls . " When these words were spoken the spirit of the new nation was already stirring and striving . Irving had written Knickerbocker 's History of New York , and other more characteristic books , Cooper had published The Spy ! and sev ? eral of the Leatherstoeking Tales , Poe had touched a new chord in prose and verse ; Bryant had given the world Thanalopsis and a group of nature lyrics ; Hawthorne had written Twice-Told Tales ; but it was Emerson , in this memorable address , who not only laid bare the tap-root of the democratic order in society , ? its recognition of the divine in every human soul , ? but who saw and said that new men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express them . Emerson 's active life fell within the period of sectional development and feel ? ing . Provincial America , with its hands at work in the New but its thoughts still centred in the Old World , slowly gave place to sectional America , with its fresh and crude sense of strength , its empha ? sis of interest on local growth and power , its sharp definition 0f local interests . Emerson 's sympathies and personal asso ? ciations were inevitably colored by the conditions of time ; but his thought es ? caped their limitation . A man of the purest and highest New England Hood and breeding , at a time when men were New-Englanders , New-Yorkers , Virgin ? ians , or South-Carolinians , Emerson was an American in the range and freedom of his thought ; a man of national instincts and outlook in an epoch of sectional di ? visions and antagonisms . The depth and fulness of national feeling he could not compass , because no man can adequately express that which does not exist ; but he discerned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation in almost every characteristic utterance . When the war between the sections ended , Emerson was in the serene ma ? turity of a nature so harmonious that it seemed to share the unconscious growth of the world about him , but his work was substantially finished ; he had delivered his message . The echoes of the sectional strife were slowly dying , the fires of sectional antagonism slowly sinking , during his beautiful old age ; the nation which he foretold was swiftly forming itself , and was already putting its hand to colossal works with an energy which has disturbed men of less pene ? tration of spiritual insight than he . At the end of a century since he was born in one of the capitals of provincial America , how stands the account of the new na ? tion with him ? Does his work bear the limitation of the period in which it was produced , or does it so habitually relate itself to universal experience and to fun ? damental truth that it remains an inter ? pretation of a later and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and con ? fusion of an epoch of expansion ? The key to an age is to be found , not in its activities , but in its thought ; the significance of activities resides , not in their mass and magnitude , but in their disclosure of aim and spirit . In at ? tempting to measure Emerson 's relation to the wider horizon of the twentieth century , and to indicate his vital and necessary rather than incidental and in ? dividual relation to the nation , it is for ? tunate that his own life was so entirely detached from the working life of his people ; that he lived and died in an at ? mosphere of such serenity that it is pos ? sible to realize not only his thought , but his complete expression of it , with entire distinctness . No man of letters has ever left a cleaner record ; in his case there are no moral problems to distract atten ? tion from his thought and his art ; no contradictions between aim and action to confuse the judgment . A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , in literature at least , no man has so happily unified his vision and his task . ft is not difficult to point out his limitations of thought and experience ; but the man was all of one piece , to quote a pithy colloquialism . At the end of a century from his birth he stands , in the clear air of Concord , as distinct from base to summit as Monadnock or Wachu ? sett , which stood always in his view . And although he spoke freely of the matters that were uppermost in the mind of his own time , he was so bent on find ? ing the unity of power and purpose be ? hind the urgencies of spirit and the di ? versities of thought that there is no need in his case , as there is in Carlyle 's , to sepa ? rate what was universal and permanent in his work from what was shaped and col ? ored by the emotion or interest of the hour . His serene detachment , his steady determination to feed the light rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? thing of the powerful personal influence which Carlyle exerted on his contempo ? raries , but has made it easier for posteri ? ty to understand and estimate him . There is less of the accidental and more of the universal in hip work than in the work of any other writer of his period ; he used the language of his time , and drew upon it freely for illustration , but he was a purely spiritual force . In this fact lies the secret of his escape from the limita ? tions of sectional America , and his im ? mense and permanent service and signifi ? cance of the nation in its full , if not its final , development . More distinctly than any other man who has appeared among us , Emerson affirmed the presence of the divine in every human being , the direct and per ? sonal relation between each man and the Infinite , the authority of individual in ? sight , the dignity of the individual soul ; and this is , in a true sense , not only the basal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought bad very wide hori ? zons , and touched all forms of human activity ; be united in rare degree the ripeness and repose of the historic races with the fresh interest , the quick enthu ? siasm. of a people whose history was still to be made . The equilibrium between the sobriety of long experience and the eager faith which has not yet fully tested the resources of life , gave his spirit a beautiful poise , and he is one of the few great thinkers and writers in whom the wisdom of youth survives and dominates the knowledge of age . His deeply medi ? tative spirit , the vein of mysticism which ran through his intellectual rather than his emotional life , his penetrating insight into the spiritual realities behind the shifting appearances of the world , drew him to the religious thought of the Farther East , the background of the his ? toric life of the race . No one has more clearly and compactly stated the differ ? ence in temper between the Eastern mind and the Western than did he in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of im ? movable institutions , the seat of a phi ? losophy delighting in abstractions , of men faithful in doctrine and in practice to the idea of a deaf , unimplorable , im ? mense fate , is Asia ; and it realizes this faith in the social institutions of caste . On the other side , the genius of Europe is active and creative : it resists caste by culture ; its philosophy was a discipline ; it is a land of arts , inventions , trade , freedom . . . . Plato came to join , and by contact to enhance , the energy of each . " It may be added that Plato carried the evolution of thought a step farther ; building on the basis of the unity of all the manifestations of life , he passed on to its realization of itself in the individual consciousness , to that di ? versity which marks the higher stages of evolution , to freedom and immor ? tality based on that free but responsible putting forth of personal energy and husbanding of personal experience which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element in each of these views of life is preserved ; in him , as in Plato , the two poles of thought are always visi ? ble . He holds both conceptions in their historical order : first the perception of unity and the sense of fate , then the realization of diversity and the sense of freedom . But he does not concern him ? self to make every utterance square with his fundamental view ; he was too deeply and , at times , too exclusively the poet , to give his work the formal consistency of the logician . He would have prefaced the essay on " Self-Reliance , " which is an extreme application of Western ideas to individual life , with the poem " Brahma , " which is a bit of the oldest Orientalism in poetic form , and taken it for granted that his reader would stand in no need of the mechanical aid of note or comment to reconcile the two . It was quite of a piece with Emerson 's spiritual valuation of the human spirit , and the beautiful respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reader 's co ? operation for granted ; he never explained , because he assumed that those who were drawn to him would bring to his page the divination of an imagination like his own in kind , if not in degree . These two conceptions of life are in antagonism only when they are placed on a parity of time ; taken in the order of their development they fall into line , not only with the facts of experience , but with the needs of the soul . What was significant in Emerson 's thought as , in a sense , marking the point of departure in the spiritual life of the New World , was its full acceptance of what had been secured by the historic past , with unfettered freedom in dealing with the present and confident expecta ? tion that the future had still larger truth to disclose . There was nothing revolu ? tionary in Emerson , but the radicalism of democracy found in him free , frank , and harmonious expression . No man of a new age ever bore himself more rev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch of the brusqueness of the re ? former , the crudeness of the radical , the passion of the advocate , in him ; he ac ? cepted truth from every quarter , he saw good in everything , but he saw also that the race was only at the beginning of goodness and truth . This delightful air of self-possession without a touch of self-assertion was characteristic of Emerson , and had its roots deep in his nature . He had great respect for dignities and powers and au ? thority , but he looked at them , with level eyes , on a basis of entire equality , and was never diverted from a true valuation by the show of things or overawed by a splendor which rested on any un ? reality . In Representative Men , one of his most characteristic books , this reverence for spiritual achievement , com ? bined with indifference to the accidents of birth and station , and the quiet use of the right of one human soul to interro ? gate another on equal terms , is strikingly illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always evoked a lyrical de ? light in Emerson , and in enumerating the functions of the scholar his prose often rose in to the region of eloquence : " The scholar is the favorite of heaven and earth , the excellency of his country , the happiest of men . " But no man who has held the rich accumulations of know ? ledge in his keeping kept them more resolutely in their place and in rela ? tion to their uses . Emerson kept the faith of scholarship with glad-hearted fidelity , but he had no patience with its superstitions . He was as free with it as with all other tools and instruments made for man 's use . The old books , which have given laws to the mind and lighted the ways of the spirit as with fire from heaven , are to be devoutly pondered and carried in one 's heart , but to-day speaks with as much authority as that in which Job talked with his friends and the Iliad was recited to listening throngs . " Each age must write its own books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeding . The books of an older period will not fit this . . . 15-leek young men grow up in libraries , believing it their duty to accept the views which Cicero , which Locke , which Bacon have given ; forgetful that Cicero , Locke , and Bacon were only young men in libraries when they wrote these books . " When a book is accepted as a final authority it becomes a tyrant , and men must again affirm their freedom . Emerson 's quiet but resolute assertion of the right of every age to select its teachers , and of every man to go straight to the sources of truth , seemed to Hermann Grimm profoundly sig ? nificant . He speaks with a sense of oppression of the immense accumulation of knowledge , the heritage of decades of centuries , under which the mind of the Old World staggers . " Our best pow ? ers barely suffice , " he says , " to enable us to glance over what has been already accomplished . It would be hailed as a blessing if some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be set aside , that untrammelled we may press on to the goal before us . " And he saw that this was precisely the servicewhich the poet and thinker of the New World was doing in a reverent spirit but with a perfectly free mind . Emerson es ? timated at their full value the accumu ? lations of knowledge which lay in the vaults of Europe , but he was resolute that his own people should make their own intellectual and spiritual fortunes ; that they should be not only heirs of the past , but producers of present wealth . They were not to feel too heavily the weight of history ; they were not to respect too deep ? ly the authority of tradition ; they were to see , feel , think , and act for themselves ; they were to " enjoy an original relation to the universe . . . The sun shines to ? day also . There is more wool and flax in the fields . There are new lands , new men , new thoughts . Let us demand our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Emerson was the logi ? cal outcome of his estimate of the indi ? vidual soul , of the supreme importance he attached to man as man ; the active , work ? ing , creative spirit behind all forms of civilization . Behind the wealth of the world of every kind he was concerned only with the producer ; for the chief sig ? nificance of wealth is the kind and quality of the genius which created it , and its value lies in the uses to which it can be put by that genius . Rank , privi ? lege , position , interest him because they are the symbols of achievement , past or present . They are pictorial , symbolical , historical ; but they are , at the best , only the insignia of the man . In the presence of the most venerable and transcendent work of his hand man is still master , creator , divining spirit ; he alone is sacred and immortal . When Emerson , who faced the sphinx , the Parthenon , the greatest library , the congress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? man soul , he is filled with reverence , and a lyric cry rushes to his lips : " The great Pan of old , who was clothed in a leopard-skin to signify the beautiful variety of things , and the firmament , his coat of stars , was but the representative of thee , O rich and various Man ! thou palace of sight and sound , carrying in thy senses the morning and the night and the un ? fathomable galaxy ; in thy brain the geometry of the City of God ; in thy heart the bower of love and the realms of right and wrong . " This is the fundamental attitude of democracy , not as a form of political or social order , but as a view of man 's place and authority in the world ; a recognition of his spiritual significance ; the con ? summation of the long process of history in the complete emancipation of the in ? dividual spirit , with full freedom to choose for itself its manner of life and the type of its development . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally him with the political creed of his time and place ; it allies him with the historic movement which came to clear consciousness in his work and which found its earliest institutional ex ? pression , on a great scale , in the New World . He is the incarnation and the exponent of democracy as a spiritual force , but democracy as a political order still lags far behind him . Nature , written in the seclusion of the Old Manse at Concord , was the first fruitage of the unfettered freedom which he sought and found when he exchanged the pulpit for the Lyceum platform , and remains the most beautiful and complete disclosure of his thought . Sixty-seven years have not dispelled the mystery and charm that make it enigmatical to many readers , but have kept it from profane hands to this day . It is a key to the spiritual meaning of Nature which can be turned only by the imagi ? nation ; it is a poet 's gospel in eight chapters . Appearing at the moment when the tide of scientific activity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of fact and form , however comprehensive and searching . It does not conflict with a movement in which Emerson rejoiced ; it penetrates be ? low the region of its activity , and rests securely on the ultimate foundations . It stands serenely in a place by itself ; it uses no machinery of investigation , em ? ploys no instruments of observation , is worked out without the aid of logical formube , fortifies itself with no argument ? ments , contains no reference to authori ? ties , and is without foot-notes . It is a piece of pure divination ; it has been contradicted , confuted , travestied , par ? odied ; but its serenity , its beauty , the sense of mystery and worship which per ? vades it , persuade men of imagination and insight of its essential truth . What is significant , for the purpose of this comment , is not whether its con ? ception of Nature as a series of images " in the firmament of the soul " is true or false , but its exaltation of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , with the Infinite in the creation of the universe . The Hebrew poet saw Nature as the vesture of God , the garment which veiled but did not conceal the splendor of the Almighty ; Emerson found in man the key to Nature , and discerned in Na ? ture the vast symbolism of the soul , the order of its discipline , the provision for its education , the language for its expression , the prophecy of an ultimate harmony be ? tween a purified sou : and an external order from which all that is unclean , inimical , diseased , and unlovely has van ? ished . This interpretation of Nature , with its lofty faith , its profound insight , its lyrical eloquence , is , in reality , a poetic interpretation of man ; a recog ? nition not only of the divine in every man , but of the potentiality of deity in every man ; it proclaims man , in a sense , the creator of Nature . The greatness with which Emerson invested the human spirit was reflected not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and art , and in his own style . In diverting atten ? tion from the trappings and insignia of public and social distinction , and fasten ? ing it upon the spirit behind the acci ? dents or incidents of life , he discarded the conventions and traditions n-F the art of writing , and spoke from his heart with perfect simplicity and directness . His style seems obscure and elusive to those only who are not in sympathy with his point of view ; for few writers demand more of their readers than Emerson . Whatever the faults of his style ? and they arc really faults of his thought , ? it is entirely free from pretension , artifice , rhetorical device ; it is absolutely frank and sincere . Placing so high a valuation on man . Emerson held that there was nothing too good or sacred for men . He had as little regard for arbitrary intel ? lectual classifications as for arbitrary social distinctions . He held to the doc ? trine of community ownership in know ? ledge and thought . Plato might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above all , the possession of the plain people . Trans late a few technical words here and there into the vernacular , and the really great is as comprehensible by the unlettered as by the aristocracy of scholarship ; for it is vital , not technical , excellence and power which make men great . On to the expert for facts , he seemed to be al ? ways saying , but think your own thoughts and reach your own conclusions . In the historic meeting at Stonehenge , Carlyle challenged Emerson to define the American idea . It was characteristic of Emerson that he made no enumeration of mechanical or political gains or losses as the result of the new ordering of so ? ciety in this country ; he spoke " neither of Presidents nor cabinet ministers , nor of such as would make of America an ? other Europe " ; on the contrary , in the shadow of the ancient circle on Salisbury Plain , and in the presence of the most re ? lentless and scornful preacher of the need of governing men by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men , predicted the " bankruptcy of the vulgar musket-worship , " planted himself on " the law of love and justice alone , " declared that " we play the game with immense advantage , " and that no skill or activity can long compete with the pro ? digious advantages of this country in the hands of the English race . Sur ? rounded by the ripe beauty of England and sensitive to the appeal of her great traditions , he wrote : " There , in that great sloven continent , in high Alleghany pastures , in the sea - wide , sky - skirted prairie , still sleeps and murmurs and hides the great mother , long since driven away from the trim hedgerows and over-cultivated garden of England . . . . Here is the home of man , ? here is the promise of a more excellent social state than his ? tory has recorded . " At Stonehenge , it appears in the light of recent history , Emerson was a prophet . Born in the provincial period , speaking his word and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he foresaw , foretold , and prepared the way for the massing of the forces of a divided people in the potency , the majesty , and the unity of the nation . If he did not express the passion and volume of the national feeling , he de ? fined the national ideals . To him America meant something more than a continuation and repetition of Old World experience ; it meant a spiritual concep ? tion of man as en original , creative force ; a recognition , in the structure of society , of the divine in man which makes it safe to trust him ; the practice of a higher morality in international dealing , based on the kinship of man with man under all forms of govern ? ment ; the largest freedom for self-ex ? pression to men of all races and classes . In the account of the nation with this beautiful and prophetic spirit it is clear there is still a great indebtedness to be discharged ; for time has revealed with increasing distinctness the service of one of whom an eminent Frenchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw herself in him , and he was her conscience . " Concerning the quality and rank of his work there is general agreement ; he has survived the reaction which follows the death of a writer of original and individual force ; the de ? fects of his prose , the limitations of his verse , are clear enough ; but the depth of his insight , the lift of his thought , the freshness of his spirit , the felicity of his speech and its penetration , the wholeness and symmetry of his life : these are far beyond the region of questioning . He explained America to herself in terms of the spiritual life , he set man in his true place in the New World , he has kept the conscience of the nation and established for all time the doctrine that the success or failure of the new society shall be measured by its ser ? vice in the emancipation of the soul , the exaltation of man .                  @ @ @
