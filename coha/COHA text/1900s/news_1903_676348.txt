txt District Attorney Jerome was the guest of honor last night at a dinner given to him at the Hotel St. Denis by members of Club C , a ' good-government organization . In his speech he criticised Mayor Low for " constitutional timidity . " Among those who listened to Mr. Jerome 's criticism of the Mayor were Police Commissioner Greene , Tenement House Commissioner , De Forest , and Commissioner of Charities Folks . In the course of his speech he provoked a volley of applause when he made the assertion : " We are going to pull our boat to victory next Fall , even if one man is going to splash in the water . " Paul Fuller , President of the club , was toastmaster of the evening . vIr . Jerome sat on his right and Gen. Greene on his left . Others at the guest table were the Rev. Dr. W. S. Rainsford , Wheeler H. Peckham , Magistrate Barlow , Austen G. Fox , Mayor Osborne of Auburn , N. Y. ; Isaac H. Klein , Fred W. Hinrichs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jerome was the last speaker of the evening . He was greeted with tumultuous applause as he was presented to the guests . He spoke of the step the Good Government Clubs took when they first were organized and sought to extend their influence to parts of the city not yet ripe for the work by a propaganda of principle purely , and without personal leadership . PERSONAL LEADERSHIP IDEA . " You have to get back to the idea of personal leadership if you wish to succeed , " he continued . " If you have any idea that principle is going to do the trick in this community or in any other community built on democratic foundations you make a mistake . Principle does not avail any more than abstract ethics will . In a Commonwealth like this you must have men fitted by natural selection for the leadership . You must have not only a good man , but a man to whose goodness there is a great deal of edge . " You may think it fortuitous that Tammany Hall has brought about its power through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have returned them to power . It has required more than that . Pat Keenan , an Irishman , could never control the big Hebrew districts by a distribution of political patronage . These Tammany Hall leaders are a natural selection . They are an illustration of the survival of the fittest and have won their spurs in open war . They are leaders because the men feel that they have in them the elements of leadership . It is said Pat Keenan could take his district anywhere , even into the bosom of the Episcopalian Church . That is the weakness of the reform movement . It is weak because it has not taken in consideration the principles of individual leadership . We can and must get back to those principles and win out with strong hands . " The present is an illustration of what I have said . We have had a reform government for fifteen months . I have kept pretty close tab , and we have never had fifteen months of good government in the past fifteen years as we have had in the past fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decent and right things . Mistakes have been made , but not corrupt mistakes . " Mr. Jerome then commended highly the work of Police Commissioner Greene , Commissioner Lederle , and other officials under the present city government . " But you irlay tell a man of all these things , and point out what has been done and he will wave it all aside . And if he be a vulgar man he will turn round and say , ' Oh , hell . ' I do n't know that I ought to say these things , but I am going to say them . The trouble is that the Mayor has established a feeling that he is not inherently a leader I of men . He has established a feeling that he would undertake nothing unless he had a policy of insurance signed and underwritten as to where it would land him . That is why I feel diffident . I know Mr. Rainsford ? he is my friend ; he has shown himself to be my friend when I needed a friend . He has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me say that unless the stroke oar is firm and true there can be no rhythmic movement . " He will tell me that it is not expedient to say all these things , and the question of fusion will soon again be brought before us . He spoke then about personal leadership . But this is why I feel bitter . We are in a position where we should not be , and I am not the only one who thinks so . There are hundreds in the Citizens ' Union and in other reform organizations who hold the same opinion . ONE MAN MAY HAVE TO'SPLASH . " Now I say that no man is worth the sacrifice of an entire great movement and that any cause is greater than any man . I believe that if we stand together we can win again , and I say we are going to take this boat to victory , even if one man has to splash in the water . " What I think of Mr. Low is pretty well defined by what I have said here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help being constitutionally timid . He ca n't help it . And he loves to write letters . And I love to make speeches . But the best work that has been done in fifteen years has been done under him . And it does not detract from the force and power of his administration . We ca n't do better than to have him for our standard bearer , despite his shortcomings . There is no use looking for a saint . " Gen. Greene was the first speaker of the evening . He said that before taking the appointment he had told Mayor Low that it would depend on whether he thought he could get along with District Attorney Jerome whether he would take the position or not . The conference with Mr. Jerome followed . and a perfect understanding had been reached . The fusion between police and Prosecutor in this city will surely continue so long as the present administration lasts . What may happen to the other fusion is difficult to prophesy . " Dr. Rainsford said no greater moral lesson had been taught this community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event before the people simply on the principle of right and wrong , honesty and dishonesty . He said he heartily indorsed the attitude of Mr. Jerome on the liquor question . He added : " The shortcoming of the reformers is that while the work went along very well singly they were very poor at team work . The reformers are the dandy crew but they are infernally poor as a team . " Edward M. Shepard and Oscar S. Straus sent their regi ets . Mr. Shepard said in his letter : Mr. Jerome deserves the respect and admiration of all good citizens for his courage and ability and , I feel bound to add , for his- genius . He has done what to my mind every citizen ought to do ? that is to say , compel the people at large to give their attention to concerns of criminal justice . " In the cases where I still think him to . have been wrong , it is a comfort that his very error has been usually lighted up by score wholesome and piercing stroke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially where , to my regret , he has seemed to exalt the morality of sheer physical force and to disparge a longer time and surely a more triumphant-morality , he has , nevertheless , been not only vigorous and interesting but also honest and courageous .
