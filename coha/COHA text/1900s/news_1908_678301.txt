txt An appeal to colleges , parents , public officials , and the press to unite in an effort to stop hazing has been Issued by President Edmund J. James of the University of rill- ? riots . He describes hazing as a sort of annual epidemic . " It breaks out at the beginning of the year , " the appeal reads , " and rages for a time , like a fever . It is difficult to eradicate , owing to the sentiment of Parents and public officials . who , while condemning the thing in the abstract , In a mild sort of way , practically support It by refusing to regard It as anything more than a bit of harmless horse play . " This view Is , of course , justified In regard to certain phases of it . but other more serious Phases are really the outcropping of the same spirit that shows Itself In such an alarming way in the frequency of moh action of various kinds in different parts of the United States .
