txt It became known in White Plains to-night that hearings in Or divorce action brought in the Supreme Court in Westchester County by Mnia . Emma Eames. the opera singer , against her husband , Julian Story , have been ' ended by the referee , Frank M. Buck of Mount Vernon . It is generally believed that Mr. Buck has filed a report recommending that an interlocutory decree be issued in favor of Mme. Eames . Mr. Buck refused to-night to tell In whose favor he had decided or whether he had filed his report With the court or not , but he admitted that the hearings had been finished . The testimony , he said , covered sixty typewritten pages . Mr. Buck would reveal nothing whatever about the nature of the testimony , nor would he tell the name of the Philadelphia woman whom Mine . Eames is said to have named as co-respondent . It is probable that little information in regard to these matters will ever reach the public . Every effort has been made by the attorneys for both sides to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the lawyers will undoubtedly ask the court to order that all the papers in the case except the judgment be sealed , so that not even the County Clerk , with whom they must be filed , can see their contents . The next step in the proceeding , provided , as is generally expected , that the referee has found in favor of Mme. Eames , will be for her attorneys to apply to the court for a confirmation of the report . If this is granted an interlocutory judgment will be entered , provisionally granting the divorce , but this judgment will not be final until three months have expired . The decree can then be made absolute , and the plaintiff will then be entitled to marry again . Justice Arthur F. Tompkins granted the application appointing the referee , and it is more than likely that the case will come before him at special term , but it can be dealt with by any other Justice in the Second Department . It could not be ascertained last night whether Mr. Story had made any defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel . Mme. Eames , it is known , however , attended the sessions and furnished a large amount of the testimony . Mr. Story is now in Philadelphia . Mme. Eames is in Chicago with the Conried Opera Company , which is finishing its season on the road . TUG LOST , CAME IN ALONE . Dismasted Ship Rigged Up Sails and Got to Port Without Help .
