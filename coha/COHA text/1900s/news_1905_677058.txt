txt The Secretary of the Treasury went down into Virginia on Tuesday to deliver a sermon to the Republican State Convention . Here , according to the report of The Tribune , is his modest statement of his mission : I come to preach the gospel of American progress , and to teach those principles and policies which have made us what we are and which will carry us to yet higher planes and to grander achievements whenever , under GOD , the brain of the South and the brain of the North , the brain of the East and the brain of the West , shall be allied for affirmative action , and when no portion of our common country shall be longer held wedded W negative traditions which tend only to retard . When they arp reduced to their real substance the " principles and policies " referred to are found to consist of the Dingley tariff . This is the concrete embodiment of the idea of protection as it is entertained and practiced by the Republican Party . The theoretical basis for it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor mean cheap labor , " though what he doubtless intends to say is that cheap products of labor mean low wages for the laborer , which is a very different thing . The highest wages in the world for the same kind of work are paid on American railways , not only in the operation of them but in the construction of them , in the manufacture of their equipment , and all that belongs to their supplies and transportation . The net product of the labor of these highly paid men is cheaper here than in any other country . There are several considerable branches of exported manufactures , such as watches , especially of the cheaper sort ; sewing machines , typewriting machines , &c.,; in which labor is specially skilled and well paid , and the product of such labor competes in the markets of the world with that of less well-paid labor , and competes successfully . The cost to the employer of each man 's labor is high ; the cost of the labor in each unit of product is low . Such facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians , but they are facts all the same , and they make ridiculous the argument for protection based on the rate of wages instead of on the real cost of labor . When it comes to a specific case Mr. SHAW cites one that is in direct opposition to the general principle of the protective tariff . He brings up the trade of cutting diamonds . By putting uncut diamonds on the free list and taxing cut stones 10 per cent , and set stones 60 per cent , he says that there has been developed in this country a body of diamond cutters , some 2,000 in number , who earn in the aggregate " several millions of dollars . " This is a. case in which the strict principle of protection has been mitigated , and to the extent of the mitigation prosperity has followed The diamond cutters are allowed to get their raw material untaxed . The same policy might with advantage be applied to iron and steel and wool and to a multitude of partly manufactured commodities that are necessarily the material of other and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he permitted rebate of duties on Canadian Wheat exported in the form of American made flour ; but if the idea were carried out logically it would make short work of the Dingley tariff .
