txt Although their bid was approximately $2,000,000 higher than the lowest bid submitted for the work , the Brothers Company and Winston &; Co. , which put in a joint bid , have receivedj the contract , known as Contract 3 of the Ashokan Reservoir work , by the Board of Water Supply . The estimated cost of the work to be done under this contract is $12,800,000 . John Peirce &; Co. , one of the largest contracting firms in the country , was the lowest bidder , putting in long detailed statements and a total bid of $10. - 315,350 . The joint bid of the other two companies was $12,660,775 . When it was learned yesterday . that the board had awarded the contract on the latter bid surprise was expressed , in view of the standing of the Peirce Company . At the offices of the board , however , It was said that Mr. Peirce had been in . Europe when the bids were made up and ' that his company 's estimates on some of the work were manifestly too low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , he was apprised that this was the opinion of the board 's engineer , and , it is said , he concurred in the opinion , but offered to go on with the work if the contract went to him . At the offices of the board this statement was issued : The question regards the construction of a dam which shall hold water , which involves a special form of construction requiring expert knowledge and experience , and the details of which must be rigidly insisted upon . The cost of the work , as separately and independently estimated by the Chief Engineer , two designing engineers , and an assistant engineer , is shown to be over $2,000,000 more than the bid of the lowest bidder . These estimates of the engineering department are confirmed by the bids of four of the five bidders , each one of whom has had more or less experience in this particular kind of work . In an analysis of the bid of the lowest bidder his figures on masonry work , with which he is familiar are approximately correct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items of excavation and embankment his figures are over $2,000,000 less than the next lowest bidder . In regard to their bid , Mr. Peirce of the John Peirce Company ( the lowest bidder ) states that in the matter of excavation and embankment far reservoir construction his company has had no experience : that they were dependent upon others for their figures ; that upon investigation he can procure no figures on these items to protect their proposal , and that upon rechecking his figures he finds that the estimate is too low to do satisfactory work for ' himself or the city . Therefore , the estimate of the engineering department and four bidders out of five is practically confirmed by the statement of Mr. Peirce himself , and there is no other conclusion to be reached in the light of this evidence than that the bid of the lowest bidder is , much below the necessary cost , besides being concededly based upon lack of knowledge and experience as to excavation and embankment items . Chapter 724 , Laws of 1905 , Section 20 , says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly opened by the said Board of Water Supply and it may select the bid or proposal the acceptance of which will , in their Judgment , best secure the efficient performance of the work . " To best secure the efficient performance of this work it Is necesasry that the Board of Water Supply should take into consideration every phase of the question , the elements of which ere : Financial standing , knowledge , experience . and such a margin for profit as will secure willingness and ability to continue the work to its conclusion with essential speed , the absence of any one or moro of these elements being vital . Therefore . in the case of the lowest bidder the absence of the elements of knowledge and experience in the matters of excavation and embankment for - reservoir construction , and the evidence showing lack of margin for legitimate profit , is deemed sufficient . in the interest of the city , to recommend the rejection of that bid . Your committee . therefore , recommends , in view of the report of the Chief Engineer and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to each one of tthe three consulting engineers , Messrs . Freeman. , Burr , and Steams , which are herewith submitted and which concur , supported by such additional thought and judgment as it itself has been able to bring to bear upon this subject , that Contract No. 3 for the construction of the Ashokan Dam be awarded to Brothers Company and Winston Company at their bid , which on the assumed baste of quantities amounts to $12,069,775 , the committee having satisfied itself as to the financial standing , knowledge . experience , and ability of said company to do the work . Respectfully : submitted . J. EDWARD SIMMONS , CHARLES N. CHADWICIC. , CHARLES A. SHAW . Aug. 25. 1007 . It was recalled about the City Hall yesterday that this is - the second large contract the concern has been awarded , although not the lowest bidder . About three years ago Bartholomew I Dunn , who made the lowest bid , took the matter to court and charged , among other things , that J. Waldo Smith . who passed upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the Company in Massachusetts . This contention , Mr. Smith said yesterday , was not correct , and was never proved . LOCKED IN . POST OFFICE . Young Man Whom Clerks Had Forgotten Freed After Many Hours . Lieut . Ochterioney answered a ring of the telephone in the Jamaica Police Station last night . and was startled to hear a familiar voice exclaim : " For Heaven 's sake , get me out of here ! I 'm locked up in this confounded old building , and ca n't get out : This is Graff . I 'm in the Post Office Building . Postal clerks downstairs left for night , and , not knowing I was writing in a friend 's office upstairs , locked the front door after them , and , confound it all , I 'll have to stay here all night unless some one unlocks that door ! " " Better look out . You 'll be in the dead-letter office soon if you 're not careful , " yelled back the jovial Lieutenant ; but he sent a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of keys on the heavy front door , but without success . A curious crowd had collected to see what the trouble was about . A rumor soon spread that there were burglars in the Post Office and that the police were making desperate efforts to capture the intruders . William H. Graff , who had the misfortune to be locked in , was busy working the telephone in the office upstairs , trying to rouse some one with a key . All the while he had to sit in the dark , for he had no matches . He telephoned to some friend to come around to the front door and pass him some matches through the keyhole. but this was only a temporary relief . About midnight the janitor came with the key , and the young man was released . he had been locked up since 6:30 o'clock .
