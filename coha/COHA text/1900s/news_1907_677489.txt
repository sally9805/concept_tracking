txt Business -- Private and Corporate . Some years ago a young man who could earn $30 a month in Summer and nothing in Winter came to New York and bought a milk route for $3,000 . There was no tangible asset except a horse and wagon , but in spite of expenses in the way of presents to the servants , his investment netted him a profit of $2,000 per annum . If he were a corporation , I presume he would have been the subject of a legislative inquiry , his capitalization reduced to the price of the horse and wagon , upon which be would be allowed to net a profit of 4 per cent. , and finally he would have been convicted of graft . However , he merged his business into that of a larger concern at a good profit , and I presume he is somewhere denouncing the corporations which have driven him out of " busi ness , " while the farmer is receiving more far the milk , his customers are buying it cheaper , and the driver is better paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
