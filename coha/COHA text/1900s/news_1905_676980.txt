txt The foreshadowing of a conflict between President Roosevelt and the Senate at the proposed extra session over rate legislation was the one topic in official circles to-day , and put more than usual interest for the closed season into political gossip at the capital . Furthermore , indications of divided opinion in the Cabinet are found in the discordant views expressed by Secretary Paul Morton last Thursday , and Secretary Taft last evening , before the same hearers . the . delegates to the International Railway Congress . The President 's Denver speech , which was reported in the newspapers here yesterday . and Secretary Taft 's address last evening sounded the same keynote . No one supposes that the coincidence of the speeches was prearranged , but no less significance is attached . Mr. Taft was invited to the dinner in his capacity as head of floe Government In Mr. Roosevelt 's absence . He told the assembled railway men of this country , in the presence of their foreign guests , that they must accept rate regulation or find cause to regret it . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroads and then replying to Mr. Fish , the effect was to turn the baneuet into a joint debate on the subject of 1 a declared policy of the Administration . Secretary Morton , another member of the Administration . in welcoming the delegates to the congress here last Thursday , had given a view so opposite as to be in line with the utterances of Mr. Fish last night . Lie had argued that if discrirninalion were done away with , rates would take care of themselves . Mr. Fish aPH parentiy used Mr. Morton 's words as the foundation of his argument in his two 1 speeches answering Mr. Taft . If the President 's and Mr. Taft 's speeches had been intended as a rebuke ) to Mr. Morton . devised to clear the Ad-ministration of any suspicion that it i agreed with him , a more complete method 1 could not have been found , is the opinion expressed here to-day . The views of Mr. Fish , the railroad men generally , and of Secretary Morton are those of the Senators on Mr. Elkins 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ratemaking : question . The committee , it is - understood , is utterly hostile to any such legislation as the Fsch-Townsend bill . It is credited with killing that bill in the la , .. st Congress . The result of its investigation , therefore , has been discounted , i and not much interest has been taken in it . The committee will frame a bill , but the expectation is that it will in no respect resemble what the President wants . The committee expects to adjourn on May 20 . The speeches of the President and Mr. Taft are taken here as a direct warning to the committee . Some of Mr. Taft 's significant sentences follow : " What the railway men of this country ought to do is to assist in the passage of a la 's ' that will accomplish the result . It is not an easy law to draw , but if they will stand up and assist they will take away from the extreme feeling which exists against the railroads . " I am the last one to argue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this country that would be so unfortunate- in its effect as the Government ownership of steam railroads . And we are not going to come to it , but we may have a campaign on this subject which will do no good to the rail-roads , " It is true that the railroads have been guilty of some abuses and I say this because 1 have run railroads for ten years in courts as a judge through receivers . And it was mighty hard sometimes to get receivers who would not cut , rates . I had to stand them up at the end of every week and swear them to be sure and then I was not quite sure that they were nut cutting rates . " Most railroads to-day are prosperous , and when they age prosperous they can obey the law ; but when it comes to a question of the survival of the fittest . then the weakest begin to break the law , and that letvis all the others in the same direction . What we-want is a law that will enable the railroads that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so or else go out of business . " I heard the.other night a speech from a gentleman whom I very much admire , an old friend of mine , President Baer , and I thought his tone , his attitude toward regulation , was one that was likely to lead the railroads into a position from which they must some time sorrowfully retire . " ' When Mr. Fish maintained that the law was ample and that administration rather than legislation was the thing desired Mr. Taft retorted : " I know something about the InterState Commerce litigation . I know you began a case four years ago over an Issue whether a particular town was prejudiced Madtee obey In which the rates were e for that town and five years hence the case is decided in the courts . In the rnsantime the town has been wiped out by a tornado . " If , despite these warnings , the Senate pers:sts in the course foreshadowed by Mr. Elkins 's committee , lively times are looked for in the extra session . The 11- .. : use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . The passage c , such a bill as Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Tait have indicated they do not want will piece the President in the situation v.-11 : , 11 Mr. Cleveland confronted when Congress passed the Wilson-Gorman Tariff bill . Mr. Cleveland branded it as one of " perfidy and dishonor : " but preItrred : to allow It to became a laW rather than veto the only tariff bill he-could-get.
