txt Objects to Street Opening Tax . Will some one conversant with such matters enlighten me as to why the city can charge $36 for a " permit " to cut a hole one and a half yards long by one yard wide in order to remove some obstruction in the pipes , preventing the flow of water to one 's premises ? When the water tax is paid , is it not the duty of the city to keep its water mains free from foreign substances which will interfere with the water supply of private citizens . An eel gets into the water main and cuts off the water supply , for two days , from a private house . An opening , of the dimensions above named , is made in the opposite side of the street , and before this opening Is made , the city demands $36 . Is it lawful ?
