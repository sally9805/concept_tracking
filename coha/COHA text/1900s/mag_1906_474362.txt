GENERAL GRANT , when President , adopted the plan of parcelling out the various Indian tribes and reservations among the several religious bodies engaged in Indian work . Thus it happened that to the Episcopal Church , under the leadership of Bishop Spalding of Colorado , then in charge of Wyoming , the Wind River reservation was allotted . That was early in the eighties , just previous to my going West . In this beautiful valley of the Wind River , embracing a territory of 30,000 square miles , two noted tribes were domiciled ? the Shoshones and the Arapahoes . Since the Shoshones migrated to the Wind River ? indeed long before that date -- until a few years ago , they have had but one chief , old Washakie , as he was familiarly known . The Indian word " washakie " is said to mean " shoots-onthe-fly , " and may bear witness to the deadly and unerring aim for which the chief was famous . This reputation , coupled with his bravery , inspired much terror in the minds of the surrounding tribes . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any Russian Czar . Tradition has it that some years before I knew him Washakie himself had not been free from blame in that he had disposed of his mother-in-law . But he was the chief and had absolute rights , and the government could not wisely interfere with his domestic rule . The story is that on one occasion Washakie went hunting . Before leaving , lie ordered his squaw to move his teepee to a higher point of ground , for it was getting . damp in the valley . He was gone a week . When lie returned , he was cold and tired and cross . Approaching his tent , he saw with much disgust that the wigwam stood just where he had left it . He was not accustomed to be ing disobeyed even by his squaw . Enter ing his home , he said , " Did I not tell you to move this teepee ? ' " Yes , " said his squaw , seeing fire the old man 's eye . " Then why did you not do it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit me . " Then there ensued a passage at arm between the chief and his mother-in-lav and Washakie , in a fit of unbridled rag ( cruelly slew the offending old woman . I hope my readers will not undul blame me for narrating this incident , fc already it has brought upon my innocer head at least one serious reprimand . was in Buffalo , New York . I was th guest of a prominent rector much belove by his people . Ire had sent for xne the 1 might inspire some missionary zeal the hearts of his flock . He told me the they were a kind and thoughtful peopb and towards him personally most grt cious and considerate . He said they woul give any amount of money for their ow city or parish , but that he had tried i vain to get them interested in the caw of missions , foreign or domestic . B added that about a half-dozen men wealth sat in the front pews near tl pulpit , and he hoped I might induc them to give liberally toward the caw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told the of the poverty of my scattered floc on The big prairies ; described how few hundred dollars would enable it to send a clergyman here or there ; plained that with five hundred dollar aided by the people themselves , I coul build a much-needed little church . Bi my appeals did not seem to move then Then I told them some pathetic stork of suffering and self-denial on the pa-of my missionaries . Again , I tried ti effect of some facetious incidents ; bi ill in vain . Finally , becoming desperate , narrated the story of old Washakie : Ming his mother-in-law , and reminded ny hearers that even such a cruel and lard-hearted savage as he had been had ome under the fascination of the gospel tory and was now a good Christian . No ' reater testimony to the power of Chris-lanky could be given , I added , than hat a man mean enough to kill his aother-in-law had been converted . Then he plates went round . One man tore ut the fly-leaf of his prayer-book and irate : " Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed his mother-iniw . My heart goes out to him . " Anther wrote on a scrap of paper , " I have iven the Bishop all I had in my pocket , ut call on me for twenty-five dollars tore for that old chief . " About thirteen undred and sixty dollars was gathered i for an Indian school . After the service I received in the estry-room a card . It was evidently mm some one in mourning . I asked is rector who the lady was . He said she as a devout and wealthy parishioner , nd added , " See her , by all means . " Then she stood before me , I saw there as trouble ahead . She told me she had : .. en so much interested in the early part r my address ; " but , " she continued , " 1 as deeply disappointed that you told iat horrible incident about that cruel d chief who killed his mother-in-law . " he said she dearly loved her mother-inw , whom she had recently lost , and that was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against others-in-law . It was not until I had ; cured her that no personal experience id inspired my recital , and that a range and inscrutable Providence had nied me a mother-in-law , that she cornetely forgave me , and produced a check T WO which she had brought to church r me , and we parted excellent friends . As it was my custom , when journey-g through my diocese , to spend several Lys in a mining-town , it was often issible to prepare the way for my visitant to the next camp through the kind ices of personal friends already made . aus it was that Mrs. Deardon , one of r church members in Challis , informed that her husband kept the hotel and non in Clayton , and that she had already sent him word of my intended visit . A white horse was placed at my disposal by a gentleman who facetiously reminded me that my first stopping-place en route would be a mining-camp known as Bay Horse . It was at this latter place that I met , for the first and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was spoken of as the " Bulgarian monk . " He carried a gun , and was followed by a dog . Occasionally he would descend from the hills , where he led a solitary life in the woods , to a mining-camp , and preach the gospel to those who were attracted by his weird appearance and mysterious personality . He affected the conventional dress and bearing of the apostles , and seemed to consider himself a sort of modern John the Baptist . By the more superstitious and impressionable he was regarded with much awe and wonder ; by others , and especially the young , he was greatly feared , and mothers would conjure with his name in keeping their children in the path of obedience . Whence he came and whither he went no one knew . His movements were enshrouded in mystery . I tried to engage him in conversation , and elicit from him some information as to his life and purpose . But my efforts were unavailing . As the weather grew cold in the autumn , he would disappear , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow had melted in the mountains . Then with his rifle and faithful dog he would once more be seen in the woods . Whenever he condescended to come to a settlement , it was only for a brief hour to deliver his message or warning and then disappear . On the occasion of my seeing him at Bay Horse , he was just leaving that place , and I can vividly recall his curiously clad , retreating figure , as he climbed the mountain and disappeared among the pines . Reaching Clayton about one o'clock , I was met cordially by my host , who bade me alight and partake of his hospitality . I was somewhat late for dinner , but the dining-room was still open , and I soon found myself seated at the table . Scarcely had I begun my dinner , when a man in the far corner of the room hailed me in a loud voice . " Hello , Bishop , " said he , " is that you ? " " Yes , " I replied . " Bishop , come over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . By this time I had easily discovered that my friend was far from sober . I declined the invitation to join him by reminding him that I had already been served , and that it would be inconvenient to have my dishes carried over to his table . I added that I would see him after dinner . That suggestion did not at all satisfy him . He said , " Weil , then , Bishop , if you wo n't eat with me , I 'll come over and eat with you . " And over he came . He was the impersonation of good nature and amiability , though somewhat familiar for an entire stranger . When he was seated near me , he said , " Bishop , are you going to talk to the boys here to-night ? " I told him that was my object in coming to the camp . " Well , " he added , " I am glad , for God knows these fellers here need it . You see , Bishop , the trouble with the boys here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last person to complain of that tendency on the part of his brethren . So I ventured to say , " Well , my friend , I am very sorry to hear that , but , if you will pardon me , it seems to me that you are suffering from that same trouble yourself just now . " He saw my point , but was ready for my sally . and quickly rejoined , " You are right , Bishop ; but do n't you see , when the Bishop comes , a feller just has to celebrate . " It was easy to establish kindly relations with so pleasant a nature . His next remark was : " Bishop , I heard you at Ketchum . Are you going to give them that same talk you gave us fellers there ? " I told him I had thought of preaching another sermon . " Oh , give them that same talk , Bishop ; that was a hell of a good talk , and will hit these fellers here just right . " He then wished to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him the service would be in the dance-hall over Barnes 's saloon at eight o'clock that evening . He asked me if I would allow him to help me " round up the boys . " I answered that I thought his help would not be necessary ; that I intended to visit the mill , and go down in the mines , and call in at all the stores , and invite everybody . But before I escaped from him he had expressed his purpose to be on hand with out fail . After calling , on the superintendent and letting all the people know about tin services , I returned to the hotel and ha ( supper . About half past six I went ove to see the dance-hall . It was in a nuos untidy condition . There had been dance the night before , and it had beet left in great disorder . I found a broom raised the windows , and swept the plac thoroughly . I then dusted the orgai and the chairs , and put things in orde as best I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ehim ncys , and was quite pleased at the im proved appearance of things . I thet sat down to think over my address an , prepare for the service . It must hay been about half past seven when I hear the sound of heavy footsteps ascendin the outside stairway . It was my frien ( " Bishop , " he asked , " are you ready fo the boys ? Shall T round them up nowt " No , not yet , " I said ; " wait abo half an hour , please . " " All right . I 'll be back in a hall hour , " Sure enough , a little before eight , h again reported . " Are you ready nor Bishop t " " Yes , " I replied . " You may no-round them up . " I still hoped that th constable might come to my relief an look up my friend in " the cooler " tint after service . But no such good fortur awaited me . Presently I heard h voice resounding up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 yes , boys ! Oh yes ! Come this way ; tl Bishop is ready . The meetin ' is abot to begin . " His invitation was head nodded in evident approval of my arguments , and at last I could hear him say , " That 's right , Bishop ; go for ' em . Hit ' em again . " He became more and more noisy and excited . Finally he clapped his hands , and unable longer to restrain himself , he shouted : " Good , good ! Give ' em hell , Bishop , give ' em hell . " I looked at him severely , and motioned to him with my hand deprecatingly , and he subsideri . It was a memorable evening . After the closing hymn and the benediction , the men lingered long , and many of them came up and shook my hand gratefully ; but I could see there was something on their minds which they wished to express . At length one of them found courage to say . " Bishop , things did not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meant . " Why , " he said , " you did n't look like a bishop , and did n't have ' cm on as you did in Challis . " " Oh , you refer to my vestments , " I said , and explained to them that I had left my robes and prayer-books in a gunny-sack with Mr. Deardon at his saloon . He had placed the bag behind the counter ; but later a ranchman , living out of town about nine miles , had called for his gunny-sack , and as they all look alike , had taken mine instead of his own ; so when the time for service came I was without my usual equipment . " Oh , that 's the way it happened , is it ? Well , you see , Bishop , we boys like to have you dress up for us . It seems so much more like eburch back home . " As I returned to the Wood River country from this trip , I spent a few days at Bailey . One afternoon a card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my room at the hotel . I recognized at once that my visitor was a famous gambler , of whom I had often heard ; but , despite his unenviable profession , Joe Oldham was highly respected by the men of Idaho . lie stood at the head of his business for decency and honor and integrity . Naturally , however , I wondered why he had called to see me ; but I immediately descended to the parlor , where , attired in a faultless suit of broadcloth , Mr. Oldham awaited me . Tall , dignified in bearing , most gracious and polite in manner , he extended his hand . As I grasped it , he said , " Bishop , I hear you arc from Missouri . " " Yes , " I replied , " I am proud to say that is my native State . " I added that I was from Fayette , Howard County . His face lighted up with a smile , and he exclaimed : " Howard County : Why , I have been there . I have relatives in old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I soon learned his mission . He simply wished me to write a letter to his " folks , " who lived in Independence , Missouri . His family consisted of a mother and two sisters . " Bishop , " he said , " as long as Joe Oldham lives , they will never know what it is to want for anything . If you will write my mother and just tell her that you have met me , it , will make her very happy . Tell her that you are the Bishop of Idaho , and that her son Joe called upon you . Now , Bishop , I expect you have heard of me . " " Yes , " I replied , " often , Mr. Oldham . " " And you know what my business is ? " " Well , yes , Mr. Oldham . ? I have heard something about it in a general way . " " Now , Bishop , I am going to tell you all about it . I am a professional gambler . I run a fine place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , or I would like to take you around and show it to you . But I run a clean house . Every man who comes there has a square deal . No crookedness there , Bishop . No drinking and carousing allowed . It is a place for a white man . " Rising to depart , he said , " Now , Bishop , if you will write to my mother , " giving me her address , " I shall be so grateful to you . But may I ask of you one great favor when you write ? Just do n't mention what my business is . It would simply break her heart if she knew how I make money . For , Bishop , if there ever was a good Christian woman in this world , it is my dear old mother . I only beg of you not to give me away . " Joe again extended his hand and grasped mine . As he withdrew it , I found that he had placed a twenty-dollar gold piece in my palm . " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find some good use for it . And just let me say that whenever you want another just like it , if you will only drop a line to Joe Oldham , Hailey , Idaho , ' it will b. sure to come . " Invariably , after that first interview when I would meet my Missouri friend he would slip into my hand a twenty dollar gold piece . He was a generbu soul , warm-hearted and loyal to hi friends . His kindness to the widow an . the orphan , to the man hurt in the mine : and to all in trouble made him greatl beloved . He had about him a certain titl of nobility . He did not claim to be Christian , but , as he never turned hi face away from any poor man , let u hope that the face of the Lord has nc been turned away from him . At the time of my first visit to the Cm d'Alene , Wallace was my objective poin and the first engine had but recentl reached the camp . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who had preceded me by a fe weeks . Already a rude printing-pre : had been set up , and as I stepped from the train I was handed a large gree circular which had been widely distribi ted and was posted up on stumps an logs and shacks in every direction . read as follows : " The Bishop is coming . Let all tor out and hear the Bishop . Services i George and Human 's Hall to-morro Sunday , at 11 A.nr. and 8 P.M. Plea . leave your guns with the usher . " The young men who got up this uniqt notice wished to have the service in ei tire harmony with the environment . As I was escorted from the station - my hotel , I was impressed by a scene 4 throbbing activity . The camp was crow ed with men , and the sound of saw ar hammer filled the air . Conspicuoi among the rude buildings and ten which made up the town there were , 1 actual count , sixty saloons . It was confused and stirring spectacle . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Missouri , bright and ente prising fellows , were the owners of tl local paper ; hence , I was at once made feel at home . On the next morning , Sunday , I w. curious to see whether or not the gret circular had been effective in drawing congregation . Its charm had been peter The hall was packed , and the congreg tion , as was usual in new mining-canq was made up almost entirely of men . No church of any kind had been built , and , indeed , so new was the place that my visit was the first made by any clergyman . I had already , on the evening of my arrival , secured from Captain Wallace , after whom the place was named , and who had some sort of a title to the town site , the promise of an ? ligible lot . The next step necessary sue to raise money for building a church . After the morning service , and before lismissing the congregation , I dwelt upon the importance of having a place ) f worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds . By ray of encouragement , I informed them hat a kind layman in Philadelphia , Mr. 7. emuel Coffin , had given me a check for ive hundred dollars , on condition that I . ould get a thousand more in some town , and thus erect a fifteen-hundred-dollar lurch ; and I expressed the hope that Arallace might obtain the gift . In closng , I gave notice that at the evening ervice subscriptions would be received , nd that I felt sure all would help in aising the thousand dollars . That Sunday afternoon I took a walk hrough the camp . On every side men ; ere hard at work as on any week-day. ' he stores and banks , not to mention the aloons , were all open . As I passed one ank , I recognized in the cashier a gentle -- tan whom I had met before . He invited is in and asked about the services and iy plans . I briefly outlined to him my urpose of raising a thousand dollars let evening at the service . He generusly offered to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledged seventy-five dollars ; a third , fty dollars ; they all said they would be resent , and when called upon would ame the amounts respectively promised . large and eager congregation of men rain gathered at the ball at eight clock . After the service and sermon , renewed my plea for a church and menoned the five-hundred-dollar check in my ) cket , ready to add to the one thousand ) 11ars if only we could secure that sum Len and there . I asked a gentleman to ' Inc forward and keep a record of the edges as they were made . I called first r one-hundred-dollar subscriptions ; only ? e person responded . Then for seventyvat .. ex tit. ? xo. 674. - 36five- dollar pledges ; again but one answer . Then for fifty-dollar offers ; several of these were made . When the twenty-five-dollar pledges were called for , the responses were so numerous that I began to feel the whole amount would be obtained . Finally , when I asked for the ten-dollar gifts , an old and poorly dressed man sitting near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down for ten dollars , Mr. Bishop . " I hesitated , fearing he could not afford so much ; but the gentleman who was keeping the record reassured me , saying : " He 's all right . That 's old Huckleberry Jim . He 's rich , and got money in the bank . He could afford to give fifty dollars . He 's getting eight dollars a gallon for his huckleberries at Spokane . " The congregation was dismissed with the cheering news that the money was all in sight . The next morning I had to leave . As I was on my way to the station , two men met me , and one of them said : " Bishop , come along with us . The train will not be here for an hour , and we want to use you . We might as well raise some more money for that church , for we will surely need it before we get through , and we can do better while you are with us . " We held up before the open door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve , " said one of my companions , addressing the proprietor . As he reluctantly came forward , my friend went on : " Steve , this is the Bishop , and he is building a church , and we want twenty-five dollars out of you . " " All right , " said Steve ; " will you take it now or do you just want my name ? " " Well , if it 's all the same to you , we 'll take the cash . " Having paid up himself , Steve at once became an enthusiastic friend of the new church movement , and proceeded to lead out to us , one by one , such of his customers as he thought might help . We then went on to the neighboring saloons , and between three and four hundred dollars were added to the fund . In a short time the church was built , and is to-day a self-supporting parish , and has been the means of much wholesome and uplifting influence in that neighborhood .
