txt A pathetic story comes from Brooklyn of a worthy matron , the wife of a skilled artisan of excellent character and admitted responsibility , who has given up the quest for a home in the city after being refused in eighty-seven successive instances the privilege of leasing eligible apartments within the family means . No doubt this number of refusals could have been increased to eight hundred and seventy had her strength held out to pursue the quest . The family consists of a respectable , industrious , and responsible man , his equally respectable wife , and five children . Without the children they would be considered desirable tenants ; with them they are not wanted . It would be a waste of time to sentimentalize over the injustice of such a discrimination . The landlords take a very practical view of the matter and are probably quite right in doing so . Tenants without children object to those who have them ; and it must be admitted that as sojourners in multiple apartment houses they have grounds for such objection . Children , if healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They pound up and down stairs , romp through the rooms where they belong , congest the front door , play school on the front stoop , and are generally in the way . For this they are not to be blamed . They can not be kept under State prison discipline , and it is useless to expect that they will tiptoe around a house , converse in whispers , restrict their play to reading fairy stories , and deport themselves like the inmates of a borne for aged and indigent females . The average tenant is more unreasonable than the average landlord . For his own children he demands every privilege as theirs by right ; but it does not at all suit him to have like privileges extended to the children of other people . If childless he resents the intrusion of anybody 's children upon his peace and quiet . Hence the landlord is confronted by a dilemma for which there is only one solution . If he lets his apartments only to families with children it will not be long before each tenant insists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he lets only to families without children he must make his heart as a millstone and set his face as a flint to the appeals of many good people who can not understand why their obedience to the beneficent law of nature should make them social outcasts . Perhaps the net result makes for good . Life in apartments is not adapted to children . The street is not a fit playground , and the associations of the crowded neighborhood are unwholesome , morally and physically . It may very well be that the landlord is unconsciously doing a good service to hilmanity and promoting the progress of civilization in making it necessary for parents to sacrifice something of their own convenience for the good of their children . If they belong in that class the teeming tenements will receive them ; if of independent means they will find the more costly apartment houses open to them : if they are of the great " middle class " which , after all , comprises most of that which is best and most valuable in American citizenship , they should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restrictions and limitations of apartments .
