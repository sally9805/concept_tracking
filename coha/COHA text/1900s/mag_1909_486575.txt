President Taft 's recommendation that political candidates and committees in Congressional and national elections be compelled by law to file a sworn statement of their expenses has not made much stir in this part of the country , but the West is receiving it with hearty approval . The Washington correspondents of the Chicago Tribune and the Minneapolis Journal have made a poll of the Senators and Representatives from fourteen of the States of the Middle West , and found that they are almost unanimously in favor of legislating to secure publicity of campaign expenditures . Of the 26 Senators who expressed themselves , 25 were for the plan , while only 11 of the 136 Representatives interviewed refused to commit themselves to it . The outlook is thus promising for a statute which will force party committees to do what the Democrats did voluntarily last year . When we remember how much was made of this in the campaign , and how great are the evils which may be hidden by the secret use of huge sums of money in elections , we can not but hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this subject written into law . The long list of nominations sent to the Senate on Monday will at least end the harassing uncertainty to which our diplomats have been subjected ever since Mr. Taft took office . The President has followed the policy of promoting or transferring a number of men who by reason of long service are entitled to consideration ; and in the main the appointments are excellent . That of Richard C. Kerens to Austria-Hungary is the exception . In this case , Mr. Taft has yielded to pressure . A railroad man and politician , long a business associate of Senator Elkins , three times candidate for Senator from Missouri , Kerens represents a type whose political activity the country has come to look upon with dissatisfaction and suspicion . The very fact that he was among the largest contributors to the Taft campaign fund ought in common decency to have barred him from any appointive office . The appointment of Mr. Bacon to Paris , where he is likely to repeat the success of Gen. Horace Porter , represents no such compromise . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the successful diplomat , and his experience in the State Department and in business should aid him at this time when the question of our trade relations with . France is so pressing . Upon the excellent promise of Mr. Calb oun 's appointment to China , we have already commented . Henry T. Gage , ex-Governor of California , gees to Portugal as minister without previous diplomatic service . Charles W. Russell , minister to Persia , is an assistant attorney-general , with experience gained on several semi-diplomatic missions , notably to Cuba and Panama ; and Laurits S. Swenson of Minnesota , now sent to Switzerland , was a successful minister to Denmark for eight years . All the other appointments are of men now or formerly in the service - Who have done well in less important positions . A Congressional investigation into the matters at issue between- Ballinger and Pinchot can not come too soon . Even Mr. Taft 's good nature is not large enough to hold permanently under control a pair of fiery chargers pulling in opposite directions and kicking up in the process an unconscionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's painstaking review of the charges against Mr. Ballinger ; but there are also men whose suspicions of Ballinger have refused to yield to reason , just as there are still other men whose suspicions are evidently kept alive by self-interest . Reasonable men have been willing to interpret Mr. Pinchot 's hostility to the Secretary of the Interior as arising from a keen and sincere sense of duty . But there are minors that the Chief Forester , in his zeal for a good cause , has resorted to methods of campaigning which may turn out to be unfair and which certainly are of very questionable propriety for an employee of the United States Government engaged in controversy with a fellow-employee . Meanwhile the public at large has been asked to base its opinion on err pate state ments , on technical rejoinders , and altogether on driblets and snippets of testimony out of a complicated mass that must be thoroughly sifted before the truth can be got at . An investigation free from the slightest look of whitewash is called for by a quarrel that affects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - - Secretary MacVeagh 's ' official statement of Saturday , that bonds other than United States Government issues will no longer be accepted as security for deposit of public money with banks , and that in case of deposits now secured by railway and municipal bonds , suen collateral must , by next February , be replaced by United States bonds , has several aspects . Our Treasury is not now a large depositor in the banks , for the simple reason that it has no surplus revenue to deposit . Only $51,000,000 of Government moneys is thus held by banks at present , as against the $249 , - 000,000 in December , 1907 , and the $147,000,000 even in the middle of 1908 . Of the present deposits , some $9,900,000 are secured by State , railway , and municipal bonds , and for that the Government 2 per cents , which are virtually the only United States bonds available , must now be substituted . The Secretary 's action is important , first , as receding for all public deposits from the policy adopted by Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of very questionable legality , and pretty plainly recognized as such , in a recent speech , even by Senator Aldrich . The secondary importance of the action , and perhaps its primary purpose , is its possible effectiveness in sustaining - the price of the United States 2 per cents in face of the impending new issues of Government 3 per cents . This is of itself an artificial expedient , and might be open to criticism on that ground , but for the entire propriety of dislodging the miscellaneous securities from the Government 's accounts . Under the " Aldrich amendments " of 1907 , the Treasury would apparently have the right to restrict collateral against public deposits to the 2 per cent . bonds , and to exclude even other higher-rate United States issues . But this would hardly be a probable recourse . The introduction in the House of Representatives of the American Bar Association 's bill to bring about reforms in the practice of the United States courts should prove to be a turning-point in the history of our methods of judicial procedure generally . If an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is every reason to expect that practice in State courts will undergo a like beneficial change . The importance of limiting the possibilities of appeal to cases in which substantial ground for reopening a case is presented has become so generally recognized that the attainment of this object is , as a matter of course , the foremost aim of the bill . The preposterOus abuse of the right of appeal has been responsible for an incalculable amount of mischief . In civil cases , it has caused such delay - and expense as not only to impose a most serious burden , but to constitute practically an absolute denial of justice to persons of moderate means . In the domain of criminal law , the injury has lain not so much in specific failures and delays of justice as in the moral effect of the spectacle of trials dragged out endlessly , their issue apparently depending on meaningless technicalities , and the operation of justice presenting itself to the general mind as a matter of luck or skill or persistence rather than as the working of a great principle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr Stimson and his associates will take courage in the prosecution of their work , and especially in making every possible effort to secure the punishment of those primarily responsible for the thefts . Counsel for the defence had laid stress on the fact that any frauds there may have been were committed for the benefit of the Trust , and that it was therefore the big men in the Trust , and not these hired workmen , who were the real criminals ; and Mr. Stimson , in his closing speech , felt it proper to express his full concurrence with the opposing counsel as to " the relative degree of moral guilt , " and to declare that he regarded it as his clear duty " to take all necessary steps to bring them the men higher up to punishment " The disagreement of the jury in the case of Bendernagel , cashier at the Havemeyers &; Elder Refinery , will not lessen the activity of the prosecution in this direction ; it should be remembered that the chief plea in behalf of this defendant was that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frauds covered by the payments he was making Whether this defence was sound or not , a second trial may determine ; meanwhile , Gerbracht , superintendent of the Havemeyers &; Elder plant , has been indicted by the grand jury and is awaiting trial The first point has been gained by the Government  --  the men who did the direct and tangible work of cheating have been convicted ; if this simple result had proved too difficult to obtain , the whole matter would have looked hopeless . As it is , there is ground for looking forward to results that are vastly more important and that will be of permanent value . Between President Taft and Senator La Follette , according to a Milwaukee dispatch , there is intense hostility . " It will be open war without any direct declaration of war . " La Follette is not to be recognized in any way in the distribution of Federal patronage in Wisconsin . It is all to go to Senator Stephenson and the State Chairman , who is not a La Follette man . And the pity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be due to " personal strictures upon the President by La Follette in his magazine . " What shall it profit a man to gain a magazine and lose the offices ? Or what will a public man give in exchange for the offices% La Follette , at any rate , shows that his guns are not all spiked , for the latest issue of his magazine intimates the fear that President Taft is holding back his special messages until he learns what Aldrich and Cannon want him to say . We think that the only way to answer that is to cut off the head of one La Follette collector of customs and remove three postmasters . Maryland is one of the States in which the working of the Public Service Commissions in New York , and of similar bodies in two or three other States , has attracted a great deal of interest . The movement in favor of establishing such a commission in Maryland has bad the hearty support of the leading newspapers , and of public opinion generally . A bill has now been drafted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lines of the New York Public Utilities act , though features embodied in the laws of Wisconsin and Massachusetts have also been utilized . The bill is very comprehensive , including the regulation of railways , street-railways , gas , electric-light , telephone , and telegraph companies as to rates , character of service , issues of stocks and bonds , etc . The commission is to consist of three members , appointed by the Governor , and their pay , which is not fully specified in the present draft , is to be large enough to secure the full services of competent men . First in interest among the twenty-four public measures which Gov . Deneen has summoned the Illinois Legislature in special session to consider , is direct primary legislation . Illinois in the last five years has enacted three direct primary laws and has seen them all declared invalid by the courts . The first law , passed in July , 1905 , was held invalid the following April primarily on the ground that it discriminated between Cook County and the rest of the State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was nullified in October , 1907 , on the ground of wrongful delegation of powers , insufficient provisions for registration , and interference with the elector 's right to cast a cumulative vote for members of the Legislature . The last two reasons accounted for the invalidation of the third law which went into force in July , 1908 , and was quashed the following June . Beneath the bludgeonings of chance , Gov . Deneen comes forth with a new measure embodied in a series of five bills , formed so as to meet the objections of the courts . A direct plurality primary is provided for county offices , and for all incorporated municipalities having a population of 5,000 or above , leaving the system optiona for all other cities . Members of the Legislature are likewise to be nominated by direct plurality under such provisions as ' shall enable the voter to express his preferential choice among three candidates ; among these he may distribute three votes , or he may plump them for one man . An advisory vote for President and Vice-President of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plurality being taken for the State at large . A significant feature is that embodied in the last of the five bills , which provides that municipalities may substitute nomination by petition for the direct primary by a referendum vote . Should packages marked in writing - " Not to be opened until Christmas " be allowed to go through the mails , at the low rates applying to merchandise and printed matter , or should they be charged with letter-postage rates ? After the proper amount of solemn analysis on the part of the proper authorities , it was decided that such an inscription constituted a personal communication , and therefore the package must be paid for at first-class postage rates . Now , there is really no occasion for this overshadowing fear of the written word which . seems to weigh upon the minds of post-.office authorities the world over , and which is the source of an endless amount of petty annoyance and difficulty to those who use the mails . The distinction between first-class , or letter , postage and the other classes Is no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities naturally feel the importance of this consideration . But they seem universally to have overlooked the fact ? that , so far as concerns the revenue , only the single letter rate  --  two cents in this country , for instance  --  is of any importance . The revenue that is obtained from overweight letters is quite insignidcant . Accordingly , all this bother about written matter accompanz ing books and packages could be got rid of , with practically no loss of revenue , by simply requiring a minimum postage of ' two cents on any package containing written matter . That is , merchandise - would pay merchandise rates , books would pay book rates , quite regardless of the question whether they carried written matter or not , provided only that there was as much postage on them as would carry an ordinary letter ? two cents . This would not only re -- suit , as we have said , in no loss of revenue worth mentioning ; it would almost certainly result in an increase of revenue , owing to the freer use of the mails which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson of Montreal , in a statement i as admirable in form as it is moving in substance , has brought the recent distressing episode concerning the distinguished poet to a not unexpectecl. end . The long- interview published immediately after his arrival in this country showed too clear evidence of an unbalanced mind , even if it had not been matter of pretty general knowledge that the poet had , a number of years ago , passed through a period of mental illness . Mr. Robinson Watson 's statement as to the origin of that former attack is of the highest interest , connecting it with the production of the noble poem on the death of Tennyson under circumstances of extraordinary strain , with the poet 's previous struggles with poverty , and with the shock of joy and relief caused by signal and substantial recognition coming at that time . It can but be matter for sincere regret that a way was not found to keep this man of high and fine nature , who represents today as do few others the best traditions of English poetry , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that , wide as has been the publicity given to what looked like an unpardonable offence on his part , the episode will now be forgotten and William Watson restored , in the eyes of all the world , to the place to which the spiritual nobility as well as the literary excellence of his work entitles him . " From my knowledge of the working men of the North , " writes a correspondent of the London Spectator , " I am finite certain that if Mr. Balfour definitely states that in order to broaden the basis of taxation he will advocate a duty on foreign manufactured articles only , he will win Lancashire , which , as you know , has a great influence on the voters at the later elections ; but if there is the slightest doubt in the minds of the operatives with respect to a tariff on foodstuffs , he will assuredly lose . " Whether this forecast is correct or not , it gives an interesting picture of that state of mind which is at the bottom of the strength of protectionism the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been brought up with such a strong feeling of the importance to him of free trade in food that his fear of the effect of a tariff on foodstuffs may outweigh his desire for a tariff on manufactured goods which would help ably is that he would like foreign competition ruled out from his own particular geld . And once the protective system is actually established , this desire outweighs all others connected with the question . Each beneficiary desires to hold on to his part of " the pork , " and only a few go beyond this consideration so far as to strike a balance of advantages and disadvantages , even for themselves , not to speak of the country as a whole . It is easy to see why , when a yrotectionist regime has once been started , it is almost impossible to bring it to an end . In the College of Cardinals there is an unusual number of vacancies , and ? : everal American archbishops have been candidates for a red hat . But they are likely to be disappointed , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sera . Ile gives it as the semi-official opinion that , of the nine or ten new cardinals to be created about the middle of January , not one will be American . Bound by the concordat with Portugal , Pius X will bestow the cardinalate on Monsignor Bello , Patriarch of Lisbon . At least three Italians will be chosen ? Granito di Belmonte , Papal nuncio at Vienna , almost surely , and two workers , like Monsignor Lugari , Assessor of the Holy Office , and Monsignor Giustini , secretary of the Congregation of the Sacrament . France , whose normal supply of cardinals is seven , has now only three . Monsignor Amette , Archbishop of Paris , is slated for one of the honors , although his opinions have not been sufficiently ultramontane - to satisfy the Jesuits . To offset him , Monsignor Cabridres , Archbishop of Montpellier , an aristocrat and thoroughgoing reactionary , may be selected . Monsignor Jubillard , Archbishop of Cambdry , is the third possibility among French prelates . One red hat is to go to a Spaniard , , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Archbishop of Westminster , is to receive the honor which is long over-due . The death of Father George Tyrrell , ex-Jesuit and ablest of all the Modernists , has brought a lull in Dr. Bourne 's jurisdiction , so that the Vatican can promote him without misgivings . Yet , as the Italian motto runs , " a cardinal is only a caprice of speaks in the consistory.
