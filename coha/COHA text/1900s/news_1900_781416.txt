txt Creditors of Count Boni de Castellane and the Countess de Castellane , formerly Anna Gould , have decided to ignore the action of the French courts in appointing George Gould as the guardian of the Countess , and have arranged to bring actions in this State with the view of preventing the Countess obtaining all of the income due her from the Gould estate until her debts , which amount to several million dollars , have been paid . The first move was made yesterday , when Guggenheimer , Untermyer &; Marshall , representing Anton J. Dittmar , the assignee of claims of a bric-a-brac dealer of London , obtained a temporary injunction from Justice Fitzgerald , in the Supreme Court , restraining George J. , Edwin , Howard , and Helen M. Gould , as trustees under the will of the late Jay Gould , from paying to the Countess de Castellane any income which might be due her . Argument for a permanent injunction and the appointment of a receiver for the Countess 's interests will be heard in the Supreme Court on Monday next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has others representing over a million dollars , and the present suit is looked upon as a test case . On the other hand , it is learned that the trustees propose to fight the claims here , arguing that the Countess has no direct interest in the estate beyond her income , and that the income is not hers until it is actually due and payable ; therefore the creditors of herself and Count Boni can place no claims before the trustees for settlement . n the present action Anton J. Dittmar , who is associated with the law firm conducting the case , is only the nominal plaintiff . The real plaintiff is Asher Wertheimer of London , England , a dealer in bric  --  .1-brae . In the complaint filed there is some idea given of the large purchases made by the Count and Countess de Castellane on credit . Their first dealings with Mr. Wertheimer were in February , 1897 , when they obtained articles worth ? 7,738 . Mr. Wertheimer drew on them in August , 1899 , and the draft was accepted by both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to and including October , 1898 . As the accounts now stand there is due and payable , according to the dealer , the sum of $201,432.74 , and there are drafts not yet due which amount to $115 , - 657.32 , ' making a total of $377,290.20 . After setting forth these facts and giving copies of the drafts , the complaint recites the fact that Anna Gould married Count Boni de Castellane on March 4 , 180 , and that under the trust fund created by Jay Gould there is about $18,000,000 , on which she is entitled to receive an income of about $900,000 a year . that " the sum of $230,000 per year and no more is necessary for the reasonable support of the defendant , Anna Gould , Countess de Castellane , and for the support , education , and maintenance of her children according to her station and condition in life . That sum of money will supply all the legitimate necessities and luxuries of life that she and her children now enjoy . The cost of living in France is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $230,000 , converted into French money , will purchase as much in the way of the necessities and luxuries of life in France as could be had for $400,000 in the United States . " The remainder of the annual income derived or derivable from the rents , issues , and profits of the trust estate , to wit , the sum of $6150,000 per annum , or thereabouts , is surplus income properly applicable , and should be applied to the payment of the debts owing by the said defendant , Anna Gould , Countess de Castellane . " The complainant further declares that the Trustees now hold a large surplus which has not been paid over to the Countess . Mr. Dittmar adds : " When the acceptances became due and remained unpaid , and after Wertheimer had been pressing for payment , Count de Castellane promised to return parts of the merchandise , and to permit the amounts at which such merchandise had been sold by the said Wertheimer to the defendants Castellane to be credited on account , but on being asked to make good his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I am informed and believe , he actually sold valuable parts of the merchandise . " Mr. Untermyer , when asked as to the purpose of the suit , said that the papers on file speak for themselves , and that he had nothing to say . He then added , how-ever : " It will be recalled that a few weeks ago George J. Gould was appointed guardian for the Countess de Castellane , with her consent , and that of her husband , in a proceedings in France , declaring her a spendthrift . The creditors claim that this proceeding was to get the property of the Countess de Castellane away from attack by her creditors , so as to enable the Goulds to force settlement of the debts at their own time and on their own terms . " The purpose of this suit will be to defeat that object , and . to have the Court regulate the way in which the income is to be applied to pay the debts . The case is novel in this respect , and the outcome will be watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shown to ex-Judge John F. Dillon , who represents the trustees of the Gould estate . He thereupon dictated the following : " The foregoing statement of Mr. Untermyer being shown to Judge Dillon , he said that no complaint or injunction had been served , and therefore he had no information as to the character of the suit , and could say nothing in respect to it ; that he is the counselor of the trustees of the estate of Jay Gould , whose will provides that his daughter Anna . now the Countess de Castellane , is entitled to one-sixth part , speaking generally , of the income of his estate . She is not entitled to any part of the capital or principal sum of that estate , as the foregoing statement seems to imply . The will of Mr. Gould further provides in substance that the income is to be a trust fund in the hands of the trustees , to be appropriated for the support and maintenance of his daughter , and that ... sheacanot anticipate or dispose of anY  --  Part of that incme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so received it shall not be liable for her debts or those of her husband , and undoubtedly the trustees will feel it to be their duty to have this provision in the will carried out in its full extent , or as far as is possible . The Countess de Castellane has no control , nor has the court any control , over the principal sum , which goes to her children after her death . " In the foregoing statement it is said the creditors claimed at the recent proceedings in Paris . whereby Mr. George Gould was appointed guardian for his sister , that the idea of Mr. Gould 's family was to get possession of the Countess de Casteliane 's income and force her creditors to settle on their own terms , which is obviously a mistake , as the only effect of that proceeding is to prevent her from incurring fresh obligations without the consent of her brother . " None of the trustees under the will of Jay Gould would talk about the case , referring all inquiries to Judge Dillon . It was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardian of his sister 's interests . At that time the Countess 's debts were given as $740,000 due zn connection with the Charity Bazaar Building . $1.317.032 on mortgages payable from 1900 to 1909 , 3858.631 on bills for money loaned , and $1,820.000 owing to curio and bric-a-brac dealers , malting a total of 33,735,643 . A lawyer familiar with the situation said yesterday : " The creditors of the Count and Countess evidently realize that under existing- conditions their only chance to get at least security for their claims is to bring proceedings here .
