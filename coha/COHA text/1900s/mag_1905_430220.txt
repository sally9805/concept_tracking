 |p1276  The first thing that strikes one , in reviewing Admiral Togo 's magnificent victory , is its strict accord with the well-known insistence of Japan that her ships shall fight near her own coast . Therefore she put Togo with his fleet in the shortest highway to Vladivostok and so near to her own bordering shores that even a desperately wounded vessel might be able to limp into some one of her many havens and dockyards ? and then leaving invitingly open the main road , quietly awaited her adversary 's arrival . Into the trap bravely steamed Rojestvensky 's ships , foul with weeds , short of coal , and anxious- to reach the northern shelter . The Japanese , with merciless precision , closed in around them with a ring of steel and fire , every attempt to break through which was met by the torpedo boats , and then as darkness fell came the rush of the destroyers . The rest of it was the gradual extermination of the survivors as fast as they were caught in their flight , and so the proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the strongest parts of our Navy is the Atlantic Ocean ; another is the Pacific . Hostile fleets to attack us must cross them . Clearly it is better to do our sea fighting at home ? as Togo did . That also makes for a smaller Navy , since two fleets , one to go off on excursions and the other to defend the coast , will not be needed . Japan at once achieves a great advance as a naval Power , while Russia , on the other hand , is now almost as negligible as was Spain at the close of the recent war . The difference in her favor lies in her superior resources . To rebuild her navy will be the work of years , but the replacing of ships . alone can never insure an efficient navy . That is only to be obtained through efficient men , and the lack of these is the direct cause of Russia 's defeat . A battleship can be built in 40 months , but it takes 72 months to render a man , otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 20 years to educate a competent naval commander . These are the periods required , observe , when the raw material comes from a stock bred to the sea and when training is conducted under the traditions and discipline of the natural sailor races . To these the Russians do not belong , nor have they ever followed the Anglo-Saxons in sea discipline and traditions . It is reported that the crew of one of their sunken battleships was drafted from an artillery regiment and that some of the officers were cavalrymen . This may not be true , but it would be nothing surprising if it were , since Russia has always mixed her land and naval forces . England , in Charles II 's time , had sailors to handle her ships and soldiers to fight her guns , but the separation was clear . The sea is a jealous mistress , and while she permits the sailor sometimes to do the work of a soldier , she never submits to the control of the soldier only . It is a new navy of men that Russia will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships . The net result of Japan 's achievement is to reduce the Russian navy from third to seventh place among the navies of the world , and to advance the Japanese navy to sixth place , so that the Powers ( arranged in order of tonnage ) now rank as follows : Great Britain , France , Ger many , United States , Italy , Japan , Russia , Austria . As every foreign nation is to be reckoned as a possible enemy an increase in our present Pacific fleet is indicated , unless , of course , we follow Japan 's policy in limiting our sea fighting to our own waters , in which case it is not apparent how any hostile meeting between Japan 's navy and ours could ever occur . III . One clear result is the unsettlement of the whole battleship question . The first brilliant attack made by the  |p1277  Japanese torpedo boats at Port Arthur temporarily silenced the extreme advocates of the battleship ; but because the subsequent torpedo work did not continue to be spectacular they took heart of grace and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably do some hard thinking . In an article in Collier 's Weekly , published a month ago , Captain Mahan says : " While open , I hope , to conviction , and despite the impressive potentialities of the torpedo vessel , I believe in its essential inferiority if resolutely met , " meaning by " resolutely met " if such vessels do not produce a panic akin to that caused in by-gone years by fireships . He adds : " I should certainly expect the Japanese admiral to withhold his armored vessels of every kind till he has fully tested the possibilities of his torpedoes " ; and then he conceives : " Should unsuccess compel him , " Togo would " bring the armored force into play against the undiminished Russian fleet . " The obvious inference is that Captain Mahan deems torpedo attack well enough to try at the outset , but hardly comparable in certainty of finally destructive result with the gun fire of heavy vessels . Yet the accounts so far received of the great fight reveal much difference of opinion between Admiral Togo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous gun fire from the Japanese . An eye-witness of the engagement says that " by the unusual gun fire of the Japanese the Russian vessels were thrown into utter confusion . The Japanese knew instantly the enemy was beaten and the concentrated fire now became absolutely infernal . " The torpedo boats appear at the outset to have been used to prevent the hemmed in Russian ships from breaking through the cordon of Japanese vessels , while the gun fire was kept up at constantly decreasing range , and concentrated at times first on one Russian and then on another with systematic deliberation . When a victim showed clear signs of distress two or three torpedo boats would come in to deliver the coup de grace . After nightfall , however , the main torpedo assault was delivered , and the result was the sinking of the Oslabya , " " Alexander III , " " Navarin " and three gunboats . Plainly Admiral Togo was very far from regarding the torpedo attack as an expedient to be tried out in the beginning . On the contrary , he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gun fire , and it seems that most of the ships which were sunk succumbed to it . Again has been proved the vulnerability of the huge battleship . Again it has been proved that the most complicated aggregation of mechanism that the human mind has ever produced can certainly be sent to the bottom by a few score pounds of explosive detonated against her under-water hull . Another fact to be noted is that the heavy superstructures of the battleships did not prevent wholesale slaughter of their crews and prompt destruction of ammunition hoists and other vital mechanisms . The men who escaped from the " Borodino ' liken her decks to shambles , and yet here was a vessel in which the crew were mainly disposed in no less than eight separate armored turrets . Conceive the frightful slaughter which would occur in such vessels as our " Kearsarge " or " Kentucky , " where most of the crew is massed in a single huge , weakly protected compartment . It may well now be doubted whether any construction could be devised more certain to sacrifice life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is got when the animals are driven into a crowded enclosure . And all past experience of naval actions proves that bodies of men can seldom withstand the killing of thirty per cent . of their numbers without demoralization and surrender . Surely it is time to heed the logic of events and seriously consider whether ships which cost over five millions each , but which can be turned into slaughter houses above water , and which a couple of hundred pounds of gun cotton below water can send plunging to the bottom , are after all the best sea weapons which the ingenuity of the most ingenious people on earth can devise . And , finally , this great action was won , not by a huge fleet of battleships , but by four , supplemented by eight armored  |p1278  page deleted  |p1279  the navy for what he has done " with the best strategy . " It is to suggest that when the prophetic strategy of the study comes to be exemplified by the present forecast ( made by the " foremost living strategist " concerning the greatest naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumspection in depending upon thereafter . V. The certainty and precision of heir battle tactics show how completely he Japanese had reached that ready condition to which Dean Merivale nearly half a century ago , in his " History of the Romans , " gave the name of " preparedness for war . " That the phrase means ships and men adequate to any probable emergency goes without saying , but this s not all it signifies . It also includes the development of adequate sources of supply . It is necessary only to point to the marvelously rapid increase in the Japanese manufactories indicated by their now undertaking the construction of a battleship of the largest size , 19,000 tons , to see with what activity this development is being pushed . It is true that our powers that be are advocating more battleships , which involve the assembling of the results of already developed resources ; but it is not so plain that the further development of the resources themselves have been fostered to an extent in anywise sufficient to meet possible emergencies . The curious notion seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make guns and conduct all the experiments to meet the constant demand for improvement of them , and also ammunition with its improvements , and it has even been seriously proposed that it should make armor also . Yet with all the facilities now existing in this country it is extremely doubtful whether we can produce any adequate supply of ammunition . Look at the blowing off of muzzles which still continues because we persist in keeping afloat guns designed for brown powder pressures long after brown powder has become obsolete and replaced by smokeless compounds . It is a private concern which is making at its own cost the experiments looking to betterments in our weak weapons . There are not wanting critics to contrast the expenditure of ten millions for buildings at Annapolis with the reluctance to give to American gun makers the contracts to devise and make better arms than we have . Nearly fifty years ago one of our naval officers , Commander James H. Ward , a brilliant scholar and one of the first to die at his post in action during the Civil War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unreasonable , to look in a Continental nation , as the United States , for the living perpetual interest and favor with which an insular people , like those of Great Britain , cherish their wooden-walled defenses and patiently endure the burdens they entail . But such a degree of experimental construction as will determine the best types is judicious ; because with men , money and material at command it renders the problem of sudden and indefinite increase in the number of ships of easy and safe solution in the event of war . And . . . it is in reality resources for building , equipping and manning ships , in which England vastly excels , that gives to her , or to any nation possessing them in the greatest degree , a true and actual maritime ascendency . " It is especially reassuring to learn almost coincidently with Togo 's victory that the Navy Department for the first time in many years is ready now to buy navy guns from private makers in this country , and that both the Bethlehem Steel Company and the Midvale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armament of the battleship New Hampshire " and the armored cruisers " Montana " and " South Carolina . " We can not afford to continue below the standard of naval preparedness which Japan has exhibited . The encouragement of our own manufacturers seems the best way to reach and maintain it . VI . The dash and vigor of the Japanese attack would , of itself , indicate that the fight was won by young men , even if their presence were not already well known . The average age of the Japanese commanding officers is between forty and forty-four years . All the Japanese rear-admirals are less than fifty years of age . Togo himself is fortyeight . The men who handled the smaller vessels and torpedo boats are much younger . Our Navy is officered by old men , too old to be of any use in war . Our youngest rear-admiral is older than Togo . The average age of our captains is thirteen years beyond that of the Japanese  |p1280  page deleted              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
