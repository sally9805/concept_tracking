txt Yesterday 's rioting in connection with the trolley strike here was followed to-day by a period of quiet , and interest was shifted to the attitude of Dennis Mulvihill , . this city 's union labor Mayor . Mr. Mulvihill 1 interfered yesterday when two deputies attempted to arrest a rioter for stone throwing , with the result that the man was allowed to go unpunished . Public indignation on the Mayor 's action ran high and resulted in a meeting of prominent citizens at  --  which Mr. Mulvihill was forced to promise to keep hands off and let the Police Department assume full charge of mobs in future . The meeting at which the . Mayor capitulated was nominally ' a gathering of the Police Board , but the protesting citizens , including well-known manufacturers and lawyers , had arranged to be there . It had been called indirectly to the Mayor 's attention ? that ? legal steps might be taken against him because of his action in seeming to aid the strikers unless he changed his attitude . The men who attended the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences following the disastrous mix-up of Sunday afternoon . There were present at the meeting , besides the four Police Commissioners , ex-Mayors Pyle , Taylor , and Stirling , President Birdseye of the Bridgeport Board- of Trade , President Graves of the Business Men 's Association , State Senator , Superintendent of the American Graphone Company 's plant , Judge Beers , General Manager Sewell and Counsel A. W. Paige of the traction company . Sheriff Hawley and Deputy Sheriffs Hendrie and Plumb were first called upon to tell  - -  their stories of Sunday 's riots , after the Mayor himself had called the meeting to order . They declared Mr. Mulvihill had laid his hand on the deputies ' arms and told them to let their prisoner go . The Sheriff himself admitted that he knew this only from hearsay . Then the Mayor denied that he had interfered or favored the disorderly mob . He was trying to aid Po'Iceman Burke , he said , when he saw the deputies seize a man . He says he did not know that they were deputies . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bead , inflicting a painful wound . Following the Mayor 's explanation came the protests . Mr. Paige , lawyer for the company , declared that the Mayor had acted most improperly . Others also told Mr. Mulvihill the same thing . Then they demanded his promise not to use his power over the Police Board to prevent the force from being used to keep order . He hesitated and parried their questions for half an hour . but finally gave the promise . . THE MAYOR ANGRY . Mayor Mulvihill to-night expressed himself as very angry because of the treatment accorded him at the meeting . He said : " it seems as if I was on ? trial . I knew nothing of this conference until . I reached there . I supposed that it was a regular meeting of the Police Bdard , and was surprised to find men there who were apparently there in the interest of the trolley company to humiliate me and put me in a false position before the public . I will yet clear myself . I have witnesses to prove that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his duty . I did not order any policeman to refrain from assisting Deputy Sheriffs , nor did I do anything , as I am charged with doing , to encourage rioters . The fact is , that anything that I would have done or might have done would have displeased my critics . I might have remained at home . Then I would have been called a coward . As it was , I risked my life ; in fact , was struck by a stone in an effort to quell disorder . " I still maintain that the responsibility for yesterday 's disturbance must rest with the trolley company . Why did n't they start their cars on Saturday ? They ought to have known better than to start them on Sunday when the streets Were full of people . " In regard to future events . the Mayor said that if the Police Commissioners and the Sheriff desire to handle the situation he is willing that they should do so . The Mayor said he had a copy of the riot act in his pocket yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient policemen about to enforce it . He said : There were 7.000 people in that crowd , and the whole New York Police Department could not disperse it . " President Henry D. Beach of the Police Commission said to-night that to-day 's meeting had cleared the atmosphere for the present and for the future as well . He said : " We know now what to do . We found yesterday that there was a conflict of authority between ourselves and the Mayor . We found that the Chief of Police could not determine whether to obey us or the Mayor . " ' The Connecticut Railway and Lighting Company did not attempt to run any cars during the early part of the day , except two or three on the Stratford line . The first one from the Barnum Avenue barns , the scene of the rioting yesterday , was started out after 1 o'clock , when the Mayor - had consented that policemen should guard the cars . During the rest of the day , though there was ro casualty , between fifteen and twenty arrest : : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the peace . Most of them were taken to the station house after ' being detected yelling " Scab ! " on the streets , and tevo of them had thrown stones With bad aim . The three prisoners arrested during the riot were carried to court in the morning . Two were held under $1,000 bail- for trial , and the case of the thin was postponed until to-morrow . The company ran eight cars on the Barnum Avenue and State Street line throughout the afternoon , and the front and rear platforms of each were occupied by two special Deputy Sheriffs standing on either side of the ' motorman and the conductor . The passengers - were few . A spectator , standing on the sidewalk near the New Haven Railroad depot , counted ten men and two women riding in the eight cars . No attempt was made to run cars after 7 o'clock . MILITIA . MAY BE NEEDED . That the State troops are very likely to be called out is acknowledged . One of the officers of the traction company said to-night : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through , for although we have plenty of men to take the places of the strikers , there is not enough protection in the way of police , and when the strikers realize they are out for good I fear there will be setious trouble . " The Sheriff , of course , has power to appoint as many deputies as he wishes , but he has exerted this authority pretty nearly to the limit , having about 100 on duty today . If ? these can not do the work of keeping order , an application will be made to the Governor of the State , who already has the-facts about the Sunday riot in his possession . " There are 250 strikers , conductors and motormen , demanding 221 ; fi cents an- hour wages Instead of 20% cents . The policemen of the city number only 58 . Sheriff Hawley , after swearing in 38 deputies yesterday , got 40 mere to-day , collecting them from neighboring towns as well as from here . The only doubt in the - mincle of the company 's officials , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikers will grow violent and prove too strong for this moderate police protection . There is no anxiety on the score of a scarcity of non-union motormen and conductors , for enough of them have been imported already . The representative Of the company said : I estimate that there are more than 225 men . including ex-employes of ours and men who have-come from out of town , now ready to take charge of the cars , but we are not going to run the full force until there is a certainty of adequate protection . Having had fifteen cars running to-day , it is our plan to send out twenty-five early in the morning . If we find that works a right the number will be . increased .. If we ca n't finally resume full operations ivithout appealing , for State help , we must ask , for it . " The non-union men who have come into the city to run the cars are guaranteed good wages , and it is known that ' some of them  --  those- on duty in the eight cars , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of them. , it is said , represent the class of trolley employes who make it a regular bueiness to go about the country under the lead of well-known " strike breakers . " The streets of the city , if not showing signs of immediate danger to-day , at least gave evidence of latent trouble . The . strikers . sullen for the most part , but often talking loudly of their grievances , seemed to be everywhere along the trolley lines . They walked idly up and down , each wearing a white ribbon , on which were printed in black letters the name of the union and the number of the local branch of the Amalgamated Association of American Street Railway Employes . YELLED " SCAB ! " WAS ARRESTED . When the first car of the Stratford line etarted at 11- o'clock there was a big crowd in the neighborhood , but Sheriff Hawley and his deputies were scattered about at ' close intervals , and . the first arrest of the day was made when a man howled " Scab ! " from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and caught the offender before he knew anybody was after him , and he was taken to the police station and held under $300 bail . The arrests made later were under somewhat similar circumstances . The crowd around the barns then dispersed . to gather again at about 1 o'clock around the barns at Barnum . Avenue and State Street . Probably as many as 500 men and women formed-the spectators who saw the car emerge from the barns at full speed , filled with Deputy Sheriffs . Col. liendric , who is an officer of the Fourth Regiment of the Connecticut Guard , was one of the officers on the front platform beside the motorman . The Colonel wore a warlike-looking belt , in which swung a big revolver . The car passed toward the centre of town unmolested ; and the crowd followed it only about ' half a block . There were no cries . The second - car , guarded in the same way , came out a few minutes later . This one and the first were followed down town by a patrol wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight cars ran at regular intervals . Most of the- fifteen prisoners were arrested in " West End . " where the barns are located . Every time one of the Deputies or policemen heard , cries derogatory to the motormen and conductors they lost no time in stopping the cars and running down the prisoner , who got a free ride to headquarters and was held on the formal charge of " breach of the peace . " After the departure of the second car from the barns the . crowd dispersed , and at no time thereafter were there more than a few score persons collected at any one place . Next to the " West End " neighborhood . the place most frequented by groups of strikers was the corner opposite the company 's offices , near the New Haven Railroad station . The police reported during the day that those injured in the Sunday riot were not dangerously wounded , though some of the gashes made by stones , sticks , bottles , and other missiles had been painful ones . The two men who were arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . if they ever intended to hit the cars near ? them at- the time .
