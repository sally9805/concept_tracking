Those persons who were caught out on the water when the squall broke were buffeted about in such a manner as to cause panic in nearly every pleasure party afloat . The wind sweeping over Gowanus . Gravesend , and Jamaica Bays whipped the waters into foam and swung man craft around as if they were so many chips on the waves . In the suburbs old trees which had stood up strong and sturdily in the morning lay prone on the ground when the storm had passed .

A score or more of the men , under command of Chief Master-at-Arms Thomas M. Walker , put out to aid those in the sloop , taking three whaleboats . Just as the sloop was about 100 feet from the snore they saw the sails belly out and the boat turn keel up , throwing those on the deck into the water .

When the darkening skies began to herald the corning of the storm there were scores of selling and fishing parties out on Gravesend and Jamaica Bays . The experienced sk-ppers among them , suspecting what was coming , took no chances and made all speed to the nearest landing places . The inexperienced and the reckless , however , thinking that a mere shower was Qreatening , remained out , some shortening " ' sail and others-not even taking this precaution .
