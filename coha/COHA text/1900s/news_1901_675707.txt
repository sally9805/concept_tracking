txt The men who are at present figuring as the shareholders of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Company do not intend themselves to construct either the bridge or the approaches allowed by the Raines bill , and against which such a determined protest is to be made to the Governor of the State . It is the intention of the share. : holders to sell out their holdings , and definite steps have been taken by banks and capitalists to finance the scheme when the desired privileges are secured . Such was the admission made by Law-yer Burton Harrison at the mass meeting at the Merchants ' Association rooms , 340 Broadway , yesterday afternoon . Mr. Harrison appeared there at the request of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Company , the company having asked that a representative of it be allowed to answer questions . Mr. Harrison admitted upon inquiry that he did not , in fact , represent the company , but the capitalists who expected to finance it . It was also frankly admitted by Mr. Harrison that the proposed bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approaches . He also said that only .1 ; a0,000 of the capitalization of $10,000,000 of the company had been paid in . He stated , furthermore , that the Raines bill was only a step in the powers of this corrs : pany . When he made this statement the merchants present laughed derisively . It had been the intention of the organizers of the meeting that certain resolutions should be presented condemning the proposed franchises to build elevated railroads on West Street . So unexpected were the admissions made by Mr. Harrison , however , that it was decided not to present any resolutions , as the ones that had been drafted were not strong enough . A committee was appointed to go to Albany on behalf of the Merchants ' Association , and that committee determined that all possible energy would be exerted in the effort to secure a veto of the bill by Gov . Odell . This committee is constituted as follows : Henry W. Goodrich , R. W. G. Welling , Arthur J. Baldwin , Charles L. Guy , Frederick AV . Hinrichs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William F. King . THE PROTESTANTS ' FORCES . It was evident front what was said at the meeting that more organizations than those already reported would send deiegationa to Albany to appear before Gov . Odell . The Real Estate Association is to be represented , and several property owners ' associations . In addition to these there will be the Merchants ' Association itself , the City Club , the Board of Trade and Trs.osportation , ' the ? citizens ' Union , the Chamber of ' Commerce . aPci representatives of the gov  --  ernraentafa .. theCity of New York . Mr. 1 Harrison gave notice that he would appear in advocacy of the bill . he having appeared before the committee of the Legislature when the bill was pending there . The meeting was presided over by William P. King , President of the association . A statement was read embodying the position of the Merchants ' Association with reference to the bill now before the Governor . That statement was , in part , as follows : " The officers of this association are not opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of New York , but they are opposed to giving away valuable franchises at the expense of the taxpayers , ? ? It is not disputed that a belt line would be beneficial to New York , but that fact alone does not justify a surrender of the franchise to a corporation . ? ? The city might properly control the road , and lease to the highest bidder the right to-use it for a proper compensation . The taxation of the City of New York is increasing every year , and to reduce that every effort should be made to have public ) franchises paid for . " The present position of the association is that a measure of such great public impertance and so vitally affecting the taxpayers of this city should not be adopted without the fullest public discussion . A careful examination should be made into all the facts and the probable results . No such opportunity has been given . The measure was railroaded through the Legislature at the very last moment of the sesMon. - There are obvious objections of great weight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions of good faith . The bill should not become a law until all doubts regarding such apparent defects are disposed of . and they can not be disposed of if this present bill becomes a law . " The officers of the Merchants ' Association have distinctly stated to the represen-t tatives of the bridge company that if , after full inquiry . it shall be found that the measure deserves support , the association will advocate it . " The chief objection to the bridge bill which was so hastily railroaded through the Legislature is that it offers too small a remuneration to the city for the valuable franchise it secures to the company . It is one of the most important and most valuable franchises ever given to a corporation , and public franchises given to private corporations should certainly bring an adequate return to the City Treasury . The greatest drawback to-day to New ' York 's Prosperity is the extreme rate of taxation on real estate . which is not born by the , real estate owner . but by the manufacturer and merchant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATTITUDE . The questioning of Mr. Harrison began almost immediately . Mr. Harrison from the very first talked as if he were exasperated at the questions asked him . He later explained this to be because of the fact that almost every question cast odium upon him . Arthur J. Baldwin was the first questioner . Sitting near him was Horace E. Deming , who will appear before the Governor on benalf of the City Club , and who was present as an adviser yesterday . Mr. Harrison was asked his interpretation of the clauses of the bill referring to the compensation the city was to receive for the elevated railroad franchise . He replied : When extensions have been granted under the present charter to the Metropolis tan Street Railway Company and to the Third Avenue Railroad Company , the city charter required that a percentage of the gross receipts should be provided to be given to the city for the use of the city thoroughfares. property belonging to the city . and every construction in that use to the ordinary street traffic . In every one of these cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been distinctly made that the percentage of gross receipts was to be calculated upon the receipts of that portion of the line which was granted by that particular resolution . and not upon any of the rest of the line . Now , what we say is that this percentage shall be calculated upon that portion of the structure which this bill relates to . and nothing more . " Mr. Baldwin asked if there should be a terminal station at the point stated , would any tax have to be paid for the terminal station . Mr. Harrison replied : ? ? Why , of course , we are liable for all taxes in the City of New York . We are liable for all franchise taxes under the Legislature . The city should certainly not receive under this bill anything whatever for rights not held by the company independent of this bill . Whatever rights this company gets under this bill may be taxed by the Legislature . The Legislature in this bill has assessed upon the city a percentage of the gross receipts ascertained by the relation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copyright owner . Further reproduction prohibited without permission . roach to the whole cost of the bridge ; That is all . " Frederick W. Hinrichs then asked this question : " Why was a bill of such importance rushed through the Legislature of the State of New York at the closing days of the / session of this Legislature without a proper opportunity on the part of representatives of the eitizefis of the City of New York to be heard ? " EXPLANATION OF HASTE . Mr. Harrison replied to this question as follows : " I will say that this bill was passed at kthe tail end of the session because it was ot passed before . It was introduced on March 29 , I think , which was nearly a month before the Legislature adjourned . It was referred to a committee , and that committee gave Public hearing . I went before that committee , was heard , and the city was heard against it . It was a long time before that committee reported , and when it did report the thing was finally passed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my = right tells me that the discussion before the legislative committee took place on the ' 16th . We ask the question why was it in ' troduced in the last thirty days of the Leg , islature. and taken before a committee of the Legislature ten days before the present i meeting ? I ask , also , is there anything in this bill which would compel any member of this corporation or any other person to build a bridge over the Hudson River ? " ' Mr. Harrison  --  Unless the thing to be built down to the river front as an approach to the bridge is intended for that it wo n't have any existence , and ca n't , under this bill . There must be some approach in order that there may be a bridge . There will be no approach if there is no bridge Charles L Guy asked of Mr. Harrison : " Does n't this bill absolutely take away from the city the control of its own docks and take away the control of the approaches to the docks and piers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reply . Mr. Guy  --  You perhaps have a different apprehension of the English language than I have . Mr. Harrison  --  Well , assume that Mr. Harrison a few minutes later said : " Now , this thing has undergone public scrutiny for years and years , and it has met with the approval of every legislative body that has ever gone before . " Mr. Guy asked : " You are not speaking of this particular bill now ? " Mr. Harrison  --  Not of this particular bill , but of the company in all its enterprises . and of all the necessary plans contained in this bill ; this bill is not to be dealt with in and of itself . but is to be considered as relating to all the necessary legislation . MR . HARRISON 'S ADMISSIONS . The next question of Mr. Baldwin 's led up later to the unexpected admission of Mr. Harrison . Mr. Baldwin asked : " Is th. , capital in this company to build this . or is this merely a franchise to be sold : There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of differ- ' ence as to the support of this association as to whether or not this was a legitimate enterprise or whether or not it was a mere option or franchise which should be negotiated . " To this question Mr. Harrison replied : " There has never been any attempt to sell any franchise , or to sell any company . The holders of the majority of the shares of this corporation do expect to sell their shares . I am told that there are financiers in this- town of unquestioned responsibility , who are entirely ready to provide the means of building this bridge when they can get it in such shape that they can see I any prospect of return for their money . : and they have refUsed to deal With this isituation on any terms unless , in addition , 1 it gives them a percentage . " Mr. Baldwin  --  What is the capital of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Company. and for what was the capital stock ! and how much was issued ? i Mr. Harrison  --  There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and what v , as issued , I am told , was issued on what the statute required . 10 per cent . cash , the rest the liability of the subscriber . Mr. Deming  --  Mr. Chairman , I would like to ask the total amount of capital so far subscribed and paid in , including all the enterprises ? Mr. Harrison  --  I do n't know . That does not concern me . Mr. Deming  --  Mr. Chairman , I should like to ask if there is any representative of the bridge company who can answer that kind of question ? Mr. Harrison  --  I do not represent the bridge company . and I never did . I represent people who desire to build this bridge , if they get the opportunity . We have applied to the Sinking Fund CoriamiSsion ; and have not been - able to make any headway , an &; then we tried . to avail outselves of the Legislature . and hence this bill . Mr. Derning  --  Does Mr. Harrison represent the capitalists who intend to buy the shares , If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some things which I must deny myself the pleasure of l communicating , even to Mr. Deming . I / will tell von I am representing people who . , I are willing , to undertake this : enterpriseif ; they can see a profit in the conatruetion of this bridge and they are given an opportunny to finance it . Bankers are not in the habit of having their names bandied about ornoters . Controller Coler was in the audience , and at this point he was called on to state how g much money the city had put into its dock system He said : E ? ? I hope at least to meet all of you gent tlenaen before the Governor next Tuesday ; I hope the bridge company will be represented , and not the gentlemen who are going to buy the franchise . We thought we were dealing with the bridge company ; Mr. Candee says that is where we have been mistaken . Well , I really think he is right . because I knew the bridge company could not get that bill through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting , and there was then an adjournment After the meeting was over the committee which is to appear at Albany held a conference and decided upon the manner in which its protest would be presented . EX-GOV . WERTS 'S DENIAL . ' Declares the Company Will Not Sell Out  --  Says Mr : Morgan Offered to Buy Its Franchises . Ex-Gov . George T. Werth of New Jersey , general counsel of the corporations interI ested in the New York and New Jersey Bridge Company , yesterday made a statement regarding the plans of the company . ' In respect to the charge that the corporation would sell its franchises to capitalists he said : " There is no truth in the assertion that the bridge company will never build the bridge , and is merely holding the franchises to sell them out to the highest bidder . The company has all the financial backing it needs to build the bridge , which will cost about . $e0,000,000 , and it will not sell out . . It has already had many offers from . capitalists and corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Pierpont Mortgan was one of those who sought to acquire the rights . " CITIZENS ' UNION COMMITTEE .
