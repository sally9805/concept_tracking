SPEAKING of a new book that deals with some of the more conspicuous facts and tendencies of American life , a newspaper said : " It is not easy to recall a single thing with which the author finds serious fault .. No doubt he does take mild exception to an occasion ? al infelicity of human nature or of the social order , but such incidental hints are quite lost in the gentle flow of his satis ? faction with things as they are . More ? over . his contentment seems genuine . " How is it about things as they are ? Should we be satisfied with them or not ? The head-lines of the noon papers on the news-stands to-day cried , " Two Hundred Lost by Fire or Wave ? Burn ? ing of a Steamship . " That 's not very satisfactory . It is typical of innumer ? able daily happenings that are sorrowful . dreadful , depressing ; which include ac ? cident , catastrophe , poverty , disease , the inequitable distribution of goods in this world , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized life , dis ? honesties , brutalities , insanities , fallacies : " And in the world , as in the school . I 'd say how Fate may change and shift ; The prize be sometimes with the fool . The race not always to the swift . The strong may yield , the good may fall , The great man be a vulgar clown , The knave he lifted over all , The kind east pitilessly down . " That is the way of it . At times it gives us all low spirits , and out of some of us it makes pessimists . It was in the paper yesterday that a doctor , who was an as ? sistant in an insane asylum , blew out his brains , leaving written on a sheet of paper , " What 's the use ? " And that 's a question that , first or last , very many of us have to meet . Most of us are sub ? ject to fluctuations of energy , health , and spirits , are bolder on a full stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ished pockets , than we are when our physical machinery runs imperfectly , or things in general for any reason seem to be going wrong . When life wells up strong in us and the way is fairly clear ahead , and we want things ardently and hope to get them , " What 's the use ? " does n't trouble us , and when our light burns low , and obstacles look big , and work distresses , and we want to stop and sit down , then it seems a very rea ? sonable and natural question . But it should never be a practical question with a real bearing on purpose or effort , and if it is not to be that , the more sound reasons we can find for a general sat ? isfaction with things as they are , and the deeper the foundation on which we can base an open-eyed optimism , the bet ? ter , surety , for us and for our work in this life . " Things as they are " includes every ? thing ; not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done ; not only exist ? ing facts , but prospects , tendencies , and laws ? the whole terrestrial and celestial machinery . To be satisfied with things as they are is to be satisfied with the machinery of the universe and the Mind that devised and directs it . To believe in God , which is instinctive , to have a profound confidence in His wisdom , ca ? pacity , and benevolence ? no less sure a rock than that will do for the foundation of intelligent optimism . Confidence that things as they are reflect in a large way the purposes of the Almighty Will and are working slowly forward and out in accordance with Almighty Benevolence , is but a corollary to belief in God . That belief is the greatest existing power that makes for sanity , for courage , for pa ? tience , and a consistent optimism . It must be that the pessimists are those who , for one reason or another , have lost the usufruct of it , and with it the greatest source of courage to live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct ; some by mental disease , some by intensity of selfishness and self-indulgence ; some be ? cause details overwhelm them , and they lose sight of generals in the deluge of adverse particulars . Unless one has con ? fidence in the Management of this uni rse , it must seem a dreary show . Un ? til one somehow has gained that confi ? dence , the more he thinks about things as they are the worse he is entitled to feel . That German scholars , and others who have failed to gain it , should write depressing books about human affairs and creatures and finally settle back into gloom and cut their throats or wind up in madhouses , is quite reasonable and seems to accord accurately enough with the scheme of things . For surely it is part of that scheme that man should know God and trust in Him , and other ? wise should not go forward nor find rest for his soul . No working hypothesis about this life has ever been , or can be , satisfactory that does not include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things , there is a just and benevolent Power , in accordance with which this planet spins on to an adequate destiny . Confidence in the Management , then , is the first essential to a hopeful state of mind about this remarkable terrestrial show , of which we are all a part , and to a qualified satisfaction with things as they are . Almost everybody has that confidence in some degree , and most people who think about these matters are optimists as it is . The reason why more people are not more optimistical about things in general must be partly because their confidence is not vivid and conscious enough for them to lean hard upon , and partly because their perception of the intentions and methods of the Manage ? ment is not clear enough to enable them to recognize and put themselves in har ? mony with those methods and intentions . Most reasonably intelligent people in our time have come to believe that the uni ? verse is run by law and not by whim . It has taken a long time for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got so far , the most interesting and important things in life become the discovery of the laws to which human existence is geared , and the work of adjusting ourselves to their operation . Whether or not we discoverand pay attention to those laws makes no difference about the laws , but it makes a lot of difference about us . The laws will stay as they are whether we discover or regard them or not , but whether we stay and how we stay ? whether we go forward or backward , in ? crease or diminish , grow in grace or per ? ish ? depends upon our success in ad ? justing ourselves to the requirements of those laws . Nobody knows all of them , or nearly all , yet , or can live in accord with many of them , but the belief in any person that he begins to understand something about some of the vital ones , and to see their point and purpose , and how they are working , and that other new laws are constantly being discov ? ered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prac ? tical application of discoveries and un ? derstandings ? all that is immensely con ? tributory to a state of satisfaction in that person with things as they are . There are two ways in which we learn out of our own experience to know the most important of the laws that regulate life . One is by obeying them and finding a profit in it ; the other is by running counter to them and getting jolted . His ? tory is the record of the profits and the jolts experienced by our immediate pred ? ecessors during the last six or eight thou ? sand years in their investigations of how to , and how not to , behave . The daily newspaper is the record of contemporary effort in the same line . Most of us know something about history and are grossly familiar with newspapers . We ought to be able in a loose way to compare the past with the present . Well , how about it ? Is God 's will better understood on earth than it was even a thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was even a mere century ago ? Even if it is not , that need not discourage any one , because the process of getting comprehension into human heads is well known to be mighty deliberate and fluctuating , and , likely enough , we flatter ourselves un ? duly if we suppose the present stage of it is the final one in which human endeavor is to reap the whole harvest of time . But one may confess that even of this present stage some signs look very hopeful . There is the Church , reduced in some particulars to a condition of feebleness unmatched since its best days ; shorn of almost all temporal authority , but abounding in influence ; left powerless to compel , but unrestricted to persuade ; deprived , in great measure , all over Christendom , of that control of public education , which ? vast as its services to education have been ? it usually abused , yet never freer to teach and preach the Christian gospel , and probably never a greater influence for sound morals and Christian living . Considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got , first or last , by its efforts to stifle truth , it is edifying to observe that the search for truth is most eager and successful , and the en ? thusiasm about it most ardent , in the Christian countries . An inference , that comes easily and is reasonable , is that there must be an absolute antagonism between the truth-stifling propensities of ecclesiastical organizations and the spirit of the gospel that those organizations have purported to represent , and that , however faulty in spirit and deportment the organizations may have been and still may be , the seeds of truth and liberty in the gospel which they must disclose are strong enough to survive the mis ? treatment . In that inference there is a fine anchor ? age for the optimist . If he can look beyond the misdeeds of Church organ ? izations and find a sound and perfect gospel , that is an immense encourage ? ment . For the imperfections and mis ? deeds of an organization he can easily make allowances . All organizations , po ? litical , educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apt to be danger ? ous to liberty , and to the very purpose they exist to promote . They are prone to consider , as they grow strong , that they exist for their own ' sake and not for the sake of the ideas behind them . Po ? litical machines are notoriously inclined to ignore principles and even righteous ? ness in reaching after power and places . Educational organizations are liable to spend their strength in perfecting the machinery of education , and lose sight of the ends of teaching . Charitable or ? ganizations , justly growing more and more in favor , have constantly to face and fight the danger of being swamped by their own machinery . If religious or ? ganizations come at times into conflict with the spirit of the gospel they stand for , it is not to be wondered at , for it is the natural propensity of organizations to love life and live for themselves . And yet organization is indispensable , and we have to pay the price of it and be vigi ? lant that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are not only the seeds of disease but of cure . When they get too tyrannous or diverge too far from the ideals that are their war ? rant , they smash or yield to discipline , and this is the more certain to happen to the Christian Church organizations because the gospel they are bound to works irresistibly for freedom , tolera ? tion , and truth . All civilizations heretofore having been based on religions and having gone for ? ward apparently as far as their underly ? ing religions could carry them , it is the very corner-stone of satisfaction with things-as-they-are to have confidence that their religious basis is sound , ample , and coextensive with all requirements . Having concluded that the world has a mind behind it and is governed by law , the next important thing for would-be optimists who are living in a Christian civilization is to be able to assure them ? selves that the teachings and the faith in which that civilization rests do not antagonize , or diverge from , the eternal laws , but blend with , interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attainment of that assurance than full liberty to hold the contrary opinion as long as it seems the better one . People speak with mournful conviction of the collapse of the creeds and the necessity of devising new working hypotheses to which to adjust the conduct of life , but do they appreciate how vast and hard-won a privilege it is which they enjoy in holding undisturbed that the creeds have collapsed and that life needs a new chart ? Like as not the written creeds are imperfect , though some of us , as we grow older and get new points of view , grow sceptical about our own scepticism ? ; but Christianity is not written creeds , but a life . Creeds are convenient , if true , but not indispensable . One gets at the essential principles of Christianity not by studying its creeds , but its life . One way to test its precepts and its prin ? ciples is to try to put them into practice and see how they work . Another way is to try some other scheme of life and see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or read history and biography and see how various experiments in living have turned out . Any reasonably good scheme of life will have much in com ? mon with the Christian scheme ; all the great religions have much in common with it ; but it is an immensely im ? portant basis of optimism in a citizen of a Christian country to believe , or even to suspect , that in Christianity are all the ideas and provisions that are neces ? sary to the perfect development of hu ? man life and human institutions , and that Christian civilization never will be checked in its progress because it has outrun its religion . And since , if Christianity is perfect and sufficient , it must win in a fair con ? test with any other scheme of life , it is a great additional basis for satisfac ? tion with things-as-they-are that the contest is so much more free , that per ? secution is so nearly dead , that the pur ? suit of truth is more and more honored and less and less penalized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world begins to wish him ( iodspeed , and that though mistakes , misapprehensions , and half-truths are feared , the truth that is really true is feared less and less , no matter what its bearing may be on preconceived opinions , or vested privileges , or exist ? ing organizations . One of the cheering things about the world as it is is the rising courage of mankind ; the courage of some of the Haves to lose what they have if justice demands it ; of some of the Have Nets to gain what they must have to make life profitable ; of states ? men to give liberty and self-government - to peoples , and of the truth-seekers to find out the truth at any cost and give it to mankind . Folks seem nowadays to be less afraid of bogies than they used to he . If we do n't believe a creed or a policy , we put it down and go on with something that we do believe in , and gather wisdom and experience in effort as we go . And if in course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to us from another angle far down the road , we re-examine it with lively interest , and use it if we can . Wasteful masters of the people used to burn or behead folks for doing that only two or three centuries ago , and if we had lived then we would probably have considered that so to wipe out heresy or treason was a wise precaution . So the mind has gained enormously in freedom , and that is fair matter to be cheerful about . As for the body , the mind can take care of that if it has a fair chance . The body is only a detail , a creature that the mind and the soul have charge of . It can be fed . There is plenty to feed it , and apparently there can be as much more as is needed . The problem as to that is one of methods and distribution , and belongs to the mind . Folks who are anxious nowadays are anxious about the lessening rate of in ? crease in population , and not as Malthus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources of Earth . The mind can do ahnost what it will with agriculture , and is doing it ; can replant forests and preserve such as are standing , harness waterfalls , reclaim waste lands , irrigate , make four acres do what forty could not do without applied knowledge . It can feed , clothe , and shelter every ? body abundantly ; can protect and pre ? serve health , can better immensely the distribution of wealth . All these things it is incessantly at work to do , and con ? stantly progressing and improving in the doing of them . While the soul is free to gather inspirations and inspire the mind , and the mind is free to learn all truths and apply all that are needed of them to the defence and nurture and development of the body , how can one help but be hopeful about things as they are ? Imperfectly as wealth still performs proper functions , is it not better geared to them than it has been in times past ? Of course a lot of it is wastefully used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of the total wealth as appears , because the wasteful use is apt to be far more conspicuous than the fruitful use . Be sides the very large share of the total wealth that goes to maintain life in no more than reasonable comfort , and to enlarge the opportunities and better the lives of those who have it , there is con stint expenditure of slices and shares of the incomes of the greater fortunes in works of studied and tested benev ? olence , and above all in promoting educa ? tion and the discovery of truth . So common is this use of superfluous money by individuals as fairly to give ground for the suspicion that the limitations of the profitable use of money for per ? sonal advantage are being better appre ? ciated . Those of us that have learned a little , really want , not money , but life ? the " more abundant life " that is worth having . We want money in so far as it promises increased life ; but , looking about at the various people who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , beyond a certain point which many attain , the mere command of money does not give the coveted in ? crease of life . Excessive fortunes seem as apt to blight life as to expand it ; and when they do blight it -breedingselfishness and laziness , narrowing asso ? ciation , relaxing fidelity , and paralyzing effort ? they bring , not envy , but contempt on their possessors . To see the rising generation of heirs male of a great for ? tune proceed to equip themselves with repining wives and prosperous mistresses is to the ordinary looker-on as disen ? chanting a spectacle as tenement-house congestion . When superabundant money works such disaster as that , is it any affectation to say it is dreaded ? to say that it is despised ? Now , we can endure to be despised in good cause , but when we begin to suspect that we are just ? ly contemptible , or in danger of being so , it is apt to bother us , be we ever so callous . That may be one reason why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an intensity almost comparable with that which marked its accumulation . There seems to be nothing profitable to do with the more enormous fortunes , the rolling up of which has made so many observers anxious , but by hook or by crook to devote the bulk of them to securing the welfare of the people from whom they were derived . And in great measure this is done automatically merely by putting money to profitable use as capital and directing its expenditure , not necessarily with altruistic intent , but merely withintelligence . So industries are developed , processes are improved and perfected , and the earth subdued to the uses of man . We are so used to it hereabout that we forget to wonder at the prodigality with which great private fortunes and vastly greater sums of the taxpayers ' money are poured out for the increase and spread of knowledge to qualify the mass of the people to help themselves and come to their own . Knowledge is power , yet there is no perceptible disposi ? tion to restrict or engross it . Those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profited by it find the readiest ex ? penditure for their gains in provision to make it as common and as fruitful as they possibly can . When a Tillman says , " Do n't teach the negroes so much that you ca n't control them , " it is like the voice of a Rip Van Winkle ; an echo of times gone . Hardships and sorrows mark the march of progress . Children work in mills when they should not ; some workers get too high wages and others far too little ; in ? juries and wrongs cry out every moment to be righted . So it has always been ; perhaps it always will be so . The very Earth itself , unfinished still , can not sus ? tain the jolt which jars some detail of it into a new adjustment without such suffering to human creatures as we saw the other day on the shores of the Strait of Messina . " Wounds and wants and fears . The seething urgency of discontent , And groans and tears , grim tokens in them ? selves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes for solace to think that , as much improvement and cure come pain ? fully , so much of the world 's pain is cur ? ing something . We are all tied together so that nobody 's ill case can be neglect ? ed with impunity ; and yet we are free ; each to get what he can that is good , to learn what he can that is true . And happiness has such encouraging ruled To give is really better than to receive , besides being pleasanter ; and to love even one 's enemies is better and more cheer- , ing to one 's own spirit than to hate them , and less nauseating than to love one ? self . To hate is to suffer ; to love is to rejoice . To think last of oneself is next to being proof against calamity . The natural laws work ever in the long run for the material welfare of men ; the spiritual laws work just as surely for their consolation and happiness . Re ? spect for both is the price of satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both kinds of laws is rapidly improving , to the immense betterment of the condition and the relations of men , is the greatest basis of satisfaction with things as they are , and the most satisfy ? ing answer to " What 's the use ? " Back of everything else is the instinct ? ive conviction , common to most minds , that existence does not end with death . What comes next is a free field of spec ? ulation , but the belief that something comes next , and that , somehow , person ? ality and consciousness are preserved , was never more general than now , nor held by stronger or more respected minds . It is not matter for argument . Evidence and argument for it do not prove it , and the most that can be done for it in that way is to demonstrate ( as is not difficult ) that modern science can produce neither fact nor argument that weighs signif ? icantly against it . People who believe in the future life " because the Bible says so " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and people who believe in it as a result of ruminations and re ? flections extending over many years , be ? cause it seems to them to accord , on the whole , with probabilities , are interested to remember , not as a reason , but as a concurrence , that " the Bible says so , " and that it is part of the body of Chris ? t ian teaching . Superficially it seems to have wonderfully little effect on human conduct or human hopes , but it lurks persistently in the backwaters of thought , and is a valuable conviction to have in the back part of one 's head . The more points in which , out of our own experi ? ence of life , we find the tenets of the re ? ligion on which our civilization rests to accord with the facts of life as we under ? stand them , the more respectful and ex ? pectant we become in the examination of those tenets which as yet we do not see our way to accept . 369 Altogether , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases of optimism . It helps in a good many ways ; opens a door to the solution of a good many perplexities ; helps some of us to acceptance of that science of the rela ? tions of men to men which we find in the Christian gospel ; makes life a bigger and more interesting speculation , with larger possibilities of profit than are quite with ? in mortal ken . Noble characters have developed without its aid , but as a rule the great characters seem to reach out for it , and , as years increase upon them , doubtless rest on it more and more . It makes for patience , for hope , for tolera ? tion and good humor . Anything is en ? durable that is only a process . Signor Ferrero says that we Americans are pretty much all optimists , and very good-humored , and surprisingly gentle , all of which he admires in us with a generous envy , and says our mood about life is by no means that of Europe . That is partly due , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we and all our concerns are in the state of process ; not fastened to any ills or defects or mis ? takes , but going on ? blundering on , usually ? to fuller life and wiser ways of doing things . Surely that is a sound view of life which estimates it all to be a process . It is either that , or a sublimated rat-hole , and in so far as we can choose which we will have it , confidence in im ? mortality will argue against the latter . But this life properly confronted is in itself a mighty interesting adventure while it lasts , and meant , apparently , to be lived primarily for its own sake . Let the life to come be what it will , whatever is really best for this life is best for that . Truth here is truth there ; love here is love there ; riches here may not be riches there , but that depends upon the han ? dling . That a blithe spirit should be serviceable in either life seems altogether likely . Wherefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An optimist , how ? ever light , who is still game to take hold and lift , is helpfuler than the most pow ? erful pessimist who has let go .
