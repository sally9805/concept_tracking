SIR The letter in your issue of November 8 , from Prof J S Clark of Northwestern University , on the cause of bad spelling , is confirmed by my own experience In the examination of students at different times for many yeais , I find that those who had learned to spell by syllables were usually correct in their spelling , while those NA ho had been taught the word method of reading often had a hard time of it Professor Clark hits the nail on the head The " word method " is responsible for much bad spelling A F BEARD . NL NI . York , November 19 TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION SIR The papers are paying considerable attention to the visit of 500 English teachers , under the direction of Alfred Mosely , who thinks that American schools are better than those of his own country Mr. Mosely , who is primarily a business man , does not , of course , speak as an educational expert My own opinion . if I may venture it , is that he is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am glad he secured for these English teachers so cheap a rate as $25 for the round trip across the ocean I only wish that he would do the same for 500 American teachers , so that they might see how much more and better work the English boy of nineteen has accomplished than the American boy of the same age The daily tasks for boys of sixteen or seventeen in English schools would , if imposed on boys or girls in the highest class of any secondary school in this country , evoke from the pupils rank mutiny and from their parents loud complaint The requirements for admission to West Point are child 's play compared with the competitive examinations for Woolwich and Sandhurst The same is true of the College Examination Board 's examinations in this country as compared with those of the Oxford and Cambridge school certificate examinations in England The English boy of nineteen goes straight from the sixth form of his school into the Classical Honor School at Oxford or the Classical Tripos at Cambridge No ordinary graduate of an American secondary school could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classics The Rhodes scholars who are graduates of our colleges are nettled to find that such boys far surpass them in knowledge of the classics The course of study for the Sixth Form at Rugby , Winchester , and all the leading schools reads like the curriculum of the sophomore or junior year in an American university Let no one , be he editor , parent , teacher , or pupil , lay the flattering unction to his soul that American schools are better than the English , tested by the finished product in mental power , discipline , and accumulated knowledge Such advice as this is now much needed , considering the steady oozing of virility out of our courses of study , and the steady growth of the sugarcoated-pill theory of education . The New York Schoolmasters ' Association demands of the College Entrance Examination Board representation on the committees that frame examination papers , and on those that examine the books , and they get it Then they grumble because the present moderate requirements are too hard and wish them made easier Harvard has dropped to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes in a single subject , so that he can enter college by piecemeal in the course of a few years I know a little about the secondary schools of Germany and France , considerably more about those of England , and a good deal about those in the United States It is my deep-rooted conviction that , judged by the tests I have mentioned , those of my own beloved country are inferior to the rest in intellectual vigor and most need a virile uplift GEORGE L Fox New Haven , Conn , Novembei 12 under the above title in the Nation of October 4 Professor Child 's criticisms are mainly the result of misunderstanding the point of my argument My point was not that " the degree of A B is quite as significant of a certain profitable discipline , whether or no it stand warrant for any Greek at all , " but that the effective preservation of the A 13 , and alt that goes with it , can be secured only by broadening the terms on which it may be obtained , and on which students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its context , Latin and Greek  --  not " the tag and good-will of the old firm , " as Professor Child supposes My contention is simply that the preservation of Latin and Greek is best secui ed by the effective preservation of the A B degree , this degree in turn is saved from practical extinction only by broadening its terms for admission and graduation This involves no comment , expressed or implied , on the value of the degree thus administered , and hence no implication as to the relative merits of the classics and modern studies I merely urge that such administration is better for Latin and Greek Professor Kelsey 's criticisms are directed mainly toward the accuracy of my figures concerning the number of students of Latin anc Greek in secondary schools and colleges He rightly assumes that they indicate only general conclusions , their use for further inference is , I believe , at least hazardous He notes certain errors in the figures for 1904 , but fails to observe that similar errors occur in those for 1894 regarding the number of secondary students in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without going into details , I may say that the statistics quoted nearly fulfil the statistician 's requirement , i e , they represent " phenomena of the same class but existing at different points of time " Since the errors are approximately constant , their elimination would not affect my general conclusions , which were , first , that Greek appears to be declining slowly in the face of a general increase in the secondary school and college population , and , second , that Latin is increasing , both relatively and absolutely , the absolute increase being phenomenal Professor Kelsey 's data showing the rap-:d decline in secondary students of Gi eek , coincident with the abandonment of prescribed college enflame Greek , would go far to refute my statement that this abandonment has not gi eatly influenced the decline , if he could also prove that the prescription of entrance Greek is the only factor influencing the number of its secondary students This proof is , of course , impossible On the other hand , certain other potent influences in the same direction are easily discernible The administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid drift of matriculants toward college degrees not requiring Greek is another , and still others might be named These , taken together , seem to me the most powerful influences in this direction , continued prescription could only have delayTHE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE NAVY To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION SIR As editor of " A Contribution to the Bibliography of the History of the United States Navy , " by Charles T Harbeck , allow me to correct two errors iii the review in your issue of November 8 The title , " A Review of a Pamphlet puiporting to be Documents in Relation to the differences which subsisted between the late Commodore 0 Perry and Captain Jesse D Elliott By a Citizen of Massachusetts Supported by facts made known to the world in 1820 and ' 21 by the accused Bo 4-ton H B &; J Brewster , prs , 1834 55 pp 8 ?

THE REVIEWER AMERICAN FLYING MACHINES To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR Permit me to call attention to an ei i or in your issue of November 15 , in which you say : M Santos-Dumont by a flight of more than 200 metres in his an ship , becomes the first skipper of a flying machine who has risen from the level , flown for an appreciable distance , and landed without serious mishap The previous experiments by M Santos-Dumont and his winning a large prize for flight in a dirigible balloon have been so widely reported that his latest achievement with a genuine airship without the aid of gas , is popularly accepted as the first of its kind . It seems certain , however , that to America belongs the honor , and this should be known and recognized now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of successful air-flight by man The studies of the late Professor Langley 1 esulted in a model of an airship which sustained its own weight in flight for three-quarters of a mile over the Potomac It is not so generally known that two Americans  --  the Wright brothers of Dayton , 0 ? after some years of experiment on the sand dunes of the Carolina coast , with apparatus akin to that of the German Lillienthal , solved the problem of the airship , within the past year , in an enclosed park near Dayton They made many successful flights , of at first short but later increased duration Finally , one of the brothers made a continuous flight of about twenty-five miles at an average rate of forty miles per hour , but purr osely , as in the case of Santos-Dumont , at no great height above the earth These statements were testified to at the time of the convention in New Yoi k last winter of those interested in man-flight , and there was published in the New York Ti ebitne a testimonial to the facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMES Boston , Mass , November 16 It is possible that the brothers Wright have exceeded Santos-Dumont 's exploit , but their trials were conducted in such secrecy and so little is known as to the nature of their flying machine , that their record must count as at least doubtful The Tribune itself , to which 11r Ames refers , said in an editorial note on November 18 The unquestioned success achieved with his aeroplane by Santos-Dumont makes it extremely desirable that the Wright brothers come to the front and show the world what they can do Around the pretence of these Americans that they accomplished a year or two ago what Langley attempted In vain there has hung a veil of doubt Ca n't it be dispelled ? ?
