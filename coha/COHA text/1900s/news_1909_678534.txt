txt Slandered North Carolina . In Sunday 's paper " Paul Howard " states that nothing grows on the hillsides of North Carolina save " scrub oak , " " scrapple , " and a Cow other such words . ' Where does be get Ills information ? Is he a native North Carolinian or only a New Yorker ? For from , my porch to-day I can see the tops and two sides of the mountains close by covered with a splendid crop of oats now ripening to the harvest , while on others one can see splendid crops of corn Planted and grown on almost perpendicular hillsides . A trip across one of these " barren " mountains will discover magnificent roads . bordered on all sides with a luxuriant growth of lovely rhododendron , the beautiful mountain laurel , gorgeous ferns , and a profusion of flowers of all sorts , almost tropical In their luxuriance . Does Mr. Howard get his information from first hand . or is he only displaying the superior and well-known ignorance of the New York City native ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
