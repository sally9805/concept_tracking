Worthington , Long Island Electric Railway Company , Andrew Onderdonk , Consolidated Telegraph and Electrical Subway Company , and Empire City Subway Company ( Limited ) . It can not be learned to-night what the sums assessed against these corporations amount to . Efforts to seeure these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be given out until they are in the hands of the companies assessed . Enough is known to-night , however , to demonstrate that they will be large enough to eat up from % to 1 per cent . of the yearly dividends at present paid by their companies . Among the smallest assessments made , Standard Oil , which practically has but an infinitesimal portion of taxable property of the franchise order in New York City , is assessed on $100,000 . This means merely an assessment on the terminal points of the company and practically demonstrates that the assessment on companies owning franchises wholly in New York City will be extremely large . Figuring at the rate of tax imposed on the Standard , Oil franchises in New York City the valuations on Metropolitan , Third Avenue , Brooklyn Rapid Transit , Manhattan , and Consolidated Gas franchises will be close on to $35,000,000 , bringing to New York City about $700,000 in taxation returns .

Corporations ' Objections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York City corporations in objection to the taxation of their franchises under the . Ford Franchise Tax law will be h " eld.before the State Tax Commission in , Albany to-day . J. Edgar Leaycraft of the " State Tax Commission started for Albany yesterday to take part in the sessions . According to President Feitner of the local Tax Commission the completed rolls will reach his office about April 16 , when they will be placed upon the books of the department and then run the usual course through the Municipal Assembly until they are collected . The tax levied under the assessment will become payable In October . Mr. Feltner yesterday was asked to explain for the benefit of the people , who are still in the dark concerning the working of this law , what the real effect of it would be and whether or not it would add much to the tax receipts of the city . " I am as much in the dark as anybody , " said Mr. Feltner , in reply ; " I do n't even know how the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less do I know how the courts will construe it . Supposing its constitutionality will be sustained , it may yet he construed in a number of different ways and it would take a prophet to tell which one will be adopted . I will suggest one possible construction . " Supposing the franchise is considered realty , as the law declares it to be , we may have to deduct it . together with the other taxed real estate and the debts of the corporation , from Is capital stock in fixing ? the tax assessment on its personal property . Therefore what would be gained in the tax on real estate would practically be lost again in the ' personal tax . If , however . although elapsed as realty. the franchise will not have to be taken into account in reaching the assessment on personal property , it would , of course , be a substantial gain in the city 's tax receipts . I believe . however , that the law will increase the tax receipts , but this increase may be only very slight . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results of the law until it has been tested .
