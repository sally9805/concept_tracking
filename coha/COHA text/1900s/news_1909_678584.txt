txt The Right Rev. Charles D. Williams . Bishop of Michigan , in a communication to THE NEW YORE Timm has explained the sermon he preached at St. Bartholomew 's Church , on July 38 , which was construed as a personal attack on John D. Rockefeller , Jr . He has frankly withdrawn the phrase which gave rise to this idea , and acknowledges that " it was undignified and unworthy of the occasion as well as unjust , " but he maintains that Mr. Rockefeller 's illustration of modern business competition derived from the pruning of a rose bush typifies not the natural evolution of combines , but the " deliberate policy of commercial assassination practiced by great corporations , " which should be heartily condemned . In his sermon on modern business meth .. ods the Bishop was quoted as saying : " A young scion of wealth and greed , possessed of more dollars than ideas , recently used the figure of the pruning of a rose bush . The gardener he pointed out cut off all but the hardiest buds , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right to apply this idea to human relations . That doctrine was advanced not in a board meeting , but before a Bible class . " A rose by any other name will smell as sweet , but the odor of that rose to me smacks strongly of crude petroleum . I wonder if that young. , man ever read the IIibie he professes to teach ? " Sermon Aroused Protests . A week later the Rev. Dr. George Thom. as Dowling wrote an open letter to the Bishop , which was published in Tait TIMES , taking up the cudgels on behalf of Mr. Rockefeller . He stated that the rose-bud illustration was used by Mr. Rockefeller many years ago in an address before his college Young Men 's Christian Association on " Christianity in Bus ! ? ness , " and not before his Bible Clash , and declared that he could of his own knowledge pronounce young Mr. Rockefeller as " a kind and faithful son , a good citizen , and a scrupulously honest business man , commanding not only the re ? spect of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who know him best . " Since preaching in New York the . Bishop had been on a vacation in the woods and not until his return did he learn that his sermon had caused so much criticisms Ile then at once wrote this letter : Mackinac Island , Mich. , Aug. 9 , 1909 . To the Editor of The New York Times " * ' Uponmy re turn from a camping trip . I find a letter from a friend In New York calling my attention to what he considers " the injustice of an attack on the personal character of Mr. John D. Rockefeller , jr. , " which I am supposed to have made in ... sermon preached in St , Bartholomew 's Church , New York . on Sunday , July 18 . The same incident is referred to in an open ? letter of Rev. George Thomas Dowling , D. D . published in a recent issue of your journal . I ask the use of'your columns la say in reply to these friends and to the public as follows : I had not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal character of Mr. Rockefeller or any one else . In the sermon referred to I Was dealing with a certain philosophy of the world as contrasted with the Gospel of Christ-1. e. , the philosophy of those who advocate the suppression of the weak and unfit in the interest of the development of the strong and capable as contrasted with the teaching and practice of Him who " came to seek and to save the lost . " As illustrating the application of this philosophy of the world to the industrial and commercial realm , I found Mr. Rockefeller 's unw familiar analogy from the coloration of the American Beauty rose admirable to the point . and that philosophy , so applied . I did condemn as antagonistic to the Gospel of Jesus anyi the ethics of Chris-tinnily . Beyond that condemnation I had no int.ntion or thought of going . Apologizes to Rockefeller . . One phrase used in the sermon , written and spoken in the heat of Indignation , I can now see is of the nature of a. personal attack  --  the phrase " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars than Ideas . " That phase I most sincerely regret , and apologize for . It was undignified and unworthy of the occasion , as well as unjust . I have no doubt that Mr. Rockefeller , Jr. , is , as his friends say he is , ... loved . by all who know him , not for his money , but for his singular purity . personal conscientiousness , and the thoughtfulness of his whole I I fe . " The ** tra tier/ I referred to  --  viz. , the Cultivation of the American Beauty rode  --  was used , I fun informed , in a college essay to Illustrate the natural evolution of combinations In the business world and not the deliberate policy of commercial assassinations as notoriously practiced by our great corporations by means of secret rebates trout the ratiroads. both on their shipments and also on the shipments of their smaller competitors : secret and paid espionage upon their rival 's business , manipulation of legislation , &c.,; ad nauseam . With natural evolution of industrial and colimercial combinations I liars no quarrel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied parl-passu by a larger and larger g  --  wernmental control and the soolalisation of the resulting benefits . But I can not see how the analogy used Illustrstes such a natural evolution , wbtls It most aptly pictures the policy of COTOrecial assassination referred to . Men with " Dual " Conscience .. At any rate . I took the illustration 111 that very obvious sense , and that policy , It seems to me , it is the fluty of every Chris ? tian minister and every man with a conscience to denounce as dishonorable ant ruthlessly unjust and oppressive : In a mord. utterly antagonistic to Christian ethics . Many icathrs in our business world seem to have a dual or divided conscience-4 conscience , that is , which is keen and sensitive to the point of scrupulosity as to technical pieties and even the , autor morals of personal conduct , while it is color blind in the region of the ' larger or social ethics . Perhaps they are more to be pitted as the victims of the " syStem " of ' big business " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. : deliberate framers of its execrable policies . They are possibly more the creatures of their environment than the creators thereof . It is that system and the philosophy which inspires it which I attacked in my sermon , and against that system and philosophy , it seems to me , the bounden duty of every man who has conscience and courage to " cry aloud and snare not .
