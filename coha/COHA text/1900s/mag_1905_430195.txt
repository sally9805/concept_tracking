 |p1047  " JAMES , a letter from Agnes . " Mrs. Leon tried to penetrate the newspaper bulwark protecting her husband between swallows of his morning coffee . " Will you hear it ? " With a lingering look at the quotations of the stock market , Mr. Leon vouchsafed the somewhat ungracious assent : " Oh , I suppose so ? what 's she want now ? money ? That 's usually the burden of that scapegrace Harry 's communications ? why , " glancing over the mail , " here 's one from the boy now , but it can wait ? sail ahead , Helen . " " BRYN MAWR COLLEGE , MERION HALL . " MY DEAREST MAMMA : " How I should like to step in for a moment to-night and see you , but , tho I miss you so much , yet I 'm so busy that I have n't really the time to be homesick ; for , indeed , I am just rushed with my college duties . I wish you could see my rooms , they 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . She 's been at Bryn Mawr nearly two years and knows all about college life ; and Alice says that I take to it quite naturally . I hope papa will not think that I 've been extravagant in fixing up my rooms , I tried to be economical . Alice calls them bachelor girl 's quarters , and I 've made up my mind that I shall always live in this way . Alice says there is no reason why girls should not live in this independent , free manner . And to think , mamma , that I 'm actually here at Bryn Mawr ! Oh , I feel so dignified and scholarly in the cap and gown ! It 's just lovely to wear this student 's uniform , different from the rest of the world . But it makes me feel sad that every one can not be students , but Dr. Haines says ? and , oh , she 's such a brilliant woman , she 's Professor of Greek , you know , and has degrees from all over the world ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world so as to release scholars from its slavery , thus enabling them undisturbed to pursue their elevating line . But what spare time I can get from my studies I 'm going to devote to the College Settlement , for I realize that it must be of great benefit to these poor creatures ? oh , I feel so sorry for them ? just to come in contact with those who have studied . And is n't it unselfish in college bred people to go down into these mean districts ? And Dr. Haines approves , too , of this idea of elevating the poor , for , she says , if left to their own short-sighted notions they might band together and destroy all the colleges and universities , so I intend earnestly to try to make them see the advantages of education . " Now , mamma dear , do n't worry about my health . Of course , I study very hard , the scholarship at Bryn Mawr is real ! But I have a walk every day , besides spending an hour in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it , says that we Bryn Mawr girls should show in every way , physically as well , as mentally , that we can compete on equal terms with our brothers . As for Alice , she can do anything in the Gym . ' " But you should see how the girls work here . And at any rate they say the examinations at Bryn Mawr are as difficult as those at Harvard ? does n't that show whether the brain of a woman is n't just as good as that of man ? The other day a lot of us girls were comparing some Harvard questions with some of Bryn Mawr 's , and we concluded that ours were even more severe ? wonder what Harry would say to that ! " Such an inspiring thing is it to see the girls in cap and gown passing back and forth to the lecture rooms . They look so earnest and studious . It all fills  |p1048  me with such an ambition to be a scholar , and do you know , mamma , that I 'm even thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 've just begun working for an A.B . But Dr. Haines is my ideal . I confess to being a little afraid of her . She is so absorbed in her work that she does n't seem to live in the world at all . When she comes into the lecture room she does n't seem to see any of us . She is a great specialist . But , never having been to college , you perhaps do n't realize what that means . Poor , dear mamma . you 've just had a home life , have n't you ? Alice and I have decided that we shall never marry , but we are going to study all our lives , and give our whole attention to higher things . This morning we spent the whole Greek period over one disputed line of the text , and it sounded so learned to hear this one and that one quoting her scholarly authorities , French , German , English , etc. , for various readings of this passage . I begin to see the more uncertainty there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for collegiate work . " And there are so many graduate students here , some working for A.M.s and some for Ph.D.s . And Dr. Haines says that one really has no pretentions to scholarship until one has a Ph.D . You see , mamma , here the ideas of scholarly work are very serious and earnest , and I guess that a Ph.D . from Bryn Mawr would entitle you to a position anywhere . Oh , I 'm so glad I came to Bryn Mawr , perhaps if I had n't I should never have known the real meaning of scholarship ! It 's such a wonderful thing to be a scholar , and I am going to live for that ! " What do you hear from Harry ? bad boy , not a word have I heard from him , tho I 've written him twice in spite of all the study I have to do . How I should love to see him make a good record as a student , but I am afraid that he 's a little frivolous , not quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dearest mamma , I am looking forward to the time when you will visit me here , and then you can see for yourself what a scholarly place Bryn Mawr is . Alice says she is dying to know you , for she thinks your picture is just the sweetest thing , and I told her it was just like you . Now , mamma dear , you and papa will understand if I fail to write sometimes it is owing to the fact that I have so much studying to do , and , of course , you realize that it can not be neglected for ordinary things . Well , it is nearing ten and I must to my Greek , so adieu , " With love to papa and yourself , " AGNES HAMILTON LEON . " " Ha , ha , " laughed Mr. Leon , " now let 's hear what the boy has to say . " " HARVARD . " DEAR FATHER : " Why did n't I write home last week ? thought I did . Mammy need n't worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful chest on me , full a quarter of an inch larger . Of course , I 'm improving my opportunities . And I 'm not so slow , either . Sailed through my exam . all right ? course I was coached a little , lots of the fellows are , save some of those tiresome grinds . " Wasting my time , " now do n't you think it . I am not particularly stuck on flunks myself , and Gee ! did n't I have to study at Exeter . But down there the profs. were strict . But here they put a man on his honor . Oh , by the way , I wonder if mammy knows that Bess London is here at Radcliffe ? girls better go to their own colleges , they ai n't wanted here . Agnes seems to be jollily happy at Bryn Mawr . I am looking forward to the great football game Wednesday between Harvard and Pennsylvania . I 'll bet on Harvard every time ; mighty strong captain that of our team ; that Campbell played last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he weighs 168 pounds , stands 5 feet 7 inches in hight , and has a dandy record , and the coming game with the Penn team will be immense . I do n't take a back seat myself in football , and with practice I should n't be surprised if I got on the team before I graduate ? am willing to work to get there , Itell you . Great time Wednesday , better run down , pap , and see it . Wish mammy would send me some more pillows and any little fixings she happens to think of ; my rooms are great . Oh , by the way , send me another 25 right away quick , will you ? " Lots of love to mammy , " HARRY . "
