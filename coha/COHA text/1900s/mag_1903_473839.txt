OF the Tawareks ? or Touaregs , as the French spell the name , ? the inhabitants of the open Sahara , and , in spite of European treaties and French spheres of influence , the real rulers of the country , very little is known . Most of the information that we have concerning them was gathered from some members of this race who were captured during a desert raid and confined for some time in a fort at Algiers . They are , however , known to be an educated race , as a rule , nearly white in color , who , since they inhabit practically the whole of the Sahara , possess a territory more than half the size of the ' United States . Ethnographically speaking , they belong to what is known as the Caucasic race ? the race that originated in that part of Africa that lies to the north of the Sudan , when the Sahara was a highly productive country , dotted with swamps and intersected by huge rivers , in which crocodiles , hippopotami , elephants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists , were our own immediate ancestors , and the Mediterranean branch of it to which the Tawareks belong are closely related to the Iberians , Corsicans , Italians , and Greeks . Owing perhaps to the fact that as the northern part of Africa gradually dried up it afforded insufficient sustenance for its inhabitants , these European branches of the - race in the dim ages of the past left their country in several successive migrations and settled in the more fertile lands lying to the north of the Mediterranean , where under happier circumstances they rapidly increased and became highly civilized races . The Tawareks , however , remained in the ancestral home of their family , which during the course of ages has so changed that at the present time it forms one of the most desolate wastes on the face of the earth . The result has been that while the Tawareks still retain the physical characteristics and intellectual qualities of the race from which they have sprung , their method of life , owing to the nature of the country which they inhabit , is entirely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated to the extent that they almost all can write and read in their own tongue ? Tamahak ? and a considerable percentage of them in Arabic in addition ; some of them can speak a Sudanese language , and as a race they seem to have a considerable linguistic capacity . The barren character of the Sahara compels them to lead the life of restless nomads , pasturing their herds and flocks on the desert scrub , and condemned to perpetually flit from place to place in search of the scanty supply of water and pasture upon which the flocks to which they mainly look for a livelihood subsist . Being as a race miserably poor , they supplement the scanty living which their beasts afford by preying upon their neighbors or acting as guides and guardians to those caravans that traverse the country of the tribe to which they belong . The rich caravans ? consisting sometimes of thousands of laden cam-els ? which cross the Sahara offer , when pass-ing through the coun-try of a rival tribe , an irresistible bait to these lawless nomads , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having at least one serious en-counter with these re-doubtable robbers . The Arab camel - drivers ? who , though capable of the most reckless brav-ery at times , are by na-ture a very cautious race ? go in fear of their lives of these dreaded marauders , and no power on earth will induce them to venture into the Tawarek country until they have come to terms with the chiefs of those tribes through which their road lies and paid the hInekmail demanded by them in return for a safe-conduct and protection while in their territory . Their fears are by no means ill founded , for graves of the victims of these raids and even whole cemeteries , with mounds of earth or mud pillars instead of gravestones , marking the places where caravans have been cut up , are frequently to be seen by the side of the Sarahan trade routes . Owing , however , to the recent French occupation of the northern part of the Sahara , the roads leading into Algeria have become , comparatively speaking , safe . All the Tawarek men conceal their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in color . This mask is never removed even in the family circle . Whatever may be the origin of this curious custom , it certainly is one that has its advantages in a climate like that of the Sahara ; for not only by covering the mouth and nostrils does it prevent evaporation andso enable the Tawareks to travel for long periods without drinking , but it shields the mouth and eyes from the flying sand during the violent storms which are so common in this region , and protects to some extent the eyes from the contrast in temperature between the day and the night , which is such a fruitful source of ophthalmic diseases . On account of this peculiarity end of their marauding propensities the Tawareks have been nicknamed by the French the masked pirates of the Sahara . " But , like every one else , the Tawareks are a compound of good and bad . They are seen at their worst in their relations with their neighbors , for in their domestic circle they are almost model family men , and their good qualities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in many respects recalls the romantic and chivalrous customs of the feudal ages in Europe . The young Tawarek gallant , mounted on his swiftest camel , armed with sword , dagger , and lance , roams the Sahara like a knight errant of old , protecting and guiding the caravans under the charge of his tribe , redressing and avenging the wrongs done to his slaves and serfs , or . in order to bring glory to his ladye-love , whose gage d'amour he wears , and to find the necessary dowry to settle upon her , engaging in adventurous forays upon Iris neighbors ' herds and the caravans under the protection of the neighboring tribes . From time to time , when an opportunity occurs , he sends a letter to his adored , giving , in a somewhat vainglorious tone , an account of himself and his exploits . These letters are written in the old characters of the Berber alphabet , which at the present day is in use among the Tawareks alone . They are sometimes il lustrated with rough but spirited drawings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cipher , of which the writer and the recipient alone possess the key , and not unfrequentiy they take the form of a short poem addressed by the absent Tawarek to his inamorata . When a Tawarek woman wishes to obtain some intelligence of her absent lover , if no other means are available for doing so , she arrays herself in her best dress , dons the whole of her jewelry , and betakes herself at nightfall to the nearest Tawarek grave , where , lying at full length upon it . she summons a spirit known as the Idebni to appear before her . If he answers to her call , he takes the form of a huge Tawarek , and seating himself beside the grave , enters into conversation with her . Should she succeed in winning his approbation , he gives her the information that she requires . Should she , however , be so unfortunate as to fail in so doing or to offend him in the slightest degree , the spirit immediately strangles her and carries her bodily off into the gloomy recesses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what is supposed to happen when a Tawarek woman does not return after invoking the Idebni ; but as the missing damsel is sometimes afterwards discovered as the wife of a Tawarek belonging to some distant camp , it may be assumed that these mysterious ceremonies are sometimes intended merely to afford an opportunity for a faithless maiden to escape from her paternal custody to elope , in the absence of her betrothed , with some more favored swain . In any case , when a woman disappears in this way , it is not considered etiquette to refer to her again in the presence of her relations . The Tawarek warriors return at intervals to the family circle from their forays in order to lay at the feet of their beloved the spoil that they have collected . On these occasions the women of the camp come out to meet them , chanting to the accompaniment of a guitar songs of victory and extemporary odes in praise of their exploits and valor . If the raid has been unusually successful , the whole community gives itself up for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights , and performances after the nature of " Punch and Judy " shows , with clay puppets dressed in rags , take a prominent part . During two visits to Algeria I had heard much of these curious Tawareks and of their romantic predatory method of life , and what I had learned had so aroused my curiosity that when , on a subsequent visit to that country , I was told that a camp of these people had been seen near one of the oases in the northern part of the Sahara , I could not resist the temptation to go in search of them to see for myself what manner of men they were . Owing , however , to their frequent migrations , I found them extremely hard to come up with . Like the mirage , they seemed to perpetually retreat from before me , and though I continually heard rumors that they were in my neighborhood , it was only after a protracted hunt that . I found their camp . The wayfarers to be met with in the desert show an endless variety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two groups of human beings . Nomads watering their herds at the wells ; Arab shepherds changing their pasture ; whole tribes migrating northward to their quarters for the summer months ; native hunters and falconers : squat , bandy-legged merchants from the lizab oases with their strings of camels or mules ; and caravans of lithe , wiry Arabs bringing dates into the market-townsare frequently to be met with upon these roads . Nor are the oases less interesting and varied . Each little Saharan city has , as a rule , a character peculiar to itself , and is totally different in the nature of its buildings from its neighbor some two or three days ' march distant . Often , too , the races inhabiting adjacent oases are entirely distinct from each other , and speak , if not different languages , at all events distinctive dialects . The markets in these towns are always full of quaint and picturesque scenes and figures , and afford an artist or photographer endless opportunities of exercising his art . In spite of the bad character which the Tawareks bear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went , were , with one exception , of an entirely amicable nature . The exception was in the ease of a grizzled , scarred , and battered veteran of a hundred desert fights , who , if his history could only have been discovered , would probably have proved to have been as hoary an old sinner as ever lifted a herd of camels or swooped down like a hawk in the windy dusk before the dawn upon a defenceless caravan . We met him riding , accompanied by a servant mounted upon a mule , into one of the desert towns . His steed was a huge white camel some eight feet at the hump . The Tawarek himself , like nearly all the men of his ' Mee , was extremely tall . He had apparently injured his leg . for he sat his beast in a curious sidelong manner , which , however , did not seem to interfere in any way with the firmness of his seat . In addition to his crippled leg , he had lost the little finger of his left hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not conceal that his nose had been smashed across his face . He had clearly been very much " in the wars . " In spite of the fact that he was badly armed and that our party outnumbered his in the proportion of two to one , he treated us with all the overbearing insolence for which his race is notorious . He rode past us at first without returning our salutation ? this in itself is an unpardonable offence in the desert . When addressed by one of my men , he commenced heaping the most insulting epithets upon him , My Arab , who was not blessed with too serene a temper , retaliated in the same manner , and if I had not interfered , the incident would have ended in that insolent Tawarek receiving a shot in the back from my infuriated Arab as he rode past us . The distrust that the Tawareks inspire in others is an entirely reciprocal emotion . They are as suspicions and as shy as wild beasts in their dealings with their fellow men . I employed n young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Arabs belonging to n , y caravan happened to be a member of a tribe with which his was at blood-feud , and it was very amusing to see the way in which my hulking guide sidled away and furtively handled the hilt of his dagger whenever his enemy approached him . The latter , feeling that he had the whole of my party on his side , abused the position shamefully , and chaffed that sulky Tawarek in such a merciless and insulting manner that he ground his teeth audibly in his impotent fury . In the middle of the day , when we halted for a meal , the young Tawarek absolutely refused to eat some dates that I offered him until I bail partaken of some of them myself as a guarantee that they were not poisoned , and he had watched for about a quarter of an hour to assure himself that I did not suffer from any ill effects in consequence . When at length I prevailed upon him to accept a few , he squatted down upon the ground at a little distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them minutely , smelling and licking them all over before he became quite satisfied that they were innocuous . Then he made up for lost time by bolting nearly three pounds of them in about five minutes . It was very curious to watch him eating . Like ail the Tawarek men , he considered it immodest to show his face , so he passed the food up under his mask in such a way as to show not even his chin . Before dismissing him , I bought the whole of his arms , with the exception of his dagger , for which he asked an enormous price , wishing to retain it , as he did not like to go about unarmed . The possession which he most prized Was a large stone bangle which he wore upon his arm above the right elbow . This had been given him by his fiancee , and she had inscribed her name upon it . He would not part with that , he said , for " all the camels in the Sahara . " A French soldier , whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts in the Sahara , told me that he had orders not to allow any member of this race to approach him , but to fire a shot over his head if he came within a thousand metres , and to shoot the pariah dead if he did not immediately take the hint and sheer off . This soldier was what is vulgarly known as a " sans sooci " ? that is to say , he was a member of one of the condemned corps who together with the " " foreign legion " ? the Tureos , Spahis , and other native troops ? form the bulk of the garrisons of the French forts in the Sahara . As these condemned corps consist of those soldiers who have been convicted of serious crimes during the term of their military service , in point of depravity they are quite a match for any Tawarek , and , with the exception of the almost equally disreputable " foreign legion , " are the only troops for whom the Tawareks and other warlike desert tribes have any real respect . My sans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed me with a leer that even at a thousand metres it was difficult to miss these huge Tawareks , and consequently the first shot often took effect . In accounting to the authorities on his return for his missing cartridge it was , lie said , merely necessary for him to show that he had killed a Tawarek with it , and no further questions were likely to be asked . The weapons of the deceased were the French soldier 's by right , and he could sell them as curios to the officers , who were always glad of an opportunity to purchase them .
