txt Remarkable Letter from a Russian Staff Officer . From The London Times . The following extract from the letter of a Russian staff officer at the front , addressed to a journalist who has distinguished himself by his Chauvinistic articles in a St. Petersburg journal , appeared in a recent number of the Osvobozhdenie , the organ of the Liberal Opposition , published at Stuttgart , and requires no comment : If our official sources of information are occasionally compelled , for political reasons , to observe silence , we can all understand the reason . We can all understand why silence was maintained as to the loss of nearly 8,000 men at Wafang-kau , ( Telissu , ) and also as to the loss by one regiment of its colors , that sacred object of military honor . We can all understand why nothing was said as to our hasty retreat before an enemy only equal in numbers . But what we can not understand is the effort made by journalists to keep the public in an optimistic frame of mind to distort facts as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know nothing . If you will read attentively the official report you will see that on June 14 the enemy had only two incomplete divisions , while we had two and a half . Moreover , with us a regiment consists of four battalions , save in the East Siberian units , which have three . We had also two brigades of artillery  --  that is , ninety-six guns , besides a Cossack horse battery with nine guns , ( sic , ) the Primorsky Dragoons , and two regiments of Cossacks . Our force , as you see , was not a small one . To the assistance of the Japanese came a divislon  --  the staff report says a brigade ? of infantry with two or three bat , teries , while three regiments were sent to us by rail . But you talk of this as our heroic battle with an antagonist three times our strength ! We have always known how to die , ( with some exceptions , ) but this does not mean that an enemy so rare from a military point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contempt which our custom is to shower upon this civilized nation . I have a right to speak , for I have spent a. considerable time in Japan , and I tell you frankly that I often blushed for my country when I compared many things there and here . An enemy so dangerous , whether as regards persistence , readiness for war , or moral strength , Russia has never met . Japan is a dangerous enemy for this reason : Our soldier , unfortunately , despite valor and resignation , is inferior to the Japanese soldier in discipline , and  --  what is still more important  --  fights with indifference , under compulsion . For the Japanese this is a war for an idea ' which penetrates all without exception from the . Minister to the husbandman . Here you have the reason for such incidents as occurred at Chong-chuyou are probably unaware of this  --  where the Cossacks refused to charge , and as a result we lost three officers . It is from this fact , and not from the color of the uniforms , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those of the men , that the true reason Is to be found for the large percentage of losses among the officers . Our Trans-Baikal and Siberian Cossacks are our weak point . In consequence of their loose behavior and want of preparation for active service they are of little use to us . The army awaits with impatience the arrival of the Fifty-first and Forty-ninth ( Fifty-second ) Dragoons . It Is hoped that they will help to place the scouting on a proper footing . Our officers , as a whole  --  especially those trained in the Rinker schools  --  are undoubtedly inferior to the Jananese as regards . professional training . The majority . it is needless to say , go under fire not for the sake of an idea ( the only idea that could have any force with us would be self-inter ' est ) , but for the sake of tradition or for distinction . But they do not consciously die for their country 's sake , for its good , because it is evident , upon anything like an attentive consideration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you only I knew what we did during the Chinese campaign ! One 's heart bleeds . It is not without reason that the Chinese stand openly on the side of the Japanese , their ancient enemies . We have the greeter chances of victory . but the guarantee of these chances lies in the Baltic squadron alone , for we can not secure victory now by mere weight of numbers ( on land ! ) , and still less in the future . Do you really assume that the Japanese have only thirteen divisions in their army . besides reserves ? Are they really so na ? ve as not to have increased this force during the last few years ? Given equal numbers on either side , there Is on our part ? on the staff at any rate ? no hope of absolute and indisputable victory after the refusal of the Twenty-second Regiment to attack at Tuirencheng and after the terrible havoc wrought by the Japanese artillery at Wafang-kau . Russia considers herself a great nation . Every great nation , in the person of its representtives. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should feel respect for a worthy foe , should not conceal its own mistakes . and should not indulge in barefaced self-laudation.
