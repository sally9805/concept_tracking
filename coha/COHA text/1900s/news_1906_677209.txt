txt After an illness of six weeks , following an acute attack at the crisis of the troubles of the New York Life Insurance Company . John A. McCall , former President of that institulon , died here this afternoon at 5:35 o'clock . It is said officially that Mr. McCall died of cirrhosis of the liver , but the rapid development of his malady and his extreme mental depression during the early pare of his illness have made it a matter of current gossip here that his death was greatly hastened by , if It was not due to , the scandals which the insurance investigation revealed in his company . Mr. McCall 's death was Quiet and peaaafuL He flied as though he were dropping off into a deep sleep . He had been conscious since 1 o'clock this morning% and from that hour up to the time of his end his mind was apparently a Wart and he was motionless , except for a faint , flickering smile which came upon McCall 's lips when his wife bent over his almost lifeless body and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it coming , " he said to membere of his family who were crowded about his bedside early this morning .

" Mr. McCall said this just after midnight , About half an hour later he had a sinking spell , It proved to be his last , for , there was no rally as there had been atb ? er the many attacks which had oharett ? terized his illness in the past week . At 8 o'clock this morning there were algal of consciousness , but they faded away at once . At 5 P. M. his extremities be . gen to get cold . It was than fella la Van der Poel told Mr. McCall 's family : . " The end is at hand , Mr. McCall 's heart is weakening . There can be no ' hope now .

Kingsley , Mrs. Albert McClave , Mr. and Mrs. Ballard McCall , Mr. and Mrs. Leo McCall , Stanley McCall , , Clifford McCall , and Judge Edward C. McCall . Thirty-five minutes later Dr. Van der Poel pronounced Mr. McCall dead . John C. McCall then came down into the lobby of the ttLurel House from the McCall suite cf rooms and made the announcement . He spoke with emotion . It had been expected by Mr. McCall 's physicians , Dr. Van der Poel and Dr. Charles L. Lindley , that he would not last through the day . That Mr. McCall felt it himself was evidenced by the fact that he had sent for Father Matthew Taylor of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament In West Seventy-first Street , New York , where Mr. McCall attended ' religious services . aThe fact ali'o that yalwaa . James A.

A few momenta later Bishop left the house , but returned at 11 o'clock , in the hope that Mr. McCall might come out of his stupor . Dr. Van der Poet entered the room about the same time . There was no rally , however . Doctor Gives Up Hope . " We can not hold out any hope now , " said Dr. Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father will die before night . His death may occur at any moment now . " From 1 o clock until 4 in the afternoon Mr. McCall remained in a coma . It was at this time that Mrs. McCall , his wife , who had been constantly at his bedside during the night , leaned over and spoke to her husband . Several times she asked him to recognize her . At last his eyes half opened , and while his wife was bend , ing over his face Mr. McCall appeared to ! brighten . His face relaxed just a trifle ' and a faint suspicion of a smile sassed over his lips . That was his last act of recognition , for from that time until he died he remained lifeless as far as appearances went . When Mr. McCall lapsed after his smile to Mrs. McCall , and the physicians said there could be no further hope , David , who load been his personal attendant for many years , came to the bedside and recited the litany for the dying . There had been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , and it was at 's request that he performed the religious office . This service followed the last important one of Saturday night . After Mr. McCall had recovered from a sinking spell on that night he askek for Father Healy of the Church of St. Mary 's of the Lake . " I know it 's coming , " he said to his son . John C. McCall , " and feel that consolation in the Church will make me feel better in my last hours . " Father Healy gave the sick man the Holy Viaticum , consisting of the sacrai Merits of Penance arid the Holy Euchae rist . Mr. McCall had been anointed on Monday night , and . the service of Saturday night was the final important one to be performed . Coincident with the combined sacraments Mr. McCall conPessed and took communion . Directly after that he sent for Father Taylor of his parish in New York . All day Saturday , when Mr. McCall had several sinking spells , Father Taylor recited prayers for the dying , and continued them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink all day Saturday and during the night He rallied every time , but as he emerged from each successivel state of unconsciousness he grew weaker and weaker . Dr. Lindley remained at his bedside all night and supplied the sick man with oxygen and other forms of Stimulant . It was by this means that Mr. McCall was enabled to rally from time to time until stricken by the sinking spell at 1 o'clock . A Strong Rally on Thursday . Although Mr. McCall 's family generally expected that he would not recover from his illness , some of them expressed a slight hope on Thursday that he might recover . It wag on this day that Mr. McCall rallied perceptibly , and appeared to be in an unusually happy frame of mind and strong condition . The family was so much encouraged that thanksgiving services were held at the Church of St Mary 's of the Lake . All of Mr. Mc- I Call 's children , his brother . and three or four close personal friends attended the mass and prayed for his recovery . His rally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the McCall rooms at the Laurel House this evening he said : " Mr. McCall 's death was the most quiet and peaceful I have ever seen . He died like an innocent child dropping off to sleep . His end came without a ripple , and his death was serene . He died like a man who had made his peace with God , and I know it was with the conviction that he had done so that Mr. McCall passed away . There was no heavy breathing and no distortion . The breath escaped him like a shadow , and he left us like a passing spirit . " Dr. Van der Poel then said that the cause of Mr. McCall 's death was cirrhosis of the liver . He said he did not think ; much of the theory that Mr. McCall 's ill:less had been caused by worry over insurance affairs . John C. McCall later in the evening raid : " Since he was anointed last Monday night father had been at entire rest . He had been absolutely resigned to death and was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything - of which he was ashamed , and after Monday night he felt that he had been received in spirit and was competent to leave . And father was doubly pleased - to . get the opportunity to let the world know that he still held the utmost faith in and friendship for his old friend ' Judge ' - 1- TsmiltOn . He died ' Judge ' Hamilton 's friend . " That Mr. McCall 's troubles in the New : York Life Insurance Company were mainly responsible for his death is generally accepted by all his friends who have talked confidentially with members of the McCall family . In the latter part of December Mr. McCall was stricken in New : York with a congestive chill  --  about the , : time he was to refund the Hamilton payents . He wrote his resignation as president of the New York Life Company hwhile propped up in bed , and a few days , later Dr. %Tan der Poel advised him to ' come to Lakewood for a rest He never left the town .

McCALL 'S RISE TO POWER . It Began When He Was ig , and Ability Carried Him Far . It took John A. McCall twenty-two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Superintendent of Insurance to the Presidency of the New York Life Insurance Company . Six months after a general Investigation of insurance conditions conditions had been ordered as a result of the troubles in the Equitable Life , he had resigned from that position that he had then held for fourteen years , and within one year from the original publication of the story of the Equitable row , his death had become a matter of days . As a clerk in the office of the State Superintendent of Insurance he had a salary of about $1,000 a year . As President of the New York Life , during the latter part of his term , he had a salary of $100,000 a year , and had become owner of the finest country place on the Jersey coast , . To make restitution of $235,000 of the company 's money which Andrew Hamilton had spent in influencing legislation , he mortgaged his place for $150,000 and accepted a surrender value of about $100,000 on his $400,000 of life insurance in his own company . And soon afterward , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable for some $275,000 more of the money that flowed out of the New york Life 's treasury while Hamilton ran its bureau of taxation and legislation . It has been said that just as John McCall was a product of modern business conditions in his rise , so he was a victim of them in his downfall . The facts bear in an interesting manner on this statement , for the charges that resulted in his resignation from the Presidency of the New York Life , his sacrifice of his magnificent home , the eventual destructidn of whatever personal fortune he had accumulated , and the complete wreck of his health had to do , not with his personal honesty in the handling of the trust funds committed to his charge , but with his employment of them through the machinery he had invented for obtaining , the country over , the legislation he considered necessary to maintain a theory of life insurance he had helped to create . Born in 1849 . John A. McCall was born in Albany on March 2 , 1849 . He got his education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a clerk in the office of an Albany mercantile house . A year later he obtained his first life insurance position ? it was a clerkship in the Albany office of the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company , and it led after a couple of years to an appointment to a subordinate position in the State Insurance Department . There his rise was rapid . In 1872 he was put in charge of the statistical work of the department and before the year was out became an examiner . This continued for four more years , until , in 1876 , he was made a Deputy Superintendent . As Deputy Superintendent McCall 's ability in orgalnization and application of business ideas ' to life insurance management began to be recognized . The conduct of the department then , as in more recent years , was primarily in the hands of the assistants , and two Republican Superintendents of Insurance , John F. Smyth and Charles C. Fairman , were content to trust their Democratic subordinate to run things . So it was a very natural thing that Grover Cleveland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Deputy Superintendent to be the head of the department . He had . moreover , a record behind him . Having undertaken , back in the seventies , to put twoscore of dishonest fire insurance companies out of business , he had conducted a campaign that broke eighteen of them in this State and fifteen foreign companies before he became Superintendent . Nor did it stop there . for McCall took up a pursuit of insurance officers who perjured themselves in the course of his examinations , with the net result that two Presidents and one Vice President spent terms of two years apiece in Sing Sing . Superintendent for Two Years . McCall remained State Superintendent for two years only . The Equitable offered to make him its Controller , and when David B. Hill succeeded Mr. Cleveland as Governor the State Superintendent came into the- metropolitan life insurance world . From that time until THE NEW ' YORK TIMES exposed and put outh the De Beers management of the New York Life Insurance Company in 1891 and 1892 little was heard of him except as a capable official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a President for that institution and Mr. McCall appeared to fill the bill . He did not disappoint those who chose him , either as a business getter , an organizer , or a financier . He put new life into the discouraged forces of the company , got around him some able men and took hold of the finances with a hand that won him recognition in Wall Street . Since Mr. McCall was elected President fifteen years.ago , the New York Life has added a volume of outstanding insurance which amounts , in round figures , to $1. - 480,000,000 . The progress made under his administration is shown by this table : Dec. 31,1891 . Dec. 31,1905 . Assets $127,947,290 *435,820,359 Income 31,854.194 102,630,863 Dividends of year to policy holders 1,200,340 *5,000,000 Total payments of year to policy holders 12,671,491 40.262.039 Number of policies in force 182,803 ? 1,000,000 Insurance in force , premiums pail1 575,689,649 2,061,593,886 ? Estimated . A story frequently told of Mr. McCall 's early days in the Presidency of the company had to do with the Cleveland bond issue of 1896 . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $5.000,000 at 108 and $5,000,000 at 109 . On his way to Washington he decided that the bid of a syndicate that was being organized by J. P. Morgan &; Co. would be higher than either of his , and so he tore up the carefully prepared papers he carried and substituted a bid of 110.67 on the whole $10.000,000 the company wanted . He got the bonds , and various biographers of Mr. McCall have said that the profit was $500,000 . Of course the New York Life Trustees approved this deviation from instructions . It made money for the company . But the same freedom was what made it possible for Mr. McCall , practically upon his accession to the Presidency of the company , to establish relations with Andrew Hamilton . whom he had known in his Albany days , and led , in 1896 , to the establishment of the Department of Legislation and Taxation . The Legislative Bureau . The newspapers have not been lacking of information about the workings of that department , which looms up particularly large in any view of John A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best organized legislative bureau in the world . It extended over every State in the Union , except where the Mutual Life or the Equitable Life , in scattered instances , had local connections that enabled them to take care of legislative matters . It cost , in thirteen years , $1,347 , - 382 to the New York Life , exclusive of what the other companies paid in , and of this amount , according to the recent report of the Fowler Investigating Committee , $1,074,774 has never been satisfactorily accounted for , One may get McCall 's own words If he seeks an explanation . On Sept. 21 last McCall told the Armstrong Committee a little of what he had to tell later about the Hamilton accounts . This happened to be the 8235.000 that has been paid back , and the incident in question was a conversation that McCall had with Hamilton just before the latter sailed for Europe last June . " You 're perfectly good , Judge , " said McCall at the parting , when Hamilton said that he was in the company 's debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , according to prevailing theories , whatever money the President of a life insurance company thought it proper to have his legislative agent spend in what he considered the company 's interest was " all right . " Mr. McCall leaves , besides a widow , three sons . John C. , Sidney , and Clifford . All three , in addition to his nephews , Ballard McCall and Albert McClave. are in the service of the New York Life . TRIBUTE TO MR . McCALL . W. B. Hornblower Speaks of His Suc. cess in Building Up the N. Y. Life . William B. Hornblower , who is a Trustee of the New York Life , on learning of Mr. McCall 's death from a TISIES reporter last night , paid this tribute to his memory : " Mr. McCall was a man of most extraordinary ability , and one of the ablest men ever engaged in life insurance . His work as President of the New York Life Insurance Company , during the fourteen years in which he headed that organization , was most remarkable . His success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs generally were unequaled . " In spite of criticisms that have been made of his conduct in some particulars , and in spite of the action which the Trustees of the New York Life have felt called unon to take , it still remains true that he did a great work , and it is much to be regretted that in the later years of his Presidency things were done which have laid him open to censure . " He was personally a most genial , kindly . end attractive man , and everybody woo was brought in contact with him hscame warmly attached to him . I am F- re that all the officers and Trustees of the New York Life Insurance Cornpairs feel deep sorrow at his untimely death and deep sympathy for his family . "
