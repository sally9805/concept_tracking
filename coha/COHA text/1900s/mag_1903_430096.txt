0 NE day last summer , I dined with an old peasant woman , whose clean little cabin stands on the seashore in a wild glen among the Donegal mountains . She had invited me indoors to take shelter from a shower , and as her dinner was just ready , she of course would have me share it with her , for hospitality toward all comers , friend or stranger , is an unfailing virtue among these people . Potatoes boiled in their brown jackets , and a few small silvery fish called sheean , with a drink of sour milk waiting in a thickrimmed Delft bowl , formed her repast ; so she was faring better than usual , for fish and milk are not by any means always to be had . In that case , potatoes only are her menu , and when they run short , as unfortunately sometimes happens , their sorry substitute is meal . " Not oatmale , " my hostess regretfully explained , " but the chape yella male " ( Indian meal ) . " ' Deed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear-o , it does be terrible expinsive . " A taste for oatmeal seems to have been long established here , for a Spanish don , shipwrecked on this coast in the year of the invincible armada , reports of the inhabitants : " They do not eat oftener than once a clay , and this is at night , and what they usually eat is butter with oaten bread . They drink sour milk , for they have no other drink ; they do not drink water , although it is the best in the world . On feast days they eat some flesh half-cooked without bread or salt . " And Campion writes a little earlier : " Oatmeal and butter they cram together . They drink whey , milk and beef broth . Flesh they devour without bread . Corn , such as they have , they give to their horses . " He adds , however , " They swill in aquavitae by quarts and potties . " This was about the time when potatoes were first brought into Ireland , where they did not become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another century and a half passed before the devastation of the great famine in 1845 showed the danger of relying upon them to such an extent . Yet even nowadays they are practically the sole food of many Irish households . The farm laborers and small peasant farmers in the poorer districts subsist on them almost entirely , using a bit of salt meat or fish merely for a relish , as if it were some rare condi- ment . " Potatoes and point , " so called because a piece of bacon was hung up for everybody to rub his potato on , is an extreme instance of this . Materials so very simple give small scope for cookery ; and at the other end of the scale , in the big houses of the quality , it would be difficult to divine from any day 's bill of fare in which one of the three kingdoms we were sojourning . Therefore if we seek something distinctly national in cookery , we must look for it among the better-to-do peasants and farmers . Oatmeal stirabout is almost the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter think themselves lucky if they can afford to live on it altogether ; the former like to have it on their breakfast table , though they would feel strangely ill-used unless it were accompanied by a variety of other viands . It differs from English and Scotch porridge in being made of much coarser oatmeal , which is peculiar to Ireland , and which after sufficient stirring , in water , over the fire , swells into a stiffish paste , more " thick and slab " than an Englishman or a Scotchman would approve . Milk or butter is eaten with it , that is to say by people who are not limited to the best of all possible sauces ; sometimes both milk and butter . To sink , scooped out on the level surface of a hot plateful , a well wherein a lump of butter may melt , or to indent on it a system of canals through which streams of milk may flow , is a congenial pastime for a child with more imagination than appetite . Buttermilk and sour milk play an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homemade bread is kneaded for baking on the round iron griddle . Cakes of white flour and of whole meal are to be seen , as in other places ; but potato cakes belong more especially to Ireland . It behooves the cook to select for this purpose dry and floury potatoes , or the result will be a composition quite unsurpassable in sodden leatheriness . When they are judiciously chosen , boiled , mashed , blended with butter and milk , and baked to a delicate brown , the three-cornered cakes will be outwardly crisp and inwardly flaky . They are generally held in high esteem ; yet I have heard inappreciative persons liken them , at their best , to shreds of flannel . Oatmeal , too , is rolled out into the thin , flat sheet which is the only form in which its want of gluten allows it to be baked . In bygone clays , when the vast tide of emigration began to flow , and when emigrants were  | required to provide their own food for the voyage over strange seas , a bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their sod of turf and pot of shamrock . Many a forment for our favorite buttermilk . When sour and thick , it is hung in a cloth until the whey has dripped out , and the remaining curd is then beaten up with sugar and fresh fruit or jam . It is called lorn meal it held , to be eaten sorrowfully further and further from the ould country . More cheerful associations have barnbracks , whose name is derived from two Gaelic words , barn , a cake , and breac , speckled . Their speckling is as a rule caused by currants , but sometimes by caraway seeds , and on very festive occasions , raisins , candied fruits and spices are added , so that were it not for the absence of butter and eggs from the dough , they would be just plumcakes . The small , plain buns , colored a brilliant yellow with saffron , which are common in Ireland , do not appear to be so elsewhere . We may also claim the credit of having discovered the following treat " hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has an unmistakable flavor of its own . A dish of kailcannon also frequently appears as a vegetable at dinner ; it looks like green mashed potatoes , and its ingredients are , id fact , mashed potatoes , chopped cabbage and milk , with a seasoning of onions and herbs . Part of Sydney Smith 's celebrated recipe for a salad might well be applied to its composition , for the onions should be such atoms as he would have " lurk within the bowl , and half-suspected animate the whole " ; while the potatoes , if " passed through kitchen sieve , " according to his instructions , would give an " unwonted smoothness , " highly desirable , since  | lumpy kailcannon is a " failure from end to end . " As for Irish stew , or beggars ' dish , its more usual name here , it is a commonplace preparation of mutton and potatoes , for which we are in no way especially responsible . None of these dishes are , we see , by any means costly and elaborate . Ireland is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bestowed upon cookery by the people at large , and where monotonous and scanty meals are partaken of with much philosophy . It has , doubtless , bee n learned in part from necessity , which for many a long century has schooled the Irish peasant in the scie n c e ? the dreary science ? of doing without : but it is probably in part the outcome of his natural disposition to despise practical matters and creature comforts . Hence , too , results the fact that his womankind genera 1 1 v manifest a strong distaste for all work connected with the preparation of food . When they go into domestic service , they choose any situation rather than that of cook or kitchen maid when they are living at home they discharge these household duties in the most perfunctory manner . Families who are fairly well off not infrequently live , children , workers and all , upon a diet of baker 's bread and tea , for no better reason , apparently , than that it can be procured without much trouble . This bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-nourished , the laboring men are tempted to fortify themselves with false strength at the public house , which leads to the consumption of the aforementioned " aquavitae in quarts and potties " ; and to the excessive drinking of tea is attributed a share in the serious increase of mental disease throughout the country . One of the remedies proposed is the teaching of cookery to women and girls , and something has been done in this direction , but so far without any great success . Numerous difficulties attend the practical teaching of cookery in schools , and unless such teaching is practical , that is to say , is accompanied by actual experiments a n d demonstrations , it can be but little to the purpose . For instance , cookery is included under the head of domestic economy in the program of the intermediate examinations , which are passed by hundreds of Irish girls every year . But they merely learn the subject by heart in small handbooks , the contents of which they are wont to reproduce in curiously mangled forms . " Little cretins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with pea soup . " Another describes Pot-au-feu as " a delicious broth made of nothing but potato parings , " a fact which certainly should be known in every cabin . Herrings and herring bones , according to a third , must be boiled separately ; and she  | adds that the bones make excellent calfsfoot jelly . Then there are so many cases where the most practical instructor would in one sense be unpractical , because the pupil might point to a fireless hearth and an empty pot , and say Shakesperianly : " More matter with less art , " or in the words of a much quoted recipe : " First catch your hare . " On the whole , we may conclude that an improvement in the general circumstances of the Irish people must take place before they can be expected to profit much by lessons in cookery , which , however , under more favorable conditions , afford a valuable training in cleanliness , carefulness , and avoidance of happy-go-lucky methods . Nor should there be any scarcity of raw materials to discourage such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , minerals and the manufactures they promote being happily absent ; but her natural gifts should amply suffice to supply all her inhabitants with comforts , and even with luxuries . Her corn lands are well reputed , her pastures unrivaled ; fish swarm round her coasts ; shining salmon and freckled trout leap in her loughs and rivers ; poultry of every feather abound , and bees thrive industriously , finding the finest of flavors for their clear amber combs on the hillsides , apricot-colored with mingled furze and heather blossom . So that we are inclined to wonder , as Bishop Berkeley did , more than a hundred and fifty years ago , whether " there is any other people whose wants may be more easily supplied from home ; whether if there was a wall of brass a thousand cubits high round this kingdom , our natives might not nevertheless live cleanly and comfortably , till the land and reap the fruits of it . " And again : " Whether one may not suppose a nation of human creatures , clad in woolen stuffs , eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great plenty , drinking ale , mead and cider ? depending on no foreign imports , either for food . or raiment ; whether such people ought much to be pitied ; and whether Ireland be not as well qualified for such a state as any nation under heaven . " If those days do ever come to pass , so that the people of Ireland shall have not only butter with their potatoes , which Tom Moore 's wife thought the hight of luxury , but cream with their stirabout , and honey with their griddlecakes , and salmon steaks with their kailcannon , Irish cookery will , no doubt , develop new and interesting features for some future historian to chronicle . But we can not enter upon prophecy and conjecture in this little sketch , which deals with things as they are .  |
