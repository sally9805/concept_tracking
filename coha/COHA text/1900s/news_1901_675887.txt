txt Huge red cards , announcing a children 's performance to take place yesterday afternoon in Colonial Hall , One Hundred and First Street and Columbus Avenue , in aid of a children 's home , were distributed in the neighborhood of West One Hundredth Street last week . Part of the price of admission was a potato , and 1,200 children , each with a potato , went there yesterday . They fired the potatoes at the management , called the show a " fake , " and broke windows and chandeliers till the police routed them and arrested the organizer of the entertainment , Oscar B. Steele , fortythree years old , of Boston , a theatrical agent , giving his New York address as 119 East Sixteenth Street . He was charged with giving a performance without a theatrical license and obtaining money under false pretenses . The big red cards were eagerly read by hundreds of school children , who found the prices of admission advertised as follows : " Scholars ' admission , 7 cents and a potato ; parents ' admission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the potatoes were to go to the " Children 's Home . " Steele could not tell satisfactorily just what that place was . The red card also advertised a " Punch and Judy Show , " a " Cinderella , twelve inches high and thirty years of age who sings and dances , " and Brownies . The art of drawing letters was to be taught free , and , best of all , the children thought , souvenirs were to be given away to every child present The presents were to be rings , roller skates , dolls , dolls ' clothing , &cThe; ball holds about 400 persons , and is on the fourth floor , and Steele expected about that many present He was appalled at 4 o'clock , the time set for the performance , to see 1,200 children , boys and girls , swarm up to the hall , yelling and laughing , some with their parents and every one with a potato in his or her hand . The potatoes caused much rivalry and many conseaueift squabbles among the youngsters . " Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . One boy showed one of huge proportions , and in a twinkling it was stolen from him , and he sat down in the gutter and began to cry . John Thulman , the German proprietor of the hall , wiped his brow again and again as he saw the mob of youngsters , all eager to get in . The colored elevator runner was fairly weakened in pulling the car filled with children up and down the shaft . Max Oppenheim of 15 West Ninety-eighth Street , with four children , for whom he paid 28 cents , and 13 cents for himself , finding Manager Steele in a terrible plight , offered to help him take money and did so . When the children got into the hall  --  nearly all jammed in in some way , three-quarters of them standing  --  they began to clamor for the presents . They had been told to keep their potatoes until they could drop them into a barrel for the Children 's Home . Then came the first trouble . The " presents " were given out ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin as a copper wire . No dolls , or skates , or anything but thin rings . " Wot a skin , " cried several . " I want a dolly ; I do n't want a ring , " cried half a hundred girls . Shrill voices demanded dolls and skates till the room rang with cries of derision and calls for better presents . To quiet the youngsters the manager rang up the curtain . There were three performers , Steele , his wife , and a hired assistant Steele made three huge dice disappear . " Is that all you can do ? " shouted a boy , and howls of *derision maddened the manager again , and he changed the vanishing dice to a " Punch and Judy Show . " The children were no better pleased . " This show 's no good ! " " Skin ! " " Oh , it 's a cheat ! " chorused both girls and boys . A potato sailed through the air and hit hump-backed Mr. Punch in the face , knocking him over . " Hooray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the room . The Punch and Judy stand , the stage , and curtain were pounded with them . A window was broken , and then another and then another . Each crash seemed to delight the girls and boys , who would shriek with laughter and applause . One daring boy said he : could give a better show than the one advertised himself , and he climbed on an electric light chandelier and began to swing on it . The children shouted in glee . Suddenly there was a scream . The boy had fallen with the chandelier . which broke with his weight , and the manager almost cried as he saw the mob of children renew the shower of potatoes . Steele begged for order . A shower of hisses greeted him and a boy threw a potato which hit him in the eve , and amid shrieks of laughter he disappeared . " I 'd pay 15 cents and a bushel of potatoes for such fun , " yelled one boy as he threw a potato through a window and yelled again as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police . Capt . Schmittberger and four detectives arrived . They were astounded . What to do with 1,200 rioting children on the fourth floor of a building puzzled them . The children had taken up the cry . " We want our money back ! " and some of the larger boys and some parents mane such a clamor that the wife of the manager began to give them back their 7 and 13 cents . They let the potato go . Capt . Schmittberger questioned Steele , found he had no license to give a performance , and that he could not answer questions about the " Children 's Home " satisfactorily . and he arrested him . This Made the children wild with delight They howled again and again and cheered Capt . Schmittberger . The officer then sent for the reserves of the station . and twelve men came around . They formed the children in line after a hard time , and sent them in Indian file down stairs to the street . Some still clutched potatoes .

Potatoes were thrown every now and then , and many hit not only Steele , but the policemen . Steele said he has been in business ten years as a theatrical agent , and did not know he needed a license . He said he gave a performance last week in Harlem , and was to give another to-morrow . Oppenhelm , who had been struck by some potatoes from the children who thought him in league with Steele , was the complainant against the manager . The children waited around the station house until they got tired and went home . Meantime Mrs. Steele picked up pennies by the thousand . wrapped them in two cloths , and went away .
