txt A number of people , perhaps twenty-five in all , were gathered in front of the tall Queen Building , at Cedar and William Streets , last night about 7 o'clock . watening the motor wagon of the Hall 's Safe Company with its electric hoisting apparatus taking a three-ton safe from the eighth to the fifteenth story of the building . Two men , Frank Drumm and Paul Weisenberger , were sitting on the top of the safe , and by means of their legs and arms were trying to keep the heavy safe from striking the building . One of them pushed too hard , for the safe , swinging back and half turning , caught in the coping at the tenth floor . The sudden strain on the ropes tore open the sheaves of the big block which was made fast at the seventeenth floor , and the safe with the two men fell to the pavement . There was a great crash , a cloud of dust , and a shower of bricks , mortar , rope , and tackle . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his face crushed in . Drumm , who still breathed , was not mutilated with the exception of the back of his head . The two men were carried to the sidewlak in front of the building at 70 ' William Street . An ambulance from the Hudson Street Hospital was hurriedly summoned , but Drumm was dead before aid could reach him , and both bodies were taken to the Old Slip Station . Before the accident occurred , the crowd , at first numbering not more than a dozen persons , was increased by each passerby , for the sight Was in many ways an unusual one , because the electric hoisting apparatus Is said to be the only one of its kind in the country , and as the Queen Building is seventeen stories tall  --  twice as tall as any near-by building on that side of William Street  --  the spectacle of two men seated on a huge safe , which seemed to hang by threads , more than half way up the spectrelike ? structure . was striking enough to attract even the least curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building , so most of the crowd gathered on the sidewalk opposite . A good many , however , disregarded the red signs , and only a few seconds before the safe fell an old woman , carrying a bag of paper , passed directly beneath . The safe was brought out through the window of the eight floor , from the office of Louis Sonnenberg , a lawyer , who is moving up to the fifteenth floor , and v-ho expected to have the safe in position when he reached the office this morning . After the safe was made fast to the tackle everything worked well . Three men were . on the truck , and Leonard Fisher was in charge of the hoisting apparatus . The heavy object moved upward so easily and . rapidly that the fact was commented on by the curious crowd below . Sergt. Joseph Saul of the First Precinct , who was standing on the opposite corner , apparently had a premonition that something was going to happen , for he said to a man who had crossed over from the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance then , friend ; I saw one of those things fall three stories one time , and the woman who hapened to be under it did n't live very long after . " Hardly were the words uttered when the watchers noticed that the easy upward progress of the safe had stopped . Suddenly there was a faint cry from above , and then all were horrified to see the ropes slacken and the immense safe fall . The spectators saw for a moment the safe nearing the ground , and not far above it the two men , with upright bodies and arms held high over their heads . The safe in its downward course broke off a large piece of granite from the coping that surrounds the third story , and bent V-shaped the top bar of the heavy iron railing that guards the entrance to the basement . The safe with its brick and mortar partitions was smashed to atoms , while the pavement , strange to say , was only slightly Injured . One of the men who was working on the motor truck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled down his cheeks as he tried to get his brother to sptak to him . They lived with their widowed mother at 7 Spring Street . Weisenberger lived in a boarding house at 169 First Avenue. , Both were unmarried .  - -  Sergi . Saul placed Truck Foreman Leonard Fisher , who lives at 213 Avenue A. under arrest , and he was locked up in the Old Slip Police Station on a charge of homicide . The work of hoisting the safe was being done by the Eagle Trucking Company , who do all the hoisting work for the Hall 's Safe Company . John J. Rainier , who is President of both companies , arrived on the scene shortly before 9 o'clock , after having given orders to the Stephen Merritt Burial Company to look after the bodies of his men . He asked one of his men to notify Drumm 's mother . He started out to do so himself , he said , but found he had n't the heart to do it . About the same time Mr. Sonnenberg came down and was talking to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 100 such safes , " said the latter , ' if I could have my two men here , They were two of the best men I had . " After the accident Sergt. Saul , fearing that other stones in the building might have been loosened , called out the reserves . and ordered them to keep persons away from the front of the building . The Queen Building . which is said to be owned by the Mutual Life , will be examined this morning .
