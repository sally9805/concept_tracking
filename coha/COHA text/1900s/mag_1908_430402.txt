 | The almost universal nineteenth century thought of Eastern peoples was that they are heathen , pagans , idolaters , immoral , brutal , superstitious , licentious , and that the term " semi-civilized " was really too good for them . This traditional style of thinking still persists . An editor of a large Christian paper recently returned from Japan and tried to be just in his report by saying several good things about the Japanese , but was conscientiously compelled to acid , " They are still a pagan nation . " A member of the English nobility and a clergyman , a few months ago , after seeing Japan and Korea , wrote to that world journal , The London . Times , " I am not for a moment blaming the Japanese soldiery , but they have only the ideals of a heathen race . " Not only does the religious bias make some Christians cruelly unjust to a great moral-loving people , but such censors unwittingly give aid and comfort to the sensational press in America which despises the peoples of the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflame the minds of the people here against " the yellows . " One need only to ask , " Is a nation pagan after it has adopted and adapted the very best fruits of modern civilization ? civil and religious liberty , universal education , equality before the law , and representative government ? Can an army of over half a million carry on a campaign in a foreign land on a higher moral level than was ever attained by other armies , and still have only the ideals of a heathen race ' ? " The time for revising our nineteenth century ideas of the East has come . The real facts are beginning to loom up before us . And new and glad voices are bearing witness to the wonderful moral and spiritual life in the nations of the East . Bishop Roots , of the Episcopal Church , is one of these witnesses . In an address given in Boston he recently said : " It is difficult to take in the moral greatness of the people of China ! They are the only people who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vice in their classics , who have never publicly sanctioned immorality . Their ideals have been scholarship , peace with the world , and righteousness ; and it may be their mission to impress these upon the world . " I can not frame a sentence just like that for Japan , but I can truly shape one that shall have fully as high a moral ring to it and shall begin with the same words : It is difficult to take in the moral greatness of the people of Japan . They are the only people who have an Imperial Line unbroken from prehistoric ages , so revered and loved that against it the people have never risen in revolt . What moral power is embodied in that historic fact ! In the face of the barbarous beheadings of kings and queens in the West , and of the horrible assassination only the other day of the King and Crown Prince of Portugal , how exceptionally moral appears this Imperial Line , for which during millenniums supreme reverence and devotion have been so strong that it has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral hero whose death is so close to that of Christ that you can not read it without putting the two together . When Sakura Sogoro was crucified , his noble wife refused to be divorced , preferring crucifixion with her husband and death with her children rather than life divorced from him . And his parting words to his people as he hung on the cross were : " Had I five hundred lives . I 'd gladly give them all for you ! " The history of Japan is rich in this spirit of self-sacrifice for others , and this is one of the elements that make Japan a nation of moral greatness . Again , they are the only people , I think it safe to say , whose passion for righteousness has exceeded her greed for  | gold , and whose love of honor was greater than her fear of death . Here is a nation whose virtues were so embodied in life that when the Red Cross Society and its humane work were presented to them , it just fitted into the nation 's moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded Russians , and to treat their 72,000 prisoners with a degree of kindness and consideration that no Christian nation under similar circumstances has yet equaled . After the battle of Mukden I saw whole trainloads of prisoners coming down to Dalney . Every time our trains met I saw Japanese officers and soldiers give , not as conquerors but as comrades , their cigarettes and hard tack to the , Russians until their private stores were exhausted . Read " Human Bullets ! " That tells of a wounded officer who beckoned for aid for help to a Red Cross man on his enemy 's side . Immediately he received the needed help , had his wounds bound up and a canteen of water left by his side . After which he drew his revolver and deliberately shot his deliverer ( lead . The officer who did that dastardly deed was not of the yellow race ; he was a white man , a subject of a Christian nation . I was in the Japanese army for six weeks , privileged by letters from the Premier , Count Katsura , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixt regulations of war time , and f have no hesitation in saving that so far as I saw and heard thru careful inquiry , there never was an armv so absolutely free from camp women , so free from drunkenness , so free from looting , so free from boasting over a conquered foe , and so kind to prisoners of war as were the half million soldiers of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan . It may not be out of place to say here that those victories on land and sea were really won " by the virtues of the Emperor . " " What nonsense to ascribe those victories to the Emperor who never was on a battle field and presumably has no military knowledge ! " some Americans have exclaimed . Yet those reports of victories sent by generals and admirals , ascribing their successes to " the virtues of His Majesty " were absolutely correct . But for the traditional.virtues of that Imperial Line there could be no such devotion and loyalty as held together the generals of that huge army and the admirals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal hatreds or love of women even once imperiled the success of the strategy . Every dying soldier , too , bore the same witness to the virtues of the Emperor if strength sufficed to utter the words : " Heika , Banfai ! " Long live the Emperor ! It was not the flattery of underlings but a true expression of faith in the virtues of the Imperial Line which have made possible the history of Old and New Japan . But right here objectors may say " You are making them out altogether too good . Are they not commercially untrustworthv and about as dishonest as they can be ? Are they not notoriously licentious , so that their immorality is well known the world over ? Are not their soldiers in Korea barbarous in their treatment of horeans ? And , anyway . have not the Japanese a spring , treacherous nature , so that the more foreigners know them the less they like them ? " Commercial immorality ; sexual immorality ; savage brutality ; unsocial , spying natures ; these are the four charges freely made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who do not know the facts , and sometimes by those who do not wish to know the truth . 1 freely admit that there is sonic measure of truth in every one of these charges . " fake commercial and industrial dishonesty . Yet before examining theirs , let me ask whether investigations into some of our great life insurance companies ; the constant discoveries of graft in our city governments ; the illegal rebates that have helped make sonic swollen fortunes ; the sweating system of making cheap clothes at the expense of precious life and yet more precious purity of life -- are these and other great outstanding financial immoralities in our own Republic so insignificant that we can afford to throw stones from our own glass houses ? Now in this irresponsible assertion of Japan 's commercial dishonesty , it has gone all thru the nations of the West until even a well-informed and well-disposed people believe it to be true that the Japanese are so dishonest among themselves that they have to have Chinese compradores in their banks to keep watch of the bank accounts ! Cultured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep coining home with this ludicrous slander , and back it up by saying : " I saw it myself . Chinamen in the banks took my checks and handed me the cash ! " Well , that seems conclusive , for you can not think that scores of business men and bright women could all be mistaken on so simple a matter . " The Chinaman was there and gave me the money , " they say . And , indeed , that is perfectly true , but it has no more to do , with Japanese untrustworthiness than the presence of Chinese laundrvmen in our cities means the untrustworthiness of the merchants in the same cities . These returned globe trotters who are so cock-sure that Japanese banks employ Chinese accountants probably never saw the inside of a Japanese bank . They had their letters of credit cashed in the great Hongkong and Shanghai Bank , a British bank , whose branches are in Yokohama , Lobe , Nagasaki , and all the main ports of the East . l f these travelers had gone to the Yokohama Specie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tokyo , the largest of which has a capital of $15,000,000 ( gold ) , or to any of the 2,200 native banks , they could n't have found with the best of microscopes a shadow of a Chinese . They did not know that some of the ablest financiers in the world are Japanese . Probably not one of these persons ever so much as heard that Count Matsukata , a dozen years ago , swung the finances of his Empire from a silver on to a gold basis , without deranging any industries , and with the applause of all men who have the difficult problems of the world 's finances always before them . One might as well say that because Chi-. nese coolies were employed in the rear of the Japanese army in Manchuria . therefore the Japanese could n't trust each other to handle their commissariat and had to have Chinese to do it for them ! Now I freely acknowledge that many of the merchants in Japan will bite any foreigner if they get a chance . Too many Japanese merchants actually have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do their own statesmen and moralists and upright merchants . They are doing everything they can to correct this national defect by persistent earnest IF THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN 85 ethical teaching in all their schools , especially in the higher commercial schools . And I believe it will come out all right , just as I believe that our shameful graft , and the evils of our trusts , will come out all right . Just as there is here a strong moral life that will conquer our financial immoralities , so do I believe in the strength of the moral qualities of Japan to correct her mercantile defects and put her on a level with the best commercial morality of the world . Not long ago 1 spent three hours with Prof. K. Nakamura , of the Imperial University in Tokyo . lie said : " One of the reasons why Japan at first hated and resisted any treaty of commerce was the fear that mercantile relations with the West would foster the spirit of gain , and would thus harm the finer moral sentiments of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in japan that a great world commerce . on lines of competition , as in the West , would bring untold peril to the high moral sensibilities of the Samurai spirit . No , I do not withdraw or modify the statement it is difficult to take in the moral greatness of the Japanese , whose passion for righteousness exceeds her greed for gold . " Well , can you keep that up when it conies to sexual morality ? " I am asked . 1 dislike very much to speak about this subject . It is one of the great world problems that never lets up iii any land . If we did n't have 50,000 abandoned women in New York ; if every city in our Christian republic did not have its Tenderloin districts ; if our divorce rate were not rising with such frightful rapidity ( while Japan is probably the only nation on earth whose proportion of divorces to marriages is diminishing ) that now we have " more divorces in this country in one year than all the other Christian lands combined " ( Pres. G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where gather the choicest of our youths were not infected with this alarming problem ; if latest scientific reports on the so-called " black plague that infects nearly sixty per centum of youths " did not threaten the moral existence of our homes ; then we might venture to talk . All I have to say on this sad question is : The people of the East prize among  | their highest and noblest virtues those that conserve the family lines . Everybody knows that when men and women become morally rotten , such societies gradually are irreparably ruined , and families die out in crime and impotence until their nations cease from off the earth , or are swallowed up in outside conquests . Applying this great moral law that runs through all society East and West , we see at once that when family lines exist for centuries and even lenniums , it must be because they are supported by real moral life . The same is true of nations . So that when we sec these oldest of the nations of the earth , with their histories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women as well as men ? and when we find them so morally vigorous that they are capable of adapting the best fruits of Christian civilization within one generation , then I submit that talk about their licentiousness and concubinage and yoshi waras can not have any deep meaning of the Japanese . Next , take their brutality as manifested by soldiers in Korea . Sad stories of this have been published far and wide , and I fancy much of it is true . But I remember it is less than a decade since one of our generals in the Philippines ordered the slaughter of men , women and children , and the brutal water cure was not untried on the natives by some of cur officers . The fact is , whenever a superior nation becomes the victor over an inferior one , no history of such conquests and occupations as yet has had a white page . No one deplores the irregularities and injustices consequent on the temporary military occupation of Korea more than does Japan 's greatest statesman , Prince Ito , the Resident General of Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit in our republic , and a moral life that will push our work in the Philippines to a successful issue , so I believe that Korea , which by her weakness and ignorance has been a standing peril to the peace of the East , will under Prince Ito 's just guidance , and under the splendid work of our American missionaries , become a vastly better and happier land than it ever has been or ever would have become under the old regime . Just as I believe in the moral greatness of our own republic , in the ultimate solution of our problems of expansion , so I believe that the moral power of Japan , increased by the wider interpretations of moral terms , will justly solve the problems of expansion in Korea , Formosa and Manchuria . The last of the four charges is that the Japanese are a spying and treacherous people . I hasten to suggest that this charge is never made by any one who can converse in their language and read their literature . The greatest barrier that exists between the millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language , and the Japanese language is confessedly the most difficult on earth to master . " Nothing is worse than a barrier against the communication of thought . " said the unfortunate Premier . Ii-Kamon , who was assassinated for daring to sign the treaty with Commodore Perry . It is perfectly safe to say that were the North separated from the South in our republic by the same linguistic ignorance that separates our people from Japan , the misunderstandings and bitter slanders that would ensue would be incalculable . It is natural to be suspicious where one can not understand , where the barrier against communication of thought can not be crossed . It is because of this difficult barrier that 99 out of every 100 of the foreigners who have come in contact with the Japanese have such a large margin for suspicion and such an easy digestion for misrepresentations and such an unsuspecting willingness to pass on current slanders as truth . The Japanese are vastly superior to us in their unwavering purpose to break down this wretched barrier to intercourse . They have splendidly overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , educational , religious , social , and family structures . Their scholars read in the originals our histories , and are familiar with the great men and women who have left imperishable names in Western literature , laws and science . And there is no language they study so much and prize so highly as the English , which  | now his become the world language . There is not a higher government school in Japan where English is not ceaselessly taught , with the possible exception in very few schools where German or French is the specialty . But how is it with us of the West ? We never learn the Japanese language unless we have to . I know of none of our hundreds of universities and colleges where students take courses in the Japanese language . Even our great government , that has been of invaluable aid to Japan for over half a century , never has had more than one or two American interpreters in diplomatic service . until recently they have sent out six students to learn the language and be ready to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington who can read the Japanese language , but I very much doubt it . Is it not therefore natural that Westerners who ca n't think or speak in Japanese should take easy refuge in all sorts of suspicions , especially when not even our ablest newspapers have on their staffs a single one who can read the Japanese language ? Is there not danger that our highest officials may be misled by some angry war correspondent , or by some disappointed military attache , or by the newly formed body of secret agents of the government , or by hateful European diplomats who long to break the real friendship that for more than half a century has bound us together ? If all these men , whose business it is to know facts exactly as they are , were able to use the Japanese language freely , does any one imagine that the jingo journals of America could have had such a prosperous crusade of over a year against Japan ? Or that a member of Congress could go around the country , ignorantly or maliciously slandering great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he is a member and the disgust of the people who condescend to listen to him ? I believe that thirty-three years of life in Japan enables the to say without fear of contradiction by any one who knows their language that the moral greatness of Japan makes it impossible that she should do an act of international treachery , such as attacking the Philippines or Hawaii . They are a people as sacredly bound to the principles of international law as we are . Their alliance with Great Britain , instead of being , as some maliciously assert , a peril to America , is one of the surest bonds of abiding peace . It may be worth while to quote from a very high authority on this subject : " That treaty has not abridged in any way the right of Great Britain or Japan to go to war of its own choosing ; but in that case the other party is under no obligation whatever to conic to the assistance of its ally . . In order to involve the other party to the alliance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war should have arisen from unprovoked attack or aggressive action on the part of some ether power . If the territorial rights of Japan or Great Britain in Eastern Asia or India , or the general peace in those regions , or the " open door " in China is threatened by an aggressive and hostile action of a third power , then only are Japan and England to fight shoulder to shoulder in defense of the just rights of one or the other of the two parties or of both . " This means that if Japan should make any aggressive action against America , the alliance does not bind England at all . It seems to me that those who accuse Japan of possible treachery are themselves treacherous to the ideals of our republic on fair play and to our AngloSaxon standards of honor . They seem to me to be ignorant of the people they slander , ignorant of the methods of diplomacy , and of international law . It is not more difficult to take in the moral greatness of the Japanese than it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the face of the charge that the Japanese are " a race morally reprehensible , " I have no hesitation in saving again : It is difficult to take in the moral greatness of the Japanese , whose Imperial Line has never been broken : whose family life persists thru centuries ; whose heroes , men and women , show a spirit of sacrifice that is the very key to the highest moral life : and whose virtues are so virile that they can appropriate within the narrow limits of one generation all the great liberties of our modern civilization , and all the humanity that is embodied in the world-wide Red Cross Society . In these ( lays of ceaseless insinuations of the likelihood of war with Japan sooner or later , it is not out of place to say that Japan regards our traditional friendship of very great value , and she  | has an unique feeling of gratitude to us . But it is equally true to say we owe Japan quite as much as she owes us , and in the solution of the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the West ? Japan can be of more use to us than all the rest of the world . It would be a calamity for us to lose the true and sincere friendship of Japan .
