Mr. Brooke adverts to that theory , of which Lowell was so fond , that Browning had Jewish elements if not in his blood , yet in his intellect , spirit , and character , and concludes that he was " a complex creature , " whereas Tennyson was not complex . He notes that Browning 's love of color was far more intense than that of Tennyson , and that sometimes , as Ruskin says , " it is not color , it is conflagration " ; but it is at any rate an essential part of Browning . Browning , he thinks , comprehended women far better . Tennyson could deal with a few simple well-known types , of both good and bad women ; but Browning , in describing women , " touched great variety and great individuality " ; " each of his women is distinct from the rest . " " He neither lowered her , nor idealized her beyond natural humanity , . . . and he has wrought this out , not by elaborate statement of it in a theory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conscious patronage of womanhood , but by unconscious representation of it in the multitude whom he invented " ( pp. 346 , 348 ) . It is to be noticed , however , - that Mr. Brooke 's criticisms on Browning 's women are among those passages over which the reader of this book will be most tempted to doubt his author 's judgment . In dealing with the strong picture of the wanton Ottima in " Rippe , Passes " ( p. 331 ) , or the poor sinful child Mildred in ' The Blot in the ' Scutcheon ' ( p. 338 ) , we venture to think that Browning knew what he was drawing far more profoundly than his critic . Again , we should dissent from the opinion that Balaustionwas , among women , " the finest creature Browning drew " ( p. 389 ) . Mr. Brooke paints admirably the steady lessening of the imagination and steady increase of the intellectual element in Browning ( p. 415 ) , and thinks that it had begun even while he was at work on ' The Ring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power of a few of these later occasional poems , as " Hervd Riel " and " Pheidippides , " while he justly finds some of them " needlessly ugly , " as " Halbert and Hob " ( p. 433 ) . In the gi eater part of - " Parleyings with Certain People " " imagination such as belongs to a poet has deserted Browning " ( p. 435 ) . Mr , Brooke truly says , in summing up his poet 's total service : " He kept , in the midst of a fretful , slothful , wailing world , where prophets like Carlyle and Ruskin were as impatient and bewildered , as lamenting and despondent as the decadents they despised , the temper of his Herakles in ' Balaustion . ' He left us that temper as his last legacy , and he could not have left us a better thing " ( p. 440 ) . As a rule , it may be said that , if we recognize Mr. Brooke 's own distinction between the imaginative and intellectual in Browning , his critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the imaginative , and least of all in the domain of emotion . Thus , his analysis of the powerful poem " Caliban " is so profound as to leave nothing to be desired , but in dealing with the much discussed " Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came , " Mr. Brooke is quite shy and self-distrustful , and almost inclined to think that his poet merely put odds and ends together aimlessly , which certainly was not Browning 's way ( p 276 ) . Mr. Brooke quotes " Meeting at Night ? Parting at Morning " rather as if they were pleasant little verses in the corner of a village newspaper , instead of being , as they are , strains so concentrated and so perfect as to be likely to live as long and prove as inexhaustible as Sappho 's Ode . We should be doing injustice to Mr. Brooke 's rich and thoughtful style if we did not quote his closing words : " As if the Muse of Poetry wished to adorn the image of his death , he passed away amid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world endeared to him by love Italy was his second country .

" Illustrations of the Boohc of Job . In twenty-.one plates invented and engraved by William Blake , Author of Designs to " Blair 's Grave , " " Young 's Night Thoughts , " etc . London ? Published by the Author , 3 Fountain Court , Strand , and Mr. J Linnell , 6 Cirencester Place , Fitzroy Square . March , 1826 . One thousand copies issued in facsimile by J M Dent &; Co , London , and G. P. Putnam 's Sons , New York , 1902 1 The latest important work of William Blake was that entitled as above Linnell was not a publisher in the usual sense of the word , but rather an artist , a hard-working and sucessful painter , who had employed Blake , or encouraged him in this and in other artistic enterprises Linnell was guided thereto , as it would appear , partly by pure desire to aid a struggling brother artist , partly by that worthy ambition to cause artistic work to be produced which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental energy , he showed throughout his long life . What he thought of Blake 's work it is not easy to ascertain ; but his actions were such as would do credit to a richer and to a more influential man than Linnell ever was , and he was able to leave to succeeding generations a series of works by the more imaginative man , by the exceptional artist , Blake , works having a stronger hold than Linnell 's own on the graver attention of posterity . For in reality there has never been an artist , whose works are known to us , so entirely alone in art , so absolutely apart from any school or the influence of any tradition . To call him a religious painter-engraver is to lead the student astray , because there is no close observance in his work of any Christian traditions , whether artistic or liturgical , and only a general , laic , Protestant Bible-reader 's view of Old Testament records . To call him an artist of strong and pure imagination is to exaggerate the importance of his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was excited in his mind by half-gained knowledge and half-understood dreams . To call him an artist of sentiment , of that universal human feeling which is found in the fine art of words even more freely than in the arts of color and form , is to ignore much the greater part of his mental life , namely , its mystical side ; whereas , to call him a mystic is to ignore the fact that his rejection of realism proceeded from impatient indifference to what most artists think essential to their art , rather than from a deliberate attempt to reveal or discuss mysteries . Every student of his life is entitled to his bwn and a separate and distinct view of the combination , in Blake 's mental condition , of a kind of insanity with imaginative power and with the tendency to fanciful excess It might be held with , perhaps , equal plausibility that , if he drew the figure very badly , it was because he could not see it rightly , had never learned its true character , and was , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , that his spirit was full of visions which crowded one another so closely that there was no time or.mental grasp sufficient to see each one clearly , and that he was far too sincere and too direct in his moral aim to spend time In rectifying his drawing or solidifying his composition . The experience of art-students is usually that they care most for Blake when they are young , and as yet not greatly practised in their art ; and yet this is not the universal experience It would be hard to escape the impression , when some one is found very enthusiastic over the ' Book of Job ' or other plates of Blake 's , that as yet the greatness and the splendor of the artistic world= have not quite revealed themselves to the enthusiast . In literature there is hardly the like of what William Blake was in art ; and yet it may be said that there are certain mystics , certain illuminati , whose poems or unrhymed rhapsodies give more pleasure to the beginner in literature than to the veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if one is well versed in intelligent , learned , sane , and yet powerful art , he will care less for the dreams and visions which fill these twenty-one plates . The monstrous caricature of an elephant which is used ( plate 15 ) to stand for Behemoth will repel rather than attract , while the final plate , showing how the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than the beginning , will pass as but half-understood sentimentalism . On the other hand , no one can refuse his tribute of admiration to the design in plate 3 , in which the columns and walls are falling upon the sons and the daughters of Job , while Satan presides over the destruction , balanced , as it were , upon a falling stone whose support his spiritual essence is seen not to require And so it is with the treatment of that same Satan , occurring again and again in the plates , he is asexual , and is partly invested with scales , as if in some suggestion of a lower nature than that of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once the good and evil of extreme intensity . Concentration of horror or of peaceful tranquillity deliberately intended excludes other considerations Realism , of course , is entirely remote from the conception of such designs , and yet the separate instances are treated in a realistic way ; it is only their combination and their concentration into a scene that is the very reverse of real , which is purely fantastic Thus , the runner who approaches Job and his wife with the cry , " And I only am escaped alone to tell thee , " is shown in headlong race , and , however ill-drawn the limbs , and however ill-expressed the attitude and the action of running ( the foot resting fiat upon the ground even in the action of running ) , it is still reality which controls that figure On the other hand , the presentation of Job and his wife as already overwhelmed with grief , eyes raised to heaven , and hands clasped in  --  attitudes of despair , while still the one runner has only just reached them and the other is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as completely so as if it were expressly announced as a metaphorical rendering of the idea of loss and of grief . It appears , then , that the very doubts which invest this subject and the hesitation which every art student must have as to the true place in art of the Book of Job , ' are a sufficient reason for its reproduction The original work is of very considerable scarcity , and of great cost . The reproduction issued by the London and the New York house and sold here at a reasonable price will be found to give nearly all the artistic value of the original plates , losing more in the brilliancy and beauty of the prints than in other ways , and therefore revealing all of Blake that there is in the designs except his merit and charm as an original engraver on metal ? New France and New England By John Fiske Boston : Houghton , Mifflin &; Co 1102 It is difficult to review a posthumous book by John Fiske without saying at least one word about the author . The memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shrewd humor , and of his true simplicity , is as yet too strong to be put by In most cases the reviewer must keep his attention fixed upon the work rather than upon its writer ; but where the thought of the writer 's eminence is enforced by the recentness of his death , the ordinary rule can hardly be observed in all its strictness . There is a further reason why a reviewer of this volume should be tempted to stray from his duty of immediate and particular criticism In a publisher 's preface , it is stated " that ' New France and New England ' completes the story of the settlement and development of the colonies up to the point where Mr. Fiske 's ' American Revolution ' has already taken up the narrative . It therefore gives a final unity to the sequence of remarkable volumes which he has devoted to American history . " Here , then , one is tempted to speak of the series as a whole and of Mr. Fiske 's historical methods , but such subjects , though attractive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an experienced and accomplished lecturer , as thousands of peo ple in different parts of the country have reason to remember His ' New France and New England ' consists of ten chapters , which might be styled ten separate essays were it not for the fact that most of them are couched in lecture form and were delivered before the Lowell Institute . Personality is ; on the whole , more likely to emerge during a lecture than during . an essay , and almost every page is redolent of Mr Fiske himself His complete freedom from pretence is visible in all his writings , but nowhere more eloquently than here He talked copiously from the fulness of knowledge , but with no affectation of learning , and his style of writing was equally spontaneous His genuine interest in the subject of his research is reflected in the animation of his narrative . While this latest of Mr. Fiske 's writings bears genuine marks of his quality , we can not pretend that we think it by any means the best of his works . To some the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no systematic attempt to examine the relations of New France and New England , to point a contrast between divergent political systems , or to delineate the successive phases of national rivalry . The first four chapters are given to the historical geography of New France , the fifth to Salem witchcraft , the sixth to the Great Awakening ' produced by Jonathan Edwards , the seventh to Norridgewock and Louisburg , and the last three to the Seven Years ' War . Thus geography and war get most of the text , with witchcraft and Jonathan Edwards thrown in ; yet in the whole book there is hardly a word of Frontenac , and no account is given of his policy towards New England We feel very certain that , had Mr Fiske lived longer , his final account of the duel between France and England in America would have possessed greater unity than can be claimed by the book with which we are now dealing . Perhaps a little more care might have been shown regarding points of detail . However , the main thing is that the studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters on French exploration form a little series at the beginning , and the three chapters on the Seven Years ' War make a group by themselves at the end  --  a group to which the story of Pepperell 's expedition against Louisburg may fitly be added . In the middle come the articles on Salem witchcraft and the religious revival in New England . For our own part we must say that we prefer the chapters which treat of life in New England . They seem fresher , although the subjects themselves are well worn , and they show a firmer grasp of the material . The chapters on New France are at the disadvantage of following in the track of Park-man , and there is little to indicate that Mr Fiske had made a special study of Canadian history He is much interested in the Indians and the voyageurs , but the development of the colony is put altogether to one side . Mr. Fiske was essentially a humanist in the broader and higher sense of that term . Although the problems of philosophy and science appealed to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did not divorce his intellectual interests from the ordinary affairs of mankind . The depth and quickness of his sympathies go far towards accounting for his success as a popular historian . He was not above being clear and simple , nor did he shrink from putting into his books what the average reader cares to hear about . For perorations and other rhetorical tricks he cared little , but , when touched by the spectacle of such - torments as the poor victims of Salem suffered , he could use language of unwonted fervor : " We can but faintly imagine what must have been the destruction of confidence , the breaking of the dearest ties , the madness , the reign of savage terror ; and we can not be too grateful that the gaunt spectre which stalked so long over the fairest parts of earth has at length been exorcised for-ever ! " John Mackenzie , South African Missionary and Statesman By W. Douglas Mackenzie , M.A. , Professor in Chicago Theological Seminary . New York ? A. C Armstrong &; Son . 1902 . Pp. xii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of this biography is singularly opportune . South Africa is to be " settled , " Mr.Chamberlain is on his way as settler , and it is here made clear that he , of all English statesmen , had best secured and held the esteem of the subject of this book . In their views of the needs of the case they essentially agreed . Mackenzie was an imperialist of a class which we do not always quite understand or exactly distinguish . For him imperialism meant the supremacy of the central government  --  federalism we might call it . His ideas upon it were largely modelled on the treatment by this country of its Territories , and alsd affected by the problems and results of our civil war . He saw that the greatest difficulty in South Africa lay in the rapidly growing colored population ; he was in fact the first to note that rapid increase Further , he recognized that no white pioneer class could be trusted to act fairly by " natives . " They would make of them a subject race , whether slaves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the races of South Africa were worth saving , must and could be saved . To accomplish that and bridge the gulf for them to selfgovernment  --  protecting them on the way from being exploited by whites  --  he advised simple protectorates ( using their tribal chiefs ) and crown colonies . The last , oddly enough , he compared with our Territorial government So he fought , and successfully , the incorporation of Bechuanaland into Cape Colony , the spread of Dutch rule  --  which meant always an enslaved black race with no rights against a white man  --  and the jurisdiction and system of the British South African Company . His difficulties were great and of a strange kind It is hardly credible , and yet this book makes it plain , how little English politicians less than twenty years ago thought and knew about South Africa . They had no interest in it , would not be troubled with it , nothing could be made of it . So they were driven on without a policy , refusing to see either opportunity or duty . To open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they were , bound to come sooner or later , was Mackenzie 's public work . In it he was only partly successful . Entire success would have prevented the Boer war , entire failure would have meant the enslavement of all the native races . Yet , considering the English attitude , it is rather wonderful that he accomplished so much . Their timidity  --  so strangely contrasting with present high hands and mailed fists  --  ran back to a feeling that the mass of the new democracy was unreliable , fickle , and averse to any new responsibilities , and the fear of that democracy was upon them all . That a democracy could be imperialistic never entered their heads or certainly their convictions . Mr. John Morley , of whose honesty Mackenzie thought highly , said frankly : " I grant yours is far the nobler position and begets more worthy and chivalrous feelings " ; but yet he rated it impossible . Froude 's attitude was still more and cynically hopeless . Mr. W. E. Forster , on the other hand , was with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have no sympathy , commercialism and money power could , for him , found no true state . He regarded Rhodes as pursuing an essentially double course , Dutch with the Dutch and imperialistic with the English . Of Mr. Gladstone he and his biographer have significantly little to say . It is perfectly clear what Mackenzie thought of Mr. Gladstone 's South African policy , but the halo round the figure of the great Liberal leader is still too bright for an English Nonconformist to dare to speak out Of Disraeli there is not a single word This , then , is no ordinary missionary biography , but a book which must make its weight felt both as a record of the past and as a suggestion as to the future . Of defects in the treatment there are few . There might have been much fuller detail on many points , but these are surfaces under which the ashes are still glowing , and the biographer , religious especially , must step cautiously . In the large , Professor Mackenzie has accomplished his delicate task well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a strong picture of one man by another . And the claim of the title is fairly made out . This was both a missionary and a statesman As both , his position may , perhaps , be best summed in the following sentences written in 1891 : " I believe I was the first to point out the possibility of the peaceful opening up of native territories under the Imperial Government , accompanied by the recognition of the rights of natives to their holdings , and by intelligent steps taken to secure those lands to their owners under the Imperial Government . " ( P. 454 . ) " The problem in South Africa is not an easy one in any circumstances . What I fear is that her Majesty 's Government is in danger of acquiescing in its own expulsion from active administration in new territories , by a few men in the Cape Colony , before there is a Confederated South African Government to which it could hand over its duties ; and I am well aware that no greater calamity could possibly happen to South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this kind we can surely have no quarrel . The Last Days of the French Monarchy . By Sophia H. MacLehose . Glasgow : James MacLehose &; Sons . 1901. 8vo , pp. xiv , 391 . No adequate introduction has yet been written to the history of the French Revolution . Many attempts have been made to picture the anctea regime , ranging from the philosophic and highly finished chapters of De Tocqueville to the most trivial of the innumerable sketches of the private life of Marie Antoinette . Many important contributions to the subject are of course available , but we still await a sound and comprehensive explanation of the French Revolution which shall satisfactorily estelish the historic continuity between the old and new France . Reasons why such a work should still be wanting are not far to seek . In the first place , the very word " revolution , " as Carlyle long ago warned us , is used in almost as many senses as there are writers on the theme . He himself meant by it , if we remember rightly , the upbubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sharply to be distinguished from this notion is the conception of the French Revolution as a great permanent change which separates the France of Napoleon and later times from that of the eighteenth century . The more superficial volcanic phenomena have until recently fascinated most observers . They have recorded the rumblings and the darkness , the stifling fumes and the lightning flashes . The fundamental and permanent alterations have been forgotten in the turmoil of transient disorder . It is obvious that one to whom the upbubbling of anarchy and the prevailing of the powers of darkness constitute the essence of the Revolution , should look inquiringly to the ( Lucien regime for an explanation of Hebert and St. Just The more profound student of the subject will also turn to the eighteenth century for an explanation , not , however , of an explosion , but of an enduring and fundamental political and social reorganization . Even if writers were at one in their interpretation of the Revolution and its antecedents , they would still have to face an important inherent difficulty of their subject . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe the conditions in France and the lot of all classes of society , from the king and his immediate companions to the peasant . At the same time , extraordinary changes which took place during the generation preceding the opening of the States-General must be even more carefully studied than the ancient political and social organization of the kingdom . Unfortunately , writers have never succeeded in doing justice to both the static and dynamic . The scholar who has best succeeded is , perhaps , Gomel , who , in his ' Histoire financiare de la Revolution Francaise , ' has exhibited with remarkable clarity and precision the economic conditions , the trend of public opinion , and the experiments of the ministers . The volume in hand belongs in the same class with Lowell 's excellent ' Eve of the French Revolution . ' It is a popular and eminently readable account of the most striking features of the old order , for the most part , based upon unimpeachable sources . It is the first of two volumes , in the second , the author proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States-General in 1788 to the establishment of the First Republic . After a description of the royal town and all its Persian apparatus . there come three brief chapters on the administration , the privileges , and the philosophes . Then , with a correct instinct for discovering the real beginnings of the Revolutionary movement , the writer turns back to the Austrian Alliance , and soon introduces us to the Empress 's little daughter , to whom the leading place is assigned in the succeeding pages . Marie Antoinette is treated with refreshing candor The author frankly and fully describes the Queen 's gambling and her minor indiscretions , but takes no delight in exposing the weaknesses which the loyal Madame Cam-pan and those who accepted her judgment have been wont to conceal . Since the pub- : lication of the correspondence of honesr Count Mercy with the Queen 's mother and brothers , there is no longer any doubt that , in spite of the fundamental propriety of the Queen 's conduct , she exercised a most malign influence upon the public policy , and justly called down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turgot and Necker is clear , and perhaps as adequate as could be expected under the circumstances It is noteworthy that Calonne , the Notables , and the conduct of the Parlements during 1787-8 receive far more attention than is granted them in other popular accounts of the period This promises well for the second volume , which wilt doubtless be read with pleasure by those who have profited by the first . As one lays down the book , lie can not but reflect that , although all may be quite true that has been said , there is a certain failure to grasp the essentials in the criticab situation in which France found itself . The pomp and circumstance so vividly described were in no way new , nor were the frivolity of the Queen and the embarrassments . of the ministers , Several of the books which . would have helped the author to a deeper insight have been omitted from the long list of authorities which she consulted .. None of Babeau 's admirable works except that on Paris is mentioned , nor Gomel's. volumes . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Esprit Publique an Dix-huitiame Siacle ' are omitted . The author cites Lomenie 's ' Beaumarchais , ' but not his ' Mirabeau . ' Hanotaux 's monograph would have prevented ' the repetition of the old mistake through , which the establishment of the intendants is assigned to Richelieu . Lastly , the whole momentous matter of the Church ix almost entirely neglected . Something can be done to rectify these deficiencies in the second volume , and the scope of the work should be broadened , if it is to include all the important phases in the regeneration of France . Early Prose Writings of James Russell Lowell . With a prefatory note by Dr. Hale of Boston , and an introduction by Walter Littlefield . John Lane . These who recall the latter pages of MaScudder 's delightful biography of Lowell can hardly have forgotten the description ( vol. h. , 395 ) of the pains the poet took with the final revision of his prose writings , going over them all with care , " tucking in " or " erasing " whatever he wished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " go . hang . " He did not live to see that it would not he so easy as he had supposed to indict this penalty on the pirate class , or that his own early friends would lend countenance to the buccaneering . The book now before us contains Lowell 's college prose , such as it was  --  and it was poor enough  --  and those early views of the British dramatists , printed in ' Conversations on Some of the Old Poets , ' which he bad re'fused to reprint , as wholly immature and sometimes expressing opinions retracted afterwards . Dr. Hale , in his introduction , goes over ground which he has before traversed an telling the story of Lowell 's college days ; and does , it so hastily that he describes Lowell , as a sophomore , coming into a college room to arrange for a meeting of the " Harvard Union , " which all old graduates testify to have been a society for juniors and seniors only ; moreover , he gives the name of Charles S. Loring to the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the leaders of the Boston bar . The editor of the book , Mr Littlefield , is so unfamiliar with the literature of that time as to rate Lowell 's magazine , the Pioneer , as inferior to the Boston Miscellany , to which it was as much supeaior , during its brief career , as the Atlantic - was afterwards superior to the Pioneer itself . He thinks Mr Lowell fell behind ' Nathan Hale , editor of the earlier magazine , in not appreciating the value of the novel , although , as a matter of fact , Mr. Hale 's magazine printed no novel , and Mr Lowell 's Pioneer began upon one in its first : number . This , " The Armenian 's Daughter , " was contributed by his junior editor , Mr Robert Carter , then an eccentric youth , - whose main peculiarity was the construction , in imagination , of works of fiction on the most enormous scale . His main work of this kind , which he delighted to describe in detail , as being in steady progress , was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene Sue 's ' Wandering Jew , ' then popular ; two volumes of this mammoth work being prospectively devoted to an episode - consisting of a History of the World , narrated by a hermit amid the Mountains of the Moon in Africa . Mr Littlefield finally con eludes that the once noted Nathaniel P. Willis exhibited " marvellous perception " in pronouncing Lowell to be " a very unfit editor for a periodical , " although Lowell afterwards proved just the contrary in the Atlantic Monthly , where he had a fair field for action . Such are the vagaries of editors and biographers ' The Leaven on to Great City , By Lillian W. Betts . Dodd , Mead &; Co . This is an account of New York 's East aide poor , impressive from the writer 's intimacy with her subject , and from her attitude towards it , at once sympathetic and jueclicial . It begins with recalling the tene .. ment-house agitation of 1978 , inaugurated by the conference called by the State ? ha , I-ties Aid Association . It describes certain Fourth Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degradation ; then moves eh to better things  --  to the improvements efdected by the College Settlement work , the forming of Mothers ' Clubs , Working Girls ' ' Clubs , and kindergartens , nothing extenuating as to their difficulties and hindrances , Miss Betts 's knowledge of the working-girl class lends profound interest to her statement that " the inspiring fact remains that the standard of home life in ethics , as in necessities , is rising . " Of moment , too , is her estimate of the great class of independent wage-earners " as far removed from the incapable , the degraded , the vicious , the dependent , the ignorant  --  who provide the themes for books  --  as far removed from the worthless , the deficient , the mentally , morally weak , so familiar to - the people of wealth who give money or time , or both , to lessen their miseries , as they are in standard and ambition from the people counted wealthy .

Theory of Differential Equations . Part III . ( Vol . IV . ) ? Ordinary Linear Equations . By Andrew Russell Forsyth Cambridge ( Eng . ) University Press ; New York : Macmillan . 1902 . Svo , pp. xvi , Old The successor of Cayley here truly presents us with the fifth volume of his useful work on differential equations ; for his more practical ' Treatise ' on the same subject really forms an essential part of this , No further volume is promised ; but the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are inclined to think that one more will come . Certainly , enough topics have been passed over to furnish forth two , and that richly . Although it can not be called a complete handbook , the work has a tolerably definite plan and a judicious one . Whatever would more particularly interest an algebraist or student of the theory of groups is omitted . Whatever stood right across the path of a writer on Differential Equations is treated in a. general way . Works of several American mathematicians are necessarily expounded in this volume . Prof. G. W. Hill 's method forms the subject of one of the ten chapters , and that is meagre allowance . An unfinished MS. treatise of the late Prof. Thomas Craig has been made use of . Theorems by Osgood , Eficher , Van , Vleek , and others appear . A peculiar sort of suggestiveness attaches to that of Bdcher . Of course , such a book can have no interest to the generality of our readers except in this respect The premises upon which pure mathematics rests are few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numeration. there are about a score of them . The reasoning is wholly deductive . If , therefore , deductive reasoning were what the logic books represent it to be , if , as Kant says , it merely explicated what is confusedly thought in the premises ; if , as Mill says , it merely registered what had already been accepted , then the total number of mathematical conclusions could not exceed the total number of possible combinations of premises  --  or , say , something like a million , including the most trivial . By this time , then , pure mathematics ought to be approaching exhaustion Doubtless , the current impression among ageometrieal persons is that such is the case . Yet the four volumes of Professor Forsyth 's ' Theory ' present , in somewhat full outline , only about two-thirds of the discoveries made during the nineteenth century in a subject which has occupied about one-tenth of the total energy of mathematicians ; and far from there being the slightest sign of exhaustion , the bulk of the new work is increasing in geometrical progression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad . As many new methods of value now appear in a decade as there were born of new theorems in the same interval a hundred years ago . Here is a subject dealing with nothing but the abstract creations of the mind ; a subject , too , in which comparatively few are able to make discoveries , and yet it may be doubted whether sixty volumes could give a very much fuller account of the mathematical discoveries of the nineteenth century than could be given in the same space of the discoveries in so rich and universally accessible a field as biology At any rate , the fact that there is no utterly overwhelming discrepancy affords food for rumination.
