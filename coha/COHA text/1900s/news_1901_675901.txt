txt A LOCOMOTIVE FAMINE . The congestion of grain at Buffalo , representing some twenty-five millions of bushels of wheat in elevator or on its way to that point , with an eastward movement of only about a million bushels a day , calls attention to the fact that the trouble at the moment is less a scarcity of cars on which to load it than a scarcity of engines with which to move the cars when loaded . During the years of depression the railroads are said to have let their locomotive equipment run down , ' and when the rush of freight movement came they could not get as many engines as they needed . The locomotive works have been crowded to the breaking point with exigent orders , and are still far behind the requirements of their customers . Even the engines shown at the Pan-American Exposition were all sold long ago and were delivered immediately the fair closed , It is agreed among students of transportation problems that the scarcity of locomotives is a more serious matter than the scarcity of cars , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle their traffic , the increased movement would be equivalent to more than doubling the available car supply . It is also predicted that the needs of internal commerce will not be met by pars alone , since on many roads long lines of loaded cars are now left standing on sid.ings for days at a time owing to inability to provide engines to move them . This would tend to confirm the growing conviction that the day of the locomotive is passing and that electric traction must be looked to for the continuous movement of traffic which has outgrown the train system . MT . LANGDON 'S estimate for the Midland ' Railroad of England , showing that by doing away with infrequent and heavy trains and maintaining a practically continuous movement at an average speed of , say , forty miles an hour for its entire traffic , the caps.city of a railroad would be practically doubled , would seem to apply as well to the trunk lines between Buffalo and New York as it obviously does to interurban electric roads , which are successfully competing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both for a much lower percentage of gross earnings than any steam rail : road poSsibly can .
