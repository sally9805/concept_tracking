Our Canal Commissioners at Washington must have read with peculiar and perhaps slightly malicious pleasure the dispatches from Paris telling of the complete surrender of the Panama Canal Company . By the action of its stockholders it has repudiated its former President , M. Hutin , whose discomfiture in the negotiation which he carried on , too cleverly by half , with Admiral Walker is now acknowledged . No one can read the correspondence which passed between them without smiling at the steady persistence with which the American met all the shifts and windings of the elusive Frenchman with the one question , " Tell us your price . " At last M. Hutin named some figures$109,000,000 ? which he said the Company would regard as " just , " though from them it would doubtless make " reasonable concessions " if it should appear that they were justifiable . But implacable Admiral Walker took the Frenchman at his word , reported that the Panama Company had demanded an " unreasonable price , " and , in view of that fact , he and his fellow-Commissioners favored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , comes the consternation of the Panama stockholders at the blundering of their President ; and too late their repentance and renewed offers to sell their property at a fair price . But why should it be too late for us to accept and profit by a situation which our Canal Commissioners labored long and earnestly to bring about ? t It is impossible to read their able re port without seeing how strong is their inclination to the Panama route . In their final summary they say in so many ' words : " There are certain physical advantages , such as a shorter canal line , a more complete knowledge of the country through which it passes , and the lower cost of maintenance and operation , in favor of the Panama route ; but the price fixed by the Panama Canal Company for a sale of its property is so unreasonable that its acceptance can not be recommended by this Commission . " The " unreasonable " price was , as has been said , $109,000,000 . What is the canal really worth to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly , kind friends , we must not ignore our own Commissioners . They , as skilled engineers , made a careful estimate of the value of the Panama Canal , which may be found on p. 103 of their report . Leaving the plant entirely out of the account  --  since all the buildings , machinery , dredges , lOcomotives , etc. , might be of no use to an American contractor  --  they reckon the whole to be worth in round numbers $40,000,009 . This sum decomposes into $27,474,033 for the " excavation already done , " $6,850 , - 000 for the " Panama Railroad stock at par , " and $2,000,000 for " maps , drawings , and records " ? total $36,324,033 , " to which add 10 per cent . to cover omissions , making the total value of the Panama Canal $40,000,000 . " It is this valuation by the American Commissioners which the Panama stockholders have determined to accept . This shows how sweeping is Admiral Walker 's triumph . He has succeeded in getting $69,000,000 knocked off the price named by M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two routes , purely on the money side ? The Commissioners estimate the cost of constructing a Nicaragua canal at $189,864,620 ; to complete the Panama Canal will require , they say , $144,233,358 . Add in the $40,000,000 for the estimated value of the work already done at Panama , and we have the latter route the cheaper by $5,600,000 . But this is by no means the whole story . On p. 256 of the Commissioner 's report is printed the estimated cost of maintaining and operating the two canals . The figures for Nicaragua are $3,300,000 a year ; for Panama $2,000,000 . This advantage of Panama represents a capitalized value of $40,000,000 . Therefore , taking the estimate of our own engineers , we stand to save $45,000,000 by electing the Panama route . Is Uncle Sam so lavish and reckless that he will disdain to pick up a tidy sum like that ? This is saying nothing of the technical , engineering arguments . That these strongly favor the Panama route IS now beyond dispute . There is practically a consensus , on this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the two projects . The engineering preferences of our own Commissioners are unmistakable in their report . They incline markedly to Panama , and bring out the difficulties and drawbacks of the Nicaragua route more conspicuously than has been done in any previous report . As they say , the " complete problem " involves a plan for a sea-level canal . This is wholly impossible through Nicaragua , and " the Panama route alone , " say our Commissioners , " is feasible for a sea-level canal . " To such a canal it is altogether likely that we shall want to come in the end ; and this is but one of the engineering considerations which make powerfully for the choice of the Panama route . If the Frenchmen have perceived their great mistake and hastened to correct it , Americans should surely not seize the occasion to fall into a greater mistake of their own . Happily , it is not too late for sober reconsideration . The President is not committed to the Nicaraguan route ; his message spoke only of an Isthmian canal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route may be expedient . " With the Panama Company at last brought to their senses , and with their canal , which is demonstrably the cheaper and better , offered to the United States at a reasonable price , the opportunity for our Government is certainly fine both to save money and to build more wisely for the benefit of the generations and the commerce yet to be . THE PHILIPPINE BURDEN . President Roosevelt was never franker or terser than when , in his message to Congress , he called the Philippines " a great burden " to the United States . In that phrase he may have builded better than he knew . Boldly to throw down by one honest word the gorgeous fabric of empire and of glory built up in the Philippine oratory of a Beveridge , was to invite , whether consciously or not , a calm and sane review of our attitude and our policy If a great burden , why bind it upon our backs one hour longer than absolutely necessary ? This is the question which the march of events is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and upon the people There are many ways in which the Philippine burden is showing itself too grievous to be borne . It is driving the Administration and the Republican party into self-stultification . On December 18 the House passed the bill rebnacting the Dingley duties on Philippine products , which the Supreme Court had decided to have been unconstitutionally levied . But on the same dap was published the report of our own Commissioners in the Philippines " earnestly recommending " that Congress " reduce by 50 per cent . the United States duty on tobacco , hemp , and sugar and ' other merchandise coming from these islands . " Such a measure , affirm the Commissioners ( " generosity " they call it ) , " would strengthen the bonds between the Filipino and American people . " Out of our own mouths , therefore , we stand condemned . We do not need to hark back to Burke on the criminal folly of strangling the trade of colonies by tariffs and restrictions . Let Judge Taft , our own trusted agent in the Philippines , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow full in his face . Ignorant though they were of the urgent recommendations of the Philippine Commission , five Republicans broke away from their party in the vote on this tariff . Two of them ? Messrs . McCall and Littlefield  --  by common consent stand for ability and character unsurpassed in the party , or in the House . Only the sternest pressure of conviction and of duty could have driven them to sever themselves from their fellow-Republicans . Why they were compelled to do so was clearly explained by Representative McCall . He had believed the annexation of the Philippines to be , from the beginning , an " infatuated policy . " The present bill he regarded as inexpedient , unprincipled , and un-American . For his part , he was convinced that national honor , the integrity of republican institutions , our future peace and safety , together with every dictate of interest and justice , " demand that we shall now so Shape our steps that we may return to the God of our fathers . " This is the moral sword which is thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of the Filipinos . The division and dissent will be more marked as time goes on . We know of several Republican Congressmen who are privately crying out against the policy of retaining the Philippines , and who are only waiting occasion to ripen in order to publish their position . The tariff bill has yet to face the Senate , and justice will surely not be without its witnesses in that body . By the time the debate of the Senators comes on , the Philippine Commission 's report will be seen to throw a strong light on the disastrous nature of the tariff bill . And it is to be hoped , too , that a sentiment of public indignation will be aroused , as at the time of the proposed Porto Rican tariff , to uphold the hands of those who believe that magnanimity to the Filipinos is the truest wisdom . For it is , at bottom , the modern spirit of humanity that makes most strongly against that application of the barbarous old colonial system which is proposed by the Republicans at Washington . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is comfortably taken , in some quarters , as a fair offset to the action of five Republicans in voting against it . Just the ordinary slight disregard of party lines , it is said . But the significant truth is , that the five broke away from party for the sake of principle , and the three for the sake of sugar . The Louisiana Democrats practically said to the Republican majority : " We see in your bill a recognition of those selfish notions of monopolistic taxation for which we stand . You mean to tax the Filipinos so as to prevent them from competing with us . You regard as perfect ' rot ' the talk about being generous to the islanders , and would let them starve before you would take off a penny of their taxes . Those are our sentiments , too , and we are with you . " This attitude really confirms and completes the condemnation of the bill expressed by the bolting- Republicans . They charged that the measure was one of ruthless greed , and , to prove it so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats who frankly accepted it as such . Thus , those who voted for it in defiance of party merely deepened , the stigma placed upon it by those who forsook their colleagues to vote against it . The moral riddling of the bill was the more thorough for being double-barrelled . We can but think that Secretary Root and President Roosevelt are making a grave mistake in assenting to , if they do not advise , the passage of the Philippine tariff bill , and that because of its necessarily harmful effect upon another project near their hearts . We refer to tariff relief for Cuba . This they mean to bend all their energies to obtain from Congress . But with what grace can it be asked for Cubans when denied to Filipinos ? The latter are AmerIcan citizens ; the Cubans are foreigners . Will Congress be like flint to the prayers of its own , and relent at the petition of aliens ? The Secretary and the President may think that a sullen and selfish protectionism will be more apt to be generous to the Cubans after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that is not the law of greed : it grows by What it feeds upon , and becomes more insolent with every triumph . This is the reason why we fear that the Administration , if it consents to tariff injustice in the Philippines , will make the removal of tariff injustice to Cuba more difficult , if not impossible . The really crushing nature of the Philippine burden , however , appears in something other than these embarrassments of party management and Administration policy . Not even the enormous cost to us in. money and life tells the whole story , or constitutes the main reason why American statesmanship should apply itself to the loosing of the Phihppine burden at-the earliest possible day . What we have got to see as a people is that we went on the wrong track in the Philippine venture from the first day ; that it committed us to un-American ideas of human rights and government , and set us at war with all our past . It is said that , when Thiers met Ranke in Vienna during the fatal winter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now fighting since the fall of the Emperor ? " " With Louis XIV. , " replied the German historian . It is , in like manner , George III . and Lord North with whom we opponents of the Philippine policy are still fighting . We can not consent that those discredited rulers shall be dug out of their graves and allowed to dictate for us , in the American name , a colonial policy which drove America to revolt . THE FUTURE OF COAL EXPORTS . English coal-miners are just now suffering from another of their periodic chills , caused by the fear that they may have to share Continental markets with the United States . The immediate danger is not very apparent , since the latest returns of the Bureau of Statistics show that we exported only-6,403,008 tons of coal during the first ten months of the current year , as against 6,572,597 tons during the same period in 1900 . Even if attention be confined to France and Germany , our two most favorable European markets , the actual increase over last year 's exports is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coal is relatively insignificant . - It is , however , acutely pointed out by the London Economist that " the exact extent which American exports have attained , is not material . " The British coal trade is alarmed at certain tendencies which indicate that the present rudimentary export trade in American coal may grow to much greater importance . And undoubtedly there is some warrant for this apprehension . While our actual sales to Germany have been small , the present low freights are likely to increase them . Large recent purchases are reported , one Berlin wholesaler having contracted for 100,000 tons of anthracite . More important than this , many German consumers either prefer our anthracite , or recognize it as equal to the Welsh product , while , notwithstanding the crumbling suffered by our bituminous coal in transit , some authorities believe that it may compete successfully with German coal of the same character , so far as quality is concerned . It is not to be questioned that a great potential market for American coal exists on the Continent . About 12,000,000 tons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , 6,000,000 by Austria . 3,000,000 by Sweden , and 4.000,000 by Italy . These quantities will be increased as manufacturing progresses and Continental mines deepen . But the greatest impetus to the export of American coal comes from the industrial dissension caused by the trades-unions among the Welsh miners . Their power surpasses anything of the kind ever known in the United States , and their ability to control the conditions of production was clearly shown last autumn , when they fixed the " minimum " wage that will rule for two years . Moreover , they have recently insisted on a series of " stop days " at the mines , with a view to raising prices by limiting production  --  their wages increasing , on the sliding-scale principle , with the market price of the product . As a matter of fact , prices have not risen , though it may well be argued that the action of the miners has probably kept them from declining . The Welsh miners have forgotten that our output is now the largest in the world , and that consequently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of production , plus the cost of shipment to the point of consumption . It is not to be expected that the Welsh miners will in the immediate future either relax their regulations or accept lower wages . The price of English coal is not , therefore , likely to decline . But the outlook for continued low freights for American coal is less satisfactory . Present rates are largely accidental and temporary . There has been , for reasons perfectly understood in shipping circles , a great relative increase in the amount of foreign and domestic tonnage offering its services to American shippers . Freights have , in consequence , declined , and though they are by no means so low for coal as for other exports , they are far below the point at which they normally stand . But such a situation can not be permanent . How to continue a Scale of freights which will permit our coal to go abroad is now the problem . That it may be solved , there is every reason to believe In the first place , the flourishing condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our vessels fully warrant the opinion that a new and economical type of ocean-carrier , especially suited to the demands of the coal business , will be turned out . The ships built for the grain and ore trade on the Great Lakes show what may be expected from American ingenuity . Moreover , the recent address of Mr. Schwab. before the meeting of the naval architects and marine engineers in New York reveals how great is the incentive for the Steel Corporation to promote the development of such a fleet of American vessels . There is a close connection between our powerful interests in steel manufacture and ship-building , on the one hand , and our coal exports , on the other . It is highly desirable that there be at hand a staple to provide a permanent supply of freight when ordinary shipments are short . Our manufactures do not go abroad in equal quantities at all seasons of the year , and exports of corn and wheat are subject to slack times . Coal , it is evident , would fill an exceedingly useful function as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thus encouraging prospects for foreign trade in American coal , one important difficulty has to be reckoned with . It will be far from easy , under the most favorable circumstances , for even a great combination to keep transportation charges down to a point which will permit coal exports unless return freights can be obtained . Our colliers ought to be able to count upon cargoes both ways . If , for instance , our vessels could return laden with Swedish iron ? ores , duty free , the problem of a coal trade in Northern Europe would be solved . In fact , it is not probable that any great expansion in our coal exports can be expected until some steps have been taken to provide bulky return freights . These can surely be obtained only by a reduction in our present customs duties . At whatever door we enter , in this whole question of developing foreign trade , that is the door where we invariably come out . PROGRESS OF LABOR ARBITRA-TION . A very important step toward the settlement of labor troubles in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent committee to consider methods of treating such difficulties as they may arise in the future . This was the result of a meeting of the National Civic Federation , which was in session in this city during the past week , and was attended by the leading representatives of organized labor and by a number of the largest employers of labor in the country , and had its proceedings reported from day to day in the press . The motion for a standing committee was made by Mr. Sargent , the chief of the Locomotive Firemen , and was supported by Mr. Gompers , Mr. Mitchell , and other well-known leaders of workingmen 'S organizations , as well as by Senator Hanna , Mr. Schwab , and other employers . The standing committee consists of an equal number from either side and a chosen number of citizens , who are neither employers nor employed , but whose reputation guarantees their impartiality , as well as their mental equipment and fitness for this kind of service . Though holding , as we do , that this is the right road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor difficulties will be put to rest , or that strikes will soon disappear from the land . In the nature of things , differences between employers and employed must arise . The progress of industry causes inequalities . The distribution of the joint product of labor and capital which is fair and satisfactory to both sides to-day , becomes unfair after a time . Prices change . The wages of any given period may bring to the wage-earner less of consumable goods after a while . The earnings of the employer may increase so that he ought to pay more . They may decline to a point where he must pay less , or stop altogether . Wages and profits are in a state of flux and reflux . Not only are they changing relatively to each other all the time , but some trades actually go out of existence . Canal-boating , for example , once the principal mode of transportation in the country , has disappeared from some of the States entirely , and in others lingers only in a comatose condition . The whaling industry , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already we are wondering whether the manufacture of submarine cables and overhead telegraph wires may not be superseded by a system of wireless electric communication . ' Nature does not allow industry to stagnate . The relations of labor and capital have always been in a state of unrest , and always will be . The conflict between them will always continue , and , paradoxical as it may seem , ought to continue . Capital will grasp all that it can get , and labor must fight for its rights , or lapse into servitude . This is the testimony of the ages . The true interest of the human race lies in the equalization of opportunities and rewards , and to this end all public effort should be directed . That the movement inaugurated last week is in the right direction , may be inferrcl from the fact that it looks to the instruction and guidance of public opinion quite as much as to the settlement of disputes between employers and employed . If the gentlemen named as the standing committee accept the task assigned to them , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their labor will be of corresponding value to the country . It can hardly happen that a committee so constituted should fail in any given case to satisfy public opinion that its decision is the best and most equitable one possible under the circumstances . It is true that the decision so rendered will not be binding in law . This is not a plan for compulsory arbitration . It is a voluntary advisory tribunal , but its judgments , if accepted by public opinion as impartial and as based upon intelligent investigation , will be just as valid as those of a court of law , and as easily executed . The plan proposed bears resemblance to the courts of conciliation and arbitration which prevail in the north of England . The history of those voluntary tribunals was compiled and published by the Department of Labor at Washington in its Bulletin of May , 1900 , where the happy results may be studied . Of course such men as compose the standing committee appointed here can not be expected to drop their own proper business and take up all cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize a system of dealing with individual cases on the north-of-England plan , or devise one which they may think better suited to conditions in this country . Looking at the high character and authority of the names on the list , we shall be equally surprised and disappointed if the movement does not have very important and beneficent consequences . EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC PERIL . That Germany is over-educated was affirmed last week by the rector of the greatest German university , and he added that , in virtue of Mr. Carnegie 's recent gift for a National University , America must guard against impractical ideals of education . " Mr. Carnegie 's technical-school endowments showed that he was fully in harmony with the American spirit , but his latest proposal I am unable to commend " ? so says the rector of the University of Berlin . Of course , such an opinion is more authoritative for Germany than for this country ; and yet one may suspect that the great archeologist has merely yielded to a pessimism which is prevalent in higher academic circles throughout the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities and academic honors , repeats with a special unction Faust 's monologue : " I have alas ! Philosophy , , Medicine , Jurisprudence too , 4. nd to my cost Theology , With ardent labor , studied through , And here I stand , with all my lore , Poor fool , no wiser than before . " It was this mood which M. Brunetiere rediscovered , and renamed " the bankruptcy of science . " But Dr. Kekuld probably meant , not that Germany is infected with this Faust spirit , but that the social order has suffered material harm through the lack of correspondence between the educational system and the vital needs of the land . Whether he is right or wrong in this matter could be decided only by one who is thoroughly familiar with the recent course of industry and commerce in Germany . If the gymnasium , the real-schule , and the university have withdrawn from labor and industrial activity a proportion of intelligence and of energy which , under the deadening influence of higher education , has become atrophied , then education has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most highly organized school and university system in the world is missing its end . But , before accepting so depressing a conclusion , one would like to be assured that Dr. Kekule is not merely suffering from a graceful pessimism which at a certain age affects nearly all archaeologists and art critics . It is curious to note in this connection that the bitterest complaint of the danger of over-education has come , not from Germany or France , each with its splendid system of free education , but from England , which has practically no educational system at all . When the question of doing something for secondary education was up in Parliament last summer , Mr. Harold E. Gorst , private secretary to his father , Sir John Gorst , Vice-President of the Committee of the Council of Education , wrote a little treatise , entitled " The Curse of Education . " This put his own father in the position of administering a national curse , and was , every one felt , in a way an impropriety , but Sir John Gorst 's friends and enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir John meant to make the curse as light as possible for England . Curtis observed in ' Prue and I ' that it is the much travelled who most insist upon the worthlessness of travel in comparison with the pleasures of the imagination , and so it appears that it is the highly educated who are heard in dispraise of education . Of course there is a certain justice in views of this kind . It is possible for a formal education to fall far short of the making of a citizen . One can hardly doubt that the reiterated complaints that the French Lycee depresses and even corrupts its pupils , contain a dose of truth . What should be said is this , that in America , at least , we are far from experiencing the perils of education . We are as yet in no danger of producing an overtrained class which despises labor and industry . Our colleges , year by year , give back to active business an increasing proportion of their graduates . If danger there be in our present system , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their college course with only a minimum of intellectual culture , and being returned to active life with no finer set of ideals and resources than those who have gone directly from the schools to business . If the college will honestly do its duty by these young men and send them out with disciplined minds , we need have no fear that college education is being overdone There is even less prospect that we shall be over-supplied with universities , or that we shall turn too many young men from active affairs to the disinterested search for truth . It is probably true that there are too many institutions which , with insufficient force and equipment , try to do university work . The remedy for this is the up-building of great university foundations of so obvious a superiority that the overambitious institutions will be forced back to their proper collegiate basis . It is reported that Mr. Carnegie 's foundation at Washington will not compete with the present universities , but will rather be a foundation for free research . However that may be , one Can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , provided that the university is guided by the highest ideals , and is content to go ahead no faster than it can go well . The problem of the " peril of education " may be a practical one in Germany , here it has scarcely even the pale dignity of an academic rating
