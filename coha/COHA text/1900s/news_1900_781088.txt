" Ai n't got no love for niggers , and no white man what 's white has , " was his way of describing his sentiments . A couple of hours later the police arrested another member of McPyke 's gang . Henry Schubel , twenty years old , of 502 West Fifty-sixth Street . He , too , boasted of what he had done . Both were assured by their friends that they would be quickly bailed and moreover that it was too close to election for any Magistrate to " send them up . " John H.

He undertook to take his prisoner to the station through West Sixtieth Street . That street , between West End and Amsterdam Avenues , is called " Cuckoo Row , " and is populated by negroes . Half a dozen of them thought they would release Hopson . Cleary used his club at first and then drew his revolver .
