txt Never in its history did Yonkers witness such scenes as those enacted in its streets yesterday . The Yonkers Railway Company , whose employes are on strike for an increase in wages , made several attempts to run its cars , but every attempt was successfully combatted by the strikers and their sympathizers , the cars being stopped by piles of rocks , bonfires , and in one case by a sympathizer stretching , himself across the tracks in order to bring the car to a stop As , soon as the car was stopped the strikers wrecked it with stones and other missiles . The city authorities virtually admitted that the situation was almost beyond ! their control , and rumors flew thick and fast . that Gov . Hughes was going to send the militia from White Plains to guard the car 's .

The attempt of the company to run its cars was made soon alter the noon hour when thousands employed in the Yonkers factories quit work for luncheon . Practleaily every one of these factory hands is in sympathy with the strikers , and the fact that the company should have decided to make its stand when they were away from their work was commented upon- by-everybody . President Maher of then Yonkers Railway Company , who is also the President of the Union Railway Company in the Bronx , would not make any statement as to . why he had selected the lunch hour for his demonstration . deleted paragraph The motorman who was to run the car no sooner appeared outside the barns than the crowd which jammed the bridge that crosses the New York Central tracks in front of the barns . discovered what was about to happen . in a moment Main Street , as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling crowd of men and boys . " Look out ! Here comes one , " was shouted as the car , preceded by /a Mounted policeman , started up the hill on its way to Main Street . Out into the street , directly in front of the approaching car , the crowd surged , and the police were powerless to drive them back . As the car gained momentum , however , the crowd backed away from the tracks and it managed to make the turn from Main Street into Warburton Avenue . At that point a teamster suddenly remembered that something was the matter with his team and stopped his wagon on the tracks and got off to repair the damage . The car slowed down and then came the stones and bricks , and with its wincloiVs broken and its sides scarred the car was turned back to the barns , followed by a jeering crowd . The other cars that met similar fates were sent out over Warburton Avenue , Riverdale Avenue . and Main Street .

Then the windows were smashed and the crew compelled to flee deleted paragraph About 4:30 o'clock In the afternoon , the company , after several hours ' idleness , so far as the attempt to run cars was concerned , tried again to resume service , and again the result was the same  --  a jeering , rock-throwing crowd that the police could not control , and which soon stopped the ear , broke its windows , and frightened the strikebreakers , who were trying to get It to some destination , to most of them unknown . The policemen made several arrests for the disturbances , those taken into custody being mostly boys and young men . The Prisoners , when they were not strikebreakers , got a rousing cheer from all sides as they marched through the street on their way to the police stations . Capt .

To-day the police expect to have a more trying time . William Jennings Bryan will speak in Yonkers this afternoon , and a great crowd is expected to be on hand to welcome him . Should the situation get entirely out of control of the police , the opinion was that the militia from White Plains would be ordered to the city . Late yesterday afternoon Mayor Coyne issued a proclamation calling on the people to keep the peace . Whether the proclamation will have any effect or riot is yet to be determined , for the company made no attempt to run ears after it was issued . It was said that the ' company was very bitter against the attitude of the Mayor , and that it was going to ask in the Governor to remove him . This report could not be confirmed . deleted 1 paragraph             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
