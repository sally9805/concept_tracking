Secretary Taft must find on his return home that his backers have been troubled about many things Thus far their hopes and predictions have failed of fulfilment The expected orders have issued from the White House , but have not proved self-executing The obedient Southern postmasters have come forward as men ready to vote for Roosevelt , but strangely unwilling to be delivered to any man whom Roosevelt might name Not in New England , or in New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Indiana , or Illinois , has any real Taft sentiment been discovered , while even in Ohio there is a hitter contest for the delegates , with the practical certainty that Foraker will get at least a few Such an outlook for the Ohio candidate of 1907 contrasts sharply with that of the Ohio candidate of 1895 when Hanna was in charge If one compares the management of the McKinley campaign by Mark Hanna with that of the Taft campaign by Arthur Vorys , the first effect is almost ludicrous Whatever has to be said of Mr Hanna , he was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large political combinations Force and bigness were the characteristics of his plans Hanna was a strong man pulling along a weak candidate Taft 's manager , on the contrary , has made the impression of an ineffectual little gentleman clinging to the coat-tails of the big Secretary His methods have been petty and waspish . The mailing of a million postal cards , from Columbus , with " Taft is a Sure Winner , " or some such powerful effort of the imagination , printed on them , is a good measure of his political resource Then , too , Mr Vorys has spent too much time making denials and uttering charges and running to the White House with angry tales of treachery It may not be fair to put all the blame of the Taft disappointments upon him , but much of it undoubtedly belongs there , and if a scapegoat is desired , there stands Vorys ready to be sent back into the Ohio wil-derness Those who speak comfortable things to themselves about the prospects of the Taft campaign , ought not to forget how much brighter was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was striking at the great voting strength of the Republican party New England was practically conceded to Reed , though Connecticut in the end gave seven votes in the convention to McKinley ; but in the other States to which the Republicans must look for electoral votes , the movement for the Ohio man soon became irresistible Illinois , Indiana , with Minnesota and Michigan , were made sure for McKinley Ohio was , of course , for him without a quaver or a break Two great States , New York and Pennsylvania , were held by their bosses , Platt and Quay , but the McKinley tactics steadily undermined them . Before the convention , Quay threw up his hands , and , though Platt stuck to his " blind " candidacy of Gov Morton , the " skilful agents of McKinley , " whom the Tribune reported on December 2 , 1895 , to be at work in this State , labored to such good advantage that McKinley actually got seventeen of the seventy-two votes on the first ballot .

The rather melancholy contrast which the Taft campaign offers is not wholly to the Secretary 's discredit It is not worse to have a timid and feeble manager than to be controlled by one who is powerful , but sinister and unscrupulous Nobody is financing , or will be tempted to finance , the Taft campaign , as Hanna saw to it that the McKinley campaign was financed Without money , Hanna could not work at all His first instinct , whenever he wanted anything , was , as one of his Ohio intimates has phrased it , to " go out and buy somebody " The scandal of the lavish use of money to promote McKinley 's nomination grew so great and open that Speaker Reed deliberately placed on record his opinion that delegates were bought like cattle Secretary Taft might well prefer to fail rather than succeed by such means His friends say that they expect very positive action from him , as soon as he finds out the exact posture of affairs What he could do , however , to put a Lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers may accomplish some good , but a radical change of spirit is what is needed To-day , the Secretary inevitably stands as a patronized and second-hand candidate The President intimated to the reporters last week that Cortelyou 's declaration left " only one candidate in the field who can be regarded as representing the policies of the Administration , and only one Cabinet candidate " This means Taft , of course That large-built , vigorous , and independent man is thus held up to the country as merely the shadow of another This is what most kills off enthusiasm for Taft . And he , by not only assenting to the condescending endorsement of Roosevelt , but glorying in it , has made himself largely responsible for what followed It may be that his speedy retirement from the Cabinet would now mend matters ; but short of that , or some other clear demonstration to the country that he is his own master , we do not know what " positive action " he can take that will much avail Indeed , the latest report from Washington is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Presidency THE REPORT OF THE BANKERS ' COMUTTEE . When it had become evident , from the tun on the New York trust companies , that the State law regulating these institutions was dangerously defective , Gov Hughes requested six bankers to suggest reforms As long ago as October , 1901 , the Clearing House Association had called attention to the fact that a number of trust companies were doing a deposit banking business pure and simple , with no requirement as to cash reserves , and with a latitude as to investment of demand deposits , which had not been deemed safe , and had not therefore been permitted , for deposit banks In February , 1903 , the Clearing House required of such companies as " cleared " their checks through banks the maintenance of a 10 to 15 per cent cash reserve against deposits In January , 1905 , the State Superintendent of Banking somewhat timidly urged the passage of a law requiring cash reserves , and in April , 1906 , the Legislature decreed that trust companies must maintain against all deposits a 15 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the rest , if a company chose , in the form of public securities and deposits with other institutions This requirement , as events of last October have proved , is entirely inadequate First , because this reserve is insufficient support for demand deposits , second , because no restriction beyond the slight limitations fixed by the old trust company law is applied to the use of such deposits And the public 's unanimous recognition of the part played by these two considerations in the disastrous panic led to the demand for new banking legislation and to the Governor 's appointment of the committee Their report , a document of great val-ue , does not confine itself to imperfec-tions of the trust company law , but takes up comprehensively the abuses which the experience of last October brought to light It recommends that the Banking Superintendent have power to veto the establishment of new banks , new trust companies , or new branches of either  --  that power to be a safeguard against the exploiting of such institutions by designing promoters , or their establishment in localities where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's judgment , have a similar right to block the purchase of one banking institution by another Both these recommendations are excellent ; they are merely a new assertion of the duty of the State , which charters and shelters such institutions , to see that the powers thus granted are not used to defraud the depositor The further recommendations that all loans must be submitted to the board of directors ; that additional capital be re-quired when branch banks are established , that the proportion of loans to be granted to one borrower , or to one underwriting syndicate , be rigidly restricted , and that the Banking Superintendent administer the affairs of insolvent institutions as the Comptroller of the Currency does with national banks  --  each of these proposed amendments is both wise and necessary . We regret , however , that the committee has not grappled more successfully with the overshadowing problem of restrictions , as to reserve and scope of investment , on trust company demand deposits Three members of the committee advise a compulsory 25 per cent reserve on all trust-company deposits in the larger cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 per cent deposit credits in institutions approved by the Banking Superintendent ; companies in smaller localities to keep 15 per cent The two trust company presidents on the committee  --  both representing institutions doing an old-fashioned trustee business  --  disapprove the requirement of more than 15 per cent , holding that this , with the investment of their capital and the guarantee fund required by law , should be sufficient . A. S. Frissell of the Fifth Avenue Bank alone touches on the important question of separating trust deposits , subject to notice of withdrawal , from demand deposits subject to instantaneous recall . Against demand deposits in trust companies of New York city he advises exaction of the full 25 per cent cash on hand which is required of deposit banks Mr. Frissell is , we think , right , for the reason that the pure deposit business of a trust company ought to stand on exactly the footing of the deposits of ordinary banks If State and national banks in New York city need , as a safeguard to depositors , a cash reserve in hand of 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a trust company , needs the same . It is true that the State imposes on the trust companies requirements as to investment of capital and accumulation of a guarantee fund in the hands of the State , requirements to which deposit banks are not subjected . But these provisions were applied with a view to the simple trustee business . No reform , we are convinced , will settle the problem of trust companies , partly or wholly engaged in ordinary banking business , unless it strikes at the root , compels a distinction between the two branches of the business , sets up the rule by which deposit accounts shall be allotted to the one department or the other , and applies to the banking department the full requirements of ordinary deposit banks . CHANGES IN PERSIA . The silent struggle which has been in progress for nearly a year between Persia 's new Parliament and her new Shah gives signs of developing into open conflict Our news from Teheran has been meagre and spasmodic , yet that in itself is a tribute to the peaceful way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest Mohammedan nation in the world . Then , too , the tradition of the inhuman cruelty of the typical Oriental despot is shattered by the fact that neither the ruler who granted Persia 's Constitution nor his successor who has repeatedly promised to obey it , should have resorted to violent meas-ures The revolutionary movement received its impulse from the same cause that has set other Asiatic peoples into ferment  --  the Russo-Japanese war Behind that , however , was a long history of misgovernment and social oppression of a peculiarly iniquitous kind . The reign of Muzzafer-ed-din , the late Shah , which began in 1896 , was a period of unwonted extravagance He squandered the treasure accumulated by his father , and entered on a series of borrowings from Russia which resulted in the establishment of that Power as the paramount influence at Teheran The inhabitants of the provinces were subjected to the extortion of unscrupulous governors , whose relations to the court were still characterized by the free and easy responsibility of the ancient satraps . The important governorships were the recognized plunder of the various royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred young boys and girls as slaves in satisfaction of taxes imposed on their parents , was one of the powerful specific causes of the popular upheaval in northern Persia The khans , or large land-owners , practised their own system of robbery , which consisted in illegally manipulating the water supply so as to deprive the peasants of the necessary irrigation facilities and compel them to sell their land at a ruinous price Not the least anomalous feature of present conditions is that the clergy should have been the leaders of popular agitation Behind them , undoubtedly , was British influence In July , 1906 , occurred the dramatic secession of 16,000 citizens of Teheran who established themselves within the grounds of the British legation , while their leaders , the principal mollahs , or priests , took refuge in the sacred city of Kum . On August 5 Muzzafer-ed-din promised the convocation of a national assembly , which met in Teheran early in October and set to work upon a code of fundamental laws . The Shah signified his adherence to the Constitution on the death of his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on February 10 , when rumors of reactionary intrigues had aroused popular apprehension ; signed the instrument on October 11 , and took formal oath to it before Parliament on November 12 last . The reform move ment has swept over the court and the provinces Notoriously incompetent governors have been recalled , pensions and exorbitant salaries have been abolished , and Parliament has decreed the establishment of a national bank , founded on capital raised solely within the country , to which the entire adnunistration of the state finances should be delegated Foreign loans are absolutely pro-hibited That reform should have triumphed so completely proves , on the one hand , the utter unsoundness of the autocratic regime , and , on the other , a power of intelligent organization in the Persian people which we were loath to concede to an Asiatic race until after the battle of Mukden . Had the Shah had an army behind him , he might have held out against the aggressions of Parliament , but the soldiers have not been paid for two years As for the clergy , they constitute over three-fourths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the two great factors which , in Russia , for instance , have proved the salvation of the throne  --  the church and the army  --  there is little wonder that the Shah should have found himself so helpless . On the other hand , the reform party has revealed an astonishing capacity for organization Secret societies , pledged to the defence of the Constitution , flourish . There are seventy in Teheran alone , and it is a further remarkable feature of this debonair Persian revolution that , although these societies have been organized on the model of the secret associations which have played such a sanguinary part in the conflicts between Tartars and Armenians in Russian Transcaucasia , their course has been one of exemplary self-restraint , marred by a single incident  --  the assassination on August 31 of the Atabeg Azam , a notorious official whom the Shah had recalled from Europe and made Prime Minister . Just now , there is dissatisfaction with a Parliament that has sat for fourteen months and achieved , like every first Parliament , little practical result . The national bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet failed to supply the $30,000,000 fixed as its capital . In the provinces the people have been roused to a state of rebellion by rumors of reactionary cabals in the capital and by impatience with the work of Parliament , while governors of the old type and disgruntled royal princes have been dabbling in intrigue . Most important of all , perhaps , is the changed attitude on the part of the higher clergy . The two leading mollahs have been suspected for some time of carrying on negotiations with the court . They have been estranged from the revolutionary movement by such radical action , for instance , as the establishment , in the Constitution , of all other religions on an equal basis with Islam . Some persons have been unkind enough to say that our novels are inadequately manned for the same reason as our coastwise fortifications  --  because we do n't know how to raise the full complement The writers of to-day , they say , could not , if they tried , invent such various and curious and interesting figures as raise their heads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate fictitious personages in his mind an author can not afford to set one of these to opening gates or waiting on table or sitting about as bookkeeper or maiden aunt Consequently , these minor Parts are eliminated entirely , if possib'e , or if not , are filled by puppets without personality The modern novelist  --  we are again quoting his hostile critics  --  is a past master of the art of suppressing character 's who really ought to be in his stories , suppressing them because he has no flesh and bones to spare for them We should prefer to explain the condition in some way less humiliating than the confession that fancy is dead . Consider further analogies between the book and the drama Our recent fewcharactered novels are in many ways like the plays of our day Some of them , indeed , might be dramatized without the elimination of a single character But this is not all It has always been an accepted principle that the reader of a book could be trusted to do far more in carrying plot and action along than the auditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may let one character deceive another character , but never the spectator That personage , being none too clever to begin with , and having no chance to turn back to the previous chapter , or shut his eyes to think things over , would be in danger of losing the thread entirely The novel-reader used to be trusted more than that If an extraneous episode , a battle description , an historical disquisition , or a tale told by a character was put in between two chapters , the reader was expected to get through it without forgetting everything that had happened before It was assumed that he could tell the difference between Important and unimportant characters , and that he would not , like a small boy on an errand , be distracted by any amusing occurrence at the corner Thus , long after it was conceded by everybody that the playgoer was only a degree or two above the standard of admission to the idiot asylum , the novel-reader was still conceded a small element of common sense Can not a good many recent tendencies in popular fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regard their public as the makers of plays have long regarded their public 9 The assumption that the " psychological " novel necessarily calls for any special qualities in the reader is behind much nonsense that is uttered on this point As often as not , this type of novel is merely a device for letting the author talk about his characters , telling us how clever , or how deep , or how complex they are , as the case may be , instead of making them reveal themselves under the light of his genius In that case it demands less continuous attention , loses less by skipping , and yields less to really thoughtful perusal than almost any other form of literature Hence it is properly a compliment to English-speaking readers that book-men are wondering whether , after all , they might not be interested in something a little more complex We do not mean to say that the loss of the three-decker was altogether a calamity Scott himself would doubtless blue-pencil a new edition of his works But the breaking-down of the curious tradition that swashbuckling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed on plots as elementary as equilateral triangles is encouraging YEW SHAPES OF DISEASE The interval which always separates the purely intellectual acceptance of a scientific discovery and its real incorporation into the thought of daily life , seems to have been longer than usual in the case of those discoveries which have to do with the transmission of disease They are immensely valuable , of course Health authorities apply the new principles successfully in times of threatened epidemics , and laymen know , when they stop to think , what precautions will reduce the likelihood of catching , say , typhoid or pneumonia Some few sensitively-minded persons do try to reckon continuously and consistently with their bacillus-swarming environment But no such prophylactic measures have yet become instinctive , like those by which we protect ourselves against even some petty inconveniences Efforts are being made just now in many parts of the world to rouse the people to righteous wrath against certain of the creatures which science has shown to be persistent carriers of disease This is a test of how far the new theories have really " sunk in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterminating rage against some particular four-footed or six-footed species , it is to supplant the whole outfit of prejudices which make us constitutionally less afraid of the bringers of microbes than of more material adversaries not one-tenth as deadly One who would estimate accurately the difficulty of the task should make his researches , not in medical annals , but in those of art and letters We are not speaking now of the belief in pestilence as a divine chastisement , though that has held mankind for ages Disease has been variously incarnated by the imagination , but always as a figure of terriDec. 26 , 1907 Tile dignity It was the Wandering Jew who carried the cholera A cloud passed over the great city , and from it an awful hand was stretched forth to scatter the seeds of destruction ' The angel of Death spread his wings on the idiot , Lad breathed in the fate of the foe as he passed , Aid the form of the sleepoi W axed deadly and chill , And the heart but once heaved , and fines er grew still Poe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one ot the best specimens ot an extensive literature from which generations ot readers have unconsciously gained an idea of the semblance of disease The figure was tall and gaunt , and i-hi ?
