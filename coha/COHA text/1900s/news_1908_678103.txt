A quiver ran throughout the camp , and then the tents began to fall . Canvas was flapping in the wind , and the ' men went scurrying this way and that , dodging the tents and tent poles as they were uprooted and hurled along by the blast . Gen. Grant 's Tent Blown Away , It is estimated that the gale blew sixty miles an hour for a few minutes after it struck .

On the top of the Hogsback , a knoll which overlooks the entire encampment , and on which was pitched the tents of Gen. Frederick Dent Grant and his staff , the greatest damage was done . Gen. Grant 's tent was one of the first to go down before the wind . The General was in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the first blast struck . Before the General and the Major could spring out of the door the big A-shaped tent fell about their heads , and as they scrambled to free themselves from the canvas it was lifted by the wind and carried down the hill . The tents occupied by the military observers and the umpires were grouped around that of Gen. Grant . Every one of them was blown down and some of the observers narrowly escaped injury . Major . Charles E. Woodruff , Chief Sanitary Officer of the camp , was asleep In his tent on the Hogsbacal when the storm broke .
