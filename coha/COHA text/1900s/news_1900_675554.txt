txt It was learned in Mount Vernon last night that Cornelius L. Alvord , Jr. , the defaulting note teller of the First National Bank , was at his house in that city on Tuesday morning . This is the day that the . bank gave out the statement that the man was a defaulter , and four days after his defalcation was known to the bank officials . Pinkerton detectives had also been in the town for the same length pt time . The story was investigated by Chief of Police Foley of Mount Vernon , and his investigations led him to believe that the statements made were ' true . According to this story Alvord , who was then known as a defaulter only to the bank officials , the detectives , and his wife , reached his house at 1:00. on Tuesday morning and remained there until S o'clock . At that time his wife left the , house by the front door and drove to Pelham station , where she took the train - leaving at Seal for New York . Jacob Miller . Alvord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vernon station , he having been at Alvord 's house all of Tuesday night . Mr. Miller and Mrs. Alvord came to this city together . Alvord left his house by the rear entrance . and going past the stables , took a carriage that was there waiting for him , and was driven to Pelham . There he took the train that left for Stamford about the same time that the train bearing his wife left for New York . There all trace of Alvord is lost . Several stories were to the effect that he was in a sanitarium in Stamford , and that he went on later to Boston , but neither of these could be traced to any authentic source . Chief Foley is of the opinion that the movements of Alvord as given are authentic , and he says that the story is valuable as showing that although Pinkerton men ' were there they made no attempt to stop the defaulter and took no interest in his capture or detention . He thinks that the bank was entirely cognizant of their teller 's movements and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have him apprehentled$ as soon as they find it impossible to come to terms concerning restitution of the money which he filched from the bank . A well-known man in financial circles , ' who is a neighbor of the Alvords , and who has been a visitor at their house , gave expression to a similar opinion , which seems to be pretty generally shared in Mount Vernon . " V am firmly of the opinion that the bank ' knows where Alvord is , " said he . " I would not make this statement offhand , but my associations with his family and Intimate friends since the defalcation Mlable'ane. to make the statement as e fact .  - -  - reele- ei4e ; : wish to be drawn : into the Mat. - ter , but ' it might be just as well for the bank , - people and McClusky to know that there are a few people of intelligence who are not having the wool pulled ' Over their eyes by any such flimsy pretenses as they are making just now . It is enough to make I3ensible people sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It Is:the consensus of opinion , shared by the ? bank officers , that Alvord has most of the money he took from the bank salted away . Now , the first thing they would do Would be to try to get as much of it back his possible . They 've got Alvord , but he has covered his tracks so well that they have not the slightest idea where this ! Cache of bank funds is .. The result is that they hold the man and try to dicker with bim . " My firm belief is that the question has resolved itself into one where Alvord has Stated what he is willing to give up , and the bank has named the figure on which they are willing to let up . Each side hopes to . bring the other to terms , and in the meantime they offer a 55,000 reward for a man who they know can not be found , except they se will it ; they . get out a Federal warrant that can not be served except by a United States Marshal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . " Alvord 's peculation began by his taking enough money at first to help along his extravagant style of living . ' He knew that an occasional coup in the Street would enable him to fix matters up , and so he went on getting bolder at each stroke . On Tuesday he found it would be just as easy to take 54,000 as it had been to take 53.000 on Monday , and on Wednesday it was found to be just as easy to take 53.000 as it had been to take 54.000 the day before . I know he took one flyer in the Street and lost 840.000. and then he got wary . He found that he could not make good what he . had already taken . and he set deliberately to work to steal as large sums as possible , with the idea always in mind that if he was unable to get away he could make a dicker with the bank people when the crash came and still be a considerable amount to the good . Alvord does not want to start life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5100.000 or so would enable him to live in . comparative comfort for the rest of his life without special effort . " I believe that the major portion of the stolen funds now in Alvord 's possession Ala in hard cash . They have been trying  - -  for a week to find out where this money is , and they are as far from knowing today as when they started . Alvord . I understand , is taking matters coolly enough . Be knows that his arrest would end all chances - of the bank 's getting back any part of the half-million he has salted away . The bank knows it . to &.; The Directors stand between half a million and duty . and they wo n't revert to the latter until all hope of getting the former is out of the question . " " Do you know that Alvord wants to make reStitation ? " the banker was asked . " Would he not give up all he has to escape prisen ? " ? He will give up . but not all . He does not propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He knows the people he is dealing with . WHAT HE EXPECTS . " lie knows that when matters come ' to a final show-down the bank people will be satisfied to let him keep a couple of hundred thousands rather than put him in jail and be out the entire amount . In other words , he wants . to be paid for his work , and , you ' take my word for it , he will win out in the end . " Say that the bank was able to get back 5300,000 or $400,0U0 . What would be easier than for the Directors to make up the deficiency and then give it out that the defaulter had made complete restitution ; that he ' had been led astray through force of circumstances ; the old story of a man trying to keep pace with wealthy friends and all that sort of thing . Before this thing is through with they will have worked up a fine lot of sympathy for the ' poor fellow , ' something else will turn up to change the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become a back number . " Now , all that I have told you may be wrong , " said the banker with a smile , " but a Simple denial from the bank will not convince me or any number of Wall Street men that it is . If they want to prove that it is , why do n't they make a statement of how they are moving in the matter ? Let them tell the public why they have not done all of the obvious things they should have done . Would any sane man start to catch a thief the way these bank people are doing ? " Is it possible that if Alvord vas at large , with the newspapers of the country teeming with his description  --  a man as conspicuous as he is , 6 feet in height and weighing over 300 pounds , a mark in any community  --  that he would not be caught ? think not . And I am vain enough to believe that there are others who agree witr. me . " Mrs. Alvord left her home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of the family , who has the run of the house , it was learned that she had a consultation with an officer of the First National Bank . She returned to the house between 5 and 0 o'clock and remained at home thereafter . She is making preparations to leave the Mount Vernon house and win probably do so , to-day . One of the maids was given leave of absence yesterday . Mrs. Alvord , it is stated , will first go to stay a few days with some relatives in Bronxville , and later . join her children at Stockport-on-the-Hudson , the home of her husband 's brother . This would indicate that the negotiations between the defaulter and his former employers may take some day. ; longer . Chief of Police Foley said last night that the centre of interest in the case had been removed from Mount Vernon for the present , at least , and that if anything " came off " it would be in New York . Chief Foley will not or can not say just how he would or could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrest of the defaulter . He seemed much interested in the statement of the ' United States District Attorney that only a Marshal or Deputy Marshal could arrest the defaulter on a United States warrant , but declined to comment on it . He intimated , however , that if the District Attorney was correct he did not understand exactly what the value of the reward notice could be . Touching the rumor that Alvord is in a sanitarium , a special dispatch to Tan NEW YORK TIMES from Stamford received last night says : Alvord is evidently not in any sanitarium in Stamford . At all such institutions it was stated positively that he was not there , nor any one answering his descrip ? ? tion . At Grey Towers , a sanitarium in the northern part of the town , conducted by Dr. Frank Barnes , a man about 6 feet tall . and weighing over 230 pounds called Tuesday or Wednesday , Dr. Barnes does net remember which , . and asked for infermation regarding the place . He did not leave his name , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Stamford last Tuesday morning at Pelham . The conductor cannot- give much of a . description of him , other than that he was heavily built . He could have taken an . express for Boston at 9:51 o'clock . Two tickets for Boston were sold in Stamford Tuesday morning . Alvord could- not have been about town long or he ' Would- have . surely have been noticed for his size . " A rumor was persistently circulated about Police Headquarters last night that Alvord had been captured . The police deny all knowledge of such capture , and at a late hour nothing more definite than their denial could be learned . REWARD OFFERED FOR ALVORD . United States District Attorney Burnett Says the Case Is One for Federal Investigation . The following circular was issued last night at Police Headquarters and the Detective Bureau sent a copy of it to every official on its mail list in the United States and abroad : $5,000 REWARD !

The amount of ' the reward was set early in the afternoon at a conference between Chief Detective McClusky and officers of the First National Bank , who authorized its offer in writing . In addition to sending out the circular , Capt . McClusky telegraphed the substance of it to European cities and to several important points in the United States and Canada . " I started in , " said Capt . McClusky last night , " to find Alvord late yesterday afternoon , and the situation is what it was then , except for the circular . The case was accurately set forth in TEE NEw Yonx TIMES to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this big thief with a brass band , so I shall decline to answer any question bearing on what I or my men have done since the case was turned over to the police or in regard to the men I have assigned to it . It seems to me that the issuing of the circular sets at rest many stories that have been eurrenz . " " Will you speak of the stories of Alvord being seen at Mount Vernon this week , and especially on Thursday ? " ' All ' pipe ' dreams . " " It is said that Chief Foley of Mount Vernon was at Police Headquarters to -- day and saw you . Is there any truth in that ? " If he was here I did not see him or know of his visit . " " Has the attitude of the officers of the First National Bank toward the absconder changed ? " " Not one particle . It is as it appears in the statement published in THE TIMES . They want Alvord. and will not compromise his crime and are not negotiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankness when I talked with them to-day , and they were single-minded in regard to exerting every effort to bring Alvord to justice . They never had . I am convinced any clue to his whereabouts since he fled . " " Have you a picture of the absconder ? " " Not yet . I may have one . If I get it I will have it reproduced and send it everywhere . But I think that he should be picked up anywhere on the description in the circular . " " Alvord is reported to have been at his home at Mount Vernon on the morning of Oct. 19 , the day after he was last at the bank . Was that so ? " " That could not be . Detectives were there bright and early that Friday morning and did not find him .
