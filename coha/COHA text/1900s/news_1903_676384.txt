txt Ten years of suffering* , ten years of bearing another 's burdens , ten years of restitution for wrongs committed by the man for whom ho has been the scapegoat , have . not changed the loyalty of " John Brown " ? Moody Merrill  --  Charles F. Grayson , to the man for whom he has suffered expatriation and the obloquy which comes from the confession of guilt implied by flight . Tomorrow Merrill will be arraigned on the charge of embezzling $19,000 from Sarah Cohen of Boston , and it is believed he will remain silent and take what punishment the law may mete out to him rather than betray the identity of the individual he has shielded so long . ? Once High in Financial World . Ten years ago Merrill was a leading financier of Boston , handling in a confidential capacity money of many clients . One day , so his friends say , he discovered that a certain person , dearer to him than his own reputation , had abused his trust and the trust of his clients . Taking upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fled . In New Mexico he became a banker , became wealthy and respected . ' He began the work of restitution and sending money to Boston . When the last jot and title had been paid , he started for the land of his youth , arriving In New York last week . His arrest resulted from the good memory of an old acquaintance . Now the tragedy of the whole sad story appears : Hard Won Money Stolen . The money lie sent from New Mexico to make whole those wronged by the affair of ten years ago has not reached its destination . The police in Boston learned today that a large portion of the money he sent has been stolen . Not only have the persons who have acted as his agents converted the money to their own uses , but have worked on the fears of Merrill to keep him not only away from Boston , where he might learn the truth , but also to keep him sending along other large sums to them by representations that they were applying the money to old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cash Bail . Merrill was released today on M:000 cash bail , furnished by himself . lie declares he Las documents to show that he has liquidated his indebtedness . Mrs. Cohen , the complainant , arrived In New York tonight . Her son-In-law arrived this afternoon and endeavored to have a conference with Merrill , but the latter would not consent . lie wishes to have Mrs. Cohen appear in court , so that the case can be thrashedout .. at a hearing In this city-before action is taken to remove him to Boston for trial . Story of Grayson Career . The old man rerusea to say a worn or iris history , but a man who knows of his career said today : " When ' John Brown , 55 William street . New York , ' was taken into custody the New York police arrested one of the biggest financiers in New Mexico . Down in that country ' John Brown ' Is Charles F. Grayson , president of the Silver City National bank . The bank has a capital of $50,000. a surpluS of . $45,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Hanover National bank , and it has correspondents In St. Louis and Kansas City . It is one of the strongest banks in New Mexico , and Mr. Grayson has-been its president for more than ten years . ? " In the past Grayson has handled nearly $5,000,000 for various banks and bankers in New York , and every cent has been scrupulously accounted for . " This may seem no ex traordinary thing to the average banker , but . I mention it because this man for the time being is held up as a crook . If he was naturally dishonest he could in the country in which he has been living many years have gotten away with a good part of the millions he handled for New York accounts , and the New Yorkers could have whistled for the money . " But what is perhaps more interesting than anything else is the fact that Charles F. Grayson , the New Mexico banker , never tried to conceal the fact from his friends in New York or elsewhere he was in reality Moody Merrill , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say he has worn placards announcing the fact , but I have reason to believe that people in New York and Boston knew Grayson and Merrill to be one and the same . " I can see no harm in telling the incubus under which this man has lived , worked , and righted the wrongs done as Moody Merrill . Grayson is a bigger man in Boston than he is today in New Mexico . " Property was intrusted and money was given to him to invest . One day it came out that a. large part of this trust fund had been dissipated . Merrill was accused , but never lifted a finger to clear himself of the charge , but fled from the city , which in itself was a. confession of guilt . " Moody Merrill , lawyer , financier . street railway magnate , and once a candidate for mayor of Boston , was branded as a felon , an ( from that day to this never put In a defense and I believe he will put in none now , ever in save himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Some of his friends , however , knew the story behind Moody Merrill 's alleged defalcation . The man had a relative who was dear to him , whom he trusted . That relative made a misstep , and on trying to get to the straight road again helped himself to some money and property intrusted to Merrill . Money was borrowed , and thereafter it was the old . story . " When Merrill understood the situation he said , to all intents and purposes , ' I did and fled . Since then he has settled with the creditors as he could , and . I am told he has settled every one of the claims against him . including the one for $19,000 on which he was arrested here . " The money , as the story has been told to me , was sent to a representative of Sarah Cohen , and if the woman ' did not get it it is not Merrill 's fault Merrill long ago regretted that he ever assumed the name of Grayson , and often has said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again when he went to New Mexico and did what then seemed to be best . However great his mistake may have been , Charles P. Grayson has prospered in his new home and is highly esteemed there . " It may bo that some of the old man 's history may become court record at his hearing , but until then his lawyers , Wentworth , Lowenstein &; Stern refuse to make any statement regarding their client , and none of his friends in town  --  he appears to have many of standing and wealth in the financial cliff trl et  --  will say much about  --  htm.
