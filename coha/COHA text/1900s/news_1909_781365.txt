txt Gen. Bliss 's army of invasion landed here today , and to-night the troops from New York , New Jersey , the District of Coitl ? - bia , and the Tenth Regiment Cavalry ' are encamped on the outskirts of this city , rapidly preparing ' for the onward march to Boston that is scheduled to begin some time within the next twenty-four hours . Further north , in the vicinity of Bridgewater , in Plymouth County , the Blue Army , under Brig . Gen. William A. Pew , Jr. , of the Massachusetts Militia , is assembling , and to-night it is said that the defenders are ready and waiting to oppose the first hostile move on the part of the invaders . The Bliss forces have been somewhat delayed in beginning actual warfare by a combination of fog and the Providence ( ( R. I. ) police , the former of which held . up the troopships bearing the Second Brigade of Connecticut National Guardsmen , while the Providence peace preservers held up for seventeen hours , for vielatius the speed limit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other country . The train left Ardmore , Penn. , Thursday , and had been through Pennsylvania , New Jersey , New York , and Connecticut at an average speed of twenty miles an hour . The orders to the enlisted chauffeurs who were driving the cars instructed , them to be at New Bedford early this morning , so as to be ready to transport supplies and ammunition to the Red Army . Everything went well until yesterday as 3 P. M. The train headed by Auto No. 1 , in charge of Sergt. Elgin R. Davis of the Quartermaster 's Department , was just entering Providence when Motor Cycle Policeman Hall of that city rode out and told Davis that the speed limit was being violated , and that es a result every ear would be detained over night so as to give the chauffeurs a chance to plead their cases before a Providence Magistrate this morning . Davis pleaded in vain , trying to explain that he was obeying a War Department order , and that unless he was permitted to proceed endless confusion would surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning , and confusion did result . The Connecticut troops landed to-eight and were hustled off to the Acusimat concentration camps , where they will be assigned to their regular places in the line of attack . Brings Invading . Army 's Horses . The transport Boston , having on board the horses for the Invading army , most of them belonging to the crack Squadron A of Manhattan , was the first of the enemy 's fleet to reach New Bedford this morning . The Boston came in under the technical protection of the Gulick fleet . which is to support the land operations of General Bliss by sea , and was tied up before daylight at the Hamilton Street docks . Directly in the wake of the Boston came the transport Maine , which had on board Major Gen. Leonard Wood , commanding the Department of the Bast , U. S. A. , and his staff , and a number of other prominent officers of the regular army and the National Guard . It was after S o'clock when the next of the enemy 's vessels passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarding this artillery district , which was destroyed yesterday by the army transport Kilpatrick , which vessel . when she came in yesterday afternoon . was for a brief moment considered for war purposes a modern Dreadnought of the most powerful type , it being necessary to change the type of the vessel in order to make the investment of New Bedford possible , for as everybody knows no old army transport could ever silencethe great guns of Fort Rodman . The vessel that passed in after the Maine was the giant Sound liner Puritan , which had on board the Seventh Regiment of New York , the Fourteenth Regiment of Brooklyn , and a. part of the famous Essex troop of cavalrymen from ' New Jersey . Thousands See Troops Lend . When the Puritan , with Maningtater crack infantrymen came into the harbor the sea walls of New Bedford and of Fairhaven , across the Acushnet River , were lined with thousands of persons . It looked as if every man , woman , and child in Southern Massachusetts was in that great throng . It was the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this city has been packed with a gay . happy-go-lucky throng , all anxious to see the troops land and later pitch the camps in the Acushnet settlements to the north of the city , where Gen. Bliss has established his first line of attack . The voyage of the Puritan was a fine one from a speed standpoint , although a collision with another big Sound liner was narrowly avoided about 3 o'clock this morning . A dense fog blanketed the waters at the time , and the two vessels were within 100 yards of each other before the pilot of either vessel knew of the close proximity of the vessels , and it was only the most skillful of manoeuvring that prevented what might have been a serious setback for the Biles army , for the Seventh and Fourteenth Regiments are the right wing of the invading army . and to-night they occupy the most important position in the scheme of advance of any of the troops who are to participate in the battles that the Reds hope will result in the capitulation of Boston , Lieut . Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to Col. Appleton 's a , ssignment to brigade command , said after the Puritan arrived that the voyage had been a success from the standpoint oi discipline , and this , he said , applied not only to the men of his own command , but also to the soldiers from Brooklyn and Newark . No neater looking organizations ever landed from a transport than those of the New York and New Jersey commands . and among the 10,000 who saw them as they disembarked In perfect order from the Puritan there was not one who could truthfully pass an adverse criticism on any of them . Cpl . Heistands , Gen. Wood 's Adjutant General , said afterward that in all his career as a regular he had never seen a more perfect disembarkation deleted 8 lines The transport City of Brockton followed the Puritan Into the harbor , and as soon as the Puritan had discharged her men and cargo took her place alongside the Commercial docks . The Brockton had on board the Signal Corps detachments from Manhattan and the three artillery . commands from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . which made such a fine showing at the Pine Plains manoeuvres last Summer that its commander , Capt . O'Ryan , was suggested by one of the regular officers for a commission in the United States Army , was the first of the artillery organizations to come ashore . It was immediately followed by the Second and Third Batteries . Two hours'after the arrival of the Brockton toe artillery commands were galloping through the streets of New Bedford on their way to the centre of the Bliss line , near Aeushnet . It was about noon when the next troopship passed Fort Rodman . This vessel , was the chartered Fall River liner grim , that had on board Squadron A and a battalion of the Twenty-second Regiment of Engineers of Manhattan and the rest of the Essex Troop of New Jersey . The fame of Squadron A had preceded the command , and It is estimated that at least- 10,000 persons were packed around the Commercial docks when the Pilgrim tied up , so anxious was the populace to get a close view of New York 's crack cavalrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , for the place selected for the first camp of that organization was about fourteen miles distant from the city , at Rochester , near the headquarters of Major Gen. Wood . Cavalry Gallop Toward Acushnet . Major Bridgman , commanding Squadron A , has been designated to command all the cavalry in Bliss 's army , and as the horse troops are to do most of the scouting and reconnoitring work it was necessary that they reach their destination with the least possible delay . It required an hour to saddle , and then the call to mount was sounded , and a few minutes later the cavalrymen were galloping toward Acushnet on their way to Rochester , where they pitched camp later this afternoon . In addition to squadron A and the Essex troops , Major Bridgman has under his command in this " war " Troop A of Connecticut and a squadron of the famous Tenth Cavalry of the regular army . The transport Taunton followed the Pilgrim , but she did not have any great inumber of soldiers on board . Instead she had several hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army . The Taunton , it was said , ran out of water on the way , and the first thing the soldiers who came on this ship did when they reached New Bedford was to form bucket brigades to quench the , thirst of the suffering animals which were on board . While the Taunton was being discharged the regular army transports McClellan and Sumner , having on board Gen Harris and the District of Columbia troops , arrived in the river , but owing to the congested conditions of this river these vessels were ordered to disembark their troops at the Tack docks in Fairhaven . This was a great tiling for Fairhaven , which is a little city of homes , and so many soldiers were never before seen in that little hamlet . All Fairhaven turned out to see the soldiers , and as the " Washingtonians are a clean-cut , wellbehaved lot of young men the welcome extended them was as cordial as it was sincere . The men from the capital ' marched through Fairhaven from end to end , and then crossing into New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaker cemetery and took tip their positions near the eastern exereme of the Bliss forces . The arrival of the Sumner and McClellan left only one vessel unaccounted for , the Meade. which was erroneously reported as having arrived yesterday afternoon . C'n the Meade are two full regiments and a separate company of infantrymen of Connecticut under command of Col. Geddes , which organizations , tinder his ccmmand , will constitute the third brigade in the Red Army . As soon as the Meade arrives the Nutmeg soldiers will he hustled ashore and double quick Into Acushnet. where they will take up a position at the extreme eastern end of the Red Line of.attaele . Gen. Bliss Instructs Troops . All of the troops , it was said to-day , received instructions at sea last night front aa Gen. Bliss , in which the commanding General asked them to be careful to respect'the property and personal rights of people who live in the territory in which the battles of the next week are to , be fought . Gen. Bliss told them that the natives were all friendly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he was anxious they this ' friendship be retained . Should they violate that friendship in any way , Gen. Bliss is said to have told them that they would " never be forgiven . " By 3 o'clock this afternoon the scene of interest and activity had been transferred to Acushnet , where the troops were busy pitching camps and getting ready for the hard work that is to begin probably before daylight to-morrow morning . The different regiments and batteries began arriving at Lund 's Corner , the centre of the Acushnet district , about noon , and the scene there was one of the liveliest ever witnessed in this part of New England . The commands had gone there under sealed orders , and did not know until a few minutes before they reached their destinations where they were to camp For several miles along Acushnet Ave-nue and Parkin Hill Road , the two principal thoroughfares in that section , the soldiers were stretched in unbroken lines , the Seventh and the Fourteenth Regiments along the Parkin Hill Road , while their officers hurried about trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tents . This place was finally located near Hawes farm , a few hundred yards distant from one of the little lakes that go so far toward beautifying this part of Massachusetts . The Fourteenth 's camp was pitched to the west of the Seventh , the space between that command and the District of Columbia troops being reserved for the artillerymen , Who were to arrive a few hours later . Just tO the east of the Washington troops are encamped the Tenth Cavalrymen , while to the east of the negro troopers and forming an east wing of the invading line is the camp reserved for the Connecticut troops , provided they get to New Bedford before the next advance into the enemy 's territory begins . That the soldiers of both the Red and Blue Armies take the present exercises seriously there can be no doubt , and already-there had been created a spirit of friendly rivalry that augurs well for the success of the manoeuvres . Everybody from commanding Generals to privates is enthusiastic , and even the natives have taken the fever and are spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Impending struggle . Gen. ' Wood , who is the general observer of both armies , and whose position is absolutely impartial , said to-day that he a-as greatly pleased with everything so far and that there was every indication that the manoeuvres will prove among the most instructive ever held in this country . Orders Say Nothing of Sabbath . It is rumored that Gen. Bliss 's line will move forward to-morrow morning several miles and take tip a position somewhere between Sippecan Harbor on the west and Fall River on the east , but this can not be verified , and not even the troops of the invading army know where they will be encamped to-morrow night . The New England Sabbath is very sacred in these parts , and there are many officers who. believe that as a result the real fightin , will not begin until after midnight lton- , day morning . The orders : to the commanders of the two armies , however , say nothing about the Sabbath , and if they7 see fit there is no reason why the fight4i ing should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the positions Of the opposing troops last night . The invading Red army under Gen. Bliss was concentrated in and near Acushnet , three miles north of New Bedford , the line about eight miles long extending east and west with the centre at Acushnet . At the extreme right or west was the Second Brigade under Col , Daniel Appleton , consisting of the Seventh Regiment of Manhattan , Fourteenth of , Brooklyn , and the First Battalion of Engineers of Manhattan . To the east , of the Second Brigade , nearer Acushnet , were the First Battalion . Field Artillery , N. G. N. Y. ; First Field Battery of Washington , D. C. , and Battery A of Connecticut . To the east of Acushnet was the First Brigade with Brig . Gen. George H. Henries in command , consisting of the First and Second Regiments of regulars , the First Battalion of Washington , and a Connecticut company .

" and you can imagine how surprised we were at the - way the Providence police acted . We asked them to let us go on , and promised to stop by on our return for the court fight , but they would not ' igen to me , and so we had to stay- there until 1:9 o'clock this morning . Now we are n't under bail of $100 each to appear there for examination on Sent . 14 . A ' friend of the District AttorOeY went our ball . I do not know who he is , but he has one thanks . " The result of the hold-up of the auto truck train was that horses and wagons In New Bedford and Falr Haven had to be chartered by the Government this morning in order to get the supplies and ammunition for the troops to the front . The auto train came in shortly after noon . The Blue Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Plymouth County with Bridgewater as the centre , and its left and right wings resting on Norton and South Duxbury . The Blues so far have been wonderfully successful In keeping their movements a secret from the Red forces . There is a rumor to-night that Gen.
