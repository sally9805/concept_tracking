txt The tax list of the tenth year since eonsolidation affords material for a deoexile 's comparison of borough growth , the only possible clue to the city 's 4ut- I ure development . The January figures varied from the final tax roll by over I four hundred millions last year , as is the custom , but this is a relatively I small matter in a budget of billions , and cancels itself out taking one year i with another . Therefore , by adding the increases in assessed valuation announced yesterday to last year 's figures we have totals which we can compare with the first year of the consolidated city , as follows : ( In millions of dollars ; five figures omitted . ) Manhattan . Bronx . Brooklyn . ' 1,754,9 101,5 609.8 5,590,9 439,6 1,326,0 3,836,0 838,1 716.2 Queens . Richmond . 103,7 40,2 291,6 64,92 . 187,9 24,7 New York as a whole is as in- I comparable among American cities as Manhattan is among the constituent boroughs . It takes a half dozen cities to equal New York , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan . It is true that Manhattan 's 5 per cent . of growth this year is still larger than Brooklyn 's 14 per cent . or Queens 's ST per cent . Doubtless it is also true that this tendency must increase in the near future if New York City is to grow at all , but there are apparent limits . Wall Street 's growth will continue , but there can not be a I second financial district of equal value . The same is true of the day and night district which is developing itself north and south of Times Square . Thera will be more magnificent hotels in Manhattan for the accommodation of multitudes of transients , and many to the manner born , just as there will be a growth of the residential districts , both of flat dwellers and the =melon ? of the rich . Nevertheless it is not to be disguised that while the millions of New Yorkers who do business in Manhattan will continue to grow , they must seek roofs elsewhere , for the double reason that Manhattan can not shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirety afford to reside on Manhattan if they could find foothold there . It might be thought that Brooklyn would be theirI natural refuge , with all the tunnels and bridges which are so near use . But as matter of fact there are already 29 persons to each of Brooklyn 's acres , within its 77.62 square miles , and only 14 to each of the acres in the Bronx 's 40.65 square miles . An inspection of the valuations and rates of growth disclosed by the above table demonstrates that the boroughs ranking next to Manhattan are both too crowded and too costly for the comfortable accommodation of any such increase as New York must realize if It is to hold its own . Fortunately Queens offers ample accommodation . Its valuations are still moderate . And its area almost equals that of the three boroughs already discussed . There are only three persons to the acre within Queens 's 129.5 square miles , compared with the 140 square miles In the other three .               @ @ @ @ @ @
