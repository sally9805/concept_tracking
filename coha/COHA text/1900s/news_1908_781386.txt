Mr. Havemeyer said last I night that all of the Morse loans had been cleaned up but'one . He would not say how much that represented . When the Clearing House Committee decided last October to stand by the bank on condition that C. W.

This action of the Board of Directors was not taken because they considered the bank insolvent , but on account of the difficulty of realizing on the assets of the bank rapidly enough to meet the heavy demands of depositors in the last few days and probable further large withdrawals feared . The receiver will proceed at Mice with the liquidation of the bank and the payment of its creditors . It is estimated that all depositors will be paid in full . " Following is a statement of the condition of the bank at the close of business on Saturday , Jan. 25 , 1908 : deleted table Thought Bank Would Pull Through , " Of course , " said Mr. Itidgely in giving out his statement , " I had all along kept posted as to the hard struggle that the bank was having since the panic , but I had hoped and rather believed that the bank would be able to pull through .

Par Expected for Stock . President Havemeyer in an earlier statement dwelt more specifically on the causes of the bank 's troubles . In speaking of the institution 's solvency he expressed the opinion that with careful liquidation the stockholders as well as the depositors would be taken care of , the stockholders receiving par for their stock . Mr. Havemeyer 's statement said : " The Directors of the National Bank of North America have decided to request the Controller of the Currency to assume charge of the affairs of the bank . There had been persistent rumors afloat for the , last ten days that the bank would be obliged to liquidate or else go Into the hands of a receiver . These rumors , corning from apparently unknown sources , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have resulted in a slow and continuous drain on our re-sources . " On Saturday there was a still heavier withdrawal of funds , indicating that on Monday the demand would be increased so that we would not have enough cash in our vaults to meet it . As the committee of the Clearing House announced Its Intention to issue no more Clearing House certificates , the Directors thought It advisable to request the Controller to put some one in charge , at least temporarily , so that all our depositors would be I treated alike . Deposita Now $3,000,000 . " I accepted the Presidency of the bank I temporarily , with reluctance , at the urgent request of prominent financiers last October , at the time when Mr. Charles W. Morse retired as Vice President During the panto the bank lost over ten millions in deposits . Its deposits now amount to a little over three millions . " I had hoped to get back a large number of our depositors and so rehabilitate the bank , but the state of our cash reserve and the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have returned to us put it out of our power to offer them a sufficient reason for resuming banking relations with us , " In my opinion the bank is perfectly solvent , and there is every indication that the stockholders will receive par for their stock with a careful and conservative liquidator . Clearing House Did Not Press it Although President Haveraoyer was particular to emphasize the fact that the Clearing House Committee had hot pressed for the payment of the outstanding indebtedness of the National Bank of North America , but had only refused t allow It to be Increased , the Clearing House Committee , through Chairman William A. Nash , reiterated the denial and made It include all of the debtor banks , in a formal statement . Chairman Nash 's statement was made to announce the withdrawal of the bank from the Clearing House Association , with the consequence that the exchanges with the bank will not be made at the Clearing House this morning . It read : The National sank of North America has ' decided to withdraw from membership in the Clearing House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Controller of the Currency . This statement Of , the bank is regarded as the simplest , method of liquidating . The exchanges with the bank will not be made at the Clearing House to-morrow morning . While the Clearing House committee re-garde the growing surpluses and improved conditions of the banks as highly favorable to a complete retirement of the loan certificates , the statement in the morning papers that the banks are being forced to retire them has no foundation in fact . " The Bank 's Directorate . The vacancy caused by the retirement of C. Morse from the Directorate of the National Bank of North America was never filled .
