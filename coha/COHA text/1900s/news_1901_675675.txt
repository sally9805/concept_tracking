txt Charles F. Jones , Millionaire William Marsh Rice 's nurse , valet , and secretary , yesterday gave a strange turn to the examination of Albert T. Patrick , charged with Rice 's murder . In a calm and emotionless , yet graphic , manner he told on the witness stand how he himself , at Patrick 's instigation , placed - the fatal chloroformed sponge on the octogenarian 's face and snuffed out the feeble flame of his life . In a confession made to Assistant District Attorney Osborne shortly after his imprisonment in the Tombs , Jones , according to portions made public , accused Patrick of the murder . He then endeavored to take his life by cutting his throat . Patrick hid his face behind his counsel 's chair during Jones 's accusing recital . He scribbled incessantly . The spectators crowded into the narrow courtroom listened breathlessly . Patrick 's lawyers , Moore &; Cantwell and Frederick B. House , sat silent . Meyers and Short , who are charged , with Patrick , with forging the will and general assignments transferring all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one side of the room . Mrs. Short , with anxious eyes , sat close to her accused husband . Jones recited in detail how he and Patrick had plotted for months to kill the old man and gain possession of his property . Patrick , he said , was the moving spirit in the conspiracy . Meyers and Short had simply been his tool . Without a tremor the selfcenfessed murderer related how , at Patrick 's order , he gave to the failing invalid oxalic acid , soda , sapolio , mercury , and other things in an endeavor to break down his health . Despite all this , however , the old man grew better . He cautiously compelled Jones to taste of the medicines before he would touch them . His health continued good until one day , at the advice of a woman friend , he partook of four baked and five raw bananas . These brought on a severe illness and wehld perhaps have proved fatal , but , said Jones , Patrick , not satisfied with the rapidity with which the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with at once . " I 've got two small children to take care of , " he said , according to Jones . " You 've got to do it . Take a sponge saturated with chloroform , place it in a cone-shaped towel , and hold it over his face for half an hour . " " I did as he told me , " continued Jones . simply . " Mr. Rice was sleeping . I placed the towel over his face . He laughed from its effects . Then I ran out of the room . " When he returned his benefactor was ' dead . Jones 's original confession " stated that Patrick had held . the towel over the irt7 valid's* fade . arid ' that he ? ( Jones ) had- seen the deed from the door . Eight million dollars in cash . securities , and real estate was the stake in this darz nig scheme , which came so near being successful . MRS . FRANCIS TESTIFIES AGAIN . Mrs. Addle M. Francis was the first witness called to the stand when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick had never told her he was the old Texan 's lawyer . More important than this - was her testimony that when Patrick left her house on the Sunday night Rice died , he carried no bag or hand ' satchel . Later , said she , she saw a strange valise in the house . Jones swore yesterday that after Patrick had come in response to his message that the old man had passed away , they looted the latter 's trunks and desk , and that in Rice 's valise Patrick placed all his valuable papers , his two gold watches . $450 in bills , and a number of letters , and carried it away with him . Patrick winced and hung his head still lower during this testimony . Mr. Osborne 's desire to send a detective after Patrick 's medicine chestand letters he had written Mrs. Francis while in the Tombs provoked a stormy debate between him and Lawyers Moore and House . Mr. Osborne said he would send Detective Carey after the chest . Mr. Moore protested strenuously . He said that he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped to his feet and said he would go to the house and take charge himself . Justice Jerome settled the matter by declaring that he would commit any one to the Tombs who interfered with the medicine chest . Assistant District Attorney O'Connor and Lawyer Dalberg were sent after the chest and brought it down . It contained eighty-one bottles . A package of letters was also turned over to Mr. Osborne . Then Jones took the stand . He met Patrick in October , 1899 . Patrick called to see Mr. Rice , who had gone to bed . Patrick said his name was Smith . He called again , and Rice was again in bed . He talked with Jones about the suit of Mrs. Rice 's heirs against Mr. Rice , which was represented in Texas by 0 . T. Holt . Patrick said Holt would surely win the , suit . Holt 's side , said he , needed a letter from Rice to the effect that Baker had misrepresented the case to him . He dictated a letter , and Jones copied it He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter it was returned with instructions to rewrite it . Jones did so . Patrick said he was to get $10,000 if he won the suit . As the $250 promised was not forthcoming Jones did not give up his last copy . Shortly after . the subject of a will was broached . Patrick tempted Jones with an offer to place him at the Young Men 's Christian Association , where he could receive Lrtstruotion with a view to studying law . Jones , showed Patrick the genuine will , made in 1896 , which W. Wetherbee and W. Harmon of Brooklyn had witnessed . Patrick . bad Jones copy a draft of a will , saying he would look out for the witnesses . In December he told Jones to approach Wetherbee in regard to witnessing the new will . Wetherbee rejected the proposition indignantly . Jones insisted that he should be made a beneficiary in this will . Patrick objected . He then said Jones might have half of what was secured . He would n't put this-promise in writing , saying it would be like signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Meyers to witness the will . This was done in August . Meyers demurred - at signing the will at first , saying . he would like to be sure it was Rice s handwriting . Jones mailed empty envelopes to Patrick and personally took him letters he had written , purporting to ' have come from Rice on the will matter , and other important matters . Jones was then taken sick and was sent to the Presbyterian Hospital . Dr. Curryattended him . . He returned home on April 22 He Said Short and Meyer never saw Rice sign the will , as they swore they did . Both were at Rice 's apartment on June 30. the date of the " Patrick will . " He also asserted that Patrick never did any legal work for Rice . In August Patrick drafted four transfers to himself of all Rice 's personal and real property . Jones wrote them , on the typewriter . Patrick ar.ranged about the . signatures . Patrick said he did - not mean to nee the transfers except to , force the heirs to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . who was growing paler as he warmed to his narrative , now reached ' the dramatic part of his recital and- began the story of . how the plot to shorten the . old man 's life was evolved and put into execution . He saidr - - ' One day Patrick said to me that ' Rice was living fonger than was well for our in -- terests . He asked if there was any way to get him out of the way . I thought he was joking , and said , ' Only with a Gatling gun . ' He assured me he was in earnest , and I said I thought he wanted Dr. Curry to attend to that part of it . He said Dr. Curry would not do anything like that , even if it were broached to him . " He said that if I would let him know some time when Rice wits sleeping he would come up and put him but of the way . I told him this would be hard to do , as Mr. Rice was a light sleeper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some laudanum . I did n't . I told him I could get some from a Presbyterian Hospital nurse . I did n't dQ this , though ; but sent to my beother in Texas for it . I got two tcs o-ounce bottles , one of chloroform and one of laudanum . " Three weeks before Rice 's death I gave the laudanum and chloroform to Patrick . Rice never saw Patrick but once . This was when Patrick called on me one Sunday night . Rice looked in the parlor and saw him and asked who he was the next day . Rice sighed no general assignment on , Sept. 7 . " ( Meyers and Short swore they witnessed an assignment to Patrick of all Rice 's property on this date . ) He was cooking his lunch when Short and Meyers came . After I wrote the assignments Patrick said I had made some errors and that Meyers would rewrite them . Rice never signed them . He signed no papers on Sept. 21 that either Meyers or Short witnessed : He was in no condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO GIVE HIM SAPOLIO . " Soon after I sent for the chloroform Patrick asked if I had done anything about going to Coney Island for the laudanum . I said no . He said if I gave Rice sapolio it would weaken him and break him down . Then he said give him soda . I told him Mr. Rice was very careful what he took , and that I had to take some first myself before he would touch it . Then he . asked if I had any mercury . I said I had some mercurial pills which Dr. Curry had prescribed for me . I took some ' before Rice and left them on his table . He took some of them , and it brought on diarrhea . He took them with some other pills he was taking for deafness . He seemed to improve after this instead of getting worse . " Patrick gave me some yellowish looking pellets that he said he had been taking . He said each pellet contained about a grain of mercury . I took one . Rice took two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break Rice 's health and cause his death . Patrick also said to me to give him calomel . Rice took some and some more pills . He would take anything I took . He took some powders also that were made for him in Texas . He continued taking these up to a week before his death . " At this time Mrs. Van Alstyne of Jersey City recommended bananas . baked and raw , for indigestion. -I bought a dozen . Mr. Rice ate five baked and four raw on Tuesday before his death . They made him sick and he got worse and worse . He took some more pills . Dr. Curry came every day up to Tuesday before death . Patrick said it would be a good idea to create the impression that Rice committed suicide . When I went out to report to Patrick I locked the door and threw the key into the room to give the idea that I had been locked out . Saturday afternoon Patrick said , ' Get Dr. Curry to come down . ' " Jones had now reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder was done . " Maria Scott , the colored woman who cleans up , came in , " said the valet . " Mr. Rice got up and talked foolishly . He wanted the colored woman to hold his hand . He said he was nervous . Dr. Curry called at 10 o'clock . Rice would n't see him . He put us both out of the room ? said we wanted to kill him . Dr. Curry went away . Soon after , Rice asked why he had n't been to see him . I said he had , but Rice would n't believe me . Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter of Dunellen , N. J. , came . Mr. Rice walked up and down the hall . He was very ' weak and could scarcely stand . He shook . hands with Mr. . and Mrs. Carpenter every ; time . he passed the room where they were Then ' he fell asleep in a chair and I went to see Patrick . He told me to let him know if the old man got Weaker . - He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's '  - -  Christian Association . Dr. Curry came and said , not . to be surprised if the worst happened . I went to Patrick 's house in the evening . Rice was still sleeping in the chair . I put him to bed when I came back . He would n't stay . About 12 or 1 he was up pulling at the gas jet and the bed . I ' gave him two powders prepared in Texas  --  they looked like snow  --  and he went to sleep . do n't know what the powders were . " PLOTTING THE MURDER . Jones now began his story of the occurrences of the fateful day , wh  --  se end saw him a murderer . " I went to see Patrick early on Sunday morning , " he said . " He said he would go down town and get some oxalic acid , which I Should dissolve in twenty parts of water and give Rice . Mr. Rice had n't gotten up all day . Dr. Curry came and said he was getting along very well . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Patrick said it was a vegetable poison and would paralyze the heart . Cremation , he said , would destroy all traced . I diluted it , and Rice took about two spoonsful of it . He did n't like it , and asked if I would take it if I was him . I said no . I knew he would n't take it if I said take it . Then I lay down to rest . Thi.s was in the afternoon . I put him to bed once or twice . About 5 o'clock he went to sleep . " After writing a telegram to a young , lady , I went to dinner . I met Patrick at Fifty-sixth Street and Sixth Avenue . He walked with me to Fifty-fifth Street and Madison Avenue . We stood on the corner . Patrick showed me a bottle of chloroform . He had it in his pocket . He said he was a man of family , with two children to look after , and that I must do it . Rice had poisoned his wife , or caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be any harm to put him ' out of the way . ' It will not do for him to be alive Monday , ' he said . ' as a draft is corning due . ' " I was afraid to do it . I refused . Then he persuaded me . He said all the property was in his name , and that would be adduced as a motive if murder was done . He told me to fold a towel in a cone shape , put a sponge saturated with chloroform in it , and hold it over Mr. Rice 's face for half an hour . He would probably laugh , he said , but that would only be the effects of the chloroform . " I did just as he told me . I got the towel and sponge , made the towel into a cone shape , and saturated the sponge with chloroform . I tried it on my own face and got a strong effect . Then I put it over Mr. Rice 's face and ran out . I walked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bell . I did n't let them in , and they went away . In about half an hour . went back and raised the windows and threw the sponge and towel in , the range . They burned as if they had oil on them . I poured the remaining acid out the window . " Then I telephoned to Patrick that Rice was very low . He came with Dr. Curry . I had straightened things up as best I could . Dr. Curry asked how Rice was . I said he was dead . ' Dead ! ' said Patrick . ' My God ! this is the worst thing that could happen to me , Dr. Curry . Rice was to come dawn to-morrow to my office to settle business matters of great importance . I dora know what I can do now . ' Dr. Curry examined the body very closely . Patrick , asked . if Mr. Rice 's death did n't leave me in a very bad fix . This had beer : arranged beforehand . I said it did , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and asked Dr. Curry to give me a letter . He said he would . r then went for an undertaker . ' " After- Dr. Curry andshhe undertaker had gone Patrick and I Opened Rice 's two trunks and took , out all the valuable papers , $450 .. in bills , and $9 in silver . Patrick ' put the bills in his pocket . I put the silver in Mr. Rice 's ' valise : ? We opened his desk then- and took all the papers . Patrick then took his two gold watches and said he was ? going home . This was at 1:30 or 2 o'clock on Monday morning . " Jones , who had grown deathly pale . paused , and the spectators stirred noisily . Questioned by- Mr. Osborne , Jones said Patrick had first mentioned cremation in July or August. - Patrick came up to Rice 's house at 8 o'clock the day after the murder and gave him some signed checks to fill ( ) ht .
