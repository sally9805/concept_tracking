txt Notwithstanding the spectacular character of the raids on the luxurious gambling palaces of Frank Farrell and Richard A. Canfield on Monday night . the net result was found to be of more of a moral than a material character . The evidence obtained by the raids was inconsequential , and it was said that the prisoners held in court very likely will escape prosecution . It is possible that even the gambling paraphernalia confiscated by the police may be returned to its owners . But , in the opinion of District Attorney Jerome , the moral effect of the three raids will be very great . The raid upon Lou Ludlam 's place is considered as important , even though the reputation of the establishment was not nearly so great as that of Canfield 's or Farrell 's . All three of those places had been considered absolutely immune from police interference . Canfield himself , who , according to Pat Sheedy , is the only man in America entitled to the reputation of a real gambler , left this city yesterday morning . He had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his place at 5 East Fortyfourth Street was raided on Monday night . At Farrell 's place . 33 West Thirty-third Street , a policeman remained on guard until late in the afternoon . E. W. Burbridge , who says the house is his private residence , went in and out and manifested his anger and disgust to the acquaintances he encountered on the street . Late in the afternoon District Attorney Jerome , Capt . Walsh . and ex-Assistant District Attorney Daniel F. O'Reilly went to the establishment and opened a safe which had remained in the policeman 's custody . The safe contained nothing , however , except a few gambling appliances and a blank check book . No evidence as to the real proprietorship of the establishment was obtained . District Attorney Jerome and his corps of assistants remained longer at Ludlam 's place , at 145 West Fortieth Street , than at any of the other establishments . There they forced open a safe and had searched the house from the cellar to the roof . Mr. Jerome himself wielded the sledge hammer with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a quantity of men 's jewelry  --  such as might have been hypothecated in the place . There were also about half a dozen packs of cards . None of the raiders appeared at their offices until about 11 o'clock in the morning . District Attorney Jerome was asked his opinion of the results of the raids . He said : " I am eminently pleased at what has been accomplished . We have established two very important facts by them . The first is that these places are not so exclusive after all , for my detective . Joseph Jacobs , by paying $10 to a Tenderloin tout , was able to effect entrance to both Canfield 's and Farrell 's . These two establishments have touts rambling about the Tenderloin just like the cheaper places , and we see that they look after the man with a few dollars to lose-dust as they do after those with many . " The second important fact is the proving-that these places are not immune . For years Canfield 's place has had a sort of halo attached to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be secured . Men of wealth and social standing went there believing that they were absolutely safe . We have demonstrated that any one going to even Canfield 's or Farrell 's does so now at his peril . This is likely to have a most powerful effect . " The District Attorney said he left Canfield 's private papers alone because his search warrant called only for gambling paraphernalia . Mr. Jerome expressed the idea that the places had undoubtedly been ? ' tipped off , " though he would make no Sirect accusations against any tipsters . PRECAUTIONS AGAINST A TIP . " Possibly my having gone away last week had served as a sort of warning , " said the District Attorney . " These people may have thought I was not really away at all , but was up to something . I took every precaution possible to prevent a tip going out . Capt . Lantry was not notified because I thought it best to take as few people as possible into my confidence . My action meant no reflection upon Capt . Lan try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canfield , because he had no evidence against him . Neither would the " King of Gamblers " be called before the Grand Jury , for the reason that if he should testify against himself all prosecution of him would be prevented . Detective Jacobs had been unable to obtain any evidence against Canfield . His playing was with qucklin , whom he described as the ? dealer . " " The efforts of Detective Jacobs. " continued Mr. Jerome , " show perfectly well that a detective can get into a gambling house if he goes about it in the proper way . It all shows that a detective force that is worth a cent could get evidence against these places if it really wanted to . A detective bureau is under just as great obligations to seek out cases of gambling as of burglary . Both are felonies , and detectives have no right to choose the kinds of crimes they wilt operate against . " " Does this mean that you are not an admirer of Capt . Titus ? " was asked . " By no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing against Titus , but if a man from Washington State , unfamiliar with this city , who has never done any detective work . can jump in all alone and get the amount of evidence Jacobs has accumulated , the detective force of this city should be able to do something . In six weeks we have secured conclusive evidence against four of the most exclusive gambling houses In New York . " The attention of the District Attorney was called to a statement he was quoted as having made some months ago to the . effect that he would give $5,000 to get a man into Canfield 's place . He said he did not think he had put it that way . What he meant was that he thought it would probably cost 55.000 to get a man in there ; but that it had been done for less than $100 had removed many of his illusions concerning this famous American Monte Carlo . " Will these raids affect gambling houses in the future ' ? " the District Attorney was asked . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you have the gambling situation in hand now better than at any time before ? " " I have nothing to do with controlling the gambling situation . It is up to the police . " Well , do you think the police are in better control than ever before ? " " No , I think they are in a very much worse condition than ever before . " Some question was raised yesterday as to the legality of smashing open the windows of Canfield 's place before first demanding peaceable admission . Mr. Jerome said that he thought the law was that admission should be demanded first . though the police were often morally justified in smashing things , and ft was not very likely that any complainant against them would appear . Mr , Jerome expressed astonishment at the elegance of the Farrell establishment . The report had been generaly circulated that the equipment of the house was cheap and gaudy . The District Attorney said that the first thing to attract attention was the magnificent staircase leading to the second floor . It is chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimmings . and cost not less than $25,000 . In one room is a hardwood door of Spanish handiwork . It was a door of a private apartment in a Castilian palace , and bears a date of the sixteenth century . It is said to have cost not less than $20,000 . JUST STOPPED GAMBLING . According to Detective Jacobs , gambling had been actually in progress in both the Farrell and Ludlam places on the evening of the raids . The District Attorney was asked yesterday if there had been any gambling in Canfield 's place on Monday night . " Not within two hours of the time we reached there . " he said with a smile . Canfield himself volunteered the information on Monday night that there had been no gambling in his place for months . John Delahunty . Canfield 's attorney , who was w on hand hen the raiders arrived , said yesterday that the Canfield raid was such a blunder on the part of the police as to amount almost to a crime . " In addition to the raid being fruitless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was illegal . Entrance should have been effected to the house through a door , and not a window . Mr. Canfield would have been perfectly justified in shooting at the men who invaded his home through a window . No one applied for admission to the front door . There was no knock , no ringing of the bell . At the time the door was smashed there was a servant within four feet of the door . " " Does Mr. Canfield expect to take action against the raiders ? " it was inquired . ' Well , I do not know about that as yet . Under the code we are entitled to recover three times the value of the property destroyed . " Mr. Delahunty said that it was not true that the place had been " tipped off , " or that Jacobs had ever been in the place . The lawyer laughed at the suggestion that the Western detective had ever been there . Deputy Commissioner Piper , when he arrived at Police Headquarters yesterday morning , said that he believed the raids had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , ? ' that the places expected such an attack as they received , but they merely anticipated a police inspection . ' I think the raid was a great success , especially on Canfield 's . We wanted to get some paraphernalia , and we got it . " Yesterday was a day of reckoning in the police courts for the various raids of the night before . David B. Bucklin of Canfield 's place and Samuel G. Smith and a Mr. , said to be Robert Farrell , a brother of Frank Farrell , were arraigned in the Court of Special Sessions before Justice Wyatt , sitting in chambers as a committing Magistrate . Ex-Assistant District Attorney Forbes J. Hennessy represented Bucklin , and ex-Assistant District Attorney Daniel F. O'Reilly represented the men from Farrell 's . Justice Wyatt held Smith and Bucklin in $1,000 bail each for examination at 2 o'clock Wednesday . was discharged for lack of evidence . The six prisoners arrested in the raids on Mulberry Street Monday night were arraigned before Justice Holbrook , in the Court of Special Sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bernhardt Smith , proprietor of the Ontario Hotel . at One Hundred and Twentyninth Street and Eighth Avenue , and six women and two men who had been found in his place , were arraigned before Magistrate Mayo , but they were discharged . The Chinaman , Dan Fing. arrested in the other Harlem raid , was held in $500 bail . INSPECTOR GRANT ACCUSED . With Capt . Stephenson Must Face Charges Growing Out of District Attorney Jerome 's Raids . . - Following the Monday night raids in the precinct of Capt . John T. Stephenson of the Mulberry Street Station , District Attorney Jerome yesterday filed charges with Police Commissioner Partridge , not only against Capt . Stephenson himself , but also against Inspector Donald Grant , in command of the Second Inspection District . That action by the District Attorney is said to be only the forerunner of an extensive movement against delinquent police officials . The charges against Stephenson and Grant are for neglect of duty in failing to suppress disorderly houses , failure to make proper reports of their existence to Police Headquarters , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detrimental to the public welfare , and disobedience of orders . Assistant District Attorney George Wilson Morgan , who has been busy preparing police charges for the last two or three weeks , said last night : " Capt . Stephenson and Inspector Grant are brothers-in-law . About the middle of last August , when Inspector Grant succeeded Inspector Brooks in the Second District , Senior Inspector Cortright called both these officials before him . He informed them that the precinct of Capt . Stephenson was full of disorderly houses and joints where liquor was being sold without a license . Capt . Stephenson vehemently denied that any such places existed within his precinct . Inspector Cortright then gave him the addresses of a great number of the joints , telling him to close them at once . After a while reports were received from both the Captain and the Inspector in which they said that they had failed to find any evidence of wrongdoing at the places mentioned . " Inspector Cortright sent some of his Own men into the precinct of Capt . Stephenson , and they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported the matter to this office , and we sent our own men to co-operate with the men of Inspector Cortright . On this evidence we made the raids last night , and there is a vast amount of evidence on which we have not as yet acted at all . " Capt . Stephenson has been known in the department as " Peaches " ever since it was brought out during the Lexow investigation that he had accepted four baskets of that fruit from Martin N. Edwards , a produce dealer , of 153 Duane Street . for permitting him to violate the ordinance against blocking the sidewalk in front of his premises . On Dec. 12 , 1804 , Stephenson was convicted of this offense and sentenced to three years in State Prison and a fine of $1,000 , Later he got a reversal from the higher courts and was reinstated as a police official .
