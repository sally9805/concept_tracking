txt The reduction of letter postage between the United States and Great Britain to one penny or 2 cents an ounce has been a long while coining . The reduction of the rate to a penny has often been urged since the era of postal reform . under Sir Rownioro HILL . ELIHU BURRITT , the " learned blacksmith , " argued eloquently in favor of penny ocean postage , both here and in England , in the forties of the last century , before Sir ROWLAND 'S reforms were fairly established , with the zeal of a premature Henniker Heaton . Mr. HEATON has been the most energetic advocate of the penny rate in recent years , but he has been ably supported by prominent men on both sides of-the Atlantic . Clearly , cheap letter postage is an important factor in the development of international friendship , the strengthening of existing ties , even in the spread of culture . But the argument against it , since long before the establishment of cheap Continental postage , and the introduction of adhesive stamps , has been that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the early history of our own Post Office Department there was always a faction demanding the , increase of postage . Each reduction has been made in spite of strong opposition . Yet statistics show that with each reduction the number of letters mailed has greatly increased . After next October , when a letter may be sent from any part of the United States to any part of Great Britain for 2 cents , doubtless the ocean malls between the two countries will more than double in volume . The penny ocean rate will surely encourage our merchants to enlarge their British correspondence , while private letters will also greatly increase in number . The 2-cent rate is likely to be extended before long to letters for other foreign countries . The result will be worth watching , especially by the cable companies . A cheaper rate for ocean cables is as much needed as cheaper international postage . We have no doubt that the profits of the companies would be largely increased if the-prevailing cable rate were reduced one-half . Quick and cheap communication is a growing necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the postal authorities .
