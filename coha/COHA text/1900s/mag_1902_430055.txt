THE public school is largely a selfgoverning community , typical of the larger community of men and women , which is also self-governing . There must be in each of these two communities law , order and subordination of self . The one prepares for the other . The public school in its related life of individuals educates for the complex duties of citizenship as a school with small numbers can not do . When Froebel was asked to teach the son of the king , he replied : " You can not educate a child alone . " Numbers of children associated in public school life compel subordination of self , respect for the rights of others , admiration for the ability of others , self-reliance , self-denial ? all of which are lessons in making firm , solid , enduring character . All pupils enter the public schools as equals and are treated as equals . All are equal before the school law , as in adult life all are equal before the common or statutory law . In the same school there may be children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud and the humble , yet no distinction is known except that of worth or ability . Any distinction of birth or fortune in a school , an institution preparing for citizenship , is essentially unsound in principle , unjust in application and contrary to American ideals . Equality of opportunity is the basic principle of those ideals . THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE The free public school represents as no other institution can this democratic principle . It stands for the American ideal . It promotes understanding between various classes of people who have social , political , religious and financial differences . The child of the millionaire respects the character or worth of the child of the artisan or mechanic . More than one misunderstanding between men occupying different positions in life has been averted because they sat side by side twenty years before in the same school , where each learned to respect the other and came to know him as a good fellow . If the private school as commonly carried on were the prevailing school , then democratic government and the social structure would be hard if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in private schools ? Often they are the- sons and daughters of the wealthy or of those whose social standing is not the average . The distinction which sets off some children into private schools and others into public schools is likely to sow the seeds of snobbery on the one hand and discontent on the other . It is not the distinction of merit or promise but that of accident of birth or fortune . The pupils in many private schools regard themselves as a class , as a caste , or as a stratum of society . Walter Page relates the following incident in his private school life : " I recall a scene more ludicrous than any in Dickens when a thirteen-years-old companion of mine came to my room one day , shut the door and fell on the bed and weptbecause his father was not a colonel . I tried to comfort him by telling him that my father was not a colonel either . So far from consoling him , this information only gave him the less respect for me . " When or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth or family and educated with schoolmates from similar homes get that understanding of others , that sympathetic insight necessary in city life , unless he or she gets it in the common school ? If in the increasing complexity of city life there is no need of one man understanding another man , no need of mutual relationship , of confidence , of co-operation ; if there be independence of all other men , then the  | private school furnishes the logical education for citizenship . The public school prevents not only ignorance between men but also prevents that antagonism which inequality of wealth or station is likely to arouse . People in cities must do business daily with one another . They jostle on the streets , attend the same meetings , ride in the same cars , seek like places of amusements , walk the same streets , look at the same houses , ugly or otherwise , observe the same dress . They are all alike interested in the habits of other men and together vote and decide questions of public import . These are conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less democratic . The conception of education in either a public or private school is not so much quantity learning as quality learning , not so much knowledge as character , not so much information as citizenship . Life is not a " go as you please " or " do as you please " affair . There is duty to be performed , work to be done , self-denial to be exercised , self-reliance to be made use of , the joy " to him that overcometh " to be known , and the strenuous life to be led . The pupil in an American school should be no stranger to the strenuous life . He should learn to do the thing he ought to do , whether he feels like doing it or not . He must perform his task , overcome obstacles , meet emergencies , subordinate self and learn that there are others . Does a public school or private school best fit a child to stand the wear and tear of life ? In which school will he more surely learn that 9 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear little girl of twelve who , one bright May day , was asked : " Dorothy , why are n't you in school to-day ? " Her reply was : " I did n't go to school because mamma heard it thunder this morning . " Was she a public or private schoolgirl ? In which school will the teacher be more independent , more just to all her pupils ? in the school maintained by taxation of all or in the school supported by tuition bills ? Are marks , so important a factor in many private schools , ever modified by the thought of tuition bills ? Has any hard-headed business man ever been misled by the high marks of Gladys or Reginald ? Not long ago a gentleman said : " I went to a private school in New York city . I was always promoted and always felt sure of it , because the tuition was higher in each successive grade . " CITIZENS ' DUTY TOWARD PUBLIC SCHOOLS It may be granted that the public school is sometimes far from being a good school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its discipline too rigorous and its courses of instruction ill adapted to the real needs and growth of children . The remedy for such a condition is not for the citizen to shrug his shoulders , hug his fire and establish and maintain private schools . Half a dozen business men of prominence and influence could revolutionize public school conditions in any community if they would go about it as they do to organize and promote business enterprises . The most important interest in democratic America is the sound education of all the people . Unless a man sees this and if necessary acts to make it effective , he is not a real democrat nor does he know his obligation to the state . To quote from Walter Page again : " A country is not rich because it contains a few rich men ; it is not healthful because it contains a few strong men ; it is not intelligent because it contains a few men of learning , nor is it of good morals because it contains good women ; if the rest of the population also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good morals . The common people is the class most to be considered in the structure of civilization . " The greatest danger perhaps to the welfare of public schools is the indifference with which good citizens ? well-meaning men and women ? sometimes look upon the schools for the masses when they send their own children to private schools . The withdrawal of interest in the public schools , by any  | considerable number of prominent citizens , is of serious consequence to those schools . PUBLIC SCHOOLS GREATLY IMPROVED The public school in most American cities is a far better school in its net results upon children than some people think . Politics may interfere with efficient schools in certain cities , but the pernicious influence of the politician in school affairs is exaggerated in some cases and imaginary in others . In scores of public school systems from the Atlantic to the Pacific the politician keeps his hands off the schools . There are lamentable exceptions , but exceptions do not make rules . The scholarship of teachers has greatly improved of late years . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teachers in the elementary schools have had some col:ege training . With the broader scholarship has come greater culture of teachers . Not all teachers , it is true , are men and women of ideal manners , character , personality and speech . Still , the improved personnel of teachers has been one of the most significant changes of late in the schools . It would be , I suppose , a revelation to the ordinary parent if he should visit the public school of his district and see the teacher and know the teacher to whom he might send his boy or girl . It would also be a revelation to him to see the teachers of a city together at a reception , in those cities where the commendable custom prevails of giving the teachers a reception . Teaching , of course , is largely a matter of personality . Merely pausing to remark that teachers in private schools are not always men and women of fine personality , yet good teaching , successful teaching , real training , development and growth of children , is dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons suppose , upon the skill of the teacher in adjusting subject to child , as well as child to subject . It depends upon understanding of child nature , upon rational government and upon broad and sane ideas of what education really is . The teacher in the private school is less likely to be a trained teacher than the teacher in the public school . The training of the latter may not have been always wise or broad , but usually it is far better than none at all . While here and there a teacher is born and not made , yet in the long run a child is safer with a teacher who is not experimenting upon him ; with a teacher who knows that the world of men and women is not the world of children ; who , realizing the difficulties a book presents to a child , has the skill to lead him to overcome those difficulties and who knows the value of method judiciously used ! BETTER TEACHERS AND CONDITIONS I believe that a greater proportion of teachers in public schools than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine art . In every school , however , the time of the children is likely to be wasted because of irrational and unskillful teaching . Scores of graduates of high schools have testified to the superiority of high school instruction over that of the first year in college . Enriched teachers in the public schools are partly the result of enriched courses of study . The life of the child in his course through the schools is made broader by the kindergarten and by exercises in hand or manual training , which give that change and relaxation which his nature demands and which reinforce the lessons from books . The life of the child in the public schools is enriched by art , in the lessons in drawing and painting , by learning to read and to sing the best music , by observation of nature , by reading abundantly the literature that will live a thousand years . Increased attention is given to physical training , indoors and out of doors . Children are , as a rule , no longer left to themselves on the playground , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers . Such important factors in the welfare of children as good light , pure air , proper temperature , seats that fit , sanitary toilet accommodations ,  | are as likely to be satisfactory and healthful in public schools as in private schools , and often more so . The decoration of schoolrooms with works of art is a delight to children and has transformed the bare walls which fathers and mothers knew in their own school days . The danger from contagious diseases , often exaggerated , has become less and less owing to more stringent health regulations . With medical examination of school children already adopted in many cities , the danger is reduced to a minimum . The so-called but miscalled treadmill grind of the graded public schools has largely given way to a system of individual promotions without examinations , whenever the teacher believes the pupil is ready to do the work of the grade following . I know a young woman who is hardly twenty years old , a college graduate , who has done nearly enough work at a university to get her master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her case , while remarkable , is not unusual so far as it illustrates the fact that a bright girl or boy is not kept treading the lockstep in the public school . Never so much attention has been paid to the needs of individual pupils in the public schools as now . The child-study movement has placed increased emphasis upon the importance of the child . ' While it is of course impossible for a teacher with forty pupils to give each child the attention she could if the number were ten , yet the value of education by classes in an intelligently graded school is so considerable as to make it a training of resources which the individual method can not give . There is a real , positive advantage in class instruction . Each child listens to others . His mind is made sharp and strong by the healthy , generous rivalry of the recitation in which he must not only be careful in the statements he makes , but must as well be able to defend his positions . The ethical value of the class recitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil to do his best , to make his contribution to the sum of human knowledge . It is a period of co-operation , of mutual helpfulness , of each working for the good of all . The public school is a human institution and as such is not without imperfections . Year by year it becomes a more rational , a more scientific and a more effective institution for human betterment . The private school is not without its advantages for a certain class of pupils . There can be no question about the value of a private school conducted as some of them are by broad-minded , large-souled men and women . The public schools profit by the existence of a limited number of such schools . The danger to the public schools and therefore to American citizenship and to American ideals comes when any large number of citizens send their children to private schools , losing their interest in the only schools to which it is possible for most men to send their children . The most sacred thing in the state is the child . The public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient enough for that child . whoever he may be .  |
