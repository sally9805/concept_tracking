Was it Roosevelt the historian , or Roosevelt the embarrassed party leader , who said , on receiving Panama 's . Minister , that his lightning recognition of Panama was but doing now " as We did nearly a century ago , when the Latin , peoples of America proclaimed the right to popular government " ? As he must be perfectly aware , what we " did " in 1822 was to recognize republics which had declared ' their independence from six to ten years before that date . In message after message , President Monioe referred to the revolutions in South America , but steadily refused to allow his hand to be forced , until the Spanish colonies had shown that they were able not merely to assert but to maintain their independence . In his special message of March 8 , 1822 , announcing recognition , Monroe gave a review of the long struggle , saying that " the great length of time " during which it had extended and the " utter inability " of Spain to reduce her revolted provinces , compelled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compare this deliberation with President Roosevelt 's recognition of a seceding State before its own Government even knew that it was in revolution ! Of course , President Monroe was a fearfully slow coach , who would have made a sad fist of it in these strenuous times ; but if he waited six years , it does seem as if Mr. Roosevelt might have waited six days . Clearly , it was not the Monroe Doctrine of recognition which Secretary Hay had in mind when he said that " the Monroe Doctrine and the Golden Rule " were the sufficient bases of our foreign policy . Colombians , who are sadly ignorant of the Scriptures , will be tempted to think that what he really said was , " the good old rule " ? that they should take who have the power . We know that the king 's business requireth haste , and so , apparently , does a certain sort of President 's . The first intimations we had from the State Department breathed of all deliberation . A guarded recognition of the de-facto government at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hay 's asdistants informed the reporters , but nothing would be done Precipitately . That was before the , Cabinet meeting of the 6th . Immediately upon its close , the startling news came that the President not only had recognized the de-facto insurrectionist government , but had entered into relations with it , and had notified Colombia that she must not attempt to restore her revolted territory . This was the indecent haste which filled all conservative men with amaze ; and the President 's maladroit reference to the example of Monroe only serves to make his own course appear ' the more unprecedented and indefensible . Are we now bound to go to war with England  --  and also ' Cuba  --  for declining to recognize the independence of Panama ? No one can tell , in these wild and whirling , times . = The Britidh Foreign Office , it is true , ( alleges that it is simply following " international precedent " in waiting to see if Panama is really able ' to maintain her independence ; but this is either an insult or a stupidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all precedents , including our own ? These doddering diplomats of the old school are really " not in the game . " The hustling youth who are now playing football with international law are rapidly making Monroe and Seward and Lincolna perfect laughing-stock . When British ships chartered by Colombia appeared on the horizon , the Cabinet told the President that it would never no to prepare another piece of Trent humble pie for himself to eat ; and so the orders to stop British ships on . the high seas were graciously rescinded . With lawyer-like patience , Secretary Root is said to have explained to Executive , who had been reading this duty in. his wishes , that , really , there were certain laws that it would be just as well to respect , that - what had been ordered done in Colombian waters was an act of war . " Why , is it ? " was the surprised question of that just man armed ; i " then , of course , I 'll take the back track . " But the real magnanimity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent collision with Great Britain . Any old law was good enough for the Colombians ; but when the Union Jack hove in sight , the President suddenly awoke to the need of looking into the books to discover what the rule was . Another retreat by a rashly vigorous Administration is announced in the matter . of the new canal treaty . The first ingenious plan , it will be remembered , was to take the act of Congress and write into it the word " Panama " wherever the word " Colombia " stood . But it 25 now regretfully admitted that the question whether this can be done is " one for a lawyer to decide " Well , the lawyers have already decided it adversely , and the pretty scheme is abandoned . The thing will have to be done all over again . A new and perhaps tainted treaty will have to be submitted to the Senate . This will have to be done on the eve of a Presidential election , and the strenuous short-cut to a canal which would have come to us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent , is likely to delay the project still further . The earliest and most consistent advocates of the Panama route  --  at a time when Secretary- Hay was scouting it as beneath the notice of a serious Government  --  are free to oppose to the best of their ability any treaty that bears on its face the marks of collusion and bad faith , undeterred , , by the- virtuous attitude of the Administration in rejecting the pro= posal to go back and complete an arrangement with Colombia , on the ground that it would look as if we were actuated by mercenary motives . ( Besides , we can get the canal ' . se much cheaper from Panama ! TherDemocratic , Senators are of course preparing to oppose the hasty-pudding treaty with the overnight " republic " of Panama They will do so on various grounds , some sincere , some partisan ; but it is obvious that , if they are determined , they can prevent ratification . The Republicans are three votes short of a two-thirds majority in the Senate . The great project now bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to be thrown into the next Presidential campaign ; and so to be imperilled anew . So much for digging a canal before it was caught . It is easy , of course , to hold up hands of horror at the nefarious course of the Democrats . Republicans ask in pained amazement if it is possible that an Opposition party can place itself before the , country in so " ridiculous a light . " Yes , dear friends , it is all too possible The Republicans , when in Opposition , showed just how possible . They remorselessly killed the Bayard-Chamberlain treaty during President Cleveland 's first Administration , and their motives were of precisely the partisan character which they now attribute to the Democrats . To score a point against the President of the opposite party ; to embarrass the Administration , to keep unsettled questions still in a condition to vex statesmen and inflame the country  --  that has been the way of political parties ever since they were born . We are not defending it . We simply say that it is inevitable ( political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election imminent , and that it should have been foreseen . Above all should it have been foreseen by a President who prides himself on never pursuing barren ideals , but resolutely grasping the attainable . ? THE CANCELLED MESSAGE . " We must forthwith take the matter into our own hands ! " Those astounding words from the message that he would have sent to Congress but for the Panama revolution , President Roosevelt now makes public as a supposed justification . They are , rather , his deepened condemnation . They will revive the acute fears that many had when President McKinley was assassinated , lest a firebrand type of man succeed him . Mr. Roosevelt apparently strove to dissipate that alarm of sober citizens They began to think that responsibility had steadied him , but now we find him taking a position which has in it the possibility of a thousand international quarrels and a constant threat of war . In an affair exclusively within the ' sovereign control of a friendly nation , he is ready to declare that " we can no longer submit to trifling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hands " ? the matter being , it will be observed , the property ' of another country. ? Under such a robber. contention , , we should be entitled tot:seize- any , land on ' earth which we happened to ' want , and which we thought ourselves possessed of sufficient brute force to take . It is a declaration of stark and lawless absolutism , tempered only by land-hunger , which we have lived to see made by an American President . That Mr. Roosevelt 's hasty falling into the arms of the Jonah's-gourd Republic of Panama was a diplomatic blunder of the first magnitude , is a proposition by itself . Several of our first authorities on international law have assented to it ; but it may be admitted that the public in general does not take keen interest in such nice questions What everybody can see , however , is that the overbearing and brutal tone of President Roosevelt 's message , as he had it blocked out , - is a most serious matter . That portends tronble It could not come from an Executive who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to a friendly but weak nation that its protests in regard - to its own property were " trifling , " and that we should " forthwith take the matter into our own hands , " is openly to advocate a policy of aggression . The man in the street can see that . Here is no matter for experts . The wayfaring man knows bullying when he sees it , and , unless he is a fool , also knows that , as a national policy , it means the launching of a thousand ships Hence it would seem that Mr Roosevelt , in order to prove that he was not secretly fomenting revolution on the Isthmus , is willing to appear as a permanent disturber of the national peace . He may be sure that no utterance of his , since his accession to the Presidency , has given such a shock to conservative men , in his party and in the country generally , as this bellicose fragment of his message . We knew that he was blundering ; we did not know that he would publicly indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as such a mortal offence that the Colombian Senate declined to ratify the canal treaty as it stood ? He speaks of this lawful action as " insincere dealing . " How does he know that it was not sincere ? How does the Outlook , which is so pained at any one 's accepting rumor regarding American public men , know that it was " the robber politicians of Colombia " who defeated the treaty ? It says they did , and repeats the phrase " robber politicians " with an air of con- , viction which ought to be based on some knowledge . Has it any ? As for the President , he should be the last man to say that opposition to a canal treaty may not spring from the highest and most patriotic motives . He himself didall in his power to kill the first HayPauncefote ' treaty , so vitally related to the Isthmian canal . That treaty had been agreed to , even ardently sought , by the Administration at Washington : it was approved by the-best newspapers and the leaders of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt , then Governor of New York , burst out in a public interview with the hope that the treaty would be defeated . Was that " insincere dealing " ? Did the Outlook call that the act of a " robber politician " ? The treaty was defeated , but that led to none of the present howling . Mr. Hay went quietly to work to negotiate a new treaty , covering all the points of the old one in a way deftly to muzzle Mr. Roosevelt and the other Jingoes , and in due time it was ratified . Nothing is commoner than to have treaties temporarily defeated Our Senate has been a very graveyard of treaties . It ought to make the most solemn Senator smile to be informed by the President that the rejection of a treaty is a ground of international offence . If it were , we- should have been at war by this time with half the nations of the earth . What diplomats , up till now , have done in such circumstances is to leave off making wry faces as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the one not satisfactory . There is no reason to think this might not have been done with Colombia But no , says the President , " the time has come to declare that the beginning of the canal can not be much longer delayed . " Gladstone used to be called " an old man in a hurry , " but why should the young man in the White House have been in such a consuming hurry ? Could not a project which has been on our hands for sixty years wait till after his renomination ? In his haste he has simply passed from one blunder to another , diplomatic and political , until now he stands face to face with the practical certainty of having , with all his hurry , only delayed matters . THE TARIFF IN 1904 . The new Democratic leader of the House displays signs of generalship which ' must occasion great uneasiness among Republicans . To line his party up in favor of Cuban reciprocity was an act of constructive statesmanship . This is only  --  the first step in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the Administration will be glad to receive Democratic support on this particular measure , it must accept it with the knowledge that it is possibly paving the way for a good deal of trouble later . Representative Williams 's announcement that " we shall fight for a revision ot the tariff , " gains force from the fact that Republican leaders have lately been talking about the possibility- of injecting more protection into the schedules after next November . The existing tariff obviously furnishes the Republican party no issue for 1904 . The party is in the position of a banker whose credit is questioned , and who sees the need of paying out cash regardless of everything but the pinch of the moment . Mr. ' Williams , harping on the growing disappointment of the country over ' the Dingley law , says we must reduce our schedules . But the Reptiblican party can never consent to that doctrine Its contention will be that the tariff must be lifted higher . Possibly Mr. Chamberlain 's retaliatory scheme may furnish the " stand-patters " in this country the opportunity they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until next November , they may find an issue in him . It looks as if the " prosperity " cry would be out of the question in 1904 . On the score of industrial conditions the country may not take alarm at all over the prospect of a Democratic administration . When one stops and reflects , it is really quite dreadful to think what will be the position of the Republican party in case the strenuous life should , after all , not turn out a winning issue . The tariff might then prove the last ditch . Just at present the tariff is somewhat under ; , cloud . More than two years ago President McKinley injected the poison of reciprocity rather liberally into the popular mind . Then , too , certain heartless political economists and newspaper editors have insisted on holding the tariff responsible for the industrial Trusts , with their efforts to advance artificially the price of commodities and their waterlogged capitalizations . Considering , . hat a great many hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost in the stock market , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the latest Republican tariff , that does not seem on its face a very encouraging issue . But it is right at this point that Mr. Chamberlain may prove a godsend to the " friends of protection . " The tariff is capable of becoming a magnificent issue if rightly handled . A man must be blind who does not see why capital is now in mourning and labor in tears What we needed was a great deal more tariff than we have had But there is nothing harder than to make people see the obvious . Though we require a much higher tariff than the present , it would be risky to tell the voters that next year in plain terms . They might not see the point , and their base suspicions might lead them to raise the cry of plunder . But if we can announce in thundering tones that Mr. Chamberlain is preparing to ruin this country by his policy of " retaliation , " they may be startled into a realization that the higher your tariff the higher your prosperity . The Republican managers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined a scheme which will effectually kill Mr. Chamberlain 's preferential goose . It is said that while they propose to be " loyal to protection , " they are not unwilling to do something for the revisionists , and that a strong effort will therefore be made to bring into the Republican platform next year a recommendation of a law providing maximum and minimum tariff schedules . If power is given to the President " to proclaim an exchange of favors with nations which are ready for such negotiation , " he will possess a card which will trump anything in Mr. Chamberlain 's hand . Mr. Chamberlain will have to rise at a very early hour if he expects to get the better of our " friends of protection . " He is only a tyro at the business , whereas they are past masters . He can not learn too quickly that his policy would do Great Britain not a particle of good as against this country , but that it would play into the hands of our tariff gamblers . He wants Parliament to give him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the United States does not come down from its high horse right away . But if the " friends of protection " have their way next year , we shall simply mount a higher one . There is no knowing how high we might run up our schedules in case of a tariff squabble with Great Britain or any other country . Possibly we could do as much in that line as we did two or three years ago with stock-market quotations . Could anything please our " stand-patters " better than Mr. Chamberlain 's threat to clap on duties to keep our products out - of Great Britain ? The loss to American industry from a curtailment of exports to that market would be only incidental . The thing to consider is the magnificent opportunity to raise our own tariff duties To be sure , the benefit from this would accrue to only a handful of people ; but that is a mere matter of detail . Let Mr. Chamberlain play his present cards , and we shall show him very quickly that we can trump his ace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into effect for several years , if ever , is of course no drawback to its use as a bugbear by our " stand-patters . " COLORED STATISTICS . The Manufacturers ' Record of Balti-more again illustrates how impossible it seems to be for many Southern writers to discuss in good temper any ques-tion in which the relation of the negro to the rest of the community is in any wise involved . We had occasion , some short while since , to point out how mag-nificently endowed by nature the six heavy negro States of the South were . We said that , up to this time , those States had not attained in material things anything like the degree of pros-perity of the country as a whole . We found the explanation in the fact that their population was made up not of One race , but of - two , in approximately equal numbers . We did not discuss the question whether the negro was or was not in any sense the equal of the white man . We suggested , however , that , among negroes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not consider whether that progress ever would or could raise the negro to the level of the white man , but we did ask whether it was not of supreme importance to the South that the conditions surrounding the negro should be made such as to encourage him to progress to the utmost of his inherent possibilities ; and we asked whether the South , with so many millions of black men living in it , could afford to say to them , " Strive as you choose , succeed as you can ; but , whatever you do , so long as there is a discernible drop of African blood in your veins you shall never be allowed to obtain many of those things which men of all races and of all ages have most keenly longed for . " In criticising our article , the Record uses such phrases as " fools , fanatics , or fiends , " " idiocy or malignancy , " etc . We carry on no discussion with any one who sees fit so to express himself , because no possible good can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manufacturers ' Record in the article in question , and one thing only , on which it is worth while to comment : " In 1860 , these six States South Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Alabama , Mississippi , and Louisiana , containing only 9 6-10 per cent . of the land area of the country and 13 8-10 per cent . of the population , possessed 18 9-10 per cent , of the wealth of the country . " The proportion they contained of the land area of the country in 1860 was for practical purposes immaterial . More than one-half of the land area of the country was then virtually unpeopled . If it be true , however , that those States , with less than 14 per cent , of the pop : ulation , had more than 18 per cent . o1 the wealth of the country , it is very important , because it shows that almost everybody for the last half-century has been wrong Every historian who has dealt with the civil war has assumed that the preponderance of the North , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Davis and his various Secretaries of the Treasury were now alive , would not they rub their eyes on being told by a Southern writer that , man for man , counting negToes as well as whites , the South was in 1860 nearly 40 per cent , richer than the rest of the country ? Would they not have some reason to feel that an attack was being made upon their management of the finances of the Southern Confederacy ? For there can be no question that , if the South was so much richer than the North . there was no excuse whatever for the condition into which its treasury and its currency came long before the war was ended . how , a sec-. ton with few railroads , with practically no manufactures , with one-half of its copulation chattel slaves owning nothing , and a very considerable proportion in numbers of the whites then very poor , could ' really , in some mysterious way , man ' for man , head for head , have been richer than the rest of the country , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain . Now , of course , everybody knows , and in his cool moments the editor of the Manufacturers ' Record as well as anybody else , that in 1860 the North was very much richer , relatively to population , than the South . He has fallen into the same snare which has enmeshed many an amateur statistician before him . He saw certain figures in the census table , and Straightway sought to retake comparison of them without stopping to ask whether the way in which the table had been compiled made such comparison possible or not . Accor , ding to the census of 1860 , the true wealth of those six States named was , as the writer in- the Manufacturers ' Record says , 18 3-10 per cent . of the wealth of the country , although those States had only 13 8-10 per cent . of the population . But how was the wealth of these States calculated ? Slaves were property . One-half their population was owned by some part of the other half , and a value of some hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population ; and in that way , and in that way alone , did it come about that the wealth of the South in 1860 appeared from the census figures to be relatively greater than that of the North . A skilled artisan in Ohio was of vastly more value to the community in which he lived as a wealth producer than was a field hand on a plantation in the Alabama Black Belt , but the field hand figures in the return of the wealth of Alabama in 1860 as worth somewhere from $1.000 to $1,500 , while the Ohio mechanic was , fortunately for him , not appraised as anybody 's property . If the deputy marshals who took the census of 1860 assumed each slave to be worth on an average $500 , slave property would have added about $250 to the apparent per-capita wealth of - the entire population of the six States - under consideration . According to the census of 1860 , the total property in the country , real and personal , including slaves , averaged only $514 per head of the population . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves in these six States figure in the total valuation of the census of 1860 . Some facts of great significance in this direction are , however , accessible . Manufactures of any considerable importance being almost unknown in these States ( cities and large towns being very few ) , their wealth must have been largely agricultural ; that is to say , their land constituted a larger proportion of their total property than was the case in other sections of the country where the diversification of industries promoted and required the accumulation of personal property ; yet the census returns point to the directly opposite conclusion . Outside of these six States , the assessed value of real-property was nearly twice as great as that of personal property . In these six States the assessed value of personal property was almost twice as great as that of real . Slaves were , of course , considered personalty . In South Carolina and Mississippi , where the slaves were most numerous , the assessed valuation of personalty was about two and a half times as great as that of realty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuation of all property in 1860 was , in Mississippi $767 and in South Carolina $779 , while in New York it was $475 and in Pennsylvania $487 . No one could give a moment 's intelligent consideration to such figures and not perceive their utter worthlessness for all comparative purposes . Indeed , outside of the vitiating element of the slave valuations , the table is useless for any purpose of comparison . It is scarcely possible that in 1860 the-average inhabitant of Connecticut was nearly 46 per cent . better off than was the resident of Massachusetts ; and yet the census of 1860 so states . THE RIGHT TO NEW TRIALS . Prof. J. H. Wigmore has an article in the November number of the Columbia Low Review in which he discusses the question of granting new trials because of the erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence He pronounces the existing practice of our courts absurd and dangerous , and insists that it ought to be altered . The present theory of the courts is that a party is entitled , as of right , to a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been improperly admitted or excluded , the admission or exclusion of which may , by possibility , have affected the result as against him . If it is , humanly speaking , impossible to conceive that it did so affect the result , the admission or exclusion is treated as " harmless error , " and a new trial is refused . But the limits of harmless error are very narrow . In nine cases out of ten error by the trial judge will vitiate the trial even though the record shows that , with the error disregarded , the result reached by the jury ought to have been the same . Mr. Wigmore gives some striking instances . In a case in Alabama , there being a dozen exceptions to rulings on evidence , one of these was found wrong and a new trial was granted , e though no substantial prejudice through the rulings - was asserted . In a case in California a new trial was grant-ed for error in allowing- the- prosecution to contradict the defendant on a matter having " no reference whatever to the guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nebraska for allowing the contradiction of a witness on an immaterial point ; in a case in North Carolina where the whole evidence " warranted conviction " ; in Vermont , because counsel in his address said that he knew his clients to be of good reputation , and that this was the best kind of evidence for them . In a late case in the United States Supreme Court , a new trial was granted in a homicide case because , after a " dying declaration " had been properly received in evidence , the error had been committed of admitting a subsequent statement by the deceased that her first declaration was true " in every particular . " The practice is productive of an enormous mulitplication of trials and constant miscarriage of justice . It has produced a notorious abuse in unscrupulous trials of cases " for exceptions " ? counsel being employed not to get a verdict , but to trap his opponent into a slip on evidence which will enable him to upset the verdict , however just . In criminal trials it has been carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration of justice ; in many parts of the country the constant rescue of convicted murderers by appellate courts for trivial error is , thought to be ample justification for lynching by mobs without any trial at all . The abuse can be defended only on one or two theories : either , that the party has a legal right to a judicial observance of the rules of evidence per se , or that the reverse of the practice would involve a usurpation of the function of the jury . The first theory makes the observance of the rules of evidence , instead of a fair verdict , the end of the appeal ; but this is the abuse itself , not a justification of it . The second is supported by neither reason nor analogy ; the functions of the jury are at every turned exercised subject to the correction and revision - of the court . ' It is everyday practice for an appellate court to confirm a judgment setting aside a verdict as against the weight of evidence , though , if the jury have any function at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary case of a non-suit , or verdict for defendant directed by the judge and confirmed on appeal , the party defeated is curt off from the jury altogether . and the case is at an end . Why should the trial be vitiated for erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence if the appellate court is able to say that . even with the error corrected , the jury should rationally have been still bound to ren-. der the same verdict ? The practice is among the causes which have long been tending to enfeeble the bench and impair the confidence of the public in the administration of justice . The great democratic wave which swept through the courts and legislatures two generaticins ago has had effects of which those who swam with it little dreamed . To say nothing of the elective system , which , combined with short terms of office , inevitably tends to make judges timid and subservient , the temper of the time was jealous of judicial power and authority , and every effort was made to limit it . Statutes were passed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judges over verdicts and hedging them about on every side in their relations with juries . Their control over the proceedings in their own courts was taken away from them , and , in the name of simplicity of procedure , the most elaborate codes ever seen were constructed by the Legislature for their government . Under such influences a new ideal of judgeship gradually grew up , which makes the American judge today a figure radically different from that of which we have inherited the idea from the past . To succeed , his aim must be , not to develop ' the administration of justice and uphold the majesty of the law , as the great judges of the past did , but ' to be , as Mr. Wigmore puts it , merely an umpire of the game of legislation . This tendency was perceived by judges of the older breed fifty years ago . We find Judge Nisbet of Georgia saying in 1852 : " It is to be feared , in these days of reform , that the judges will he so strictly laced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have but little fear of judicial power in Georgia so aggrandizing itself as to endanger any of the powers of other departments of the government ; or to endanger the life and liberty of the citizen , or to deprive the fury of their appropriate functions . The danger rather to be dreaded , is making , the judges men of straw , and thus stripping the courts of popular reverence , and annihilating the popular estimate of the power and sanctity of the law . " The fetish which has been made of the right to new trials is connected with this new phase of judicial development . As the judge 's independence and courage are weakened , he inevitably grows fonder of rules which save him from responsibility . The abuse seems now so imbedded in our jurisprudence that it will prove very difficult to eradicate Some statutory efforts have been made in this direction . but thus far without much effect Mr. Wigmore does not cite any cases to show that the right to a new trial on the score of trivial error is a constitutional right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have derived all our legal theory on the subject , the abuse seems to have been swept away . Law reform in England has been directed to strengthening the courts , not weakening them , and " in England , to-day , the whole odious practice of misusing the rules of evidence as petty stratagems in litigious tactics has passed away . In the reports of decisions there not obeur annually not more than five rulings upon POints of evidence , as against more than five hundred in the reports of the United States . " It seems absurd to suppose that we have gone So far in this country on the wrong road that there is no help for us.
