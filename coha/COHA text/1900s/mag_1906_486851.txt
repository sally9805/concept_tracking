The award of the Nobel prize of $40 , - 000 to Theodore Roosevelt is a proper recognition of his success in bringing about peace between Russia and Japan . This is the finest of President Roosevelt 's achievements , and the one for which he should be longest remembered . In every land this award will be applauded , nowhere , however , more warmly than in this country , which is a sharer in the honor to its Chief Magistrate . With admirable public spirit and tact he has decided to devote the money to the cause of industrial peace . The prize will also , we trust , modify his own . conventional ideas about the necessity of being armed to the- teeth , and will set his thoughts more strongly than heretofore in the direction of amity between nations . At the coming Hague Conference he has a unique opportunity to startle the world by humanitarian proposals for disarmament ; he is peculiarly in a position to lead in some long step toward relieving the poor of Europe from the crushing burdens of militarism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conception an efficient government is that of a benevolent autocrat  --  not a mere executive , checked by a legislature and a judiciary , and hemmed in by rigid laws When routine administration under law allows perpetration of a wrong , he would step in , ( Zeus ex maeltuta , and make the cause of virtue triumph ? This notion of his has never been displayed more clearly than in his special message to Congress asking authority to dismiss naval officers whenever he sees fit . The case which has incited him to this extraordinary step is that of a paymaster who , becoming drunk at a dinner in a Yokohama hotel , on May 9 , 1905 , behaved indecently in the presence of a number of ladies . When this officer was tried in January , 1906 , the court-martial came short of duty , for , instead of dismissing him , it merely reduced him to the foot of the list of paymasters and prescribed a public reprimand . In human institutions such failures are inevitable . " I think there is no danger that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making his request for absolute authority . His consciousness of his own rectitude is thus only surpassed by his confidence in his unknown successors . Moreover , he wrote this message at the very moment when thousands of Americans were warmly protesting because he had ended the military careers of 150 ? nnocent soldiers , because he could not get hold of " from nine to twenty " guilty men . This was so grave an error that it may fitly be characterized as an abuse of power . The President , too , has plainly neglected the naval officers ' point of view . The law to which he objects was demanded by the army and navy jointly as security that officers should be deprived of life commissions only by due process of law . And why not the Army if the Navy ? And the Revenue Marine ? If executive dismissal will extirpate all evil growths , why limit it to the Navy ? The Secretary of the Navy recants this year his last year 's belief that we have warships enough , and he thinks it well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due to the failure of certain expectations that foreign nations would limit their fleets , and to another mysterious reason , no reference to which shall slip from his pen . The rest of his annual report is of interest because it endorses highly the recommendation of the Personnel Board , which has been sitting all summer with a view to regulating the flow of promotion ; and because it favors also a radical reorganization of the Navy Department . A more sweeping change in the corps of officers has never been proposed at any one time , unless it be the amalgamation of the line and the engineers . In urging a reorganization of the Navy Department , Mr. Bonaparte favors placing all the bureaus which have to do with materiel under one head and those relating to the personnel under another . The first group will comprise the bureau of yards and docks , equipment , construction and repair , steam engineering , and ordnance , In the other will be the office ' of the Chief of the Navigation Bureau , the Surgeon-General , Paymaster-General , Commandant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval Academy . From the point of view of business method and fighting efficiency , much is to be said in.favor of the suggested change But the heads of these two sections will have enormous power  --  much - greater than that of the present Chief of the Bureau of Navigation , who , in the eyes of many officers , has had far too much control over the destinies of individuals . The annual reports of the Secretary of the Treasury have long been largely given up to discussion of the currency and exposition of projects of reform . Nothing , in fact , could better prove the hodge-podge character of our past titan-. cial legislation , as a whole , than the fact that , for nearly half a century , the annual Treasury reports have almost without exception advocated a change in existing law . Secretary Shaw , in his first report , - 1902 , argued for a banknote currency based on general assets , remarking that he did not believe it necessary to make the currency thus issued a first lien on assets , and that the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national bank currency . " A. year ago , he proposed additional issues of banknotes , equal to 50 per cent . of outstanding bond-secured circulation , but subject to a tax of 5 or 6 per cent. , with a view to early redemption when no longer needed . Since Secretary Shaw 's report of 1905 , committees of the New York Chamber of Commerce and the American Bankers ' Association , have , as we noted on November 22 , joined in formulating a plan which includes the main principles of these Treasury propositions . But now the Secretary seems to have abandoned his currency reform plan of a year ago , and the modification of it proposed by the bankers , in. behalf of a plan of sheer paternalism in the money market . He revives the ideas which he has enunciated from time to time regarding bank reserves , and their regulation in the discretion of the Treasury . In this view he is , we think , governed by wholly erroneous notions of the money market , which lead him to a mischievous inference as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be that Wall Street call money rates of 25 or 50 per cent . are evils per se and unnecessary evils at that ; therefore , the banks ought to combine to suppress them , and if the banks will not do so , the Treasury ought to intervene . For ourselves , this strikes us as sitting on a safety valve . Mr. Shaw 's ideas on paternalism in finance are summarized in this extraordinary paragraph from his report , which we reprint without - further comment . If the Secretary of the Treasury were given $100,000,000 to be deposited with the banks , or withdrawn as he might deem expedient , and if in addition he were clothed with authority over the reserves of the sev , eral banks , with power to contract the national-bank circulation at pleasure , in my judgment no panic as distinguished from industrial stagnation-could threaten either the United States or Europe that he could not avert The United States Civil Service Commission , in its annual report , confirms the press dispatches regarding the difficulties of the Government in filling its competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but from , 40 to 60 per cent . of the highest eligibles on the various lists decline appointments . " The Government can not hope to compete with private employers , " says the Commission , " unless it pays salaries that measure up fairly well to the standard of private business . " In order to make Government positions more attractive , a bill has been introduced increasing the salaries of civil employees by 10 per cent . The complaint of this class does not , however , come alone . Congress is coming to the point of raising the salaries of its own members . A Cabinet officer has embodied in his annual report an allusion to the inadequacy of his pay - Generally speaking , there is not a man in public position , high or low , who does not make a convincing demonstration that , on a basis of the private demand for like services , he ought to receive more than he does . Logically , we should expect the announcement that the Government machinery is inadequatelymanned . Yet the specifications in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government salaries have not been adjusted to meet the present cost of living , is merely stating one of their shortcomings . They have not properly been adjusted at all . Most of them " just growed . " And the man really to be pitied is not the ambitious outsider , whether he be a candidate for a Cabinet post or a rural free delivery route , but the sheltered clerk who entered the Service in the days when the salary looked larger , and to-day can neither have It enlarged nor summon the initiative to go elsewhere . The Isthmian Canal Commission announced on Saturday a " postponement " till January 12 of the opening of bids for the completion of the Panama Canal . This is the officially optimistic way of confessing that no bids had been received , and that none would he received by ' the date originally fixed , December 12 . Moreover , it is stated that " certain changes " in the form of contract are to be made . These are due , it is explained , to the suggestions of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite way of saying that the old form of contract was impracticable . Among the sweeping alterations now to be made in this contract , which last summer was flawless and would lie changed to suit no one , are- ( 1 ) Reduction in the amount of the bond required ; ( 2 ) relief of the contractor from liability for defective material , throwing upon the Government the expense of replacing any that may be discovered ; ( 3 ) a Government guarantee to cover fluctuations in the wage scale on the . Isthmus , and ( 4 ) a stipulation by the Government that no contractor shall be held in loss on account of faulty engineering data . This last point is , crit ical and ominous . Prospbetive bidders , it is admitted , have ' been so disturbed by the engineering uncertainty of the plans adopted by the Government , that they would not undertake the work without.a gUarantee that the Treasury should stand the loss , if any resulted from that cause . It is understood that these technical doubts relate mainly to the borings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three locks in flight at that point . How serious is the latter difficulty , may be seen by running over the testimony of various engineers before the Senate Committee last spring . A " standpat " Congress refused last year to allow the free entry of Canadian lumber for the rebuilding of San Francisco . Therefore , Oregon and'Washington have been drawn upon for the exceptional demand But the American tonnage  --  which alone can carry freight from one American port to another-4s so inadequate that rates have already risen from $5 or less to $9 per thousand feet , with a prospect of $10 Meanwhile , there lies idle an abundance of first-class foreign shipping . These foreign ships can not carry lumber to San Francisco under their present register , nor can American capital buy them and apply them in this vitally necessary work The only practicable plan is explained by the Portland Oregonian , in the case Or the British steamship Duneric . This vessel has been chartered by Portland capital , and will be sent to British Columbia , there to load with lumber for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , which , plus the duty of $2 , will still be less than the charge for carrying native lumber from Portland to San Francisco under the American flag . If it were a case of foreign-owned freight-car or wagon or wheelbarrow , Americans would simply buy and use it But as it is a ship , it must be sent first round Robin Hood 's barn , and , after all , deliver lumber not cut in American mills , ? The promotion of John W. Riddle , now Minister to Rumania and Servia , to be Ambassador to Russia , is thoroughly deserved He never gave large sums to the Republican campaign chest , or owned a newspaper , or wielded great political and social influence ; hence he will be , among our Ambassadors , almost in a class by himself . " Because he represents the simple life , " is one reason now given for his appointment . A far better one is that he has worked his way up from a secretaryship by sheer merit . A remarkable linguist , devoted to the diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , he has shown conclusively that the United States can get men of the right type to fill the entire diplordatic service just as soon as , it offers a permanent career and pays suitable salaries . The Pope 's seeming rejection of all compromise with the French Government on the question of Separation has undoubtedly precipitated as grave a crisis as any Ministry has been compelled to face since the establishment of the Third Republic . Should the deadlock turn out to be as obstinate as would appear from the declarations of both the Vatican ' and the Cabinet , the country would be confronted by civil dissension at a time when external.relations are enough of themselves to cause the Government much anxiety . - Yet it is the very necessity of maintaining the country 's position in the present delicately adjusted balance of European politics that may impel the French Government to find means for avoiding actual war with the Church , while maintaining the , Separation Law in its substance . Nor is the Church bent on actual violence . So far as may be gathered from conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be passive in nature It is said that " parish priests , vicars , etc , must remain passive , and may not cooperate in any act of sequestration ; but if the bishop considers that the refusal of the treasurers to surrender the keys may cause grave consequences , he can permit them to do so . " And , again : " Bishops may authorize Catholic officials to participate in sequesters , if the refusal would endanger positions necessary for the maintenance of their families . " Neither side , we believe , should be desirous to provoke a collision  --  the Government , because crises often mean ministerial changes , and the Vatican , because a religious war , in the present temper of the country , would not redound to the permanent interests of the Catholic Church . It is significant that the Pope 's decision should have been withheld till the new French law was on the point of going into effect Such high dignitaries as Archbishop Lecot of Bordeaux and Cardinal Richard were allowed to put forward measures of compromise which they are now compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the peaceful efforts of French ecclesiastics by the Curia a powerful weapon in the campaign against foreign dominance in French affairs . One Ministry after another falling on the anti-clerical issue , the King alarmed , and ' the- people on . the verge of riotous outbreaks -- such is the news from Catholic Spain . Yet signs of a political movement against the privileges of the Church have long been visible . It is not only the Republican or anarchistic element , as in Catalonia , that has now to be reckoned with ; there is evidently a deep and widespread feeling that the civil power must assert itself ' against the ecclesiastical The intellectual alienation from the Church has long been evident in Spain , and , of late , the antagonism has seemed to be striking down . One recalls the popular excitement which Galdds 's mildly anti-clerical play , " Electra , " provoked . The large sale and vogue of a tirade against the Church which its author , Ibafiez , called a novel and published under the title " La Catedral , " had a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of legislation directed at the prerogatives of the Church , along the lines of the French law , though probably not so extreme , now appears to be certain . Sharp differences of opinion at the congress of Italian . Socialists lately held at Rome were taken by many as a sign of weakness and break-up . But a writer in the Nouvelle Revue asserts that the result was really a triumph for the moderates . There is a party of reform which constitutes.the Right . It preaches the emancipation of the proletariat by means of education and instruction . It does not advocate any particular politi- ' cat regime , but opposes clerical influence , urges the reduction of the military establishment , and favors universal suffrage . The " Syndicalists " compose the Left . They seek to propagate revolutionary collectivism ; they advocate the general strike , and demand the substitution of " an armed nation " for the present standing army . The Centre is represented by the " Integralists , " who seek to compose the differences between the extremes At the congress , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two other Parties . The programme upon which these agree puts social reform above political agitation , and this distinguishes them from the earlier Republicans , who believed that a change in the form of government was of the first importance . During the last twenty years there has been a rapid development of Socialism in Italy , due , according to the writer in the Nouvelle Revue , to the wretched condition of the working people , especially in the south and in the agricultural districts But it happens to be in the north that Socialism has been most . successful . As was pointed out fifteen years ago by Leroy-Beaulieu , the socialistic unrest in Italy really arises from the fact that there has been great improvement in the condition of the working classes , and the reforms already accomplished make them eager to achieve larger results . An aspect of socialistic experiments , often overlooked , is brought forward by F. T. Millen in the London Spectator . The common notion is that public relief works , old-age pensions , support for people who are out of employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich and give it to the poor  --  a blessed levelling of inequalities . Not so , says Mr. Bullen . The rich are not the chief sufferers from these attempts at equalizing , " but the large and almost unconsidered class of workers , just kept on the weather side of want by incessant work . " These are the people who feel the pinch of increased taxes , an increase that is distributed through the community in a rise of rents , as well as in the price of all the necessaries of life . " I have heard Lady Warwick assert at a banquet , " adds Mr. Bullen , " that it was the duty of the state to feed and clothe as well as educate every child of the poor , and I longed to ask her what she understood by the state . " She evidently had in mind the people of wealth ; but Mr. Bullen argues that in London the state means " the humble workers who are willing and industrious , and who dread the pauperization of themselves or their children more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bottomless pit by the ever-growing burden of rates expended by utterly irresponsible men of the type of Mr. Will Crooks and Mr George Lansbury , and women like Lady Warwick . " In this country we have not gone so far ; but many persons of fine humanitarian impulses , who sympathize deeply with the miseries of the poor , urge us to follow the example of New Zealand , Australia , Germany , and England . But before casting their votes for such policies , they should ex -- amine the problem more deeply and cover the ultimate incidence of the taxes for their well-meant projects German colonial affairs have inevitably taken much of the time of the Reichstag 's present session , and the recent six . days ' debate put the Government to-its trumps . Fortunately for its prestige , it had already begun to clean house ; and the new Director of the Colonial Bureau , Bernhard Dernburg , was able to present his plans and achievements so vigorously as to demOlish many of the criticisms directed against him and his office . Von Bulow stood by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is distinctly a triumph for the Government . The gravest accusations of cruelty and mismanagement were made by Bebel and by Herr Roerens , one of the leaders ' of the Centre The latter produced , as proof of barbarity , a heavy cane which in one colony had been used in beating the natives . Oyer this aspect of the colonial failure Herr Dernburg was fain to glide easily ; nor would it be just to hold him responsible for the misconduct of men appointed by his predecessors . Yet the need of reform in the treatment of the natives . neither Herr Dernburg nor any one else can deny ; in this respect the German calonial record is black , and Bebel 's assertions are not to be brushed aside with a mere charge of exaggeration . The most significant passage in Jacob H Schiff 's plea at the Zionist mass-meeting , in this city Sunday night , was addressed to the secret agents of the Russian Government , of whose presence in the meeting the speaker felt convinced : I say to you , is it any wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not himself that has made the Jew a revolutionist ; it is the Russian Government . This is a clear admission that the Jews in Russia have become revolutionary . There has always been a pronounced tendency to slur over the part played by Jews in the present Russian disorders , with the benevolent object , no doubt , of representing them as the innocent victims of a murderous autocracy . Especially after the different pogroms , the sympathetic press has been at pains to refute all stories as to the responsibility of Jewish revolutionaries for the outbreak of massacre . It is true that the victims are for the most part innocent and inoffensive , but it is no service to their cause to evade the fact that the Russian Jews are the main support of the revolution , and the most dangerous enemies of the existing regime . This only serves to bring out in a clearer light the iniquities of a system that has driven an entire people to desperate resistance , not only Jewish socialists and agnostics , but even that large part of the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zionism . Increase in the consumption of absinthe is causing some uneasiness in Europe In Belgium , a law has lately been passed forbidding its manufacture , importation , transportation , or sale . A similar measure was adopted in the Canton of Vaud , by a popular vote . The Catholic Congress of Fribourg passed resolutions approving this Swiss initiative In the Journal des Debuts , Dr. Daremberg states that in 1884 France consumed absinthe to the amount of - 49,385 hectolitres , in 1894 , 125,078 , and in 1904 , 207,929 . It is said that the absinthe habit prevails especially among the younger literary folk ; but it is spreading rapidly among business men . The habit increases the liability to tuberculosis , for most patients in the consumptive hospitals in France have been absinthe-drinkers The subject is one of interest in the United States also ; for during the last twenty-five years there has been a considerable increase in absinthe drinking here ; it is usually taken in the form of vermouth , which is an infusion of absinthe in white wine .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
