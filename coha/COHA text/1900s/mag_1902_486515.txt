Far down below those pines the sunset flings , Long arching o'er , its lines of ruddy light , And the wind murmurs little harmonies , And underneath then wings the tender birds Droop their averted heads  --  silent their songs . But not a word whispers the moaning wind ? Nor when in faint array the primal stars Trail with the banners of the unfurled Night ; Nor even when the low-hung moon Just glints , And faintly , with few touches , sears the wood , Not there , not then , doth Nature idly say , Nor whisper idly of another day , That other morn itself its morrow is , That other day shall see no shade of this In ' Captain Craig : A Book of Poems , ' by Edwin Arlington Robinson ( Houghton , Mifflin &; Co. ) , we have the latest work of one of the most promising of our younger poets  --  one who , like so many persons gifted in the same way , has not yet mastered his own powers and has to follow his muse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singleness of mind sometimes defeats itself and leaves his meaning unconveyed . Obscure he may be and has a right to be , for his thoughts are always worth consideration , but it must be frankly owned that he sometimes draws near the unintelligible He brings marvellous color and music into his verse when at his highest point ; yet , like Browning , ho loses himself and his readers in regions of abstract thought But he has a nature innately candid , has no desire to pose , and has been perhaps mainly embarrassed by working too much alone . It may be well for him that his surface has not suavity enough If he said things with more uniform melody , he might be more easily flattered and perverted . A young poet needs some inaccessible domain of even rudeness to which he may retreat to assert himself This book is likely to be passed unnoticed by all indolent readers , and with impatience by those a little more careful , but those more careful still will revert to it again and again , and wish health , fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could write it . There is not a trivial or meaningless thing in it , and when there is obscurity , it is often like that of Emily Dickinson when she piques your curiosity through half a dozen readings and suddenly makes all clear . Such a song ends at last , as this volume does , with a note of triumph ( p 169 ) TWILIGHT SONG Through the shine , through the rain We have shared the day 's load , To the old march again We have tramped the long road , We have laughed , we have cried , And we 've tossed the King 's crown , We have fought , we have died , And we 've trod the day down So it 's lift the- old song Ere the night flies again , Where the road leads along Through the shine , through the rain ? ? Through the Shine , through the rain , We have wrought the day 's quest , To the old march again We have earned the day 's rest , We have laughed , we have cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fought , we have died , And we 've burned the King 's bones , And we lift the old song Ere the night flies again , Where the road leads along Through the shine , through the rain We have long since called attentipa to the meditative and eminently original poems of " Owen Innsley " ( Miss Lucy W. Jennison ) , and it is pleasant to meet again her name on a title-page ; the book in this case being ' Love Songs and Other Poems ' ( The Grafton Press ) . This volume contains , not merely thoughtful and melodious English poems , but also songs in German , French , and Italian , besides many translations ranging from the Spanish to the Russian and modern Greek . We extract this inscription of the book to themiother of the poet : DEDICATION . Mov'st thou , perchance , in strange and starry spheres Afar , beyond the impenetrable night That shrouds the tomb , smiling at the old fears Of death , encircled by all-conquering light ? Or dost thou sleep where thy last bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Careless alike of sunshine and of shade , Of morns that linger and of eves that pass ? Ah ! who shall say ? No eye can pierce the dark , No strained ear tidings catch of weal or woe Out of the silence , and no single spark Blames that portal through which all must go . Yet this we know . Death is a kind of both , And brings one sacred immortality , Thou livest in thy traces left on earth ; Thou livest in thy children 's memory ' The Call of the Sea , and Other Poems , ' by L Frank Tooker ( The Century Co ) , is one of the many volumes justly dedicated to Mr Stedman by grateful young poets , and is one of those few , moreover , in which the very finest poem is judiciously placed first ( p. 3 ) : THE CALL OF THE SEA Day and night I have heard it : " Arise and come to thine own ' The surf is loud on the shore , and the spume is white in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can the land atone For the loss of the vibrant shrouds and the joy of the slanting sail ? " Follow , then , follow the free wind over the waste of gray , The sweep of the billows shall rock thee , the scent of the brine shall allure , Though Death and Oblivion mock thee , thou shalt joy in thy master 's sway , His scouring shall aim thee in might , make thee strong in thine hour to endure . " Over the run of the world make thy uncertain quest , Starlight shall mark thy course , fog and the spindrift bar ; Thou shalt exult in the storm , in the calm of the sea thou shalt rest , Seek danger , and find it not , seek peace , and miss it afar " It will lift thee on wings as an eagle , it will be both singer and song ; A lamp to thy soul in need , a snare to thy wandering feet , Blind to thy love or hate , it will save thee alone of a throng , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rum complete . " Day and night I have heard it : " Arise and come to thine own ! The spume is like smoke in the blast , and the flaws are black on the lee . Thou who art thrall to the winds that over the world are blown , Rejoice in the harping gale , rejoice in the rolling sea ! " This is the high-water mark of the volume ; the low-water mark is to be found in the following unfortunate stanza from the poem " The Messenger " ( p. 127 ) " The sprawling legs and drooping head Of his tired steed enraged him so , That , all his pity being dead , He struck him many a cruel blow . As well expect song from dead lark , 01 color from the rose at dark " ' Poems and Verses , ' by Edward Sandford Martin , the genial author of ' A Little Brother of the Rich , ' will have most interest for many readers by reason of the author 's tribute to a classmate , well known as Governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the dinner of the Harvard Class of 1877 , in Boston , June 29 , 1897 , the year following Gov . Russell 's untimely death : WILLIAM EUSTIS RUSSELL Hard hit ? All , yes ' denial 's vain Far from our thoughts and wishes toe . Stripped of our best , we meet again To share a cup that 's tinged with rue . Dear man , how proud he made as all ! Our honest statesman , patriot , mate , Whose very rivals lived to call His death a mischief to the State ! With shining eyes we watched his course Impetuous to an early goal , A man of an inspiring force , Whose pockets could not hold his soul ! Who strove without surcease or fear , Nor from his task withdrew his band Until the fame of his career Edged the far corners of the land His head was clear , his heart was good , His speech was plum without pretence , Men trusted him as one who stood For honesty and commou-sense . Ali , not timbered is our distress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freemen , leaderless , Still wonder who shall take his place . When one reads the ' Book of Joyous Children ' ( Scribners ) , by James Whitcomb Riley , one feels that such an author has spent the last few non-publishing years to some advantage . The dialect is , of course , that Western child-dialect Cast for last , for instance ) which has been found exasperating to the author 's Eastern readers . But the familiar portion of the dialect is always effective , and one envies the " little tads " for whom it is designed , even if ho does not know from experience what a " tad " is . The illustrations , but that only one source is mentioned , would seem to come from two  --  the one set almost too much idealized , the other too little . The zest and the animal spirits of these verses are inexhaustible , rising to the climax of vocal vigor in the following ( p. 60 ) : BILLY AND HIS DRUM . Ho ! it 's come , kids , come ! With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bangm ' on his big brass druml He 's a-marchin ' round the room , With his feather-duster plume A-noddin ' an ' a-bobbin ' with his bim ! born ' boom !

Of the various Christmas books for children we should select ' A Pocketful of Posies , ' by Abbie Farwell Brown ( Houghton , Mifflin &; Co ) , in which , however , the running border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the page ; and the ' Great Procession and Other Verses for and about Children , ' by Harriet Prescott Spofford ( Boston : Badger ) , which has more charming tales and more felicitous word pictures . The opening words , for instance , on " The Great Procession " prepare for this ( p. 9 ) : " Did you ever happen to think , when dark Lights up the lamps outside the pane , And you look through the glass on that wonderland Where the witches are making their tea In the rain . Of the great procession that says its prayers All the world over , and climbs the stairs , And goes to a wonderland of dreams , Where nothing at all is just what it seems ? " All the world over at eight o'clock , Sad and sorrowful , glad and gay , These with their eyes as bright as dawn , Those almost asleep on the way , This one capering , that one cross , Plaited tresses . or curling floss , Slowly the long procession streams Up to the wonderland of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great procession takes up its way , Where , throwing their faded flower-wreaths down . Little savages tire of play , Though they have no stairs to climb at all , And go to sleep wherever they fall . By the sea 's soft song and the star 's soft gleams They are off to the wonderland of dreams . " The volume ' Up from Georgia , ' by Frank L. Stanton ( Appleton ) , is one of the healthi est Southern books It accepts the past as inevitable , at least , if not fortunate , and , among other things , it presents negro life in as cheery a light as before the war , though the following song ( p. 27 ) may or may not represent that : WHEN THE FALL TIME COMES . There 's eomethin ' like a jingle an ' a tingle in the air , Fer the honey 's lest a-drippin ' from the hives ; The fields are lookin ' frosty with the white that blossoms there .

Summer 's a-goin ' ? Need n't beat the drums , - We 're bound to have a showin ' When the fall time comes ! It is pleasant to see a volume of poems from Minneapolis , where Mr. Arthur Up-son 's Westwind Songs ' is printed ( Brooks ) . These pages do not , like the same author 's ' Octaves in an Oxford Garden , ' show the imprint of one atmosphere only , but range from the Avon to Mackinaw , and even include the Bodleian Library and " The Flying Cranes " at Crane Island , as well as the wheat elevators of the West and a letter of approbation from Carmen Sylva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same author , ' Poems , ' by Arthur Upson and George Norton Northrop ( Minneapolis : Brooks ) , we have varied music , with many suggestions of great composers It is beautifully printed , apparently for " members of the Samovar Club , " but shows an unhappy whim or mannerism by which'all compounding hyphens are abandoned , and we read not only of " redgold " and " terrace-stair , " but of " blossomchalices " and " tearosetrees . " There comes from San Francisco an attractive volume , ' Songs of the Press and Other Adventures in Verse , ' by Bailey Millard ( Elder &; Shepard ) . The author has that private fault , commonest in journalism , of unexpectedly complaining of his " own sad unworth " in a dedication to his mother , but his strictly professional poems are sometimes full of vigor , like that of the " Lamore Scoop , " a railway tribute to a girl reporter ( p. 18 ) . The book has sonnets also to " Thoreau of Walden " ( p. 111 ) , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread " , and " to Edward Carpenter in England " ( p 101 ) , and to one of the most heroic figures of the nineteenth century , John Muir , the explorer ( p. 48 ) : MUIR OF THE MOUNTAINS . A lean , wild-haired wild-bearded , craggy man , Wild as a Modoc , and as unafraid , A man to go his way with no man 's aid , Yet sweet and soft of heart as any maid . Sky-loving , stalwart as the sugar-pine , Clean , simple , fragrant as that noble tree , A mountain man , and free as they are free Who tread the heights and know tranquillity . A man whose speech hints of no studied art . But careless straying as the stream that flows , And full of grace , poetic as the rose Which to the wind its pure song-petals throws . A relish of the larger life is his , And reverence rapt and wonder and deep awe For any beauty Nature 's brush may draw , A man of faith who keeps each primal law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasional books of almost international poetry which come through the Golden Gate , the fruit of foreign travel thither , sometimes Japanese , then Spanish and then again English . We find such , for instance , in ' Moods and Outdoor Verses ' ( San Francisco : Elder &; Shepard ) , by Richard Askham , with a word of introduction by Edwin Markham . This book was apparently written mostly in California ; the " Envoi " is dated at San Francisco , its place of publication ; but the printing was done in London , and the introduction written in New York . There is an agreeable flavor of genuineness and sympathy in the verses ; and Mr. Markham has something to learn from his English . friends as respects entire simplicity of manner . In one of the poems , apparently written across the water , one finds an agreeable mingling of the two atmospheres  --  or hemispheres ( p. 86 ) . IN ENGLAND ? MAY . ( To ? at the piano . ) If mine could write it as your fingers play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park and palings , you should feel The sea-breeze blowing through the Golden Gate Among the many-shouldered hills . The Bay Would bid us out again on holiday , And Tamalpais would set his perfect line Against the blazing noon . And you and I Would make a lovers ' picnic in a nook By some deep runnel , that carves out his way Among the naked roots of giant trees Darkening up above , ? ancient until The wonder of the centuries of Man Seems as a child 's . Then while the shredded light Twinkled about the gloom of those huge limbs Circling us in  --  then would we sigh and say , " How good to be in England , just for May ! " ' Wild Roses of California ' ( San Francisco : Robertson ) has the same bright coloring with the rest , and the same background of flowers ; but it has , beyond most of these books , a touch of human interest , and indeed of Wordsworthian simplicity , in the following ( p. 26 ) : THE MINER 'S LITTLE DAUGHTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tunnels dark . I sing so much he often says I am his " meadow-lark . " Our little cabin on the hill Is ' mid the tall straight pines , That seem to Whisper all the day To me about the mines . I 've twined some vines about the door , I keep the house with care . My father calls our cabin home His " castle in the air . " I never put my clean gown on Till just before our tea , Because when father first comes home He 's black as black can be . And when he 's coming up the trail , As soon as him I see , I fly to meet him , and he leaves Some black , of course , on me . The man for whom my father works Is very rich , I 'm told ; For he owns land and houses fine , And mines just full of gold . I 'm rich , I 've treasures in the mines , ? " As good as gold " is he ; It 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves me . It is interesting to find our new Finnish fellow-citizens contributing like their predecessors to American literature , as in the very interesting and promising little volume ' English Lyrics of a Finnish Harp , ' by Herman Montague Donner ( Boston : Badger ) . The increasing interchange between English-speaking nations as regards authors and commercial houses threatens , however , to make local coloring in literature a thing of the past . Here , for instance , is a volume of ' Poems ' by Mary Olcott ( John Lane ) , It is dedicated " to Nora Duff in England , " with a Greek motto . One of the poems has a title in Greek characters , others are translated from French , and , in short , there is not enough of local coloring in the whole book to show where the poems , as a whole , were written . Thereis much of thought and beauty in it , but the Prelude leaves it more perplexing than all the rest put together : - " I hide within my book till eyes Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , yet give no heed : The printed word has no surprise For alien eyes . " Whoever reads , save only one , May read . But one alone shall find The impress of the hidden mind , Uttering speech where speech is none For but the one . " A fortunate woman is the English Lady Lindsay , who gives herself and others each year a new and happy enjoyment . This year 's book is entitled ' A Christmas Posy ' ( London : Kegan Paul ) . This author is one of a class , never abundant , now diminishing , who can sing at Christmas tide , each year , a fresh supply of simple Christmas lays or Noels of many lands , and especially from the bewitching old Provencal dialect-lays . The following ( p. 50 ) is , however , an imitation , not a translation , and its cadence is singularly suggestive of William Blake : IN A GARDEN WILD . There is a garden , A garden wild , And in it wanders A little child . The angels are fraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches The birds sing sweet . And who can know How His heart may yearn , Or who can see What His eyes discern ? But Mary is calling : " Come home , my son ; The shadows are falling , The day is done . " ' This is for You : Love Poems of the Saner Sort , ' selected by William Sinclair Lord ( Revell ) , ranges from Tennyson to Phcebe Cary , and has a little tone of mediocrity , while gathering in some pieces undeservedly neglected , like John Moultrie 's ' Forget Thee ' ( p. 58 ) . The title is the poorest part ; the contents are valuable , and singularly free from misprints or undesirable readings . Mr. Frederic Lawrence Knowles has boldly printed a volume of four hundred pages called ' A Treasury of Humorous Poetry ' ( Boston : Estes ) , containing but an unusually small proportion of mere buffoonery like the burlesque on Wordsworth ( p. 16 ) and that on Tennyson ( p. 19 ) . Allowing for a few such exceptions , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the selection and the notes do credit to one of the most discriminating of our younger literary men .
