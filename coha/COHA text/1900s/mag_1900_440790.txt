A WIGWAM of weather-stained canvas stood at the base of some irregularly ascending hills . A footpath wound its way gently down the sloping land till it reached the broad river bottom ; creeping through the long swamp grasses that bent over it on either side , it came out on the edge of the Missouri . Here , morning , noon , and evening , my mother came to draw water from the muddy stream for our household use . Always , when my mother started for the river , I stopped my play to run along with her . She was only of medium height . Often she was sad and silent , at which times her full arched lips were compressed into hard and bitter lines , and shadows fell under her black eyes . Then I clung to her hand and begged to know what made the tears fall . " Hush ; my little daughter must never talk about my tears ; " and smiling through them , she patted my head and said , " Nov let me see how fast you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away at my highest possible speed , with my long black hair blowing in the breeze . I was a wild little girl of seven . Loosely clad in a slip of brown buckskin , and light-footed with a pair of soft moccasins on my feet , I was as free as the wind that blew my hair , and no less spirited than a bounding deer . These were my mother 's pride , ? my wild free- dom and overflowing spirits . She taught me no fear save that of intruding myself upon others . Having gone many paces ahead I stopped , panting for breath , and laughing with glee as my mother watched my every movement . I was not wholly conscious of myself , but was more keenly alive to the fire within . It was as if I were the activity , and my hands and feet were only experiments for my spirit to work upon . Returning from the river , I tugged beside my mother , with my hand upon the bucket I believed I was carrying . One time , on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . My grown-up cousin , Warca-Ziwin ( Sunflower ) , who was then seventeen , always went to the river alone for water for her mother . Their wigwam was not far from ours ; and I saw her daily going to and from the river . I admired my cousin greatly . So I said : " Mother , when I am tall as my cousin Warca-Ziwin , you shall not have to come for water . I will do it for you . " With a strange tremor in her voice which I could not understand , she answered , " If the paleface does not take away from us the river we drink . " " Mother , who is this bad paleface ? " I asked . " My little daughter , he is a sham , ? a sickly sham ! The bronzed Dakota is the only real man .

My mother used to say to me , as I was almost bounding away for the old people : " Wait a moment before you invite any one . If other plans are being discussed , do not interfere , but go elsewhere . " The old folks knew the meaning of my pauses ; and often they coaxed my confidence by asking , " What do you seek , little granddaughter ? " " My mother says you are to come to our tepee this evening , " I instantly exploded , and breathed the freer afterwards . " Yes , yes , gladly , gladly I shall come ! " each replied . Rising at once and carrying their blankets across one shoulder , they flocked leisurely from their various wigwams toward our dwelling . My mission done , I ran back , skipping and jumping with delight . All out of breath , I told my mother almost the exact words of the answers to my invitation . Frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered their tepee ? " This taught me to remember all I saw at a single glance . Often I told my mother my impressions without being questioned . While in the neighboring wigwams sometimes an old Indian woman asked me , " What is your mother doing ? " Unless my mother had cautioned me not to tell , I generally answered her questions without reserve . At the arrival of our guests I sat close to my mother , and did not leave her side without first asking her consent . I ate my supper in quiet , listening patiently to the talk of the old people , wishing all the time that they would begin the stories I loved best . At last , when I could not wait any longer , I whispered in my mother 's ear , " Ask them to tell an Iktomi story , mother . " Soothing my impatience , my mother // said aloud , " My little daughter is anxious to hear your legends . " By this time all were through eating , and the evening was fast deepening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legend , I pillowed my head in my mother 's lap ; and lying flat upon my back , I watched the stars as they peeped down upon me , one by one . The increasing interest of the tale aroused me , and I sat up eagerly listening for every word . The old women made funny remarks , and laughed so heartily that I could not help joining them . The distant howling of a pack of wolves or the hooting of an owl in the river bottom frightened me , and I nestled into my mother 's lap . She added some dry sticks to the open fire , and the bright flames leaped up into the faces of the old folks as they sat around in a great circle . On such an evening , I remember the glare of the fire shone on a tattooed star upon the brow of the old warrior who was telling a story . I watched him curiously as he made his unconscious gestures . The blue star upon his bronzed forehead was a puzzle to me . Looking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the old women . The rest had none . I examined my mother 's face , but found no sign there . After the warrior 's story was finished , I asked the old woman the meaning of the blue lines on her chin , looking all the while out of the corners of my eyes at the warrior with the star on his forehead . I was a little afraid that he would rebuke me for my boldness . Here the old woman began : " Why , my grandchild , they are signs , ? secret signs I dare not tell you . I shall , however , tell you a wonderful story about a woman who had a cross tattooed upon each of her cheeks . " It was a long story of a woman whose magic power lay hidden behind the marks upon her face .

Returning our borrowed belts and trinkets , we rambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to sleep over my legends . IV . THE COFFEE-MAKIYG . One summer afternoon , my mother left me alone in our wigwam , while she went across the way to my aunt 's dwelling . I did not much like to stay alone in our tepee , for I feared a tall , broad-shouldered crazy man , some forty years old , who walked loose among the hills . Wiyaka-Napbina ( Wearer of a Feather Necklace ) was harmless , and whenever he came into a wigwam lie was driven there by extreme hunger . He went nude except for the half of a red blanket he girdled around his waist . In one tawny arm he used to carry a heavy bunch of wild sunflowers that he gathered in his aimless ramblings . His black hair was matted by the winds , and scorched into a dry red by the constant summer sun . As be took great strides , placing one brown bare foot directly in front of the other , he swung his long lean arm to and fro . Frequently he paused in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his band . He was under the belief that an evil spirit was haunting his steps . This was what my mother told me once , when I sneered at such a silly big man . I was brave when my mother was near by , and Wiyaka-Napbina walking farther and farther away . " Pity the man , my child . I knew ? him when he was a brave and handsome youth . He was overtaken by a malicious spirit among the hills , one day , when he went hither and thither after his ponies . Since then he can not stay away from the hills , " she said . I felt so sorry for the man in his misfortune that I prayed to the Great Spirit to restore him . But though I pitied him at a distance , I was still afraid of him when he appeared near our wigwam . Thus , when my mother left me by myself that afternoon , I sat in a fearful mood within our tepee . I recalled all I had ever heard about Wiyaka-Napbina ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , he would not come to our wigwam because there was no little girl around our grounds . Just then , from without a hand lifted the canvas covering of the entrance ; the shadow of a man fell within the wigwam , and a large roughly moccasined foot was planted inside . For a moment I did not dare to breathe or stir , for I thought that could be no other than Wiyaka-Napbina . The next instant I sighed aloud in relief . It was an old grandfather who had often told me Iktomi legends . " Where is your mother , my little grandchild ? " were his first words . " My mother is soon coming back from my aunt 's tepee , " I replied . " Then I shall wait awhile for her return , " he said , crossing his feet and seating himself upon a mat . At once I began to play the part of a generous hostess . I turned to may mother 's coffeepot . Lifting the lid , I found nothing but coffee grounds in the bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the centre , and filled it half full of warm Missouri River water . During this performance I felt conscious of being watched . Then breaking off a small piece of our unleavened bread , I placed it in a bowl . Turning soon to the coffeepot , which would never have boiled on a dead fire had I waited forever , I poured out a cup of worse than muddy warm water . Carrying the bowl in one hand and cup in the other , I handed the light luncheon to the old warrior . I offered them to him // with the air of bestowing generous hospitality . " How ! how ! " he said ; and placed the dishes on the ground in front of his crossed feet . He nibbled at the bread and sipped from the cup . I sat back against a pole watching him . I was proud to have succeeded so well in serving refreshments to a guest all by myself . Before the old warrior had finished eating , my mother entered . Immediately she wondered where I had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that she had left the coffeepot empty . Answering the question in my mother 's eyes , the warrior remarked , " My granddaughter made coffee on a heap of dead ashes , and served me the moment I came . " They both laughed , and mother said , " Wait a little longer , and I shall build a fire . " She meant to make some real coffee . But neither she nor the warrior , whom the law of our custom had compelled to partake of my insipid hospitality , said anything to embarrass me . They treated my best judgment , poor as it was , with the utmost respect . It was not till long years afterward that I learned how ridiculous a thing I had done . V. THE DEAD MAN 'S PLUM BUSH . One autumn afternoon , many people came streaming toward the dwelling of our near neighbor . With painted faces , and wearing broad white bosoms of elk 's teeth , they hurried down the narrow footpath to Haraka Wambdi 's wigwam . Young mothers held their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their haste . They overtook and passed by the bent old grandmothers who were trudging along with crooked canes toward the centre of excitement . Most of the young braves galloped hither on their ponies . Toothless warriors , like the old women , came more slowly , though mounted on lively ponies . They sat proudly erect on their horses . They wore their eagle plumes , and waved their various trophies of former wars . In front of the wigwam a great fire was built , and several large black kettles of venison were suspended over it . The crowd were seated about it on the grass in a great circle . Behind them some of the braves stood leaning against the necks of their ponies , their tall figures draped in loose robes which were well drawn over their eyes . Young girls , with their faces glowing like bright red autumn leaves , their glossy braids falling over each ear , sat coquettishly beside their chaperons . It was a custom for young Indian women to invite some older relative to escort them to the public feasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generally observed . Haraka Wambdi was a strong young brave , who had just returned from his first battle , a warrior . His near relatives , to celebrate his new rank , were spreading a feast to which the whole of the Indian village was invited . Holding my pretty striped blanket in readiness to throw over my shoulders , I grew more and more restless as I watched the gay throng assembling . My mother was busily broiling a wild duck that my aunt had that morning brought over . " Mother , mother , why do you stop to cook a small meal when we are invited to a feast ? " I asked , with a snarl in my voice . " My child , learn to wait . On our way to the celebration we are going to stop at Chanyu 's wigwam . His aged mother-in-law is lying very ill , and I think she would like a taste of this small game . " Having once seen the suffering on the thin , pinched features of this dying woman , I felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On our way , I ran ahead of my mother , and was reaching out my hand to pick some purple plums that grew on a small bush , when I was checked by a low " Sh ! " from my mother . " Why , mother , I want to taste the plums ! " I exclaimed , as I dropped my hand to my side in disappointment . " Never pluck a single plum from this bush , my child , for its roots are wrapped around an Indian 's skeleton . A brave is buried here . While he lived , lie was so fond of playing the game of striped plum seeds that , at his death , his set of plum seeds were buried in his hands . From them sprang up this little bush . " Eyeing the forbidden fruit , I trod lightly on the sacred ground , and dared to speak only in whispers , until we had gone many paces from it . After that time , I halted in my ramblings whenever I came in sight of the plum bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear a long-drawn-out whistle rise from the roots of it . Though I had never heard with my own ears this strange whistle of departed spirits , yet I had listened so frequently to hear the old folks describe it that I knew I should recognize it at once . The lasting impression of that clay , as I recall it now , is what my mother told me about the dead man 's plum bush . VI . THE GROUND SQUIRREL . In the busy autumn days , my cousin Warca-Ziwin 's mother came to our wigwam to help my mother preserve foods for our winter use . I was very fond of my aunt , because she was not so quiet as my mother . Though she was older , she was inure jovial and less reserved . She was slender and remarkably erect . While my mother 's hair was heavy and black , my aunt had unusually thin locks . Ever since I knew her , she wore a string of large blue beads around her neck , ? beads that were precious because my uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . She had a peculiar swing in her gait , caused by a long stride rarely natural to so slight a figure . It was during my aunt 's visit with us that my mother forgot her accustomed quietness , often laughing heartily at some of my aunt 's witty remarks . I loved my aunt threefold : for her hearty laughter , for the cheerfulness she caused my mother , and most of all for the times she dried my tears and held me in her lap , when my mother had reproved me . Early in the cool mornings , just as the yellow rim of the sun rose above the hills , we were up and eating our breakfast . We awoke so early that we saw the sacred hour when a misty smoke hung over a pit surrounded by an impassable sinking mire . This strange smoke appeared every morning , both winter and summer ; but most visibly in midwinter it rose immediately above the marshy spot . By the time the full face of the sun appeared above the eastern horizon , the smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country the longest , said that the smoke from this pit had never failed a single day to rise heavenward . As I frolicked about our dwelling , I used to stop suddenly , and with a fearful awe watch the smoking of the unknown fires . While the vapor was visible , I was afraid to go very far from our wigwam unless I went with my mother . From a field in the fertile river bottom my mother and aunt gathered an abundant supply of corn . Near our tepee , they spread a large canvas upon the grass , and dried their sweet corn in it . I was left to watch the co : n , that nothing should disturb it . I played around it with dolls made of ears of corn . I braided their soft fine silk for hair , and gave them blankets as various as the scraps I found in my mother 's workbag . There was a little stranger with a black-and-yellow-striped coat that used // to come to the drying corn . It was a little ground squirrel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one corner of the canvas and carried away as much of the sweet corn as he could hold . I wanted very much to catch him , and rub his pretty fur back , but my mother said he would be so frightened if I caught him that lie would bite my fingers . So I was as content as he to keep the corn between us . Every morning he came for more corn . Some evenings I have seen him creeping about our grounds ; and when I gave a sudden whoop of recognition , he ran quickly out of sight . When mother had dried all the corn she wished , then she sliced great pumpkins into thin rings ; and these she doubled and linked together into long chains . She hung them on a pole that stretched between two forked posts . The wind and sun soon thoroughly dried the chains of pumpkin . Then she poked them away in a case of thick and stiff buckskin . In the sun and wind she also dried many wild fruits , ? cherries , berries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that one of the corn drying and the ground squirrel . I have few memories of winter days , at this period of my life , though many of the summer . There is one only which I can recall . Some missionaries gave me a little bag of marbles . They were all sizes and colors . Among them were some of colored glass . Walking with my mother to the river , on a late winter day , we found great chunks of ice piled all along the bank . The ice on the river was floating in huge pieces . As I stood beside one large block , I noticed for the first time the colors of the rainbow in the crystal ice . Immediately I thought of my glass marbles at home . With my bare fingers I tried to pick out some of the colors , for they seemed so near the surface . But my fingers began to sting with the intense cold , and I had to bite them hard to keep from crying . From that day on , for many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of them . VII . THE BIG RED APPLES . The first turning away from the easy , natural flow of my life occurred in an early spring . It was in my eighth year ; in the month of March , I afterward learned . At this age I knew but one language , and that was my mother 's native tongue . From some of my playmates I heard that two paleface missionaries were in our village . They were from that class of white men who wore big hats and carried large hearts , they said . Running direct to my mother , I began to question her why these two strangers were among us . She told me , after I had teased much , that they had come to take away Indian boys and girls to the East . My mother did not seem to want me to talk about them . But bi a day or two , I gleaned many wonderful stories from my playfellows concerning the strangers . " Mother , my friend Juddwin is going home with the missionaries . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palefaces told her so ! " I said wistfully , wishing in my heart that I too might go . Mother sat in a chair , and I was hanging on her knee . Within the last two seasons my big brother Dawie had returned from a three years ' education in the East , and his coming back influenced my mother to take a farther step from her native way of living . First it was a change from the buffalo skin to the white man 's canvas that covered our wigwam . Now she had given up her wigwam of slender poles , to live , a foreigner , in a home of clumsy logs . " Yes , my child , several others besides 46 Impressions of ' an Indian Childhood . Judclwin are going away with the palefaces . Your brother said the missionaries had inquired about his little sister , " she said , watching my face very closely . My heart thumped so hard against my breast , I wondered if she could hear it . " Did he tell them to take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forbidden the palefaces to see me , and that my hope of going to the Wonderland would be entirely blighted . With a sad , slow smile , she answered : " There ! I knew you were wishing to go , because Judewin has filled your ears with the white men 's lies . Do n't believe a word they say ! Their words are sweet , but , my child , their deeds are bitter . You will cry for me , but they will not even soothe you . Stay with me , my little one ! Your brother Daw6e. says that going East , away from your mother , is too hard an experience for his baby sister . " Thus my mother discouraged my curiosity about the lands beyond oar eastern horizon ; for it was not yet an ambition for Letters that was stirring me . But on the following day the missionaries ( lid come to our very house . I spied them coming up the footpath leading to our cottage . A third man was with them , but he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreter , a paleface who had a smattering of the Indian language . I was ready to run out to meet them , but I did not dare to displease my mother . With great glee , I jumped up and down on our ground floor . I begged my mother to open the door , that they would be sure to come to us . Alas ! They came , they saw , and they conquered ! Jud6win had told inc of the great tree where grew red , red apples ; and how we could reach out our hands and pick all the red apples we could eat . I had never seen apple trees . I had never tasted more than a dozen red apples in my life ; and when I heard of the orchards of the East , I was eager to roam among them . The missionaries smiled into my eyes , and patted my head . I wondered how mother could say such hard words against them . " Mother , ask them if little girls may have all the red apples they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in my excitement . The interpreter heard me , and answered : " Yes , little girl , the nice red apples are for those who pick them ; and you will have a ride on the iron horse if you go with these good people . " I had never seen a train , and he knew it . " Mother , I ' m going East ! I like big red apples , and I want to ride on the iron horse ! Mother , say yes ! " I pleaded . My mother said nothing . The missionaries waited in silence ; and my eyes began to blur with tears , though I struggled to choke them back . The corners of my mouth twitched , and my mother saw me . " I am not ready to give you any word , " she said to them . " To-morrow I shall send you my answer by my son . " With this they left us . Alone with my mother , I yielded to my tears , and cried aloud , shaking my head so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the first time I had ever been so unwilling to give up my own desire that I refused to hearken to my mother 's voice . There was a solemn silence in our home that night . Before I went to bed I begged the Great Spirit to make my mother willing I should go with the missionaries . The next morning came , and my mother called me to her side . " My daughter , do you still persist in wishing to leave your mother f " she asked . " Oh , mother , it is not that I wish to leave you , but I want to see the wonderful Eastern land , " I answered . My dear old aunt came to our house that morning , and I heard her say , " Let her try it . " I hoped that , as usual , my aunt was // pleading on my side . My brother Davao came for mother 's decision . I dropped my play , and crept close to my aunt . " Yes , Daw6e , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , is anxious to go . She will need an education when she is grown , for then there will be fewer real Dakotas , and many more palefaces . This tearing her away , so young , from her mother is necessary , if I would have her an educated woman . The palefaces , who owe us a large debt for stolen lands , have begun to pay a tardy justice in offering some education to our children . But I know my daughter must suffer keenly in this experiment . For her sake , I dread to tell you my reply to the missionaries . Go , tell them that they may take my little daughter , and that the Great Spirit shall not fail to reward them accordin to their hearts . " Wrapped in my heavy bt , I walked with my mother to the carriage that was soon to take us to the iron horse . I was happy . I met my playmates , who were also wearing their best thick blankets . We showed one another our new beaded moccasins , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon we were being drawn rapidly away by the white man 's horses . When I saw the lonely figure of my mother vanish hi the distance , a sense of regret settled heavily upon me . I felt suddenly weak , as if I might fall limp to the ground . I was in the hands of strangers whom my mother did not fully trust . I no longer felt free to be myself , or to voice my own feelings . The tears trickled down my cheeks , and I buried my face in the folds of my blanket . Now the first step , parting me from my mother , was taken , and all my belated tears availed nothing . Having driven thirty miles to the ferryboat , we crossed the Missouri in the evening . Then riding again a few miles eastward , we stopped before a massive brick building . I looked at it in amazement , and with a vague misgiving , for in our village I had never seen so large a house . Trembling with fear and distrust of the palefaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept noiselessly in my soft moccasins along the narrow hall , keeping very close to the bare wall . I was as frightened and bewildered as the captured young of a wild creature .
