I AM not one who derides that excellent institution , the New England conscience ; without it , I do not see how we could ever have had a New England , or where our literature would be to-day . Other countries have their special virtues , but it remained for New England to have a conscience ; let us cherish it , therefore , just as if it were as large and overpowering as our writers have loved to pretend . Let us not hold with those who act as if the New England conscience were a morbid pathological symptom , like the overgrown liver of the Strasburg goose . I respect , too , its offspring , the yachtsman 's conscience , ? which is New England conscience on its mother 's side , and man-o ' - war etiquette on its father 's . Although I do not pounce on uncoiled ropes and coil them up with that fierce passion with which a New England housekeeper attacks the attic during the spring house-cleaning , and while I here confess that I do not feel disgraced forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still , I think the yachtsman 's conscience is a fine and noble thing , though often arbitrary in its workings , and occasionally somewhat artificial in its punctiliousness . Still , the conscience impresses me less than it did before I saw it at work in a foreign country . I had imagined it a stable quantity , as potent and as up and a-doing anywhere in the world as it is at home . This is not so . There are forces bigger than it , and I purpose to tell the story of its undoing . In the first place , Stan would have saved himself much trouble had he realized from the beginning that a craft forty feet over all , twenty-four foot water line , six-foot beam , and drawing four inches of water , should no more be considered a yacht than a toboggan or a snowshoe . Toboggan , snowshoe , and gondola are all highly specialized vehicles of transportation , called into being by peculiar conditions ; and as a toboggan should not be confused with a real sleigh , neither 756 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real boat ; nor do I think Stan would have so considered it , but for his yachtsman 's conscience ; for while we were in Venice it seemed as if on its mother 's side it harked back to some New England house-cleaning grandmother , the kind that ariseth ere it is light ? and makes all the rest of the family rise too . It did not wake , the first day . It lay in wait for the moment when we should have a gondola of our own . We did not imagine in the beginning that we should have a gondola ; an unpretentious sandolo , propelled by a beautiful but rascally little boy , seemed to us nearer the kind of boats we were used to , and more in keeping with the humble station in life to which God has called us . We had hardly said sandolo to each other , when , by some mysterious wireless , news of its was sent forth and half a dozen sandolo boys were yapping under our windows . " Those sandolos are in filthy shape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Austrians left Venice . We 'll try one , though , " he conceded , with gloom . Our sandolo darted off with its peculiar rocking motion . " This boat , " Stan announced with conviction , " wo n't be a safe boat for the baby . If we ever send the baby and - nurse out alone , I sha n't feel comfortable a second . " Which , being translated , meant that Stan wanted a gondola like those that passed us , arching their lovely necks proudly , their gondoliers sporting bright-colored sashes . One of these our sandolo hurtled rudely , at which the gondola turned on us sidewise , with , it seemed to me , a proud , wounded look . Stan 's eye rested on this gondola with an expression such as 1 have known it to wear only for a boat he is falling in love with . " There 's no doubt about it , " he said accusingly , " sandolos are crank boats . I 'm getting too old to take risks . " ? " Risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtuous manner connoted , " I shall not . " We dismissed the sandolo , and Stan went out for a walk . Later , he returned with a glow on his face which means , " I have found a boat I like . " " I 've been looking , " he said , " at a perfect peach of a sandolo . You ought to see it ! You can see your face in it , " he added reassuringly , as though a sandolo you could see your face in were less crank than those on which the varnish had worn off . " flow much is it a week ? " I asked . " A week ! " Stan echoed . " It 's not for rent ? it 's for sale ! And at.such a price ! You could n't fail to get back on it sometime what you paid for it . The man , " he added , with a touch of self-consciousness , " sent his children out in it every day . " It is a curious fact that Stan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any boat he rents , as if the very fact that a boat belongs to lam creates some mysterious bond between them , which causes it to render him some occult allegiance , by which it pledges itself not to drown him or his . " I do n't suppose we could buy a sandolo , " he went on , " still ? there ' s no harm in looking at her ! " We went together . She was a beautiful boat , and everything that our boats usually were not . She sat : there in the little canal and sparkled impertinent and alluring eyes at us . We neither of us spoke of the sandolo that afternoon , for we both knew if we did its purchase was as good as accomplished ; we knew , too , that dearly as we wanted it we could n't afford it , and yet , not to buy it offended our New England principles of economy . Moreover , while we stood in its beguiling presence , Stan had heard my unspoken pleading : " 011 , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I make no doubt we should have bought it , if that evening , when we returned home , there had not been drawn up before our riva the most beautiful gondola in Venice . It was a gondola from to Vein- // tian novella . Its forward part was over-kid with rich carving of acanthus leaves , interwoven in , pleasant design ? just enough to give the effect of a little extra splendor ; to put this gondola in a class above the ordinary cab-stand gondola . In it stood a red-faced gondolier . His striped jersey was torn and dirty , and his cap , one of those long , pointed ones worn as night-caps by men in France , lacked a tassel , but there was something appealing about him which made one love him . He seemed like a bedraggled Newfoundland dog , who for want of a master and a proper home has been sleeping in I he rain . He looked at us with his faithful dog 's eyes , leaning at ease on his oar , in a pose as picturesque as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . He smiled at us trustingly and said in soft Venetian , " I have brought the gondola of the Signori . " I turned to Stan . I had expected ? and sneakingly I had hoped ? to see the expression on his face which means that nothing shall stand between him and his desire ; which means that he is willing to go without shoes ? yes , and make his wife and child go without shoes  - -   - -   rather than give up the boat he wants . Instead , he looked as though he pitied that splendid gondola . " Here , you , " he cried to the man , " behold ! Why do n't you ? why do n't von " He turned to me , his face its frequent impatient red ; he does not like to ; ink me for foreign words . " Margery , what 's the word for brass ? " " Metal " was the only translation I could give him . " ? Why do n't you clean your metal ? " lie demanded . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clic ! Che ! Chet " clicked Stan , and waggled his forefinger as he had learned to do in Tuscany . The man spread his hands and tilted his head in a charming gesture of deprecation . Ile reminded one of a dog thatbegs pardon with the lifting of a floppy paw . His gesture conveyed to us subtly that while he thought lie had cleaned his brass , we evidently knew better . " It 's a shame , " said Stan , " to see a beautiful boat like that with dirty brass ! Think what she 'd be like if those dolphins did n't look like a ship 's galley just after dinner ! " Here it was that the New England conscience stirred in its sleep . " Fin going to hire that boat , " he asserted , " and get that brass bright . " This was no subterfuge to get hold of the boat . Not a sail did I get in her that afternoon . Stan sent the man , whose name was Giuseppe , for what is used in Venice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Putz Pomade with which I was accustomed to shine up the brass on our boats at home . Giuseppe gave the brasses what is known as " a lick and a promise , " and stood smiling and obedient before us , waiting to start forth , only to hear Stan say , ? " That ' s not clean ! That 's not the way to polish brass ! Give here ! " and for want of Italian words he gave Giuseppe an object-lesson in the art of polishing brass . I once knew a narrow-built New England woman , who , when I commented on the spotlessness of her house , said drearily , " Yes , I fight it day and night . " So Stan " fought it " ? he fought it on the dolphins , he fought it on the /err ? , he fought it on the scroll on the stern . And perceiving that he was not getting the worth of his gondolier 's services , he had the cushions and carpet removed upon the riva , and there brushed and beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my afternoon of glory was taken from me bit by bit . " There ! " said Stan , the afternoon being finished , " now that gondola looks as it ought to ! I 'm sorry we ca n't hire it . " But I have New England blood of my own . 758 The Conscience " Ca n't hire it ! " I repeated . The waste of cleaning some one else 's gondola affronted me . " We 've got to have it . " Stan gave me a look which meant , " The price of this gondola be on your head ! " " Come to-morrow at eight , " he commanded . II I woke up next morning with a joyful fear , like a child at Christmas . Perhaps , after all , Santa Claus had not come ! Perhaps , after all , there was no gondola ! Stan apparently shared my feelings , for all I could see of him was'the back of his pajamas ; the rest of him hung perilously out of the window . I hurried to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stan turned toward me with a sour scowl . It had . A little way down San Vio lay our splendid gondola , and without its face washed or its hair combed . Giuseppe , unshaven , lay , coiled up on its soft cushions and slumbered . " Look at that brass ! " said Stan . " Hey , Giuseppe ! " The word was taken up down the Vio . " I-Iey , Giuseppe ! Your Signori , Giuseppe ! " Small boys echoed it from side streets , with , " Hey , Giuseppe ! " He was evidently a well-known figure of the quarter . " Asleep again , Giuseppe ! " He sprang to his feet . " Eccomi ! Eccomi ! " he cried cheerfully . " Your metal ! " shouted Stan from the window . " Your metal I ? I can see dust an inch thick from here on the gondola , " ? he turned and spoke to me across the space of wall between our two windows , in a tone suggesting that Iliad failed in my housewifely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to hold your job if you do n't keep your metal bright ? " was what he attempted to bawl , in Italian . His tone conveyed to Giuseppe that it would be best for him to begin cleaning the gondola , and suddenly . and the Gondola Stan began dressing . After each garment he poked a suspicious head out of the window . Now he muttered things to me about the shiftlessness of Italians , and again he threw a warning cry to Giuseppe . When he had finished dressing , he swallowed a cup of coffee and went to his house-cleaning . I found him , after my own leisurely breakfast , rubbing his handkerchief on one piece of brass after another , to see if any dirt came off ; and as of ten as he rubbed , he turned the accusing bit of linen on Giuseppe in stern silence , and Giuseppe , quelled , hastened to the offending spot . This morning he seemed more like a devoted , well-meaning dog than ever . One could imagine his tongue hanging out of his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a clever imitation of a man who has realized that the polishing of brass is a serious matter . But even after the gondola was faultless , the bright morning was still darkened by the dilapidated appearance of Giuseppe . " That man has got to keep . himself cleaner . He ' s got to wear better clothes , " Stan announced . He conveyed this at once to Giuseppe . " I ' m a poor man , " Giuseppe deprecated gently . " In other times I had many clothes ? sashes , scarfs ? ah , I shone in those days ! Now ? " he wagged a finger ; he had no other clothes , not a rag , was what his finger eloquently told us ; and somehow further conveyed to us that his nakedness was no fault of his own ? that he had suffered wrongs and injustice . " I know a shop , " he continued , " where clothes for gondoliers abound . If the Signori ? " Stan ignored this suggestion . " We will go , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a bad thing to be too strong-minded . It wears out the character . We had been strong-minded as we could be all clay , and we were so occupied in San Salvatore , in saying strong-mindedly that it was not our business to provide gondoliers with their clothing , that I , for one , have no more memory of that church than had I never been there ; but I am sure , if I were to go into lt , strong-mindedness would again rush over me . What I do remember is the inside of a stuffy shop , piled full of blue garments , and another little shop , gay with bolts of bright-colored silk and cotton with which gondoliers make their scarfs and sashes . That ' s what comes of being too strong-minded . The reaction is disastrous . As I look back on it now , the score between the East and West stood thus at the end of that first day : one for the West : Stan had got his brass cleaned ; five for the East : Giuseppe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , of course , we were not conscious of the struggle for supremacy which Giuseppe on the one hand , and we on the other , were fighting out . The New England conscience had been victorious in one , ? and wheedling , soft-spoken , beguiling Italy in the other . Moreover , Giuseppe had seen Stan 's passion for cleanliness , and had used his knowledge swiftly and efficiently , and we knew it , though Giuseppe tried to throw the sand of gratitude in our eyes . III As I look back , I can well trace that silent battle of which at the time I was not so much as aware . We would begin the day with an apparent victory , for the early morning hours were spent in overseeing Giuseppe not doing his work . I can see now that we spent our strength too freely in the first part of the day . We felt that we had really accomplished something , and were disarmed , and would let Giuseppe and the gondola take us where they would . Without our knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . They , and Venice , were undermining that backbone of our strength , our sense of duty . We were content when they took us into obscure little back waters , where the silencewas broken only by the plash of our oars and the melancholy " Poppen-jee ! " as Giuseppe warned the empty air that he meant to turn from one deserted water-lane into another as deserted . They carried us past high walls ? walls green below , and diversified by crabs , where the canal lapped them ; above , rose and saffron , here and there showing patches of deeper rose where pieces of plaster had fallen from the bricks . Through grilled gateways , at the water 's edge , we could look deep into gardens which seemed to stretch away into forests . Everything was quiet ; there was no sound even of a bird . Enchantment brooded over us . Then suddenly , out of the silences , Giuseppe and the gondola carried us under some populous bridge , where two files of Venetian women in black shawls passed ceaselessly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us for a ? moment . Then silence again . The enchantment of the enchanted city was upon us . In silence we passed by beautiful old palaces , whose defaced escutcheons pleaded with us to remember how glorious their dwellers once had been . We passed the beautiful iron gateway of a garden , where one frail autumn rose mirrored its brave little head in the canal . It was such a venturesome little flower , and so poetical in the midst of the decay , that I turned to Stan for sympathy . He spoke : " This son of a sea crab has n't shined the ferro to-day ! " he said . But while such skirmishing for position was continual , it is the decisive actions which stand out in my mind . The most important one began soon after we came , when , late one afternoon , " Giuseppe , " Stan commanded , " go out to the lagoons beyond the Giudecca . " I recognized the tone of the skipper . Unconsciously I slipped into my familiar attitude of able seaman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had we been in a thing on wheels . " I think , " Stan was good enough to 760 The Conscience and the Gondola explain , " it would be nice to see the sunset . " As we slid out into the canal of the Giudeeca , Stan turned and watched Giuseppe . There 's not so much to rowing a gondola , " he said . " In principle , it ' s not unlike a canoe . A man who can use a single paddle ought to get the hang of this thing in a short time . " We threaded our way among the big fish-baskets and nets of the Giudecca , and out into the sunset beyond . Giuseppe knew all about sunsets and forestieri . He made us fast to a post favorable for watching the august spectacle , curled himself up , and went to sleep . It was the usual routine . To the right and left of us , at a little distance , were other gondolas . Most of them contained lady artists , who had come out to paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , Sunset on the Lagoons . Well , one can not wonder that it should so often have been painted , and it was all that everybody has said about it , and I was losing myself , as every one must , in the first wonder of it , when Stan sprang to his feet . " - Giuseppe , " he said , " cast off that rope . I believe , " he went on , " that I can row this craft out here where there ' s plenty of room . " He picked up the oar , and let it fall into the curious little contrivance that the gondoliers so amazingly use as an oarlock , dipped the oar into the water , and bent his body strenuously forward . The next moment the gondola had whirled around like a top , and my back was turned toward the sun . The oar , conscious that an untrained hand held it , sprang derisively from the crotch , and I had the satisfaction of seeing an experienced oarsman do what I had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crab . " I mentally added to my knowledge of boats this little observation : crabs , in gondolas , are caught forward , not back ward . Stan also added this piece of knowledge to his boatman 's lore . He picked himself up and looked at the oar sternly . His disapproving eye traveled to me . I tried to make myself as inconspicuous as possible . If I budged or spoke , I knew the crab would turn out mysteriously , as had so many of our small accidents , to be my fault again . Venice disappeared ; the lagoons vanished . Again I was the shivering cabin-boy , trying to evade , the wrath of the " old man . " " Get back in there ! " Stan spoke sternly to the oar . " If the Signore ? " Giuseppe suggested . " Enough , " said Stan . - " I know how to row a boat . " With this he spun the gondola around again . Again the oar , indignant at its unskillful handling , flew out . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time the gondola had spun round in its tracks for the sixth time , the oar no longer came out . " " said Stan triumphantly , " I 'm getting the hang of the thing . " " To go forward , " suggested Giuseppe , " the Signore should ? " With the air of conferring a favor , Stan permitted Giuseppe to take the oar . The gondola responded to its master 's hand . With its clean , effortless motion , it leaped forward . Stan watched Giuseppe attentively . " Give here , " he commanded Giuseppe . " It ' s just like canoeing ; you turn your oar at the end of a stroke , " he announced triumphantly . " If the Signore will go piano , piano ? less force at first ? " Stan gave a less vigorous stroke to the boat and progressed sideways a foot . " Hold your left hand so , " advised Giuseppe . The voice of the instructor penetrated his usual deferential tones . " ' Clue left hand should be further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crab . Then , for the next ten minutes , I wit- // nessed what I had never dreamed I should see ? Stan meekly permitting himself to be instructed in boat-lore by a lazy , red-faced Italian boatman , who ( lid not know the main sheet from the lop-s ' 1 halyards . Up to that moment , it had not occurred to me that my husband had anything more to learn about boats . I had looked upon Into as omniscient . Without putting it into words to myself , I had fancied that he had come into the world knowing how to sail a boat . I had fancied that he had learned how to row before he could walk . As I watched Stan being instructed by Giuseppe I realized that a real lover of boats is willing to learn anywhere and anyhow . Still , it hardly seemed fitting dist I should witness this , and I turned lay eyes away from Giuseppe and his pupil . It was then I noticed that the boat was steadily progressing sideways , crab-fashion . We were bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gondola of a lady artist . I looked at Stan . He was engrossed in his oar . Giuseppe 's eyes were fixed on Stan . From time to time , he offered suggestions . What happened shows how lacking in judgment is the able seaman . It had been impressed on me never to offer suggestions to the commanding officer , so I sat there , pusillanimously silent , while mw gondola slowly sidled clown on that of the lady artist . It was the thousandth ease , when I should have given warning , but even up to the final thump , it did not seem possible to me that such an impossible thing could happen as that Stan should not know where we were going . It was not much of a collision , ? just a thumping of the two sides of the gondolas . My husband turned a displeased and astonished head on me . When you had so little to do , " he exclaimed , " nothing to do but keep watch ! " ? he did not finish . Guiltily I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Stan said to Giuseppe , before joining me , " Well , Ithink I did very well for the first afternoon . " We all ignored the fact that we had progressed some two hundred feet in a lateral direction . He tried again the next afternoon , and for several afternoons ; and at last the time came when the boat obeyed hint so far as to move forward in a comparatively straight line . One day he even succeeded , during the half of an hour , in laying a straight course along the line of five posts , and then he rested his oar and took his place beside Inc . I had expected a burst of triumph , but what Stan said was , ? " It ' s no use , Meg , I ca n't do it . It takes a lifetime for these fellows to learn . In the course of six months or so , I might be able to strike a two-knot gait on the lagoon without hitting a mudbank , but I never could carry a boat into a canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it up . " I look upon that as one of the pathetic moments of my life . henceforth Giuseppe took on a new importance . lie could do something about a boat that Stan could not . We could not be independent of him . Stan could be padrone of his gondola ; he could direct Giuseppe where to go , but he could not be skipper ; he could not show him how to go there . Ile gave in with an amiability that filled me with pity . We never discussed his sorrow . He chafed under it until the day came when Giuseppe suggested that Stan should learn the forward oar , which , he said , was much easier . I had another moment of pathos in the eagerness with which my husband accepted this suggestion , and it was impossible not to exult with him when he mastered that oar completely at the first lesson . In the return of my husband 's good spirits , I was grateful to Giuseppe ? even after I found out that the brunt of brute work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which does most of the pushing ; the rear oar has the light , skilled labor of steering . The tactfulness of Italy had won another point . Giuseppe had satisfied his The Conscience and the Gondola employers and won comparative repose for himself . This contest between the gondola and Stan was the decisive battle . The Venetian boat had secrets that it would confide to no foreigner ; only a Venetian would ever know by what trifling little flip of the oar a forty-foot craft could be moved four inches this way or that , sideways or forward or backward or cat-cornered , at the will of the gondolier . Nor could any gondolier impart that knowledge ; it was a part of him , instinctive as walking . Indeed , the steering of a gondola through crowded canals is a series of little perfect miracles , a continual tour de force , and one that any gondolier ? and here is the amazing part of it to us ? can perform without apparently taking thought of what he is doing . He can exchange badinage with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as intricate and delicate a series of manoeuvres as a performer on the tight-rope ; he can turn his head around and explain in pointed Venetian his opinion of the ancestry of a bargeman who has narrowly escaped crushing him , while his oar causes his gondola to escape collision with another by exactly three-quarters of an inch . Though one might try for years to learn it , one could never attain this nonchalant perfection . It is said that there are foreigners who have taken a sandolo or gondola into the canals , but they do it as the dog walks on his hind legs . A foreigner can never master the ultimate secrets of a gondola ; he can never learn to guide it when he is thinking of something else . IV Meantime , the reason for Giuseppe 's nakedness when he came to us slid into our consciousness . It was his red nose , for one thing , and the good-humored raillery from servants at many palace windows ; for it seemed to us that there was not a palace in Venice whose signori had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wage in advance also told tts much . When we emerged from a church , Giuseppe , a few seconds later , emerged from the near-by trattoria . After each of our absences , his face grew redder . It was evident ? everything pointed to it ? that It had interfered with his work in the other hundred and fifty positions from which Giuseppe had been discharged , but we tried to pretend that in our case It would not interfere . Nor did It ; we did not let It . We learned some things about the blind eye , Stan and myself , in those weeks . When our gondola went very slowly ,  --  " The wind is against us , " I would say ; and when it knocked off ? its tar against the stones of Venice , " is no longer a young man , " apologized Stan , not realizing how this was sapping our moral strength , so that finally , when It did interfere with his work , we had no resistance left . One morning Stan looked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the gondola . It was empty . Its carpet had not been spread ; the tends were not put up . " IIe has n't come , " said Stan . " I hope he ' s not sick , " I mitigated . In the background of my mind lurked the real explanation of his absence . I knew that It lurked in Stan 's too . But here Stan plumbed for me the depths of his fall . Far from indignant , ? " Well , I rather hope he wo n't come to-day , " said my husband blithely . " It ' s time we took some of those walks that we ' ve been talking about so long . You ca n't really know Venice without walking a lot . " To the suggestion of the camericra , " So Giuseppe has ? " she lifted an airy hand to her mouth with a gesture of drinking ? we turned blank faces . After we had spent two days in " learning to know Venice , " Giuseppe appeared in our apartment , bleary-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his hat . He had had , be explained , a terrific pain in his stomach ; he spared neither The Conscience gesture nor metaphor to explain to us how terrific this pain had been . It had been the grandfather of all pains . No one else had ever had such a pain as his ; but weak and trembling as he was , he , the faithful Giuseppe , had hastened back to his post . " A drink would do your stomach good , " Stan suggested , knowing all the time , in his New England soul , that be was helping a fellow-creature on a career of slackness . But as he spoke his eyes traveled up and down his gondolier 's blouse ; and as Giuseppe turned to bow his graceful Latin greeting to me , he re-waled a shameless mend , that began at ? his collar and ended at his waist . " What ' s the matter with your blouse , Giuseppe ? " Stan demanded . " My blouse ? " asked the unconscious Giuseppe . " It is newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps been a hole in it ? " pursued Stan . " A hole ? " inquired Giuseppe . " Behold , it is true ? there has been a hole ! Ali " he protested , " those scoundrels of shopkeepers , to sell a blouse with a hole ! I go to confront them with it . " He backed toward the door . " Giuseppe ! " called Stan . Giuseppe ceased his backward course . " Hang it ! " Stan flung to me , " that rip was n't there when we bought it . " Well I knew it had n't been there . It had been freshly caught together with stitches of the kind that save nine . And here was Stan almost willing to be convinced that it had always been there ! " It does n't do to push these Italians too hard , " he apologized ? be seemed actually to be protecting Giuseppe from my wrath . He compromised with his dying conscience by suggesting that it was customary to remove one 's hat when in the house . Giuseppe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that his unprincipled hat , with inanimate perversity , had somehow contrived to remain upon his head . Ile snatched it off . " Scusi , scusi , Signori ! " he murmured , and the involuntary courtesy of Italy coerced him into . bowing low . There bobbed up from behind his head something white , and as he stood straight again , a curl like that of an 1830 belle dangled from behind his ear . It was not of hair ; it was of cotton batting , and the other end of it was stuffed into a long , jagged crack in Giuseppe 's scalp . He saw our bewildered looks , and flung his hands out sidewise . " Now , " he said , with virtuous intonation , " I will tell the truth to the Signori . Yes , I will tell it to them . The hole in my blouse did n't come from the store . I knew it all the time . But Giuseppe is kind-hearted . Does he talk of unpleasant things in the company of ladies ? Never ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befallen him ; no ; rather than that , he risked the shame of impoliteness , keeping his hat on his head . Signori , a great misfortune befell your Giuseppe . A little more , " his eyes grew moist , " and you might never have beheld him again . Signori , a knife it was that made the holes in my blouse and in my head , ? the knife of a drunken friend . Oh , Signori , how sharp is the knife of a drunken friend ! " He paused . " Signori , " he continued in the tone of one telling a commonplace tale , " I sit in the trattoria . I sit and eat my pasta . Enters a friend of mine , whom I have not seen for a year . When last I saw-him , he went away taking with him my watch , a watch of the value of twenty lira , given to me by grateful padroni . IIe and my watch and chain of value disappeared together . When I see my friend , I say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say to my friend , robber of honest men 's jewelry , restore to inc my watch ! ' " Giuseppe 's tone was one of unctuous courtesy . " My friend , who is a robber and a murderer , tells me that I never had a watch and chain ? there , in the trattoria , where many know I have had a watch and chain ! I say to my friend , ? Shameful one , you were born in the court-yard of Zanipolo ; ' and , Signori , being in drink , this angers him ? zipp , zipp ! Giuseppe falls . " " Well , well , Giuseppe , " Stan cut him short , " get the gondola ready . " " Signori , " said Giuseppe , " loss of blood has made me weak . If the Signori would give me pay in advance ? " Stan 's hand traveled to his pocket . I looked out of the window , ignoring the incident . Half an hour afterwards , Giuseppe , having renewed his strength , helped us into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his battle to us . From time to time , from behind me , I would hear the words , " Zipp , zipp ! and Giuseppe ? poor , faithful Giuseppe ? Giuseppe falls ! " I wish I might omit the humiliating sequence , but truth compels me to state that that evening the street on which the back-windows of our apartment gave was filled with shouts . We tried , Stan and I , over the evening lamp , to ignore the fact that our names were called , and that it was Giuseppe 's voice which clamored for us . But even this decent reticence on our part was denied us , for Iola , our little maid , came pump-pumping up the stairs on some errand . " Oh , " she said , " listen to Giuseppe ! Hey , but he roars ! A proper beast is Giuseppe ! He cries aloud down in the mile that the Signori have not paid him . That is what comes , Signori , of paying him two days in advance . " I looked at Stan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the money of two days in advance in the wine-shop of my aunt . Now he will again get himself into debt , and there will be another canal closed to the Signori . Giuseppe dares not pass trattorie where he owes money . Did the Signori not know ? That is the reason it takes the Signori so long to arrive at the Rialto . Giuseppe can go here , but not there . " She illustrated with expressive gestures . " There are many rallorie in Venice , and in almost all Giuseppe owes money . Soon the Signori ? can only go on the Grand Cdnal and the lagoons . " A loud burst of noise from the cane took Iola to the window . " Ah , listen ! " she said . " Giuseppe says he will work no longer . Ile discharges the Signori ! My uncle comes out ? he kicks Giuseppe ! " V The reader will please next observe my husband , the punctilious yachtsman , the advocate of man-o ' - war discipline , proceeding down the Grand Canal In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The back oar is rowed , perhaps you think , by a new and sober gondolier . It is not ; it is rowed by Giuseppe . Moreover , the dolphins are dull and the /ergo is rusty . Giuseppe 's face is red , and he mutters to himself as he rows . But I maintain that it was the gondola 's fault that we took Giuseppe back , for she " stood in " with Giuseppe shamelessly , in spite of the fact that he did not keep her brasses clean , or brush off her carpet . The day after the row Giuseppe and the gondola appeared , ignoring all unpleasantness . They did it magnanimously , as though it were we who had made a scandalous noise in the Calle del Pistor . We paid no attention to them as we passed them on our walks , our dignified silence conveying to them that we were done with them forever . They both spent the day slumbering peacefully by our riva . Whenever we passed they would come to life with " Eccomi ! Eccomi ! Signori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came out or went in . The fourth day Giuseppe frisked up to us blithely . " Per f avore , Signori , " he said . " My pay ! " lie had the air of delicacy that one has when tactfully reminding people of a just debt . " And , " he concluded , " if the Signori will give me money for the candles , I will also see that the gondola is tarred . Excuse me for calling the Sig- non 's attention to it , but the gondola is in a disgraceful condition . " Ile pointed to the gondola , which lay in San Vio sulking . " As long as the Signori said nothing about it , I said nothing ; but the time is come when Giuseppe can no longer keep silence . Duty demands that Giuseppe shall say to the Signori , Scusi , Signori , but it is my duty to remind the Signori that they owe it to their gondola to pro- ? vide candles for its blacking . ' " I shall always believe that some second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have made Stan forgive him . Interested in spite of himself ? " Candles for blacking ? " Stan asked . " As the Signori know , candles are required for blacking , " Giuseppe repeated , " and of the best . I have already spoken to the gondola-maker behind San Trovaso . Ile awaits me and the gondola . If the Signori have never seen a gondola blacked , perhaps they would graciously consent to accompany me ? " Of course Stan wanted to see a gondola blacked . Choice was beyond him . He carried off his defeat with a swagger that was borrowed from Giuseppe 's own . " You can come too , if you like , " he condescended to me . " Giuseppe , where do you get these candles ? A boat-yard in Venice is as unlike other boat-yards as Venice is unlike other cities . Every two months , all well-conducted gondolas repair each to its own boat-yard for its grooming . There is a certain familiar intimacy among these establishments . None of them is very large . Each has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly sure of meeting no stranger ; instead , it will come across childhood friends . It may watch new gondolas under construction and learn for whose family they are intended , or to what tragetto they are destined . With us , a boat-yard is a place where boats are born , and , alas , a place where many boats die . You may see them any day , ' WitherMg away with age , tragic spectres of theboats they once had been . Often they may have been deserted while they were but in the prime of old age by treacherous owners , who put them up the year before , promising to have them overhauled in the spring , and then left them to shrink and die , until one day there is nothing for it but to break their bare , weather-beaten planks for old junk . Gondolas do not do their dying in the Venetian boat-yards . Now and then one may see a dead gondola hauled up on some riva of the Giudecca , but for the most part , dead gondolas are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we arrived at the boat-yard back of San Trovaso , a new gondola was having its smooth planks bent into shape . A torch was being held under it , and as the wood softened , it was bent into even more graceful lines . Amid the shavings of the shop stood an iron cauldron on legs . A fire of shavings blazed beneath it on the hard earthen floor . It was a casual sort of a fire , and seemed to have wandered to the right spot by chance . To our eyes it looked as if it might wander out from beneath the pot any minute , and lick up the shavings around it , the store itself , and the gondolas in it . Apparently it was only through its own good-will that it remained where it should . We watched the spectacle , which will always remain a miracle to foreigners , for a few moments . " These Italians , " Stan conceded , " can teach us something after all . " Giuseppe kicked some shavings into the fire and unwrapped his package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard gathered with us around the cauldron . Giuseppe threw into the pot the package of two or three dozen candles , and left them to become liquid wax , while the owner of the yard gave our gondola a baptism of fire . He carried a lighted torch over every edge of her sides and bottom . The tar melted and ran off ; sometimes the fiery drops fell into the carpet of shavings with which the yard 766 The Conscience and the Gondola was everywhere strewn . Why the yard and the gondola were not instantly in flames , I can not say . I had myself little impulses to rush forward and throw my cloak over blazing parts of the boat , and so , I think , had Stan , for when it was all over he drew a long breath . By this time our candles were liquid wax , and the padrone poured into it black dust out of a bag and stirred the mass around with a stick . It was a forbidding , oily soup , as repulsive to see as black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a large handful of waste ; he dropped it into the mass and squeezed it . The stuff oozed unpleasantly from between his fingeis and streamed down into the pot . He made for the gondola , and the padrone and Giuseppe followed with the cauldron . During the half-hour that followed , the bottom and sides of the gondola were thoroughly sponged over . It was all done with a perfection of technique , ? no hesitation anywhere ; every one knew his part . If one loved a boat , one could not but like the men who so well knew how to treat her . It was accomplished , too , with the greatest economy of time and labor . " Gad , that 's simple ! " said Stan , and he turned an approving gaze on Giuseppe . It was in this fashion that the gondola and Giuseppe got around us again . We had been taken behind the scenes of a gondola 's world , and had been shown something that we knew we would always be glad that we had seen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a boat attaches it to one . As we got into our shining gondola Stan turned to me : - " After all , you see , he really does care for his boat in the essentials . He may not go in for form , any more than a fisherman does , but the main thing is , he cares for the things that count . " So I knew Giuseppe had been forgiven ; I also knew he had not only been forgiven for this time , but that he had been forgiven in advance for all future misdemeanors . As long as we should stay in Venice , that gondola and no other should take us to and fro , and it would be propelled ? when it was propelled ? by Giuseppe . Venice and a gondola and Giuseppe had combined against us ; they had fought us on their own ground , using their own subtle methods of warfare , and had beaten us . We belonged to them as long as we stayed there , ? yes , and for longer . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change them according to our ideas of the fitness of things , but in the end they owned us , and so will continue to do as long as the memory of them stays with us.
