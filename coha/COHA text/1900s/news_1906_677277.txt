txt Revelations of the intrigue and trickery by which the Standard Oil Company is alleged to maintain its supremacy were laid before the InterState Commerce Commission to-day . The charges included corruption of railroad employes and agents of independent companies , giving short measure , selling supposed different kinds of oil out of the same tank , obtaining trade through fake companies apparently working in opposition to Standard Oil , driving independent dealers to the wall through systematic price cutting on the part of retail dealers backed by the Standard . It was also alleged that through special secret freight rates , one-half the open rate , the trust was able to control most of the trade ? without price cutting . E. M. Wilhert , who is now an independent oil operator , testified that while in the employ of the Standard 011 Company as an agent at Topeka , Kan. , he had in following out instructions of his superior officers bribed clerks in the offices of railroads and employes of independent oil concerns to obtain information of the details of the business done by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most profitable sold , " Bald the witness , " and the Standard Oil Company dislikes to have any independent sell any of this grade . Our Instructions were that if we found a competitor Belling this oil in our territory to cut the price so as to get the orders , and then substitute an inferior grade of o11 , and guarantee it to be of superior quality . " Attorney Miller , for the Standard Oil Company , broke in at this point to inquire as to the scope of the investigation . Commissioner Clements said it was desired to obtain all the information possible , and report It for the consideration of Congress . " Then as I understand It , " said Mr. Miller , " the commission takes the position that for the purpose of this inquiry its power is equal to that of the Bureau of Commerce and that the commission will simply report the results of its investigation to Congress without attempting to exercise any of its remedial powers . " " That is the position of the commission , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the methods by which the trust succeeded in stifling competition were furnished to the Commission by Maywood Maxon of Decatur , Illinois , a former district manager of the Standard Oil Company . To show the intimate relations of the trust with the railroads Attorney Mon- I nett began by asking Mr. Maxon concerning the passes he and his subordinates had . " I had seventeen or eighteen , " replied the witness . " So did seven or eight of my agents . The passes were issued on the account of the Union Tank Line Company , and saved us a total of about $800 rail- ' 1 road fare each month . It was the same in the other districts in Indiana , Illinois , and Ohio . " The witness said that apparently independent companies were organized by the Standard to wrest business from the independent oil dealers . " One way of getting their trade , " he said , " was to visit each consumer and tell him that the independent oil he was using was inferior . The agent would prove this by lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air which reached the flame he could make the independent oil burn smoky and the Standard oil clean and bright . That 's easy to do with the same oil in each lamp . In the course of time we would win over most of those housekeepers , and the independent dealers would have to come back into line or lose their business permanently . " At Paris , Ill. , the Standard agent left the service because an independent got the majority of the dealers . Under the orders of Charles T. Collins , Second Vice President of the Kentucky Company , I started out to get that trade back . I sent a man to Paris , Ill. , ? to arrange to get a. deal to sell oil for 5 cents a gallon to the consumer . This was arranged . The current price was then 10% cents to the retail trade , but we made the price to this one dealer S cents , and he sold it at cost . " " How could he make a living at that rate ? " the witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " once a month we sent a man around who gave the dealer a rebate of 1 cent a gallon , on all the oil he bought . We paid for his advertising also . " " What happened to the independent you were fighting ? " " I finally bought his plant , dismantled It , and had itt shipped to another point . " " How long did it take you to wreck him ? " " One year . " " Then what happened to the price of oil ? " " It went back from 5 cents to the price it was before the independent cut in . " Mr. Mason said the same thing took place at Urbana and Vanassia . Speaking for that part of the State 1n which he had experience , the witness said the inspection of oil was either entirely lacking or a farce . " The Oil Inspectors who came under my observation , " said Mr. Maxon , " were generally without instruments and without knowledge sufficient for the performance of their duties . All they wanted was to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse , and we would inspect our own oils and stamp the barrels . Many times a cigar and a drink were sufficient to induce an Inspector to condemn a carload of a competitor 's oil . " President Ripley of the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe Railway denied that his road had any terminal agreements with the Oil Trust in Chicago . He was asked whether the Santa Fe did not lower Illinois rates and raise Kansas rates about the time of the completion of the pipe line . Mr. Ripley professed ignorance of the matter , saying the raise , if made , was a coincidence . He declared that his road had never obstructed the crossing of their right of way by independent pipe lines . He also denied that passes were given generally to Standard employes
