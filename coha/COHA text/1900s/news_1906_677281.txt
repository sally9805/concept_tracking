txt Had the Rev. Dr. Crapsey been a guest at the annual dinner of the Alumni of the Union Theological Seminary , held last night in the banquet hall of the Hotel St. Denis , he would have felt himself thoroughly at home , for the speakers of the evening  --  there were three of them  --  had no hesitancy in decrying the doctrine of stubborn adherence to traditions and in proclaiming that the greatest religious truths were yet to be discovered . There were 200 clergymen present when Dr. William De Witt Hyde , President of Bowdoin College , was intropuced to speak on " The College and the Seminary . " " The religious world stands to-day before a great , fixed gulf , " he said . " It was always there , but has hitherto been evaded , bridged , or concealed . On one side of the gulf is tradition , on the other truth ; on one side servile repetition , on the other free invention ; on one side imitation of the dead letter , on the other reproduction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful ideas , on the other joyous response to compelling ideals ; on the one side extraneous reveille tions attested by miraculous credentials , on the other original righteousness appreciated by the pure in heart ; on one side passive hope of a better world hereafter , and on the other active work for the betterment of conditions hero . " The College of Tradition has a fixed curriculum composed mainly of dead languages and changeless mathematics . On top of it is placed a course of Christianity , aiming to prove by what is found in the world a God who never can be found outside it , and to confirm the student in the childish views of religion he brought with him from the nursery . " Of course , all the virile , vigorous fellows in such an institution plunge into dissipation . What else is there genuine and interesting for them to do ? While the strong and vigorous majority of the boys go straight to the bad , there will be a feeble remnant who meekly swallow the pre-digested intellectual food offered them and , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , profess to like it . Out of the most feeble in this weak minority the candidates for the ministry " are chosen . They have never done a bit of original thinking or independent acting In their lives . - " The Seminary of Tradition is tenfold more the child of this same docile unreality . Dead languages , the deadest of the dead , are the - spinal column of the course . The student must be taught the exact words in which the miraculoes and final revelation was deposited . Church history is the cut and dried narrative of the precise views and ceremonies and institutions of the Farticular denomination to which , in the providence of God , the student and the seminary happen to belong . Dogmatics are injected by authoritative dictation , lest if taken by the method of reading , discussion , and reflection some Precious particle might ? be regurgitated which would be proof of dangerous heresy . Add a few points about raising money for foreign missions and home expenses and the proper course of training has been carried out . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seminary of Truth his contracted lungs can not breathe the free air . His faith seems to be slipping away from him . The result is unpleasant , but , on the whole , harmless . And what of the student who comes from the side of light and liberty to the seminary bound in darkness and tradition ? You can not make him believe that Christianity is anytihng but a fabric of priestly and professorial lies . The man who has graduated from a college and a seminary , both of the traditional type , is useless and juiceless . He can doubtless comfort a few sisters weaker than himself , but that is all . He is dead the day he graduates . " The world is unquestionably longing for true leadership , but the young men do n't know it . Two tramps were loitering about a yard in which a watchdog , observing them , was barking furiously . " ' Let 's go in , ' said one of the tramps ; ' do n't you know a barking dog never bites ? ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it , and you know it , but the dog does n't . ' " You know and I know that there are *churWe'rtt an-honest and fearless minister , but the young men do n't know it and the heresy trials do n't help them to find it out . They believe , rightly or wrongly , that the ecclesiastical machinery is in the hands of the same sort of men who held it in Jesus 's day ? who will neither look the truth squarely in the face nor suffer any one who does to enter the official service of the churches they control . " Dr. Hyde 's address was liberally punctuated by applause , and when he concluded lie was cheered for some minutes . The Rev. Dr. Williston Walker , Professor in the Yale Divinity School , had something to say of the relations which should exist between college and seminary , and the Rev. Dr. George William Knox . Acting President of Union Theological Seminary , was introduced as a preacher of whom it might be sung before he began his sermon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I assumed the acting Presidency of Union , " he said , " I received many letters . There was not one of these letters which told me to find the truth and proclaim it . All the writers warned me not to ' do something awful . ' Despite these warnings I am here to say that the truth that is to come is greater elm that which men now know . There is no such thing as authority in theology , as there Is no ' such thing as authority in philosophy . The trouble is that the Church does n't want the prophet , but the scribe . and the traditionalist . " The situation of affairs reminds me Of a story I saw about a doctor of the year 19e0 , who , called in to treat a patient , looked him over , and then whispered : ? You 've got stomach trouble . I ca n't handle your case , for my union does n't allow me to treat below the neck . ' " The churches do n't want ministers who preach above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Criminal Courts Building , which has been settling for a. number of years , began to sink again yesterday , the middle pier of the building descending an eighth to a quarter . of an inch . In the process heavy pressure seemed to be brought ' on the vaults , which extend outside the building , in the direction of Centre Street . The sidewalk on Centre ' Street was badly broken yesterday , apparently through pressure from beneath . Supt.
