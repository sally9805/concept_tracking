THE sage Mr Dooley once remarked , " Nowadays ' t is th ' fashion to thry to emaciate ye'erself " an observation amply justified by the solemn warnings against gluttony uttered by most present day writers on diet . A favorite quotation of these dietetic Jeremiahs is that of a deceased English physician that men " dig their graves with their teeth . " Another aphorism , repeated with much unction by the enemies of conviviality , is that which gave joy to the miser in Moliere 's comedy , that " man should eat to live and not live to eat . " All these and other like sayings are true enough in a sense , for gluttony is no doubt one of the seven mortal sins , but taken at the foot of the letter they are mar-joys and life-shorteners . Men seldom dig their graves with their teeth ? they dig them rather by not using their teeth . If men grimly eat to live they will not live long to eat . The pleasures of the table may be indulged in injuriously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature and prepare the way for a life of discomfort , if not of misery , and an early death . There is nothing life-saving in extreme asceticism ? it is just as much an abuse of the body as is gluttony , and its result is a short life and a sad one , which is even worse than a short life and a merry one . Man , in common with all living things , has a discriminating appetite for food , and even though , or rather because this appetite has been refined through the process of development , it is none the less normal and must be respected . Modern science has cleanly shown that appetite is as necessary to digestion as is mastication , and what is eaten without relish is with difficulty , if at all , assimilated , for the stomach despises unsavory stuff and refuses to secrete sufficient fluid for its digestion . The human body is a chemical machine which needs food and air to keep it in motion and to repair its waste . With the supply of air we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the great majority of people do not get enough of it ; if they did there would be less need of dissertations on food . The man who lives in the open air ? day and night ? has little need to concern himself with what he puts in his stomach . He can eat what his palate craves , and it will usually be taken care of in the system ; and if he takes a little more than is necessary to meet the wants of the organism it will be oxidized and excreted without harm . But unfortunately we live in houses in which are windows which can be closed , and as they usually are closed the necessity for dietetic warnings arises .  | There are two opposing schools of dietetics , the followers of which may be broadly designated as meat eaters and vegetarians , or those who think that the food of mankind should be made up in great part of proteids or albuminous substances , and those who believe that man should revert to the food of his arboreal ancestors , and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these great schools , especially the second , is divided into numberless sects , such as , in the first school , the fish eaters , the consumers of red meats , and the white meaters ; and in the second , the fruitarians , the nutarians , the graminivorous or breakfast fooders , the raw fooders , etc . Then there are the no-breakfasters , the two-mealers , the one - mealers , the water-drinkers , the dry eaters , and other faddists without end . Most of these diet eccentrics are as wrong as wrong can be , their theories being based on nothing but pure assumption , and well fitted , if forced upon mankind , to produce a race of short-lived degenerates . Many of the apostles of these dietetic creeds are ignorant of the chemical constitution of foodstuffs and equally so of the processes of digestion . For example , bread is denounced by many , who have dubbed it " the staff of death , " on the ground that it is chiefly starch and contains no real nourishment . The truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , although by no means a perfect food . And while on the subject of bread a Word or two may be said regarding graham bread , whole wheat bread , and the like , in which the bran is retained in the flour on the theory that it is " strong " food , well fitted to build up the bones and muscles . So it is , chemically , but the human stomach and intestines can not digest it , and its only use is to act as a mild irritant to the mucous membrane of the intestines , so increasing the action of the bowels ; in other words , the brown element , or bran , of such breads , is a laxative medicine , and it is a question whether the same result could not be attained more rationally and less injuriously by a judiciously selected laxative pill . The best flour is made from the wheat after the husk , the indigestible bran , has been removed . Chickens can grind up bran in their gizzards and turn it into flesh and bone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand and other gritty substances with our food ; we might just as well eat sawdust , on the theory that a tree is tough and long-lived . Of course those to whom the taste of brown bread is agreeable may eat it , if it does not cause diarrhea or other digestive disturbances , but they should do so because they like it and not rest under the delusion that they are thereby virtuous . Much light has been thrown on the process of digestion in the last few years by the investigations of Pavlov , a Russian physiologist , and others . These investigations have changed very materially our views of this process and have served to explain many things relating to food , especially why it is that every food faddist thrives upon his particular diet , although it may differ in toto from that of his neighbor who thrives equally on his own regimen . Stories are told of dyspeptics , living for years on carefully selected food of the blandest and " most easily digestible " sort and suffering miseries , who suddenly conceived a longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . To their delight as much as to their surprise there was nothing to pay for this yielding to the promptings of nature ; digestion was perfectly performed for the first time in years . Such stories are not always apocryphal ; they may be founded on fact , and their explanation is the same as that of the success of the food faddist . Pavlov found in experimenting on dogs that an abundance of gastric juice was secreted when they had food that they liked , even though this food was mechanically prevented from entering the stomach ; whereas , when they were fed on things they did not care for , but could eat only when half starved , the secretion of gastric juice was very scanty . This he called the " appetite juice , " the process in the stomach being analogous to the familiar phenomenon of " watering iii the mouth , " or increased salivary secretion , caused by the sight or smell of savory food or even by the thought of it . He found also that the composition of the digestive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed calling forth , through some mysterious signals transmitted to the stomach from the tongue and palate as soon as they had tasted the morsel placed in the mouth , just the sort of fluid best adapted to its digestion . The enthusiastic appreciation by the dietetic crank of the unsavory food which he is persuaded will assure him strength and long life gives him a taste for it , and so the motherly stomach provides an abundance of  | gastric juice of the proper composition and thereby saves him from the otherwise inevitable consequences of his folly . The intelligence of the stomach is indeed remarkable . As we all know , the process of digestion begins in the mouth , where the food is , or should be , carefully masticated to reduce it to small particles and mix it thoroughly with the saliva . The saliva is alkaline in reaction and loses its power when mixed with an acid fluid such as is the gastric juice . One would naturally suppose , therefore , that its digestive action would cease as soon as the food enters the stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freshly swallowed food away in one corner out of the reach of the glands which furnish the acid secretion , keeping it there for a while to give the saliva opportunity to complete the work it began in the mouth . Only then does it pass it along to the other end where the gastric juice can act upon- it to effect the second stage of digestion . At this end the entrance into the intestine is guarded by a valve , the pylorus , which keeps the food mass back until it is in a proper state for intestinal digestion . This valve opens occasionally to let a little pass , but it is a faithful guard and if any particle needing further stomach digestion tries to get out , it closes the door promptly and will not openagain until this interloper has been pushed out of the way or has received its proper passport from the ' gastric glands . The intestine is equally knowing and retains the food mass in the upper portion until , by a peculiar churning process , it has exposed every particle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , and not until then , the churning action ceases and a propulsive movement is substituted , which propels the now thoroughly digested mass down to the lower parts , where the absorbent vessels take up each its own portion , separating the albumins , the fats , and the sugars , and conveying them to the various tissues for direct assimilation , or to the liver for the further chemical changes necessary to fit them for the uses of the body . This , in brief , is what Nature does when she is not thwarted in her purpose , and she will even do it in spite of the many obstacles put in her way by the ignorant , the faddy , or the gluttonous . The blame for the beginning of many , if not most , cases of dyspepsia rests v. ith the : offerer himself . The stomach and intestines do not go on a strike until they are forced to it by sheer inability to do work to which they are not adapted . Mastication is the only digestive process under man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature ) a very important process and its neglect furnishes the starting point for a train of evils . In the process of chewing , the food is broken up into small particles , so that every part is accessible to the action of the various digestive fluids ; it is thoroughly mixed with saliva which begins the digestion of the starches ( to be continued for a time , as we have seen , in the stomach ) and which also acts as a lubricant to facilitate swallowing ; and finally the food is brought to the temperature most suitable for digestion . If mastication is neglected the food reaches the stomach in large pieces which are digested very slowly and are retained an undue time , sometimes even until the next meal has been eaten ; then the stomach has a job indeed , to dispose of two masses of crude , unchewed food in two different stages of digestion . No wonder that it finally rebels and abandons its task through sheer inability to perform it . Another and most important result of thorough chewing is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfies the appetite , the stomach is not overloaded , and the system is not burdened with the task of disposing of an accumulation of waste material which it is unable to utilize . Gladstone , it is said , used to chew each mouthful of food thirty-two times , one for each tooth . Iie probably did not have any such ironclad rule , and certainly did not spend his eating hours in counting , for he was reputed to be an agreeable table companion . But he was a slow eater and a lusty masticator , and his reward was a good digestion and a long and useful life . Foods differ greatly in their degree of digestibility , but it is a fatal mistake for the healthy man to select only those which are most easily disposed of , especially the so-called predigested foods . The digestive organs are constructed for the reception and disposition of all sorts of viands , but if they are coddled and given food which requires little labor on their part they acquire a lazy habit and will revolt if by chance they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . A story is told of a small boy whose mother was learned in dietetics and could tell to the minute what length of time each sort of food required for its diges- tion . She fed the child on pasteurized milk , underdone eggs , crisp toast , and approved breakfast foods . He seemed to thrive ; his skin was smooth and pink , his temper was gentle , he slept well , and was round and plump . One day he went to visit his grandmother , an elderly lady of the old-fashioned sort to whose mind the stomach of a boy was second only to that of an ostrich . She wanted to give her grandson a good time and with that end in view set before him good meals with plenty of meat and potatoes , topped off with cookies and pie . The poor little chap was in heaven for a time , but his " innards " had been pampered too long and could not stand un against the shock of mince pie and crullers . They rebelled , and after a purgatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of misapplied science . This is a parable addressed to the food faddists ? which they will not take to heart . They will blame the innocent grandmother and overlook the crime of the mother . Man is an omnivorous animal ? whether he was originally intended to he one is outside of the question . In this practical world we have to deal with existing facts and not with theories . Savage races live , some on animal food almost exclusively , some on vegetables , fruits and nuts , according to their environment ; but civilized man turns to both the animal and the vegetable world for his nutriment , and through a long course of adaptation his digestive organs have accommodated themselves to a mixed diet ? meat , vegetables , fruits , nuts and sweets , even alcoholic beverages in moderation . This word is indeed the keynote of right eating ? moderation . There is no one class of food which need be selected to the exclusion of any other ( we are speaking to the normal man and not to the invalid who must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it is possible to live well and preserve health on a vegetarian diet , such a regime is entirely unnecessary . It is a greater tax on the digestive organs to extract the needful amount of proteids from vegetables than from meat , and , even when digested , vegetable proteid is less easily assimilated than that obtained from animal food . The cow , the pig , the sheep , the fowl , and fish are provided by Nature as the converters of vegetable proteid into animal , and it is only common sense for man to leave this task to the lower orders of creation and to tike his food in the form best adapted to his needs . Vegetable proteid is contained in a cellulose envelope , which the digestive juices of man are incapable of dissolving , and if he would utilize it he must first cook the vegetables and prepare them in a special way so as to rupture this envelope , and even then he has a struggle to convert the vegetable proteid into a form which he can use . Vegetable food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we derive energy , and it is well to keep the assimilative functions in good working order by giving them occasionally something extra to do , but they should not be worked too hard . It is more rational and sensible to eat meat at the principal meal of the day , and to depend upon cereals and other vegetable foods only as a means of giving variety and of supplying the starchy elements . The mixed diet which man has evolved for himself through a long process of adaptation is the one most fit for his nutritional needs . If vegetarianism , or any other fad , is a question of taste , well and good ? taste is proverbially a matter on which there is no dispute , and the normal digestive organs can take care of whatever is handed to them ? but it is not necessary to the physical salvation of the race , and to most of us it is repugnant and consequently injurious in the long run . Cheerfulness at meals , savory food , and thorough mastication before swallowing left to individual taste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicit trust . Our part is to see that the food is well cooked , tastily served , thoroughly chewed , and taken in moderation . So long as the viands are relished and eaten with cheerfulness , we may be sure that they will serve their purpose . Even fried food , if savory and thoroughly masticated , is not beyond the power of the stomach to digest . Food-faddism is no modern institution . It plagued the Romans as it plagues us today . Pliny had an honest scorn of the dietary cranks of his time , and we can not better close this mild protest against the enemies of temperate conviviality than by a quototion from his diatribe against the pseudo-scientific dietasters of his day . The translation is that of Holland : " Like to the former rules is this also , as touching our diet , that it be not too precise , but so as we may feed indifferently of all viands , and acquaint our bodies with varieties of meats ; which is ob- served to be the best way to maintain our health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat but one meal a day , to forbear dinners , is a diet that will drie up a man 's body within , and bring it soon to age and decay . But this aphorism of his he pronounced as a Physitian to reclaim us from that hungry and sparing diet , and not as a patron and maintainer of full feeding and gourmandise ; for I assure you , a temperate and moderate use of our meats is the wholesomest thing that is for our bodily health .
