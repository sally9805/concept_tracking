txt The mystery surrounding the presence of the detectives who met the Duke of Manchester on his arrival here with his American bride , on Saturday evening , and escorted him from the steamship St. Louis to the Holland House , was finally cleared away yesterday . Chief of Detectives McClusky , who , with his twosubordinates , had refused Saturday to throw any light upon their part in the case , except such as was afforded by the uncertain and baffling rays of their dark-lantern explanations , was more frank and communicative . The Chief was seen at his residence , 233 West Seventieth Street . He abandoned all air of mystery , and told a plain story of the part which he and his men had played . He said : " Detectives Vallely and Stripp went to the steamer and accompanied the Duke to the hotel because Mr. Zimmerman , the Duchess 's father , had placed in my hands two . letters  --  one written last Thursday and the other Friday , and both in the same handwriting ? in which the writer asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride arrived , and rottenegging his Grace . The letters bore a Brooklyn postmark , and were in a masculine hand . " " Did the writer say why he intended to rotten egg the Duke ? " " Yes . He said that the Duke had captured an American girl with millions , " Who properly belonged to an American , and he purposed discouraging foreigners from running away with American heiresses . The statement that the two detectives were sent as a sort of a guard of honor for the Duke was ridiculous . We do n't furnish guards of honor for Dukes or anybody else . But it is our business to see that there is no Infraction of the law , and as hurling eggs at the Duke would have been an infraction of the law , the two detectives were sent with Mr. Zimmerman to see that the law was not broken , or at least if it was , that the offender was arrested . " " Have you any idea who wrote the letters ? " " None in the world . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really quite funny . The fellow described in detail the character of the eggs he had in store for the Duke . If the eggs were as ancient as he claimed they were , and he had thrown them . I think it would have been a case for the Board of Health as well as for the police . I did not seriously expect that the threatened outrage would be committed , but then you can not always tell what cranks will do , and I thought it best to be ? on the safe side . " " What did you do with the letters ? " " I have them still . They are in my office , " Several newspaper men sent a card up ' to the puke of Manchester at the Holland House at 8 o'clock last night , and he received them readily . One of his visitors , who thought it well to start the , interview by easy- stages . said : " How did you spend the morning ? " " Being interviewed , " responded the Duke . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you anything special on hand for this evening ? " " Well , If I can get off being interviewed long enough I expect to have dinner . " All this was said in the best of humor . Then another of the newspaper men took his turn . " You have received Chief McClusky 's explanation of the presence of the two detectives ' : " " Oh , yes . Tie had two letters from some crank over in Brooklyn , who wrote that he was opposed to any blarsted Britishers coming over here and marrying American girls who were good catches . He said they were robbing young Americans of a good thing , do n't you know . Of course , if I had known about it I would never have advised having detectives on hand . 1 do n't go in for that sort of thing . If I had had my way I would have ridden uptown in an open carriage , and if any crank wanted to make trouble for me ? I think I would have been quite equal for him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T have been trained in a pugilistic school , you know . and feel quite capable of taking care of myself anywhere . or under any circumstances . " " But it is rather difficult to counter on an egg . " some one suggested . " So it is. " said the Duke . " but I guess I could have ducked all right . At least I would have made the fellow who threw it sorry he had done so , if I caught up with him . " What is your idea of the fuss Fannie Ward Lewis is making over your taking her jewels to Ireland by mistake ? " " Well , really you know . I ca n't see any other purpose she can hive than to get a good advertisement previous to her return to the stage . I know the Lewises very well . They are very nice people . I used to visit them a good deal . During the Summer I had a house on the Thames called ' Bishops Farm . " and they had a place about a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and I used to run down there every once in a while . But I have n't seen either Mrs. Lewis or Mr. Lewis since the latter part of the Summer . " " Is it true that they did notify the Scotland Yard detectives about the loss of Mrs. Lewis 's jewels and have Miss Evans . your wife 's aunt , shadowed ? " " Oh . yes . indeed . The detectives followed Miss Evans to Paris . " " Were n't they on the point of arresting her ? " " T do n't know about that , I am sure . They did n't arrest her . " The Duke was asked how long he expected to remain in New York . " I believe the original programme was for us to leave Wednesday . but I should like to remain over until Saturday . " he said . " I am very much interested in the performance to be given by the Strollers ' Club ? ' The Cruise of the i lummer Girl ' they call it ? Friday night . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you remain will you take part in the performance ? " " They wanted me to sing a song , but I am through with that sort of thing now . " Some one referred to the fact that the Duke was looking stronger and more robust than when he was here before . " I am in fine trim now . " he said . " I could go into the ring at 203 pounds , and as for my muscle , just feel that . ' : He put out his arm . It was as big around as a prizefighter's. and the muscle was almost as hard as iron . " Some one was telling me to-day , " he said laughing . " that they eat hot mince pie for breakfast out in Cincinnati . I do n't know whether T am trained down fine enough to stand that or not . I guess I will have to put on a few finishing touches , so to-morrow I will begin on hash . " With this parting piece of humor , the Duke excused himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
