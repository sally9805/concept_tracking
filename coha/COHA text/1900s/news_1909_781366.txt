txt With the passing last evening of the storm which struck New York , New England . New Jersey , and Pennsylvania early on Christmas Day , there ended one of the most trying snowstorms experienced hereabouts since the famous blizzard of 1888 . Before it passed out to sea yesterday it had caused the death of eight persons in and near New York , Injured many more than that number , and caused hardship to all classes . The most notable feature of the storm outside New York was a fourteen-foot wave that swept in on the New England Coast , doing great damage , the loss at Boston being estimated at $1,000,000 and that at Nantasket Beach at a similar figure , Four of those whose lives were sacrificed to the storm were killed in Manhattan , one man lost his life in Staten Island while struggling to reach the shelter of a railroad station . Two men were killed in Brooklyn , one , a canalboat Captain , by being blown from his craft into the icy waters of the lower bay . Another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow in Westchester County . Along the kshore much damage was done . The steamer Thurman was driven on dangerous shoals off the mouth of Toms River , near Atlantic City , and although twenty-seven men of the crew were rescued by life savers , three men are known to have gone adrift in a small boat . Nothing has been heard from them since . Ten inches cf snow fell in this city , and for most of the time the fall was and : companted by a stiff wind , which fa just short of a slaty-mile gale . It caught the city unprepared . None of the snow removal contracts had been let , and all the men that the Commissioner could get together numbered only d , UIi0 . Trolley and railroad lines throughout all the boroughs and over a good part of Long Island Were badly crippled , and in some instances halted altogether . Brooklyn and its outlying suburbs suffered particularly in this respect , only about four of the main lines out of the score or more which cover the city being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated roads , which managed to maintain some sort of a schedule , prevented Brooklyn from being entirely without traffic facilities . Tleat section of Long Island between Brooklyn and Hicksville , felt the alarm most . There wires were down , trolley cars made no pretense of running , and few trains reached their destinations . Many branches of the Long Island Railroad were blocked altogether , and there was one collision because of the storm . A work train struck a stalled passenger local , but as the passengers had been removed previously the only harm done was the demolition or the frail wooden cars of the passenger train , which the steel work train crushed like paper . Hundreds of persons spent Christmas night in ' trains and trolley cars , either being unable to leave , or tearing to taco the storm to reach other shelter . The wind blew down trees and brake windows everywhere . At Coney Island the sea climbed over the retaining wall , and mounted for half a mile up Ocean Boulevard . The shore front there was a mass of wreckage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Dozen Injured  --  Street Cars Tied Up ? Street Clearing a Problem .

The wind reached its maximum early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northeast at sixty miles an hour . Besides the injuries it caused to many people , it blew to pieces an entire house and broke many plate-glass windows . The house , a frame one of three-stories , was all but completed . It stood at Lawrence Street and Tremont Avenue , Bronx , and at 2 o'clock hardly a beam of it was standing . There was much suffering . Many were found almost frozen in hallways , or limped out from such places in the early dawn , making their way to the Bowery Mission . But because of the Christmas spirit Supt. York of the Municipal Lodging House , 434 East Twenty-fifth Street , says there was less hardship than one would expect . There came to him on Christmas night for shelter 341 men , 21 women , and 2 children , as against a total of 26 for the night before . He explained that besides the charity , the snowfall has made work for a great many , and yesterday the Pennsylvania Railroad asked him for 300 men to work at snow removal at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not overcrowded , but last night 300 lodging house tickets were given to the old and decrepit , about twice as many as usual . The storm had its comic side , too , what with slipping and falling and snowballing and hat losing . Several comical cases Caine tip in court . One John Sherry told Magistrate Kernoelian ? when arraigned in the West Side Court , that his Christmas dinner had been too- much for him . " After I had fallen into four snowdrifts , Judge , " said he . " I decided to confess in the West Sixty-eighth Street Station and get locked up for drunkenness . " He was discharged . Because of the impossibility of opening any graves or even reaching most of the cemeteries on account of the snow and ice , the Frank F , Campbell Undertaking Company has offered the free use of its chapel and receiving vaults at 241 West Twenty-third Street . Traction Lines Tied Up . Although on all the traction lines but the subwi. ' s the cars and trains had to run slowly end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lines were in fair shape by nightfall . In the early morning hours no r ars were running on regular time . there were five blocks , the longest le ere Y minutes , all around 1 o'clock in the morning on the elevated lines , which we:o jammed LO capacity by people going home . Teese tie-ups  - -  two on the Sixth Avenue line , two on the Ninth Avenue line , and one on the Third Avenue line  --  came from short circuits caused by ice formations on the third rail . On the surface lines before daylight hundreds abandoned them to walk , scores for taxicabs which in a good many cases got stalled , too , in the drifts . Almost no ears were running , around 2 A. M. One man , waiting for an hour at Forty-second Street and Broadway . spent three hours in getting to Houston Street . In Brooklyn conditions were even worse Some fifteen persons , stalled on St. John Place , near Utica Avenue , on two cars bound for Borough Hall , spent all night there . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the morning . Before 10 A. M. the outlying lines of the Bronx were hardly running at all . The Metropolitan Company had fortyeight sweepers and twenty scrapers go . ing long before daylight , and the only block after 9 A. M. came from a clogged switch in Vanderbilt Avenue , which stalled the uptown Madison Avenue line , the Forty-second crosstown line , arid the Park Avenue uptown line for forty-five minutes , After that all went fairly well . The storm taught Commissioner Edwards unpre.nared , for he had let none of his snow contracts . He has only just obtained the consent of the Board of Estimate to advent bids on them , and the contracts can not he awarded till the last day of this month . The Commissioner estimates , however . that in five days all of the ten inches of snow will be cleaned up . By dark last night he had 6.000 men at work , and early to-day he expects to have 10,000 men beyond the regular force of street cleaners , hich numbers 3.700 , and some 5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 350 trucks were at work . ONE DEATH IN WESTCHESTER . Exposure and Exertion Too Much for a Sufferer from Heart Disease . The storm which raged over the towns In West-heeler County for eighteen hours caused one death , tied up trolley roads , besides delaying trains on the New HaVon and Central Railroads . August W. Kohl , a retired merchant of New Rochelle , died upon reaching his home after tramping through fhe blinding storm from the railroad station to his house at 87 Huguenot Street . He had been spending Christmas with his daughter in Manhattan , and arrived at New Rochelle on i he 11 P. M. train . The storm was at its highest then and Mr , Kohl , who was 78 years old , could n't get a trolley car or a hack to take him home , so he started through snowdrifts which were above his knees . FROZEN TO DEATH IN STORM . F. C. McDonald Became Separated from Companion on Staten Island . Frederick C. McDonald , a wealthy resident of White Plains , was frozen to death on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Livingston power house , in West Brighton , S. L , where he had fallen while trying to make his way from the home of C. H. Dostenhoffer of Davis Avenue , West Brighton , to the Livingston Station of the Staten Island Rapid Transit Mr. McDonald , with John Nelson , also of White Plains , spent Christmas day with Mr. Dostenhoffer , and at 11 o'clock on Christmas night ' started for the station despite the protests of Mr. and Mrs. Dostenhoffer . Both men declared that it was essential that they be in the city today , and both feared that the storm , Which showed no signs of letting up , might prevent the running of trains and keep them in West Brighton unless they Started then . They left the house together . A violent wind hurled particles of snow into their eyels with the force of swiftly thrown pebbles . They could scarcely see as they plunged headlong Into snowdrifts or slid over bare stretches , where the light snow made walking a difficult accomplishment . Mr. Nelson took the lead , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way along . It seemed hours before he reached the Livingston station , and when he got inside he sank on a bench almost eshausted. gThen , for the first time , he realized that fr . McDonald was not with him . He ad thought his friend close behind . Nelson was too weak to dare to brave the storm again . As soon as daylight appeared Mr. Nelson startedout to look for Mr. McDonald and to arouse the Dostenhoffer family to search . Hardly had he left the station , however , when he met Albert Durant of 29 Lafayette Avenue , on his way to work . Durant told him that he had found a man frozen to death , and was trying to get help . The men returned and found the body of Mr. McDonald lying in a blind doorway in the brick fence surrounding the power house . Evidently he had become exhausted in his battle with the
