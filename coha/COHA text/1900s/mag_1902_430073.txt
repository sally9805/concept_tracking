 | Mr. Carnegie 's munificent bequest of ten million dollars for the founding of a National University at Washington has directed attention to Washington City as an educational center . Our national capital offers in some respects very superior advantages for a very high class of work . That Washington has these advantages is largely due to the Smithsonian Institution . No seat of learning in the country is held in higher esteem than this institution made possible by the liberality and generosity of James Lewes Smithson , a young Englishman , who spent most of his life in Paris and none in America . James Lewes Smithson was the son of Elizabeth Macie , a widow . His father was Sir Hugh Smithson ? descendant of the fiery Percies . This Sir Hugh Smithson was a man of very fine parts and held many positions of honor and trust . The Macies also had good blood , the widow being the " heiress of the Hungerfords of Studley , and niece of Charles , the proud Duke ofSomerset . " Young Smithson was never reticent concerning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit this scion of an aristocratic family to assume the titles of his father or of the much praised Percies . It was not till he had grown to manhood that he even took the name of his father . These things chagrined young Smithson much . Once he wrote , " The best blood of England flows in my veins ; on my father 's side I am a Northumberland ; on my mother 's I am related to kings , but this avails me not . My name shall live in the memory of man when the titles of the Northumberlands and the Percies are extinct and forgotten . " In 1782 he entered Pembroke College and took the lead in scientific studies ? especially chemistry and mineralogy . At this time these subjects were little studied . The means of study were also very poor . During his four years ' stay at Pembroke he was deeply interested in mining and manufacturing , and with his teachers visited many such places . The year following his graduation , 1787 , he was elected a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions . His first paper was on " Chemical Experiments on Tabasheer , " " a concretion found in the hollow of bamboo canes . " In 1792 he was living in Paris and expressing his opinions in words that bespeak the extreme Jacobin . Says he , " Ca ira is growing the song of England , of Europe , as well as of France . Men of every rank are joining in the chorus . Stupidity and guilt have had a long reign , and it begins , indeed , to be time for justice and common sense to have their turn ; the office of king is not yet abolished , but they daily feel the inutility , or rather inconvenience , of continuing it , and its duration will probably not be long . May other nations , at the time of their reform , be wise enough to cast off , at first , the contemptible incumbrance . " Smithson 's health was poor . Paris was more congenial and more favorable to his health than his native England . He spent his life largely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by his mother was sufficient to support him in the gay circles of Paris . He found his chief recreation in playing , and he managed to win back what he lost . But his life was not idle and dissolute . He was a student , careful , industrious , and painstaking . His life was lonely . He had no near relatives , but his friends were among the highest and the best . In these lonely moments he fed the fires of ambition and determined to be a scholar . It was this ambition , doubtless , that caused him to say that his name would live in the memory of man when the titles of the Percies were forgotten . In these years he contributed to the Royal Society 27 papers , and left 200 manuscripts with thousands of unconnected notes . Science was a hard mistress at this time . Dr. F. W. Clarke says Smithson 's chief contribution to science was his success in experiments with only the crudest apparatus , and that his reasoning on all subjects was good . His papers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , they had been carefully sifted and the important topics are in print . The Royal Society placed a high estimate on Smithson 's work . With Cavendish he was on terms of intimate friendship . His name is mentioned along with Wollaston , Young , and Davy . He corresponded with Thompson Black , and Arago . He was not a great scientist , but he did contribute something to the fund of human knowledge , to the  | enlargement of those " lurid specks in the vast field of darkness . " He was also a collector . His cabinet of minerals comprised ten thousand specimens , including examples of nearly all the meteorites that have fallen in Europe for many centuries . It was doubtless the richest and rarest collection in the United States when it was brought to this country . But this cabinet , like his manuscripts , was destroyed by the fire of 1865 . Of the latter years of his life little is known . Ill health had marked him . His letters were those of a man who is resigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fame . In 1826 he made his will . He had no immediate relatives . In his will he left some annuities to servants whom he had had , though none of them resided with him in France , but his estate he willed to his nephew and " his children , legitimate or illegitimate . " Then follows the clause that made possible the institution that bears his name : " In case of the death of my nephew I then bequeath the whole of my property to the United States of America to found at Washington under the name of the Smithsonian Institution an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men . " Smithson died in Genoa 1829 . There lie is buried in the little English cemetery on the heights of San Beniquo . For many years there was no slab to indicate that he was the founder of the institution , but this defect has been remedied . The United States has placed a suitable slab at the grave and a tablet in the church , and keeps the place in very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smithson left this bequest to the United States . He had never visited the country , he had no correspondents in America , he had shown no interest in the new country . England was not specially fond of the United States . The generation that saw the second war with Great Britain had not passed away . England could but look upon the United States as a monument to her King 's folly in colonial administration . Neither was this gift direct . It was dependent upon a condition . Should his nephew ever have any children then the whole estate was to go to them . Smithson died not knowing what would become of his estate . It was this residual phrase inserted in his will between an annuity to a servant and an investment of funds that gave him that immortality his young  | ambition longed for . Another puzzling question is , Where did Smithson get his idea of a great institution at Washington City ? President Washington had favored a great national university . He thought it would help to unite the States ; with Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as the assumption of the national debt and the national bank were . In his farewell address , Washington used words that have some resemblance to the words of Smithson 's will . " Promote as an object of primary importance , institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge . " Had Smithson seen these words ? Did he consciously use Washington 's " general diffusion of knowledge ? " These things we do not know . The Smithsons had not been unfriendly to America . Sir Hugh Smithson opposed the war with the colonies and secured leave of absence for his son Lord Percy , who was ordered to America . This young Lord Percy did not accept the leave of absence , saying that his duty was in the service of the King . He came to Boston with General Gage , who put him in command of the camp at Boston . Young Percy 's letters to his father give an account of the battles at Lexington and Concord . He respected his enemies . His letters do not show that supercilious contempt that most Englishmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lasting impression upon the New England fathers . They were pleased to remember that it took one of the house of Percy to command the army against them . Lowell says : Old Joe is gone who saw hot Percy goad His slow artillery up the Concord road . Had Joe lived long enough , that scrambling fight Had squared more nearly with his sense of right , And vanquished Percy , to complete the tale , Had hammered stone for life in Concord jail . The reputation that Smithson sought never came to him . He died a man unknown to fame , friendless in a distant country , selfexpatriated , but a greater fame came to him in a newer land . Said a President of the United States , " Renowned as is the name of Percy in the historical annals of England ..... let the trust of James Smithson to the United States of America be faithfully executed ..... let the result accomplish his object , ' the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men , ' and a wreath more  | unfading shall entwine itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Smithson than the united bands of history and poetry have braided around the name of Percy , through the long ages past . " Smithson 's will was made in 1826 . His death occurred in 1829 . All his estate passed to his nephew , who died childless in 1835 . Smithson 's solicitors informed the government that there was a bequest in their hands awaiting it . Andrew Jackson was President . He at once communicated the news to Congress in a message of December 1 , 1835 . The Senate referred the matter to a committee who reported favorably on its acceptance . Calhoun and Preston opposed the acceptance on the ground that it was beneath the dignity of this country to accept a gift . Jefferson Davis , however , gave it his strong support and the measure prerailed . In the Lower House the measure found a strong and eloquent champion in ex-President John Quincy Adams , who ever took great interest in the bequest . President Jackson appointed Richard Rush , of Pennsylvania , to go to England and look after the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been minister to England and to France . A wiser selection could not have been made . Mr. Rush went to London and instituted a friendly suit in Chancery for the possession of the bequest . To enter Chancery was to enter upon a long road . There were cases in this court that had been there for generations . Usually it would have taken till 1860 for this court to get through with it , but mirabile dictu ! the suit was ended within two years . Mr. Rush took possession of the bequest and had it converted into gold sovereigns by the Bank of England . To transport them to this country Mr. Rush had the bank to place the sovereigns in 105 bags , each containing 1,000 sovereigns except one . Mr. Rush was very careful to have every penny placed in these bags , for his record says that in another bag there is also " eight shillings and seven pence wrapped in paper . " Mr. Rush reached New York in 1838 and turned the bags over to the mint , still being very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very exact , for the other bag , so the later entry says , contained " eight shillings and six pence " only . The contents , including the annuity paid the nephew 's mother , amounted to $550,000 . The Secretary of the Treasury  | at once invested the funds in Arkansas State bonds paying six per cent . In 1846 Arkansas failed to pay the interest on the bonds , but the United State felt impelled as a trustee to pay the interest and to be responsible for every investment . The United States has ever since paid six per cent . on $538,000 invested in Arkansas securities . For eight years Congress discussed the disposition , or rather the use , to be made of the bequest . President Van Buren invited many learned men to give the government their opinions of the best means of " increasing and diffusing knowledge among mankind . " Various plans were proposed . At first it was thought that Smithson intended that a great university should be founded . Five out of the seven men consulted by the President thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part by the Carnegie bequest , was the proper plan . Mr. Rush , whose enthusiasm was boundless , was opposed to any school . He argued for " a system of scientific correspondence , of lectureships , of general co-operation with the scientific work of the government , a liberal system of publication and collections ? geological , zo-ological , botanical , ethnological , and technological . " Ex-President Adams , whose interest in the bequest never abated , favored the establishment of an Astronomical Observa-tory " equal to any in the world . " Mr. Adams was strongly opposed to the university idea , while Senator Robbins , of Rhode Island , introduced several bills in its favor . When Robbins retired from public life , which he did very soon , the university idea was dropped . An agricultural school with experimental farms of 1,300 acres each , a large staff of teachers , and one hundred students at the commencement was also proposed . Specialists in each line felt that their subjects were the one most important to mankind , and each urged that his specialty be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much disgust that the Secretary of the Treasury informed him that his scheme of an astronomical observatory was unpopular because he had once termed it a " light-house in the skies . " While this discussion was in progress , new agencies were at work . In May , 1840 , there was organized a society entitled the National Institute , whose objects were " the promotion of science  | and the useful arts and the establishment of a museum of natural history . " The National Institute took deep interest in the Smithson bequest . Its meetings were largely attended ; books , gifts , and specimen began to come in and its prospects were flattering . This society continued to influence opinion till the Smithsonian Act was finally passed . The most influential man in the National Institute was Joel R. Poinsett , who was secretary of the navy . At his house the Institute was organized and for several years he was its president . Poinsett was very clear in his views that the Smithson bequest was a great opportunity for the Institute , and boldly declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Institute ought to have the administration of the fund . His enthusiasm was contagious . Even Adams said that he would have to give up his plan for that of Poinsett . The strongest men in America favored the National Institute . Congress granted the society a charter . President Tyler addressed the body with high encomiums , but the society had no funds . It was thought that Congress would grant the funds or , at least , give the society the control of the Smithson bequest and make it an agent of the government . Congress did not do this , and so the society came to a slow end . However , it had lived long enough to demonstrate to all that the new bequest ought not to be used to found schools , but that it should be made a general agency for the advancement of scientific interests of all kinds . After various discussions ? eight years after the bequest was received ? Congress passed the Smithsonian Act , August , 1846 . John Quincy Adams and Poinsett were the most influential men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea had triumphed . The National Institute had not lived its five years in vain . It had stamped its impress indelibly upon the new institution . The Smithsonian Institution , according to the Smithsonian Act , consists of an Establishment whose statutory members are the President of the United States , Chief Justice and other cabinet officials . Their duty is to supervise and instruct the Board of Regents . The Establishment has met eight times . They have been free to call in distinguished men to sit with them .  | The Board of Regents has the immediate management of the Institution . The Board consists of the Vice-President , Chief Justice , three Senators , three Representatives , and six citizens . This Board elects a secretary , who is also their chief executive officer . To him they give the title of the high executive offices of the government . This secretary is responsible for the expenditure of all funds and must necessarily determine the method of the Institution . He makes an annual report to the Regent . To be a regent is esteemed a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , an appreciation of scholarship . From the South there have been many regents ? Chief Justice Taney , Mason , Joseph E. Johnston , W. R. King , Badger , Preston , B. H. Hill , A. H. Stevens . Joseph Wheeler , Jefferson Davis , J. C. Breckenridge , and Wm . L. Wilson . The success of an enterprise depends very much on its chief executive officer . It is in the power of this officer also to determine the character of the work done . There have been three secretaries of the Institution . The first was Prof. Joseph Henry , of Princeton , who was selected in 1846 . Prof. Henry was an investigator in physics . Probably to him rather than to Morse belongs the credit of the invention of the telegraph . At the time of his election he was the best known scientist in America . His selection gave entire satisfaction to the friends of the bequest . He recommended the Board of Regents to follow the will literally . In his " Plan of Organization " he said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress for financial support ; that the funds should be expended for the diffusion of knowledge among mankind in general and should not be restricted to one district nor to one nation ; that the " increase of knowledge " should be effected by encouraging original research of the highest order , and " its diffusion " by the publication of these researches . However , the library idea largely prevailed . A collection of books and curios was made , but Prof. Henry still maintained that this enterprise was too local and should be supported not by the Smithson bequest , but by the government . Henry lived long enough to see the library transferred to the Library of Congress , which is now so handsomely housed , the meteorlogical service placed in the War Department , and the National Museum supported by congressional appropriation . So  | the resources of the institution were left free for the investigator and his publications . Prof. Henry was succeeded in 1878 by Prof. Baird . He carried out the policy of Henry placing special emphasis on the development of the museum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He founded Marine Laboratories , among which is the famous Wood 's Holt . He interested the army in his work and through the assistance of General Winfield Scott and General McClellan secured a collection of reptiles from the far West . The present secretary is Prof. Langley , who is the founder of the Observatory and of the Zo-ological Park . Also he has developed the system of exchanges . The international exchange system is one of the most interesting features of the Institution . The work done by this institution is exchanged for the works of the great societies of the world . Agents are scattered in various parts of the world . This is a literal fulfillment of those words of the will , " the diffusion of knowledge . " Every branch of science has been benefited by the work of the institution . Its investigations have been thorough , for only specialists have been employed . Many of the learned societies of America , like the American Historical Society , make their annual reports to the secretary of the Institution , who publishes them and distributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Smithsonian Institution and under its direction ? from its own funds and with assistance of the government , form a library itself . The idea of Washington has been carried out in a modified form . Mr. Carnegie 's donation will make available the resources of a great government and give greater activity to the work of the Smithsonian Institution .
