txt When Governor-Chairman Odell entered Grand Irving Hall , at 220 Broome Street , last night to attend the Lincoln Republican Club 's mass meeting his coat was covered with confetti which had been showered upon him and his party by the enthusiastic crowd gathered in the street . That the Governor was pleased with his reception was evident from the smile he wore , and which showed no signs of coming off as be left the hail . This was only the first of a veries of ovations the Governor-Chairman received on a tour t " the east side . It was 9 o'clock when the Governor-Chairman and his party , consisting of Edward Lauterbach , President Murray of the republican County Committee , Joseph Levineon , Charles Adler , and Col. Kowalski and Dr. Adolphe DenAger of California , arrived . There had already been a display of fireworks in the street , supplemented by an equally brilliant display of oratorical pyrotechnics in the hall by Otto Rosalsky , the Republican leader of the district . Word had reached the district in the afternoon that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give him a big reception . His picture , draped with American flags , was hung from the centre of the gallery in the hall , and there was a run on the shops having confetti for sale . About five minutes before the time set for the meeting to open , a small boy with an earthenware pitcher of Rater made his way to the platform . He was pushed back by the indignant head Usher , who said : " Do n't you know that die Governor is to be here to-night , Bring es two syphons of Seltzer . " The syphons were brought , arid the head usher , pleased over ills thoughtfulness , paid this compliment to his own genius : " We want to charge ' em up a little . Ice Rater ai n't no stimulant for eloquence . " Cheered for Six Minutes . The Governor-Chairman was cheered on his entrance for a full siz minutes . It was a. frantic sort . of a . demonstration . Men waved hats , coats , and chairs . If a majority of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak above a whisper for a week it will be a wonder . A brass band in the gallery tried to compete with them , but was a poor second , which is say- I lag a good deal considering the din the band had been able to raise when going it alone earlier in the evening . The only reason why the demonstration ended at the end of six minutes was that the crowd had exhausted itself . Several times it tried to break out afresh , but was too feeble to persevere . Next in interest to the tremendous demonstration over Gov . Odell was the bitter attacks which all of the speakers , except the Governor , made upon ex-Secretary Olney for his condemnation of the attitude of the Administration in protesting against the outrages committed against the Jews in Roumania and Russia . In opening the meeting Mr. Rosalsky said that the soup house sites on the east side in 1S03 were now the sites of banks . He declared Gov . Odell to he the greatest Governor the State had ever had , and closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is a canidate for re-election in the district . tIn introducing Gov . Odell , Mr. Rosalsky said : " lt gives me great pleasure to introduce to you the man whose name will ever stand 245 a monument of honor and glory to the Republican Party in this State  --  Benjamin E. Odell . " His Plan to Prevent Fraud . The crowd tried to shout , but finding itself too hoarse began to whistle while the band played . When silence was restored the Governor spoke as follows : " I would be vain indeed if i failed to appreciate to the fullest degree the magnificent reception which you have tendered me . The thought came to me as I watched you cheering that if you vote as you cheer the majorities against the Republican Party in this county will be so small that they will hardly be worth counting . " I have come down here to-night because I realize that in this section there are honest and sterling Republicans who are always ready to do battle for the cause . We ' lave now started on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our efforts will be such as to astonish our Democratic friends on election day . I have been here since last June formulating plans to secure us a fair and equal chance and to prevent fraud in the coming election . The registration tells how well those plans have succeeded . Applause. - Every man has a right to vote if he has complied wit , / the requirements of the Ian- , be he Democrat or Republican , and in the protection of that right every decent citizen owes him co-operation . Those who attempt to nullify the vote of a citizen who is a legal elector are guilty of a crime greater than any in the Penal Code . There is no principle of our Government so important as the purity of the elective franchise . I call upon every honest man to see to it that the right of suffrage is honestly exercised in this city in the coming election . Applause . " We are on the . ' eve of a great and important election .

" As important as it is that the Republican Party should be continued in power in the Nation , it is no less important that - we should have a Republican administration in this State . " During the past few years of Republican rule in the State your city has obtained a greater degree of home rule than it had ever enjoyed . Many of you can remember the time when the tax rate of Brooklyn and of your own city was faxed by the Legislature , when you could not build extra schoolhouses , employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things that I might mention for tile improvement and betterment of your city . All that has been changed . " During the past year the Legislature ? gave you so great a measure of home ruie that the Democrats failed to recognize it ! when they received It . Laughter . But , more than any other act of my administration , I pride myself on the passage of the tenement-house law . which has given you better homes , more of God 's sunshine , and more pure air . Great applause . ' We . have in our candidate for Governor a man with whom it has been my privilege to associate for many years . I have always found him honest , straightforward , and independent . " There seems to be an impeesslon in some quarters that somebody owns Lieut . Gov . Eiggins . From an experience of four years as Chief Executive I want to tell you that the man who entertains the idea that he can carry the Governor of this State in his vest pocket will wake up some morning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Great applause. ; You will no longer find entries made in lead pencil , as they were in 1893 ? under a Democratic administration , but in good ink . " We have taken better care of the wards of the State than ever before , and are doing all that can be done to restore to society as useful members of it those who have erred in early life . " Gov .

After teiiing how the Judge had vkited the Grand Street Theatre be said : " And then he went to Lorber 's restaurant and sat down with Adler the actor on one side of him and Jerome tile fakir on the other . " This utterance was received with but mild applause , the audience apparently not entirely approving it . On leaving Grand Irving Halt , Gov . Odell and his party went to Concordia Hall , in ? Avenue A , where the Hungarian Republican Club wa 's holding : a meeting . The coming of the Governor wad not been anticipated , and the hall was not more than half filled . The Governor was introduced by Marcus Braun . He said : I venture the prediction that this State wilt roll up such a great Republican majority above tile Bronx that it will he impossible for any Democratic majority in Greater New York to overcome it . Every I man has his own part to play in this contest .

Do n't allow your vote to be nullified by that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polling place in the city is properly manned and that no man who is not entitled to vote is allowed to vote . " On leaving Concordia Hall the Governor was driven to the Progress Republican Club of the Tenth Assembly District , where he was the guest of Leader Rothman . He held a reception there , but did not speak . It was after 11 o'clock when he returned to his hotel .
