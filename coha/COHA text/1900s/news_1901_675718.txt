txt It will be small comfort to those who have lost their wagers on the course of the stock market in the last few days to reflect that the reaction that has taken place has probably saved some of them from worse losses , and has almost certainly saved the country from more widespread and more serious disturbance . In a sense , the collapse of the market has been due to an accident . A struggle between two sets of men of great strength and apparently uncertain temper for the control of an important stock gave an opportunity for a shrewd manipulator to plan a corner in that stock . In this he was aided by the eagerness with which a number of experienced and confident persons hastened to agree to deliver stock which they did not possecs , and the necessities of this graup forced them to offers that demoralized the entire body of speculators and drove the weaker of them from the field badly used up . The whole operation had no relation to the intrinsic value of the particular stock , or to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt and it may turn out unmixed evil for the country . If it serves to check the speculative spirit that had become very general and was becoming reckless , the country will be safer and happier and more prosperous in the Autumn than it would have been if the reaction had been deferred . Look for a moment at the situation as it was at the close of business yesterday , the second day of " panic " in the street , compared with the situation a year ago . We have taken a dozen stocks , ranging in price a year ago from 67 to 149 , all of them the stocks of corporations doing a solid business in transportation and otherwise , and paying a fairly good return on their price at that time . These stocks declined during yesterday and Wednesday from eight to twenty-four points , a decline that reflected the general disturbance due to the twisting of the " shorts " in Northern Pacific . Yet at the closing prices of yesterday the average of these stocks was 9 per cent . higher than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . higher than the lowest rates for that month . And this substantial net advance is the result of a pretty steady rise , reduced by two days oil sudden confusion . It is not a discouraging showing for the sober portion of the community , for that portion that relies for its income on the regular and normal returns of steady business based on the development of the resources and energies of the country . may be assumed that the speculative fever which was checked by the convulsion in Wall Street would have gone on increasing in intensity as long as prices continued to rise , and would hilve absorbed a much larger share of the available funds , and drawn more heavily on the available credit of the country . The reaction was bound to come . As the comparative prices show , it has begun before there was an extravagant inflation of nominal values If , as may be assumed , this reaction shall cool the fever and leave the country in a steadier and more rational mood , it is well that it has occuired. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
