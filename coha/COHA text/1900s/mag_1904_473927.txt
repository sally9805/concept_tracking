IN none of his works does that tremendous artist Nature reveal himself so magically as in the airy transformations and changing harmonies of the clouds . Mighty and mystical master , Ms art is here seen at its strangest and its . simplest . How few and intangible his materials ; how apparently simple his methods ? vapor and currents of air and the old sun and moon ; and yet what an impressive and mysterious beauty he creates from them , there on the canvas of the sky ! Nowhere else is he seen so triumphantly as an artist of pure effect . Elsewhere we may meet with him as a melodramatist of the everlasting hills , a scene-painter of gorge and gloom and the white torrent ; but in creating such effects he has employed materials so enduring as to be called everlasting . Nature will be his own Salvator Rosa millions of years after the name of Salvator Rosa has faded from the memory of the universe , because his Salvator Rosas are made of that veritable rock and lightning and ancient darkness which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when Nature , so to speak , turns Titian and Turner , he is at a disadvantage in his materials , for the pigments of the clouds are volatile as a perfume , and fade even as the artist lays them on morning or evening sky . With the invisible artist of the clouds it is now or never for his effects , and the pictures he paints are gone even as he paints them , never to be seen again . Perhaps only one eye in all the world has seen them , some lonely figure lost in the twilight One eye alone in all Verona cared for the soft sky his pictures must pass like a strain of music . Effect , pure effect ; not effect caught and fossilized as in sculpture , or arrested awhile as in painting , but Pffeet alive and changing every moment , effect musical in its development ? music , indeed , made visible in color . All human art must pass away , but most of it has a certain spurious stability . If you are rich , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not buy her a sunrise . Even while you run to fetch her to look at it , it is gone . He will not even wait while she dons a morning wrapper , ? that arrogant " Whistler of the sky . Transitory as emotion , it has the same pathos as all poignant passing things , this art of the heavens , the same keen excitement . Perhaps we should soon learn to tire of it if it were not so mobile . Even some masterpieces hare hung too long upon the walls of time . It is this expressive movement of sensitive vapor , this unforeseen touch of change here and there ? a shining finger seen for a moment and then withdrawn , ? this disposition and re-disposition of masses , this slow womblike trouble of darkness and light , this sudden avenue of splendid swords , this calm overture of glory , these marching trumpets of light ? this radiant issue of immortal fire : it is in such effects as this that the mysterious art of the sky o'er-tops the arts of earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to move the heart and stir the senses , and , above all , to thrill and summon the soul , which surely no earthly arts can claim . With no formula , no conventions , no traditional motives , classically to command us ? absolutely without notation of any kind ? it is yet able to say all that the human heart has over felt or ever dreamed . There is no emotion of whatever kind that you can not , one time or another , find expressed for you in the sky . If you are sad and lonely , and your heart almost breaking with the fine - drawn music of regret , look at yonder sky . You are not so sad and lonely as that . Why , you almost forget your own sorrow as you gaze on that exquisite sorrow . Would you have silence , would you dream of a peace made of mother-of-pearl and the evening star : there again is the sky ! And would you be pure , and firm of faith , and free as the boundless air ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you ever see a face so wicked as is sometimes the face of the sky , so sinister with hushed menace , so livid with ambushed evil , so truculently brutal with thunder ? There is nothing that you can dream of or dread that is not pictured in the sky , with a force and intensity such as elsewhere you must seek in dreams . Black continents of monsters jawed with fire ; lagoons of shining ether ; a star , safe and silent , like a candle burning by a sleeping child ; floating islands rimmed with silver ; bergs of saffron fire drifting in the solar sea ; gardens and golden gates and towers of snow ; armies with drums of darkness and terrible spears ; a dove all alone in heaven ; bosoms filled with roses ; cataracts of moonshine falling from cloud to cloud ; peacocks made of stars ; gonfalons of flaming dew ; and battlements thronged with unearthly faces ... . There is , indeed , no such picture-book as this picture-book of the clouds ; but it is not by such concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky seriously takes hold of us ? these merely imitative , one might say punning , simulacra , accidental and unmeaning as faces seen in the fire ; it is rather by pictorial moods of expressiveness too fluid to be called symbolic , great abstract schemes of modulated radiance , that , like some of the greatest pictures , mean nothing but ? Eternity ; Eternity ? or some other words hardly less simply profound : in its power , in fact , of expressing the - trancelike dreams of the spirit , moods of the imagination , and even states of the mind . Perhaps the strangest thing about this art of the sky is its power over the soul . With all its pomp and magnificence of color , it is never sensual . Its glories and its revelries , though bright as a Persian carpet and Dionysiac as the feast of Belshazzar , seem somehow purged of earthly significance . Addressing the mere mortal eye with such prismatic eloquence , their true message seems somehow to our immortal part . The beauty of the earth too often demoralizes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ever was demoralized by looking at the sky . Its pictures are like those of some Hebrew prophet , or those in the Book of Revelation . They have all the colored magnificence of earth , yet they mean nothing but heaven . There is something mysteriously pure about this artist of the sky . But it is not merely the purity of the spirit to which he answers ; it is perhaps especially the prodigious perspective of its ambition that he makes visible. ; for another strange thing about the sky is that it never daunts , but only corroborates , the soul . Of course there are now and again times when a solitary man lying on an empty moorland , and looking up into the sky , is momentarily impressed and overborne with his mortal insignificance ; but the impression is , as I said , momentary , speedily to he followed by an exultant sense of his immortal significance ? his mastery over , his spiritual possession of , all that infinite stillness and power . The arch of the sky is not really greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starry vastness within his small skull that binds stronger bands than those of Orion . It is only when a man looks at the earth that he is afraid . So soon as he looks at the sky , that irresistible serenity of spiritual power , which he has either learned from the sky or read into it , returns to him . He feels ? nay , he knows ? that this sky is but the provocative avenue of his destiny , the triumphal highway of his conquering soul , hung with rosy garlands of clouds . No argument for the immortality of the soul can compete with the rising of the moon . Man , it is to be feared , pays but little attention to doctors of divinity , but even a common sailor , as the phrase is , thinks something of his poor existence as he sights the Southern Cross . Yes , the worst and the best of us answer to , and , indeed , eagerly watch , the sky . In a sense we are all astrologers , all augurs of the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars are the chart of the soul . A less transcendental observation of the clouds may yet be intrusted with a. record of visible data hardly less mystical than the foregoing impressions . It must , for example , take note of the mysterious way in which Nature loves to repeat in the sky the patterns he has delighted to stamp upon this or that creature or aspect of the earth , or upon the moving curtain of the sea . Nature , like all great artists , loves to experiment with materials . He lures to try the old effect in the new medium . In summer he makes dim ferns , so delicate in shape that you can hardly believe that they have roots , except , maybe , in fairy-land ; then in winter he tries the same patterns on the window-pane . Nothing in nature , if it has happened to strike you , or if you care to give it a serious thought , is more mysterious than this decorative repetition ? this duplication and reduplication of decorative pattern , now in one material and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pattern there is no work of his hands with which he will not impress it , however apparently incongruous the impression . He will as effectively depict the tiger as the lily or the deer , and crowd upon the wings of a butterfly all the glories of earth and heaven . How he loves to emblazon some little frightened fish as though he were a fine gentleman in. the sun , or hang a serpent with colored rings as though he were the planet Saturn ? How he lavishes his gold and his bronze upon the beetle , and in the dead of night decks the tinder wings of the sleepy moth with the lost purple of Tyre ! And again how he delights to rainbow the roots of inaccessible hills with gardens of amazing crystal ! But nowhere is he more imitative than in the sky . There is not a color-scheme of earth , not a pattern of flower or a tint or rhythm of the sea , that he will not match for you in those misty lawns and silks and aery sunshine of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where lies the secret soul of color and form in the universe , and what Nature means by this love of the same Shape over and over again , and one might say the same metre . But we shall only know that when we can affirmatively answer those majestic questions put by the Eternal to the stricken Job ; when we know where the light dwelleth , and as for darkness , where is the place thereof ; when we have entered into the treasures of the snow , and seen the treasure of the hail , and discovered the hidden ordinances of heaven . Yes , there is nothing in nature more provocative of meditation than these painted phantoms of the sky , so transitory that the life of a flower is long by comparison ; and one other element of strangeness about them is that they are literally phantoms , and in a sense subjective appearances , the shape and color of which are not merely determined by the physical materials of which they are composed , but by the distance from which they are seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example . Seen close , we have but an unmeaning motley.of paint . The distance is literally a part . of the enchantment . Literally , there is no picture close to ; and so it is with the clouds . It is open to the moralist to say that so it is withlife itself , more or less so with all our experience ; for is not Life a species of Fata Morgana seen afar off in youth , a wonderland of rainbows to which we hasten through the morning dew ? But when at length in middle age we come to occupy these cloud-capped towers alas for the fairy colors and the glory forever passed away . And yet I do n't know but that this is a superficial moral to draw from the clouds ; indeed , I am more than a little sure that it is , and for myself prefer rather to put my trust in those mystical intimations of immortality with which , as I said before , they beckon the soul . Even in their very immateriality and transitoriness , their brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is , so to speak , mushily to , the spirit , whose own life is a vapor , blown before the breath of God , and for a little while colored by the sun . They are but appearances , yet so are we and the whole world ; passing embodiments of the Protean ' soul of things , all alike mysterious , all alike stirring in us the need of an interpreter , but none more , perhaps , than these shapes of air and shining dew .
