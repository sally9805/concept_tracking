SO far as we can judge from what we see on our globe , the production of life is one of the greatest and most incessant purposes of nature . Life is absent only in regions of perpetual frost , where it never has an opportunity to begin ; in places where the temperature is near the boiling-point , which is found to be destructive to it ; and beneath the earth 's surface , whore none of the changes essential to it can come about . Within the limits imposed by these prohibitory conditions ? that is to say , within the range of temperature at which water retains its liquid state , and in regions where the sun 's rays can penetrate and where wind can blow and water exist in a liquid form ? life is the universal rule . How prodigal nature seems to be in its production is too trite a fact to be dwelt upon . We have all read of the millions of germs which are destroyed for every one that comes to maturity . Even the higher forms of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discovered which were uninhabited , and animals of a higher grade are as widely diffused as man . If it would be going too far to claim that all conditions may have forms of life appropriate to them , it would be going as much too far in the other direction to claim that life can exist only with the precise surroundings which nurture it on this planet . It is very remarkable in this connection that while in one direction we see life coming to an end , in the other direction we see it flourishing more and more up to the limit . These two directions are those of heat and cold . We can not suppose that life would develop in any important degree in a region of perpetual frost , such as the polar regions of our globe . But we do not find any end to it as the climate becomes warmer . On the contrary , every one knows that the tropics are the most fertile regions of the globe in its production . The luxuriance of the vegeta- tion and the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where the limit may be set no one can say . But it would doubtless be far above the present temperature of the equatorial regions . It has often been said that this does not apply to the human race , that men lack vigor in the tropics . But human vigor depends on so many conditions , hereditary and otherwise , that we can not regard the inferior development of humanity in the tropics as due solely to temperature . Physically considered , no men attain a better development than many tribes who inhabit the warmer regions of the globe . The inferiority of these regions in intellectual power is more likely the result of race heredity than that of temperature . We all know that . this earth on which we dwell is only one of countless millions of globes scattered through the wilds of infinite space . So far as we know , most of these globes are wholly unlike the earth , being at a temperature so high that , like our sun , they shine by their own light . In such worlds we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . But evidence is continually increasing that dark and opaque worlds like ours exist and revolve around their suns as the earth on which we dwell revolves around its central luminary . Although the number of such globes yet discovered is not . great , the circumstances under which they are found lead us to believe that the actual number may be as great as that of the visible stars which stud the sky . If so , the probabilities are that millions of them are essentially similar to our own globe . Have we any reason to believe that life exists on these other worlds ? The reader will not expect me to answer this question positively . It must be admitted that , scientifically , we have  | no light upon the question , and therefore no positive grounds for reaching a conclusion . We can only reason by analogy and by what we know of the origin and conditions of life around us , and assume that the same agencies which are at play here would be found at play under similar conditions in other parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has been , we know historically that our race has , in all periods of its history , peopled other regions with beings even higher in the scale of development than we are ourselves . The gods and demons of an earlier age all wielded powers greater than those granted to man ? powers which they could use to determine human destiny . But , up to the time that Copernicus showed that the planets were other worlds , the location of these imaginary beings was rather indefinite . It was therefore quite natural that when the moon and planets were found to be dark globes of a size comparable with that of the earth itself , they were made the habitations of beings like unto ourselves . The trend of modern discovery has been against carrying this view to its extreme , as will be presently shown . Before considering the difficulties in the way of accepting it to the widest extent , let us enter upon some preliminary considerations as to the origin and prevalence of life , so far as we have any sound basis to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our planet was one of the great mysteries of science . All the facts brought out by investigation into the past history of our earth seemed to show , with hardly the possibility of a doubt , that there was a time when it was a fiery mass , no more capable of serving as the abode of a living being than the interior of a Bessemer steel furnace . There must therefore have been , within a certain period , a beginning of life upon its surface . But , so far as investigations had gone ? indeed , so far as it has gone to the present time , ? no life has been found to originate of itself . The living germ seems to be necessary to the beginning of any living form . Whence , then , came the first germ ? Many of our readers may remember a suggestion by Sir William Thompson , now Lord Kelvin , made twenty or thirty years ago , that life may have been brought to our planet by the falling of a meteor from space . This does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only make it greater . It still leaves open the question how life began on the meteor ; and granting this , why it was not destroyed by the heat generated as the meteor passed through the air . The popular view that life began through a special act of creative power seemed to be almost forced upon man by the failure of science to discover any other beginning for it . It can not be said that even to-day anything definite has been actually discovered to refute this view . All we can say about it is that it does not run in with the general views of modern science as to the beginning of things , and that those who refuse to accept it must hold that , under certain conditions which prevail , life begins by a very gradual process , similar to that by which forms suggesting growth seem to originate even under conditions so unfavorable as those existing in a bottle of acid . But it is not at all necessary for our purpose to decide this question . If life existed through a creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was confined to one of the countless millions of worlds scattered through space . If it began at a certain stage of evolution by a natural process , the question will arise , what conditions are favorable to the commencement of this process ? Here we are quite justified in reasoning from what , granting this process , has taken place upon our globe during its past history . One of the most elementary principles accepted by the human mind is that like causes produce like effects . The special conditions under which we find life to develop around us may be comprehensively summed up as the existence of water in the liquid state and the presence of nitrogen , free perhaps in the first place , but accompanied by every substance with which it may form combinations . Oxygen , hydrogen , and nitrogen are , then , the fundamental requirements . The addition of calcium or other forms of matter necessary to the existence of a solid world goes without saying . The question , then , is whether these  | necessary conditions exist in other parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chemical elements go , other worlds are composed of the same substance as ours . ' Hydrogen especially exists everywhere , and we have reason to believe that the same is true of oxygen and nitrogen . Calcium , the base of lime , is almost universal . So far as chemical elements go , we may therefore take it for granted that the conditions under which life begins are very widely diffused in the universe . It is contrary to all the analogies of nature to suppose that life began only on a single world . It is a scientific inference , based on facts so numerous as not to admit of serious question , that during the history of our globe there has been a continually improving development of life . As ages upon ages pass , new forms are generated , higher in the scale than those which preceded them , until at length reason appears and asserts its sway . In his last and well - known work Alfred Russell Wallace has argued that this development of life required the presence of such a rare combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it prevailed anywhere except on our earth . It is quite impossible in an article like the present to follow his reasoning in detail ; but it seems to me altogether inconclusive . Not only does life , but intelligence , flourish on this globe under a great variety of conditions as regards temperature and surroundings , and no sound reason can be shown why under certain conditions , which are frequent in the universe , intelligent beings should not acquire the highest development . Now let us look at the subject from the view of the mathematical theory of probabilities . A fundamental tenet of this theory is that no matter how improbable a result may be on a single trial , supposing it at all possible , it is sure to occur after a sufficient number of trials , ? and over and over again if the trials are repeated often enough . For example , if a million grains of corn , of which a single one was red , were all placed in a pile , and a blindfolded person were required to grope in the pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , the chances would be a million to one against his drawing out the red grain . If drawing it meant he should die , a sensible person would give himself no concern at having to draw the grain . The probability of his death would not be so great as the actual probability that he will really die within the next twenty-four hours . And yet if the whole human race were required to run this chance , it is certain that about fifteen hundred , or one out of a million , of the whole human family would draw the red grain and meet his death . Now apply this principle to the universe . Let us suppose , to fix the ideas , that there are a hundred million worlds , but that the chances are 1000 to 1 against any one of these taken at random being fitted for the highest development of life or for the evolution of reason . The chances would still be that 100,000 of them would be inhabited by rational beings whom we may call human . But where are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell . We only infer from the statistics of the stars , and this inference is fairly well grounded , that the number of worlds which , so far as we know , may be inhabited , are to be counted by thousands , and perhaps by millions . In a number of bodies so vast we should expect every variety of conditions as regards temperature and surroundings . If we suppose that the special conditions which prevail on our planet are necessary to the highest forms of life , we still have reason to believe that these same conditions prevail on thousands of other worlds . The fact that we might find the conditions in millions of other worlds unfavorable to . life would not disprove the existence of the latter on countless worlds differently situated . Coming down now from the general question to the specific one , we all know that the only worlds the conditions of which can be made the subject of observation are the planets which revolve around the sun , and their satellites . The question whether these bodies are inhabited is one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of observation at present , but every appliance of research that we can conceive of men devising . If Mars is inhabited , and if the people of that planet have equal powers with ourelves , the problem of merely producing  | an illumination which could be seen in our most powerful telescope would be beyond all the ordinary efforts of an entire nation . An unbroken square mile of flame would be invisible in our telescopes , but a hundred square miles might be seen . We can not , therefore , expect to see any signs of the works of inhabitants even on Mars . All that we can do is to ascertain with greater or less probability whether the conditions necessary to life exist on the other planets of the system . The moon being much the nearest to us of all the heavenly bodies , we can pronounce more definitely in its case than in any other . We know that neither air nor water exists on the moon in quantities sufficient to be perceived by the most delicate tests at our command . It is certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less than the thousandth part of the density of that around us . The vacuum is greater than any ordinary air-pump is capable of producing . We can hardly suppose that so small a quantity of air could be of any benefit whatever in sustaining life ; an animal that could get along on so little could get along on none at all . But the proof of the absence of life is yet stronger when we consider the results of actual telescopic observation . An object such as an ordinary city block could be detected on the moon . If anything like vegetation were present on its surface , we should see the changes which it would undergo in the course of a month , during one portion of which it would be exposed to the rays of the unclouded sun , and during another to the intense cold of space . If men built cities , or even separate buildings the size of the larger ones on our earth , we might see some signs of them . In recent times we not only observe the moon with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photography . The whole visible surface has been repeatedly photographed under the best conditions . But no change has been established beyond question , nor does the photograph show the slightest difference of structure or shade which could be attributed to cities or other works of man . To all appearances the whole surface of our satellite is as completely devoid of life as the lava newly thrown from Vesuvius . We next pass to the planets . Mercury , the nearest to the sun , is in a position very unfavorable for observation from the earth , because when nearest to us it is between us and the sun , so that its dark hemisphere is presented to us . Nothing satisfactory has yet been made out as to its condition . We can not say with certainty whether it has an atmosphere or not . What seems very probable is that the temperature on its surface is higher than any of our earthly animals could sustain . But this proves nothing . We know that Venus has an atmosphere . This was very conclusively shown during the transits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so filled with clouds or vapor that it does not seem likely that we ever get a view of the solid body of the planet through it . Some observers have thought They could see spots on . Venus day after day , while others have disputed this view . On the whole , if intelligent inhabitants live there , it is not likely that they ever see sun or stars . Instead of the sun they see only an effulgence in the vapory sky which disappears and reappears at regular intervals . When we come to Mars , we have more definite knowledge , and there seems to be greater possibilities for life there than in the case of any other planet besides the earth . The main reason for denying that life such as ours could exist there is that the atmosphere of Mars is so rare that , in the light of the most recent researches , we can not be fully assured that it exists at all . The very careful comparisons of the spectra of Mars and the moon made by Campbell at the Lick Observatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Mars had an atmosphere as dense as ours , the result could be seen in the darkening of the lines of the spectrum produced by the double passage of the light through it . There were no lines in the spectrum of Mars that were not seen with equal distinctness in that of the moon . But this does not prove the entire absence of an atmosphere . It only shows a limit to its density . It may be one-fifth or onefourth the density of that on the earth , but no more .  | That there must be something in the nature of vapor at least seems to be shown by the formation and disappearance of the white polar caps of this planet . Every reader of astronomy at the present time knows that , during the Martian winter , white caps form around the pole of the planet which is turned away from the sun , and grow larger and larger until the sun begins to shine upon them , when they gradually grow smaller , and perhaps nearly disappear . It seems , therefore , fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some white substance forms around the polar regions of Mars which evaporates under the influence of the sun 's rays . It has been supposed that this substance is snow produced in the same way that snow is produced on the earth , by the evaporation of water . But there are difficulties in the way of this explanation . The sun sends less than half as much heat to Mars as to the earth , and it does not seem likely that the polar regions can ever receive enough of heat to melt any considerable quantity of snow . Nor does it seem likely that any clouds from which snow could fall ever obscure the surface of Mars . But a very slight change in the explanation will make it tenable . Quite possibly the white deposits may be due to something like hoar frost condensed from slightly moist air , without the actual production of snow . This would produce the effect that we see . Even this explanation implies that Mars has air and water , rare though the former may be . It is quite possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . Life not totally unlike that on the earth may therefore exist upon Mars for anything that we know to the contrary . More than this we can not say . In the ease of the outer planets the answer to our question must be in the negative . It now seems likely that Jupiter is a body very much like our sun , only that the dark portion is too cool to emit much , if any , light . It is doubtful whether Jupiter has anything in the nature of a solid surface . Its interior is in all likelihood a mass of molten matter far above a red heat , which is surrounded by a comparatively cool , yet , to our measure , extremely hot , vapor . The beltlike clouds which surround the planet are due to this vapor combined with the rapid rotation . If there is any solid surface below the atmosphere that we can see , it is swept by winds such that nothing we have on earth could withstand them . But , as we have said , the probabilities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At some great depth in the fiery vapor there is a solid nucleus ; that is all we can say . The planet Saturn seems to be very much like that of Jupiter in its composition . It receives so little heat from the sun that , unless it is a mass of fiery vapor like Jupiter , the surface must be far below the freezing-point . We can not speak with such certainty of Uranus and Neptune ; yet the probability seems to be that they are in much the same condition as Saturn . They are known to have very dense atmospheres , which shine only by the light of the sun . But nothing is known of the composition of these atmospheres . To sum up our argument : the fact that , so far as we have yet been able to learn , only a very small proportion of the visible worlds scattered through space are fitted to be the abode of life does not preclude the probability that among hundreds of millions of such worlds a vast number are so fitted . Such being the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , whatever the process which led to life upon this earth ? whether a special act of creative power or a gradual course of development ? through that same process does life begin in every part of the universe fitted to sustain it . The course of development involves a gradual improvement in living forms , which by irregular steps rise higher and higher in the scale of being . We have every reason to believe that this is the case wherever life exists . It is , therefore , perfectly reasonable to suppose that beings , not only animated , but endowed with reason , inhabit countless worlds in space . It would , indeed , be very inspiring could we learn by actual observation what forms of society exist throughout space , and see the members of such societies enjoying themselves by their warm firesides . But this is , so far as we can now see , entirely beyond the possible reach of our race , so long as it is confined to a single world .  |          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
