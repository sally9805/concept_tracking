BILLIE ( Pointing with his thumb over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice and looking off R.U. ) Is n't Josephine up yet ? It 's ten o'clock . BILLIE No , and I do n't want her to wake up until I finish this . JIMMIE Say , that 's stunning ! Looks as if Mariette herself had posed for it . All from memory ? BILLIE No , I 'm using this photograph . JIMMIE What started you up on her ? Was n't that her little French song you were singing as I came in ? ( BILLIE nods ) I say , Billie , do n't begin that again . I 'll never forget how you sung that song over and over and over when you went off your nut . BILLIE ( Seriously ) Neither will I ! JIMMIE Did you know you were singing it ? BILLIE Of course I did . That 's the awful thing about delirium . You know what you 're doing and thinking about all the time , and you ca n't help it , and you never forget . JIMMIE Look here , Billie , if you 're going to commence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Showing JIMMIE the morning paper , and comparing it with the photo he is copying ) See the resemblance ? JIMMIE The resemblance ? To Mariette ? Naw !

In Wall Street ? JIMMIE I 've got to get it somehow . ( Goes over to bureau , takes up rings , selects one , holding it up ) I could get five on that easy . Josephine 's a regular brick . She would n't care . BILLIE Put that down , Jimmie , what are you talking about ? What have you to do with Ozette ? JIMMIE She 's a peach ! ( Kissing his fingers , as if to her ) She 's a chocolate sundae . BILLIE Is she colored ? JIMMIE Naw ! What do you think ? ( Coming down again ) She said she heard of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , from Dunsty McNish . He was there studying art , he gave her an introduction to me ( Preening himself ) and , Gee Whiz ! What she did n't ask about you ! p. 5 BILLIE About me ? Pish tush ! Run along ! I have n't a cent . JIMMIE No , I mean it . About when you got married to Josephine  --  about your first wife  --  I told her how she ran away and died in the wreck and how cut up you were . How you went off your head and how Josephine  --  took care of you  --  and  --   --  BILLIE Damn your impudence ! What do you mean by discussing my personal affairs with a total stranger ? JIMMIE But she was so sympathetic ! ( JOSEPHINE , outside , yawns audibly . BILLIE gets up , puts photograph into pocket of smock and painting behind the bureau . ) JIMMIE Josephine can find it there . BILLIE She can , but she wo n't . This place has n't been tidied up for a week and it wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is rehearsing . JIMMIE It 's a great chance for Josephine . She 'll be wonderful in the mad scene . BILLIE ( Dryly ) She ought to be . " I miss Mariette terribly these days . Do you remember how this place used to look ? Poor little Mariette , if she had only understood , it need never have happened . I have no inspiration now . If she had lived , I might have amounted to something . p. 6 JIMMIE Aw , Billie , forget it ! Mariette was a dear , but she did n't have half the pep that Josephine has ; or Ozette . ( Takes up newspaper ) She does look a little like Mariette . But all French women look alike . BILLIE How many have you known ? JIMMIE Two . Say , Billie , be a good brother , let me have a fiver , wo n't you ? I 'll pay it back out of my first week 's salary . I 'm to have twenty-five dollars a week . BILLIE What for ? JIMMIE I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'll have a fine vocabulary , commencing with " nut " and ending with " chocolate sundae . " JOSEPHINE ( Outside , yawning ) Billie ! JIMMIE Please , Billie , I 'll pay it back , sure . BILLIE You young black-hand ! I believe you 'd murder me to get the gold out of my teeth . There 's a portrait of General  --  Grant . ( Giving him a bill ) That 's what I am when you 're around . Now , get out of here and do n't let me see you again for a week . JIMMIE Thank you , Billie , you 're a brick ! So long ! ( Exit L.U. ) p. 7 BILLIE ( Calling after him ) The longer , the better . ( JOSEPHINE thrusts her head with curl-papers through portiers R.U. ) JOSEPHINE ( Pleasantly ) Come here , you sweet thing and give me a kiss . ( BILLIE goes up with an air of annoyance and gives her a peck . She sniffs , holding him by lapel of coat ) My , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , new-mown hay or Mary Garden ? BILLIE ( Drawing away ) Never mind about that . We have n't had breakfast , you know , and it 's  --   --  JOSEPHINE Now it must n't be cross with its wifie . ( Withdraws ) BILLIE ( Sitting down L. of table and shaking out paper ) I wo n't be alluded to as It . JOSEPHINE ( Outside , cheerily ) All right , Billie dear . Light the chafing-dish and by the time it boils I 'll be dressed . ( BILLIE goes over to side board R. and lights the chafing-dish , burning his hands , etc . JOSEPHINE continues outside , melodramatically ) ' T is now the very witching time of night , when church-yards yawn , and hell itself breathes forth contagion to this world . Now could I drink hot blood  --  " p. 8 BILLIE Make it hot coffee for me . JOSEPHINE Billie ! BILLIE Well ? JOSEPHINE ( Outside ) Give me my stockings . BILLIE Where are they ? JOSEPHINE I do n't know . Look under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , picks up stockings and goes over and picks up slipper from under easel ) What 's the matter , Billie , ca n't you find them ? BILLIE I ca n't find but one slipper . JOSEPHINE Well , give me one of yours , and hurry , dear , it 's chilly this morning . ( BILLIE tosses in slippers and stockings , and returns to seat L. of table ) Do you see anything of my neglige jacket and striped petticoat ? BILLIE ( Picking them up from the floor , where he had thrown them ) I wish you 'd throw this striped thing away . I hate the sight of it . ( Throws in petticoat and jacket and goes back to seat . Pause . ) JOSEPHINE Say , Billie . BILLIE Well , what is it ? p. 9 JOSEPHINE What 's the theatrical news ? BILLIE More about Ozette , the papers have gone mad over her . ( Picks up paper , looks nervously toward R. U. , tears picture out of paper and puts it in his pocket ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglige jacket , curl-papers , which she takes out as she goes over to bureau , speaking as she goes . She has one high-heeled slipper and one low one on . ) JOSEPHINE Let me see the paper , Billie . Is there a picture of her ? BILLIE ( Confused ) Yes , there was , but I was looking to see if the paper had boiled and the water caught fire  --  that is  --  JOSEPHINE You should be more careful , Billie . ( Sees slipper on mantel-piece and exchanges it for BILLIE 'S which she has on ) Did you see anything of my part when you were pawing up the turf here awhile ago ? BILLIE Ca n't you wait till after breakfast ? JOSEPHINE ( She has gone over to sideboard . Peeps into coffee bag ) Just enough coffee for breakfast . ( Going over to bureau again ) I can study it while I am getting breakfast , and that will save time , do n't you see ? ( Opens top drawer and tosses contents over her shoulder ) p. 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Sharply ) Josephine , I just put that drawer in order . I insist on having that one spot to myself . JOSEPHINE Why , Billie , whatever is yours is mine , is n't it ? ( Opens middle drawer ) BILLIE Why , yes , Josephine , but  --  JOSEPHINE Here is that blonde switch . I 've hunted for it everywhere . That wig is perfectly useless without it . ( Indicating the blonde wig over back of chair at easel . Takes military brush from bureau and commences to brush switch ) BILLIE ( Taking brush away from her . Putting it on table ) Now , Josephine , my dear , you know I do n't allow you to use my brushes . You never take the hairs out . JOSEPHINE ( Laying blonde switch over dark one on bureau-top ) You can take them out for me , ca n't you ? There 's a dear . Oh , here it is . ( Taking two parts out of drawer ) Billie , this part is going to make my reputation . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am the type at last . Now , let 's go over this little place once . Move up the table . ( BILLIE complies ) There 's your part . Now you stand down right , Fitzjames , and  --  that ( Throwing wig and trousers over easel ) will do for Murdock . Blanche , you know , comes shrieking and laughing down from the mountains , and lands in the center of the stage . It 's a grand entrance . ( Goes up and comes down to center , shrieking and laughing . BILLIE claps his hands over his ears ) " They bid me sleep , They bid me pray , They say me brain is warped and wrung.I can not sleepOn Highland brae , I can not pray in Highland tongue . " ( Goes out of her part into conversational tone ) Poor thing ! Just think , Billie , of being torn away from her lover at the very altar and carried away among strangers . No wonder she went mad . If anything should part us now , Billie , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness in our family . p. 11 BILLIE That 's evident . JOSEPHINE Promise me , dear , that you will never accept an engagement without me . BILLIE When I have an engagement to accept , we 'll talk it over . JOSEPHINE No , but promise me , Billie . BILLIE Yes , dear , I 'll promise to do anything if I do n't starve to death before I can accomplish it . JOSEPHINE ( Hysterically , throwing arms around his neck ) You wo n't let me go mad , will you , Billie dear ? BILLIE Not unless I go mad first , but go on . with your part . JOSEPHINE ( Wiping her eyes on her sleeve and going C. ) Oh , yes , I forgot all about my part . ( Turning over the pages ) That 's your cue . BILLIE ( Turning over his pages ) Is it ? I 've scarcely looked the thing over . ( Reading ) " Who is this maid , what means her lay ? " JOSEPHINE Then Murdock says : ( Goes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool ! " and draws his bow , and I shrink back and you come forward . p. 12 BILLIE ( Still reading , but melodramatically ) " Now if thou strik'st her but one blow , I 'll pitch thee from the cliff as far as ever peasant pitched a bar . " ( Romantic pose and gesture ) JOSEPHINE ( Dropping to her knees , seizing and kissing his extended hand ) " Thanks , champion , thanks ! " ( Conversationally ) Then I see the green you wear , and I know you 're of my people . BILLIE Because I 'm green . JOSEPHINE Yes  --  no , Billie , because you wear our colors , and I see that Murdock is of the enemy , who are swarming in ambush all through the country round , and I want to warn you without letting Murdock know . So I make my points to you , while I croon a mad song to Murdock . Is n't that clever ? Blanche is n't as mad as she seems . BILLIE ( Annoyed ) Go on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had an eye , and he could heed  --  " ( To MURDOCH , crooning ) " Ever sing warily , warily . " ( To BILLIE , significantly ) " He had a foot and he could speed . " ( To MURDOCK , crooning ) " Hunters watch so narrowly . " ( Explaining ) Then I move off , beckoning to you . ( Double cross , JOSEPHINE upstage , BILLIE down , leaving BILLIE L. and JOSEPHINE R. ) Murdock creeps up behind you , aims at you and hits me . He flies off in the opposite direction , you after him . ( BILLIE scizes wig and trousers and starts to pummel them ) I come staggering across the stage , with the blood-stained arrow in my hand and fall  --  ( Suits the action to the word , and nearly falls , thinking BILLIE is there to catch her )  --  Billie , you must be here to catch me when I fall . p. 13 BILLIE ( Down L. ) But I 'm off here putting the fear o ' God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . I 've got to die in your arms . ( Makes a picturesque fall into his arms ) Is n't that dramatic ? BILLIE Yes , but what about breakfast ? JOSEPHINE Oh , Billie , why do n't you set that to jazz and sing it for me . Bring down the table . ( He does so and sits down at easel , cleaning brushes . JOSEPHINE , with part in hand , takes plate of rolls from side-board with a flourish that scatters them on the floor ) " But were I now where Allen glides , " ( Puts plate on table ) " And heard me native Devon 's tides , " ( Repeats business with plate of sausages ) " So sweetly , I would rest and pray , That heaven would close me wintry day . " ( Dramatically , with suitable gestures ) " The bows they bend , The knives they whet "  --  I must have props . ( Takes paint-brush out of BILLIE 'S hand , she flourishes it as if whetting a knife ) " The toils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takes bottle of hair-tonic from mantel-piece and sets it down on table , with a flourish ) BILLIE Josephine , what are you doing with my hair-tonic ? Do you think I take it internally ? p. 14 JOSEPHINE Oh , I thought it was the ketchup . What 's it doing up there ? You should be more orderly , Billie . ( Leaves part on table . BILLIE takes bottle back to bureau . JOSEPHINE absently takes bag of coffee and pours it into pan , which she sets down . She then takes up the boiling water and instead of picking up the pan with the coffee , picks up BILLIE 'S hat and pours the hot water into it , meanwhile singing  --  ) " For my sweet William was forester true , He stole poor Blanche 's heart away , His coat  --  " BILLIE ( Turning away from the bureau , sees what she is doing and speaks sharply ) Josephine ! JOSEPHINE ( Jumping ) Do n't startle me like that , Billie ! BILLIE See what you 're doing . JOSEPHINE ( Smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's more in it now than there ever was before . ( Looking in the coffee bag ) That 's the last of the coffee . BILLIE ( Taking the hat and shaking the water out of it ) Damn the coffee ! You 've spoiled my best hat . JOSEPHINE Just run down and get a little more , wo n't you ? There 's a dear . p. 15 BILLIE ( Up L.C. with the wrath of a patient man ) No , I will not . I 've put up with this just as long as I 'm going to . What sort of a home do you call this , anyway ? Look at the disorder and confusion . Not a place to sit down , nor to stand up , nor to put anything . If there had been a vacant spot anywhere else for my hat , it would n't have been ruined . Look at the dishes with the remains of the last meal upon them . Hairs in the butter . ( Picking one out ) JOSEPHINE ( R.C. ) Billie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And look at yourself . Do you think a man likes to see his wife slouching about like that ? JOSEPHINE ( Dropping on settee . Amazed at this unaccustomed avalanche ) Billie ! BILLIE Oh , I know you can look well when you are dressed , you can entertain brilliantly and you 're a genius and I 've often been proud of you ; but a man ca n't live on pride . He ca n't make a breakfast out of fireworks , however dazzling . JOSEPHINE ( Reproachfully ) Why , Billie ! BILLIE Oh , I have n't forgotten what you 've done for me . All your kindness when Mariette deserted me . I 'm not ungrateful , but  --  p. 16 JOSEPHINE Ungrateful ! Why , Billie , I did it because I loved you , I did n't want your gratitude . BILLIE ( Sitting in chair L. of table ) I do n't mean that , Josephine , but I do n't suppose you can understand how such untidiness irritates and maddens a man like me . I have n't been used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BILLIE Yes , and not only that , she seemed to anticipate all my little wants . Hotel life lost its terrors , even on one-night stands . JOSEPHINE ( Going to R. of table ) But she left you , Billie . If she had loved you she never could have done that . BILLIE There was a misunderstanding . That cursed busybody  --  you know it all . JOSEPHINE ( Working around back of BILLIE ) What kind of a love was that , Billie , that she could run away , without even giving you a chance to explain ? ( Caressing him ) Do you suppose that anything like that could shake my faith in you ? Or that if I believed it , I would leave you ? I could n't , Billie , I could n't ! ( Throws her arms around his neck , kneeling from the front , sobs , recovers herself , gets up , wipes her yes ) My , this is a cheerful breakfast , is n't it ? I 'm afraid you 'll have to go out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cent . Jimmie cleaned me out . JOSEPHINE ( Goes over to bureau and picks up ring ) Here , take this ring . I do n't need it for Blanche . It 's good for fifty . Get you a nice breakfast and a new hat . Go out to the ball game this afternoon , meet me at the Claridge for dinner . We 'll go to see Ozette to-night and have the boys up for supper after the show . ( BILLIE has been changing his smock during this speech . ) BILLIE You 'll straighten up a bit , wo n't you dear ? ( Looking at ring ) You were going to use this to pay for your new gown , were n't you ? JOSEPHINE Never mind that . Mrs. Filkins can wait . It 's the emergency ring , anyway , do n't you remember ? We bought it from the sale of your first picture . BILLIE ( Embracing her ) You think I 'm a regular old bear , do n't you ? JOSEPHINE Indeed I do n't . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door ) You wo n't forget to tidy up ? JOSEPHINE No , I wo n't . ( Kissing her hands to him as he goes out ) Good-bye . ( Exit BILLIE R.U. ) He ought to have married a cook . ( Takes broom from beside fire-place and commences to sweep collars and cuffs , shirts , neck-ties , etc. , together with papers and food under the settee , down R. Sings ) p. 18 " For my sweet William was forester true , He stole poor Blanche 's heart away . His coat  --  " ( Picks up BILLIE 'S smock from floor , shakes it , sees bulging pocket and takes from it the photograph and rumpled newspaper picture of OZETTE . Looks from one to the other . Starts to tear photo , changes her mind , puts it in BILLIE 'S drawer in bureau . Looks at herself in mirror , picks up the two switches , the blonde one on top , and brushes them , taking the military brush from the table . Absent-mindedly , she brushes the dark one off onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back , fastens it with hairpins . It looks like a pie stuck on there . She decides to change her dress . Looks over the things on the hat-rack , does n't care for them . Goes over to trunk . Tosses out a few things , finds nothing there . Remembers that her new gown was to be finished today , takes broom-handle and raps on the floor , goes to L.U. and calls out  --  ) Mrs. Filkins ! VOICE ( Outside ) Yes , Madame . JOSEPHINE Is my gown finished ? VOICE ( Outside ) Yes , Madame . JOSEPHINE I 'll be right down . ( Drawing back and peeking out ) There 's someone coming up the stairs . I ca n't be seen like this , I 'll go down the fire-escape . ( Exit quickly down L. Pause ) ( Enter OZETTE , a very Frenchy , soubrette type of person .

JIMMIE Why , oh  --  oh , nobody . Where did you get the rags ? JOSEPHINE Like them ? JIMMIE You look real Duff Gordon . JOSEPHINE No , Maggie Filkins . ( Turns again to mirror ) JIMMIE ( Laughing ) Pipe the pastry ! What 's that pie on the back of your head ?

( Preening herself before the glass ) Ozette , you have done a good morning 's work . You are not only a great chanteuse , you are an actress , as well . JOSEPHINE ( Outside ) Why , Billie , are you sure ? BILLIE ( Outside ) I certainly am . She told me so herself . p. 26 OZETTE I am afraid of zat wooman . ( Starts over toward L.I. , but is arrested by the entrance of the others ) BILLIE ( Entering and leading on JOSEPHINE by the hand ) I tell you it is true , Josephine . ( Goes down R. ) JOSEPHINE ( Entering and going C. ) Mademoiselle , allow me to congratulate you upon your artistic achievement  --  but you threw down your cards too soon . There are other actresses . ( To BILLIE ) I did that pretty well , did n't I , Billie ? OZETTE Zen , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the only one here , who is entitled to that pleasing sentiment . BILLIE Will you go ? JOSEPHINE Do n't be rude to the lady , Billie . Mademoiselle , you have done me a great service , and I thank you . If you need a friend at any time , come to me . ( Holding out her hand to OZETTE . OZETTE tosses her head ) ( Enter JIMMIE L.U. ) JIMMIE Oh , there you are . ( Goes down to OZETTE ) I 've been waiting for you down below . I missed you somehow . Come on , the bunch are getting impatient . p. 27 OZETTE Oh , Shimmie , I have been having such a pleasant visit wiz your familee . Au revoir . JIMMIE That 's great ! So long ! ( Exit with OZETTE ) BILLIE ( Looking after them ) She got my goat . JOSEPHINE I never saw Mariette , but how could you be deceived ? BILLIE ( Sitting on settee ) Well , before she came in , I had noticed the resemblance to Mariette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and calling me Billie , and picking up Mariette 's song right out of my mouth , I was taken off my feet . Any change that I noticed I thought might have happened in two years . Mariette always said her sister was impossible , and they looked so much alike that they were continually being taken for each other . That was why Mariette broke away and came to America . Her sister 's name was  --  ( thinking ) Louise . I suppose she changed it for stage use , or for purposes of disguise . JOSEPHINE You are not sorry to have been saved from her ? BILLIE Good God ! You 're a brick , Josephine ! and some actress ! JOSEPHINE ( Caressing him gently from the back of the settee ) You do love me , do n't you , Billie ? p. 28 BILLIE Sometimes . JOSEPHINE When I am tidy ? BILLIE That 's about it . JOSEPHINE Love , then , is dependent upon tidiness . How awful ! BILLIE Come here , dear . ( She sits beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holds her hand in his disengaged one ) We have never understood each other very well . If we are to go on in the same harness , we must learn teamwork , and that means understanding . I , for my part , never realized until to-day that your love for me was anything but  --  JOSEPHINE Selfishness ? BILLIE That is an unpleasant word . Let us call it a compound of passion and sentiment . I never thought that your love for me was big enough for a great sacrifice . I adore you for that . ( Reverently kissing her hand ) None the less ( Smiling ) because you could hardly have gotten away with it and carried out the bluff . JOSEPHINE What do you mean ? BILLIE Do you think you could have deceived an alienist ? JOSEPHINE I would n't be the first one-to do so . p. 29 BILLIE Do you mean that just to release me from all obligation concerning yourself , you would have gone to a mad house ? JOSEPHINE I hardly got as far as that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , it served its purpose , and it was very picturesque . You are a genius , and I adore you for that , too . JOSEPHINE ( Putting her head against his ) I love you , Billie . BILLIE But , because you are a genius , you can live in the land of the spirit , regardless of all mundane things , even appetite , while I , being just Grub Street , am very dependent upon the nearby things . I love beauty and design and order . There is no harmony or joy in life for me without these things . Ugliness jars upon my nerves like discord in music . It drives me mad . JOSEPHINE Oh , Billie , dear , how you must have suffered ! And how patient you have been ! It is my turn to adore you for that ! ( Suddenly ) Billie , you have a photograph of Mariette . BILLIE Why do you speak of that now ? JOSEPHINE ( Getting it from bureau ) Because I want you to let me have it framed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to now , I have resented your memory of Mariette , but from now on . whatever is sacred to you shall be sacred to me . I know she must have been worthy of the great love you gave her , and I pity the jealousy that drove her to her death . p. 30 BILLIE Would n't you rather have this ? ( Takes out the portrait he placed behind the bureau ) JOSEPHINE Oh , Billie , did you do that ? It 's wonderful . You 're the genius of the family , Billie , not I. Come , sit down and finish it at once . There is time to get it into the Academy . They surely will accept it . You must call it " First Love . " ( BILLIE sits down at easel and picks up palette ) I 'll clean up . BILLIE Let me help you . JOSEPHINE No , I wo n't hear of it . BILLIE You must take off your new frock , dear . JOSEPHINE Yes , Billie , I will . ( Starts to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notices her part , picks it up , studying it , as she mechanically picks up a pile of dishes from the table . BILLIE , meanwhile , is contentedly painting and singing or whistling softly to himself , MARIETTE 'S little French song. )
