txt Highway robbery as practiced on Fifth Avenue might make a good theme for a prisoner who calls himself Max Wiess , and who is now locked up in the West Fortyseventh Street Police Station . In ' broad daylight he held up two men at the point of a pistol yeSterday afternoon on the corner just opposite Sherry 's and almost in front of Delmonico 's . Although the avenue was crowded with its usual procession of Sunday pedestrians , he nearly succeeded in his bold attempt , and his capture was not effected until a hardy bicycle policeman had grappled with him and braved the threatening pistol bar-rel at the risk of his life . After the ' hold-up , the intended victims of which were two Bohemian workmen named Jacob Jaschernoritz and Robert Borchi , an immense crowd chased the highwayman down the avenue to Fortysecond Street . The fugitive was about to make good his escape , when Policeman Casey joined in the pursuit on his wheel .

When locked up in the West Forty-seventh Street Station the prisoner , after giving the name mentioned , said that he lived at 518 Sixth ' Street , and that he was thirty years old . Re was neatly dressed , and the gentle look of his eyes would never have betrayed his murderous propensities had he kept his eapon in his pocket . The amount he h d taken from the two foreigners was The way e exciting affair came about was as follows : The two Bohemian workmen had just come here from Maspeth , L. I. After wandering around-the city for a while they stitrted from somewhere - up town toward the Grand Central Station , intending to take a train for the western part of Pennsylvania , to seek work in the mines .

This individual , whose pleasing manners , according to the Bohemians , were irresistible , greeted them most cordially in the car and said that he had known them before . They did not remember him , but he was too polite to be informed of that . He talked German fluently . In fact , before they had ridden far , the fpreigners began to think they had really known him for a long time : The trip passed pleasantly . The stranger offered to render them assistance in getting work in a mine , : " the best mine in Pennsylvania , " for he was-part owner of that mine . They were to have no trouble . He knew " all the ropes . " All they had to do was to take a message from him to the Superintendent of the mine . They were delighted at the prospect . His kindness of heart was overPowering . When he proposed ' to alight from , the car at Forty-fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station ; " ' they acquiesced readily enough . The trio walked to Fifth Avenue . where they stood under the shadow of Delmonico 's and chatted as the crowds marched past- in hundreds . The delights of mining furnished them with a topic for talk . " But have you got money enough for your tickets ? - asked the stranger as though a casual thought had struck him . He addressed Jaschernoritz , who replied : " Yes . ye haf . " To prove the truth of his answer he drew from his inside coat pocket a roll of bills . He counted $48. and was about to replace the money . There was a break in the passing crowd . " One minute there , Bill ! " exclaimed the stranger , a menace in his voice that accorded little with the genial tone he had hitherto adopted . Jaschernoritz faced about quickly and found his eye on a level with a revolver barrel . The " mine owner 's " finger was on the trigger , and a steady hand clenched the butt . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the highwayman stood in such a position , that his actions were not noticeable to the passers-by . The two workmen saw what a fix they were in. and Jaschernoritz tried to shove the roll of bills down in his pocket . " None of that , now , " growled the man with the pistol , grasping the roll and wresting it away from its owner . " If you commence to howl , I 'll blow your head off . " This pleasant reminder made dumb the tongues of the Bohemians . They recovered their composure about ten seconds later , when the bank roll , the pistol , and the stranger were as many yards away , mak ? ing good speed toward the south . " Stop tief ! " they ' yelled , beginning to sprint after the fleeing man . A crowd joined in the chase , increasing in numbers every ten paces .

FIERCE FIGHT FOR THE PISTOL . But the man with the pistol was not to be taken in a hurry . As the officer 's grip closed on his shoulder , he drew his weapon and took aim . Before he could pull the trigger . the crowd , which had arrived by this time , heard his head resound ' with a blow from Casey 's billy . Enraged by the blow , his face twisted with fear and pain , the fugitive fought more desperately than ever . He seemed to wedge his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one in the crowd thought the bullets would begin to fly at any instant . The onlookers shouted things like " Drag the thief off !

For fully ten minutes the struggling pair of men , with banks of excited non-participants on each side and in front and behind , fought - fiercely . They rolled from one side of the street to- the other , the advantage of the , fight seeming to rest with , each al:erriately . At last Casey managed to get his man in the gutter , flat on his badlc , . and planting his knee with force in the prisoner 's abdomen , wrested the revolver from him with one hand , while he choked him with the : other. - The crowd renewed its shouts with new energy and dared to go much closer to the highwayman than when'he had the re-Volyer finder control .
