txt Not content with having established three world 's re &; ords yesterday , Orville Wright to-day set a new figure for aeroplane flights . Iii the teeth of a brisk breeze he remained in the air for 1 hour 5 minutes and 52 seconds , exceeding his record of yeenere day by 3 minutes and 37 seconds . He intends to go after still another record to-morrow , If conditions are favorable , for he purposes taking up a passenger and remaining up for an hour or more . This will meet the requirements of the War Department and will . give him cOnfldence when he undertakes the official tests . There was not the slightest doubt that Wright could have remained up much longer than he did to-day . He alighted simply because . , he was a trifle tired . Everything was working smoothly when he dived to earth . " I was satisfied with having beaten my own record of Wednesday , " said he quietly after he had alighted . " It gets a bit monotonous up there , and I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shortly after Mr. Wright ascended a twelve-mile breeze blew up , and there were moments during his fifty-eight times around the field when it could be noticed that his control of the machine was not quite as sure as it had been the day before . The aeroplane left the starting track at 5:07 M. There were upward of 800 persons present , including a large number of automobile parties from this city . The only army officers present were the members of the Aeronautic Beard which has charge of the test . As he climbed into the machine Mr. Wright was asked if he intended to make any attempt ' to break his newly established world 's record . " It is difficult for me to tell , " said he . " It looks as If I might have a breeze to contend with . In-view of this tact I Can not say anything definite . " Longer Circles Described . The machine left the track with great ease , and the aviator ascended immediately to a height of at least sixty feet . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than those which he described on Wednesday , and it looked on several occasions as though he was going to leave the imaginary aerial race course , arid soar down straight ahead , in the direction of the river for a mile or two . All the newspaper men had decided among themselves that this was what he was going to do , but he made no such attempt . " You do n't catch me taking any such risks at this stage of the game , " said he , after he had alighted . " I am not going to fly beyond the confines ' of these drill grounds , until I decide to make the five-mile official flight to Alexandria and back . " Mr. Wright had not been aloft very long before the aeronautical experts present began to comment on the way the machine was behaving . In making some of the turns at the upper end of the field near the starting point it was noticed that the aviator was having a little difficulty in keeping the aeroplanes equilibrium perfect . The machine would tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curve and would right itself In an instant or two and sail down the field with . its customary grace . At the end of the field Mr. Wright would send it flying to a height of 100 feet or more , and describe an exceptionally wide circle in making the turn there . He seemed to experience the most trouble at the ends of the field . He explained afterward that the wind seemed to catch him at both of these points , and that it was a little difficult to make the curves with ' the ease which has characterized his flights in comparatively still air . Sharp Turns to Avoid Gnats . In an attempt to avoid the gusts which were blowing at the upper end of the field he frequently made shorter circles , turning at a point 100 yards or more from the starting track . Several times he accomplished short turns which set the spectators ' nerves on edge , so sharply did the machine whirl about .

Mr. ' 9/right 's principal assistant . C. S. Taylor , mounted a ' shed near the starting point with a pot of white paint and marked off the time on the tar roof . Each time five minutes elapsed he would change the marking . The figures were large enough for the aviator to see from his airy perch , and as 60 and 55 appeared on the black roof the spectators ' excitement became acute , When the hour was passed Taylor stood up and waved his hands . Mr. Wright gave . no answering signal , but he said afterward that he noticed the movement . All of the motorists tooted their horns , and each time the Aeroplane circled around after that the spectators cheered wildly .

Among them was one from his brother , Wilbur Wright , who is conducting exPeriments at Le Mans , France . It'was in code , and Wright said It contained matter of ' a personal nature which he could Obt divulge , in addition to congratulations . Speed Expected .

Peilments . If he does make forty-two Miles an hour , he will be entitled to a bonus of 20 per cent . over the contract price , which would net him $30.000 , the Contract price being $25,000 . The speed Is to be taken on a measured course of i knore than five miles , against and with the wind . The start is to he a flying one , the machine to pass the starting point at Cull speed at both ends of the course . The official trials will be held as soon tet . Mr. Wright announces his readiness . lie will probably make preliminary flights for a week or more before he tests the aeroplane before the army board . One of the most enthusiastic spectators of to-day 's exploit was Secretary Metcalf of the navy . Assistant Secretary Newberry has been following the Fort Myer tests closely . Lieut . George C. Sweet of the Bureau of Equipment bas been detailed to observe the tests for the navy . Secretary Metcalf was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beginning in the application of aerotauties to that branch of the service , - " I can not say what we might do . " he replied . " Of course . we would need funds for that purpose . There is only one reaFop that I can see why Mr. Wright 's rnp.chine would be impracticable for use in : the navy . and that is his starting apparatus . An officer has been detailed to observe the flights , and what we do will depends largely on what is learned from these tests . " The Navy 's Interest . Lieut . Sweet has been present at nearly every flight of the Wright aeroplane at Fort Myer , and was so much impressed by its performances that he suggeted that the Navy Department keep In k:close touch with the progress being wade in aerial flight . " The aeroplane would prove invaluable in naval warfare , " he remarked to the army officer during Wright 's flight yesterday .

After the machine made a flight it could be brought alongside of the ship and be pulled out Of the water by means of the davits . " The Bureau of Equipment has an appropriation available for buying equipment for vessels of the navy . and this money could be drawn on for the purpose of buying an aeroplane with which to Make a start toward building up an aerial fleet for the navy .
