txt No Amendment to Charter Possible Without Unanimous Vote of Stock ? Hyde Trustee Offer Stands . Declaring that the cnarter of the Equitable Life Assurance Society could not be amended by the Directors or the stockholders unless by the consent of every share , or even by the Legislature itself , Justice Maddox , in the Supreme Court in I Brooklyn yesterday , granted the preliminary injunction sought by Franklin B. Lord restraining the- Directors and officers of the Equitable from filing and putting into effect the plan of partial mutualization adopted by the board two months ago . The opinion sustains practically every point argued by Edward M. Shepard , as counsel for Mr. Lord , and by Samuel Untermyer , as counsel for James H. Hyde and ' William . H. , the principal intervenors . Just what the effect of the decision , if sustained by the higher court and followed by a permanent injunction , will be upon the plans of the Hyde and Alexander factions in the Equitable none of the attorneys in the case and none of the principals would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawyers somewhat by surprise was indicated by the statement of one of Mr. Alexander 's legal advisers , who said , when asked what he thought of it : " It is the most radical decision that could possibly have been made . It becomes even more appardnt what the control of $400,000,000 of assets by $100,000 of stock amounts to . If the society ever wants to continue in business some way must be found to get the stock out of the way . Of course we shall appeal , and the case may possibly be argued on the appeal at the June term . " Samuel Untermyer , chief counsel for James H. Hyde , said that the decision went even further than his own contentions in argument before Judge Maddox , and that it was in line with the principle that the courts were bound to uphold , that property rights such as those of stock to control a property can not be taken away at random . Further than this Mr. Untermyer did not care to discuss the opinion . It was learned , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts with regard to the plan of mutualization for the Equitable , James H. Hyde and his advisers intend to abide by the spirit of the offer contained in the amended petition of intervention in the Lord case . In that petition Mr. Hyde contended that the consent of three-fifths of the stock was necessary to mutualization in any event , and he offered , if the proposed amended charter were found to be legal , to vote the holdings which he controls in favor of it at a special meeting to be called . ' In case the injunction were granted Mr. Hyde proposed , " subject to the determination of details and conditions . " to place his stock in the hands of trustees for a period of years . to be voted by them for twenty-eight Directors nominated by the policy holders and twentyfour of his own nomination . This was the division of the board contemplated in the proposed amended charter . The " determination of details and conditions , " of course , leaves the question of a final settlement of the Equitable controversy just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had none such been made . But Mr. Hyde 's advisers are determined , regardless of the personal developments incident to the settlement , that the policyholders of the Equitable shall obtain in the end at least the voice I in the affairs of the society that would have been theirs had the mutualizatln plan gone through . It can be asserted positively that the votes of the policy holders will not be thrown into the control of the agency force . A PROXY COMMITTEE . The plan that has been most favorably considered is that of forming , under the trusteeship offer , a proxy committee of men of National reputation and asking that these men , qualified as Directors of the society if necessary , serve as Directors , Grover Cleveland being mentioned yesterday as the type of man likely to be approached . There is another important bearing of the decision . This is upon the plan urged by many of the Directors who constitute what is known as the peace element in the board , that the affairs of the society be placed in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of a savings bank . This plan would be rendered impossible of accomplishment if the injunction were made permanent . for it would involve directly the surrender by the stock of its power of controlling the society . The decision of Justice Maddox is voluminous . It recites first the legal conditions attending the organization of the Equitable , noting that under the act of 1853 applying to insurance companies it was necessary that the society should be placed on a stock basis , should be subject to the provisions of the Revised Statutes except in regard to annual statements and other matters specifically provided for , and that its charter should " continue until repealed . " It is upon this last provision and a provision of the Revised Statutes In effect when the Equitable was founded as modified by subsequent enactments , that Justice Maddox rests his decision on the matter of amendment . The Revised Statutes then provided that at every election of Directors of a , moneyed corporation no person except a stock1 holder should vote for Directors . The decision continues : " The charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stockholders an executed contract ; it is a continuing grant of corporate power , and all applicable provisions of a general law under which a corporation has ' been formed , not expressly set forth in its certificate or articles of incorporation , are to be read into and taken to be a part of its charter . There is in the act of 1853 no express reservation of power to alter ' or amend ' the charter of any company ' formed ' thereunder , and there is no provision in the charter of the defendant company for an alteration C911:01111e4f , oW IENJOINS EQUITABLE , FROM MUTUALIZATION // or ? amendment thereof , save that , by appropriate action : - of the Board of Directors , the number of . the Directors may befditainished antrcettaig life policy holdersernay .. be accorelede'theeright to vote In person for Directors ; but the by-laws , rules , and regulations ' of the company may be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors . Justice Maddox then discusses at length the reserve power of the Legislature under the Constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special stat , utes " passed pursuant to the general corporation laws , holding that the amenda , tory power is clearly restricted to the laws or statutes and d : es not extend to the charters of corporations created under the general laws . The famous case of the People vs . O'Brien , growing out of the repeal of the charter of the Broadway surface railway , is cited and the language Of that decision quoted that " the repeal of a law authorizing corporations would not destroy organizations formed under it , nor would the annulment-of a charter affect the law under which it was created . " Section of Charter Void . Taking up the question . of the property I rights of the stockholders in the control of the corporation , Justice* Maddox reviews the development of the statutes bearing upon the provision of the act of 1E353 restricting to stockholders the power of voting for Directors , and remarks that inasmuch as the section of the existing charter of the society giving the Directors power to bestow the right to vote in person upon policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the act under which the society was founded , even that is null and void . He I then continues : " The question now to be considered is whether the proposed amended charter is violative of the protection given by the Federal and State Constitutions , it being claimed by the stockholders now before the court that the contemplated change will deprive them of property and of property rights . " The stockholders of the defendant company are members of the corporation , are the equitable owners of the corporate property , and the right of a stockholder to vote upon his holdings of stock is a property right , one of the essential rights of ownership ' ; hence the right of a stockholder to participate in the selection of those who are to be vested with the exercise of the corporate powers , the Board of Directors , is an attribute to his shares of stock , which has been ' defined as a right which its owner has in the management , profits , and ultimate assets of the corporation . ' Stock Vote Is Property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation , unless the charter otherwise provides , the share of stock is the voting unit , and , in the absence of ' some controlling statutory , charter , or by-law restriction , the right of the stockholder ' to vote his shares at corporate elections is I an incident of the ownership of the shares ; it inheres in the legal holder of them under the principles of the common I law , and is in the nature of property . ' " The persons who originally subscribed and paid for shares of the defendant company 's capital stock did so , it is to be presumed , upon the faith of the declaration of incorporation , the provisions of the law under which the company was formed , and also the provisions of the revised statutes applicable thereto , which assured to the stockholder by reason of his right to vote for all the Directors that measure of participation in the control and management of the corporation , its property and affairs . Those to-day holding such shares of stock have the same right to rely upon such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been within constitutional limitations amended or repealed . " By such declaration of incorporation and such provisions of law each stockholder has the right to vote for all the Directors , each of whom shall be the owner of at least five shares of such capital stock . The Board of Directors is to elect annually ' from among their number a President , ' and this insures the selection of a stockholder as President . I It is now proposed that the stockholders shall have the right to vote for and to elect but six-thirteenths in number of the Directors hereafter to be elected , and if the board shall consist of fifty-two persons , then the stockholders may , by a plurality of their votes , in person or by proxy , elect twenty-four only , and in that ratio if the number be diminished , but such ' proportions shall not be changed without the consent of three-fifths of the stock of the company . ' Thus the stockholder has lost the right to vote for all , and as well a majority of the Directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the essential rights of ownership , viz. : That of voting on his stock ' for all Directors to be elected . Directors Are Agents . ' 9th regard to the limitations of . the duties and powers of Directors , Judge Maddox says : " Directors of a corporation are not vested with the ' title to the property of the corporation . * * e They are agents of the corporation upon whom the duties devolve of management and care , ' the exercise of corporate powers for the benefit of the equitable owners of the corporate property , the stockholders . The Directors are the trustees and the stockholders are the cestuis que trust . " On the argument it was asserted by both sides that there were upward of six hundred thousand policy holders , scattered , all over the world . That being so , the right to vote by proxy relieves those not living conveniently near to the place of annual meetings from the necessity of travel . But assume , for the sake of argument , that a majority of the policy holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the question of legality , vote by proxy and such prox , ies are controlled by persons whose inter , ests and desires may be inimical to the rights and interests of the stockholders. and the opportunity for the absolute loss of control by the stockholders is pre , sented . Would Rights Be Destroyed ? " Consider the possibility ; there would be the policy holders ' majority , twentyeight to twenty-four , as the board is pro posed to be constituted , with the selection by that majority of a. policy holder for President and the filling of the offices of the company with policy holders or persons not stockholders , and then calmly answer the question , Have the property rights of the stockholders been invaded or destroyed ? " It is not ' to be argued that such a situation is probable , but It is possible . and then the right of dominion over the management , profits , and ultimate assets of the company would be lost to those who can only look for that which their shares of stock- represent , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every nature , contingent included , have been fully paid and discharged . " It is unnecessary on this motion to express any opinion as to the rights of either the policy holders or stockholders to the surplus or any part thereof . Indeed , the policy holders are not before the court , none having intervened , and this question should await the trial of the action , when , if found necessary , the court may direct that they be brought in . Suffice here to say , the plaintiff and the intervening defendant stockholders claim to be entitled to some part and share In the surplus . Whatever right , if any , the stockholder may have to the surplus grows out of his being the owner of shares of the capital stock of the company and must await final distribution , while here . the policy holder 's right is dependent upon his policy and its continuance and must be .. determined by . the terms of that instrument . " The internal differences between some of the gentlemen most prominently concerned with the management of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , and comment upon the allegations touching such disagreements is unnecessary . The court has nothing to do with the reasons or purposes actuating either those who have sought to ' bring about the contemplated change of charter or of those who now seek to restrain its effectuation . The intentions of , , all are presumed to be , for the good of those interested , and it is for - this court only to consider and fearlessly to determine the questions presented .
