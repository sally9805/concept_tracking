txt Directors of the Third Avenue Railroad Company will to-day , unless plans made Yesterday are reconsidered , meet and discuss the multitude of reports and rumors that are current in explanation of the plight of the road . The object of the meeting , is to consider the wisdom of taking up the most important of the rumors and issuing a public statement in regard to each . The idea that the attacks on the road should be met squarely and disposed of has been growing for several days , and the plan to refute them was decided on yesterday because several Directors of the road discovered that official silence under attack had been in many quarters construed into admission that the charges could not be disputed . It was understood yesterday that the principal subjects the statement will cover will be Henry Hart 's stock holdings and their disposition , the accumulation of the floating debt , obstacles to the proper financing of the new equipment operations . and the policy that governed the management of the system and its contracts . Several stories about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directors yesterday . The official up to the time that the affairs of the ccmpany became subject of scandal had been polite and even-tempered . He was yesterday haggard , and almost tearful . He spoke strongly in denying a story that William H. Moloney the Clerk to the Board of Aldermen , identified with the Jacob Sharp bribery to secure the Broadway Railroad franchise , had looted the treasury of the Thind Avenue Company by appropriating $500,000 destined to secure the King 's Bridge franchise . Coupled with the denial was one that disposed of a statement that the franchise in question cost the company $1,500,000 in all . The Director , also without comment , disposed of an allegation that the company rendered desperate by the large bills of Naughton &; Co. , offered 81,000,000 for the surrender of their contract . Also denied was a story that the Directors of the road knew that the percentages of Naughton &; Co. were excessive . A DIRECTOR 'S STATEMENT . " This , " said the Director , " can be disposed of in a few words I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advantage to the company , as it put the work on a par with day 's work . The work for the Metropolitan system was done in a like way . I am not at present prepared to say why the cost per mile for changing motive power was so much greater for Third Avenue than for the Metropolitan . Talk of the road 's bankruptcy is on a par with the other stories about it . I have full faith in its future under the receivership . " Plans for financing the cash requirements of Receiver Grant were the subject of discussion , and it was asserted that Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. had expressed a willingness to undertake such a financial plan . A member of the firm in declining to talk on the subject said that it was not its custom to express willingness in such transactions . Another statement that Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. will eventually act as managers of the reorganization syndicate and that the firm is forming a syndicate to purchase receiver 's certificates , as a court may order their issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000.000. of which $3,000,000 will be at first negotiated , was pronounced as substantially correct by authority for the firm of financiers .. The total amount of the issue as stated was , however , disputed as being uncertain . A member of the Third Avenue creditors ' committee , of which F. P. Olcott is Chairman , said that it is perfecting arrangements to finance the immediate cash necessities of the receives . " The bankers of the committee . " he added , " will be Kuhn . Loeb &; Co . The amount of the issue of certificates , stated at $10,000,000 in a Wall Street bulletin . I regard as . excessive . The certificates will be isued in such form as may be authorized by the court . The money derived therefrom will be devoted to the completion . as far as may be possible , of the Third Avenue system , which as a whole will be brought into o condition of full earning capacity . As soon as it becomes reasonably clear what the concrete possibilities of the property are , a plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . " WANTS MR . CRIMMINS NAMED . A stockholder of the Third Avenue Railroad Company has sent the following communication to Chairman Olcott of the Creditors ' Committee : " I notice the statement that the ' management ' of the Third Avenue Railroad Company , through counsel , joined in the application for the appointment of a receiver for the property . " Permit me to suggest whether it is not now time that the creditors and stockholders proceed to direct the affairs of that defunct corporation without the assistance , before the court or otherwise . of the reamagement. ' which has wrecked the company and brought the whole status of its affairs into public disfavor . " To restore the property to a prosperous condition and fun earning capacity must needs require able direction , expert knowledge of the intricate conditions of local transportation , a high order of executive ability , and if the best permanent results are to be attained it would seem that the man at the head of affairs should be one in whom both the stockholders and the public at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday , it is my conviction that Mr. John D. Crimmins is generally recognized as combining these qualifications to a larger extent than any one who could be selected for the important work the permanent receiver of that property will have in hand . " Should the old management continue to have a voice in shaping any action hereafter taken or be accredited with so doing , . it must be a long time before public confidence can be restored in the present prospective outcome of the company 's affairs . " Rumors that other financial firms were interested with Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. in the plan to provide funds for the receiver were not substantiated . At Vermilye &; Co. ' s this statement was made : " So far as the Third Avenue Railroad Company is concerned , we are through with it . " SUIT UNDER A BIG LIEN , The first suit against the Third Avenue Road growing out of the numerous mechanics ' liens filed prior to the appointment t of the receiver was commenced yesterday . J. H. Warner , attorney for the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on the first lien filed against the company . It was entered on Feb. 23 and was for $144,3811 , for material furnishedThe Forty-second Street , Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue , and the King 's Bridge Railroad Companies are joined as defendants in the action . A mechanic 's lien for $48,732 was filed yesterday by the Pennsylvania Iron Works against the Third Avenue and the Fortysecond Street . Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue lines . Two judgments were also entered , one by N. Quinn . for $3.290.70 , and the other for $250 by E. Overbangh . Another lien was filed yesterday at White Plains by the American Steel and Wire Company of New Jersey upon the real property of the Union Railway Company and the Third Avenue Railroad Company . The materials furnished consisted of trolley wire to the amount of $22,881.81 , which was the price agreed upon for it , . and all of which remains unpaid . The goods were delivered between Dec. 12 1890 , and Feb. 2 , 1900 . MR. ON LIENS . Daniel F. of Naughton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total amount of liens as published in the newspapers were misleading . " These liens aggregate about 86,000.000 , " Mr. said , " but I doubt if the amounts actually involved run above a half of that sum . For instance , we have filed liens aggregating $3,000,000 . Of this , about $950,000 is actually due , while the remainder is for projected work , on which no progress has been made . Included in our liens are the amounts of several others , which are also on file . These are for supplies . " I recall one in which a cement manufacturer whose claim is $65,000 filed two liens for this amount  --  one against the Third Avenue Company and one against the Union Railway Company  --  because he was in doubt as to where the material was used . We had included this in our liens , so that claims for $195,000 are on file for one item on which only a third of that sum is due . Isaac A.

Section 4 of Chapter 3 of the act tells who may become bankrupts . Paragraph A of that section says : Any person who owes debts , except a corporation , Shall be entitled to the benefits of this act as a voluntary bankrupt . " Paragraph B of the same section says : " Any natural person , except a wage-earner or a person engaged chiefly in farming or the - tillage of the soil , any unincetrporated company , and any corporation engaged principally in the manufacturing , trading , printing , publishing , or mercantile pursuits , owing debts to the amount of $100 or over , may be adjudged an involuntary bankrupt upon default or on an impartial trial . and shall be subject to and entitled to the benefits of this act . " STOCK GOES STILL LOWER . Third Avenue stock established a new low record for itself on the Stock Exchange yesterday in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue approximated 4,9,000 shares . The stock , which cipsed on Thursday at 50 to 501/. opened yesterday at 47 . The high record of the day was 49 and the lowest quotation 45% . The closing price was 471/2 . It was claimed that the low record came of liquidation due to reports of the road 's bankruptcy and of heavy assessments to be levied to permit of the completing of the work begun on the system . It was learned yesterday that all privileged transactions between David Lamar and those who dealt with him have been satisfactorily settled . Mr. Lamar during the day announced in a bulletin that he had no " puts " on Third Avenue stock outstanding . Another statement from holders of such " puts " said that they had been taken care of . MR . CRIMMINS 'S CHkRGES . Correspondence Relating to the Contract with Naughton &; Co. - 12r. 's Denials . Rumors that the difficulties into which the Third Avenue Railroad Company has fallen were due in a large measure to extravaganceiin construction by the contractors , Naughton &; Co. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . These reports - were based largely on a published interview in which John D. Crimmins , who at one time was a contractor for the construction of a part of the system , and who built the Broadway , Columbus Avenue , and Lexington Avenue lines of the Metropolitan system , pronounced the contract with Naughton &; Co. to be " ruinous , " and declared that the contractors prosecuted their work in a manner that was inimical to the best interests of the stockholders of the road . Mr. Crimmins in this interview alluded to a letter which he had written in July last to President Elias of the company in substantiation of this charge . MR . CRIMMINS 'S CHARGES . Mr. Crimmins later in the day gave out a copy of this letter and the correspondence which followed it . The letter was dated July 25 , 1899 . In it Mr. Crimmins said : , ? refrained from sending my proxy or voting as a stockholder or the Forty-second Street , Manhattanville , and St. Nicholas Avenue Railroad Company for the increase of the ? capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the expenditures now being made under  - -  ou as President . for the change of motive power . are wasteful . My attention has been called to this many times , but I did not wish to speak until I had personal knowledge , gained by observation " On the 17th inst . I drove from the upper end of the Boulevard , where the work is progressing , for some blocks below , and I can safely say that not more than one in ten men was employed , and even these were engaged in hammering without effect . " There will be a day of reckoning of the cost of carrying forward this work . It is not difficult , and I can see no obstructions to be met with save here and there some rock . The cost per mile should not be greater than that expended for the construction of the Eighth Avenue line of the Metropolitan Street Railroad system above Fifty-ninth Street . " As a stockholder of the ccrnpany . I certainly must protest against the cost and manner of carrying on this work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if the cost of this work proves to be exorbitant , then an explanation must be forthcoming . I doubt very much if there has ever been a public work or a work for a corporation where there was so much loitering as there is on this work . " PRESIDENT ELIAS 'S REPLY . In reply , Mr. Elias , under date of July 28 , wrote to Mr. Crimmins , saying that the work of changing the motive power of the road was very closely scrutinized by the company , and that daily the management of the road furnished the contractors with lists of men and foremen " whose immediate discharge we request for not performing the work required of them . " In reference to the cost of the work , Mr. Elias wrote : " I shall hope that the cost , everything being equal . will not , be as great as on the section , " ( on the Eighth Avenue line . ) Again , two days later , Mr. Crimmins wrote to Mr. Elias another letter , in which he reiterated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded : " I do not know it to be a fact , but it has been stated to me that the work is conducted more in the interest of a political party than that of the stockholders . " Mr. Crimmins yesterday declined to elaborate on the intimation conveyed in this last note , saying that he had no desire to enter into a controversy over what was only a rumor . Thstatement that he was interested in the cMtract for changing the motive power , Mr. Crimmins said , was unfounded , as he had retired from the firm of J. D. &; T. E. Crimmins on Jan. 1 , 1897 , over a year before the contract was let . He continued : " The negotiations with the Third Avenue Co. were entirely with T. E. Crimmins , and I had no intimate acquaintance with the terms . My knowledge extended only so far as to know that the contract had been entered into and afterward discontinued . " In 1897. at the request of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company , I directed the work for the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eighth Avenue line , and the Twenty-third Street line . as well as finishing the Second Avenue line and the One Hundred and Sixteenth and Manhattan Avenue line . TERMS IN OTHER CONTRACTS . " There were several contracts made in these works . One with Naughton &; Co. , one with T. E. Crimmins &'Co.,; and one with the National Contracting , Company . The prices paid were 7IA per cent . on the labor and mechanics ' pay roll . The contractor , out of the percentage , supplied all tools , which was a large item . I supplied the iron , cement , brick , and conduits , and no percent age was paid the contractor for these . tems , whose amount in the aggregate . was very large . The more expensive special work was performed directly by men under my direction . " My understanding was that I should direct the work for one year and no more , and I felt that I had labored years enough in directing large works , where there was so much detail and responsibility . All concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as receiver , will in this position prove himself , aahe has always , equal to the trust he has assumed . " Under the contract with Naughton &; Co. , the railroad company bound itself to pay the contracting firm 15 per cent . on labor and 10 per cent . on all materials used in construction . This arrangement was tantamount , it was said , to the employment of Naughton &; Co. as supervising architects on a percentage basis . This , Mr. Crimmins explained , was the usual way In which contracts for this sort of construction are let , though , as he said , he had not in pr , - vlous works , been paid a percentage on materials furnished . The firm of . Naughton &; Co. is composed of Bernard Naughton , who was at one time in the employ of Mr. Crimmins. and Daniel F. the Chairman of the Executive Committee of Tammany Hall . One of the rumors current yesterday was to the effect that the contract was obtained by the firm because of Mr. 's connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night denounced the current rumors as unworthy of reply , : Ctid declared that in all of its dealings with the railroad company , his firm had been under the closest surveillance by the officials of the company . As to Mr. Crimmins 's charges of loitering and political influence , he said that they were Unfounded . " It is n't a pleasant task for me to make public the relations existing between us and the Third Avenue Company , " Mr. said , " for , so far as 1 know , there has never been any protest about the way we did our work . On the contrary , we have letters in abundance showing that our efforts were appreciated by the officers of the company , and we can point to articles in the engineering press which prove that , far from unnecessar11y delaying work , we broke records in completing jobs of stupendous proportions . Why , it took the Metropolitan two vargs to build the tenmiles of track on the Broadway line , while we finished fifty-four miles of the Third Avenue Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In view of statements which have appeared in the 1 : ress , however . I feel that I owe it to myself to explain some of these matters . In the first place , let me say that we did not prepare the contract . That was done by the Third Avenue people , and T. E. Crimmins was anxious to get it . He never had any contract , as John D. Crimmins says , and I can refer you to the cross-examination of Mr. Crimmins by Mr. Hoffman during the Mazet investigation to bear me out in the statement . At that time Mr. Crimmins said that there never was any contract signed between his brother and the Third Avenue Company . " As to the terms of the contract , there was no gold mine in it . Out of our percentages we had to pay our engineers and Inspectors and care for liabilities arising from accidents . When I say that during the construction there were on an average ten men injured a day . you will perceive that this liability was by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this added to our burden and detracted from our profits .. " While the work was in progress it was inspected daily by the engineers of the company and a corps of twenty Inspectors , and if there was loitering- it must have been done with the knowledge of these men , who we found were most persistent in doing their duty . Men who were detected by our Inspectors in loitering were discharged , and if at times there appeared to be a larger number of men employed than seemed necessary It was because the company was crowding us to get the work done in as short a time as possible , and not to give employment to men in the interest of Tammany Hall . MR . CROKER NOT INTERESTED . " Somehow , a report has gone around that Richard Croker was interested in our firm . That is without foundation . Neither Mr. Croker nor any member of his family has ever been connected with the firm , nor was the contract obtained by us with Mr. Croker 's assistance . " Among the other rumors prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a square yard for asphalt paving between the rails on its tracks . The authority for this statement was a man who has intimate personal relations with the Directors of the road . This item alone would amount to several hundred thousand dollars . Mr. said that the work had been done by State Senator Featherson , who has done that class of work for Naughton &; Co , in all their contracts . The price paid was not near a half of that mentioned , Mr. declared , though he could not give the exact figures . Asphalt paving costs the city about $3 a square yard . " All L can say , in conclusion , " said Mr. , " is that we will be glad to have the most rigid examination of our books made by the receiver . Every payroll has ' been verified by the company 's official , and every payment to us has been checked not I only by the company 's auditors , but by its Treasure . An investigation will show ' that in all our dealings we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any misfortune that may have come to the road can not be placed at our door . "
