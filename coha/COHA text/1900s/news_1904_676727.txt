txt If the Democratic campaign can be maintained and conducted on the high plane to Which it was raised by Judge PARKER . ' S gold standard telegram , a Democratic President will sit in the White House during the next four years . We have no doubt of it , and our confidence is based upon the known qualities and well established habits of the American people . They admire courage . They applaud manly actions . Their confidence is won by the exhibition of candor and high-mindedness in the candidates for whom they are asked to vote , for they know that the public interests may safely be intrusted to the hands of upright men . Judge PARKER for his part has made an extraordinary beginning and helped . his party by a great campaign stroke . Probably no candidate for the Presidency has ever been able by an act so simple , natural , and unstudied to advance the party cause from the " fighting-chance " stage to the stage of confident expectancy . The Democratic candidate has won the people 's trust already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the intelligence of the American people . That is the sure road to victory . It would be sheer stupidity this year to resort to the stale and discredited methods of the " practical " politicians . To such tactics the Republicans will resort . They have invariably met Democratic " still-hunts " with " blocks-of-five " methods , and they have been almost always successful . They have had twice the experience of the Democrats , they have much more than twice the means . They would be delighted to have the Democrats challenge them to a game of cunning . That is a very good reason for meeting them in quite another way . To a broad-minded appeal made on the large issues , and made in a way to arouse the voters who read and think , the Republicans would have no effective reply . The campaign of 1884 was won for the Democrats on an issue of public morality . The campaign of 1892 was won by the commanding strength of their candidate on the issue of the tariff at a time when the Republicans had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again abused it in the Dingley act . In this campaign we have as an issue abuses of Executive power as well as of the legislative function ; we have the fighting spirit and the liking for restless contention which have so often been exhibited at the Capital during the last three years ; we have the reckless misuse of the grave race problem for partisan gain ; we have the issue of the trusts , as to which the policy of the party in power has been of a nature to excite the wonder and the suspicion of the people . Leave to the Republican Party the monopoly of campaign methods that have been typified in the Administration attempts to placate and make useful such political instrumentalities as the Quays , the Clarksons , the Lou " Payns , the Addickses , and the Byrne .. The Democrats must make a very different appeal . They must assume from the beginnning that if Judge PARKER can be elected at all it will be by the votes of men of intelligence and understanding , men capable of reasoning about public affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tricks , and manipulation . To begin with , the Chairman of the National Committee ought to be a man of National reputation , universally respected for ability and uprightness.
