txt Theodore Roosevelt to-day became President of the United States , with a solemn promise that he would follow out the policy laid down by President . His exact words , which produced a most profound impression upon the small company of people to whom he spoke , were : " I wish to say that it shall be my aim to continue absolutely unbroken the policy of President for the peace and prosperity and the honor of our beloved country . " A more solemn scene would be hard to conceive than was the swearing in of Mr. Roosevelt as President . It occurred in the library of the home of his personal friend , ex-State Senator Ansley Wilcox , which home is a little , old-fashioned Colonial mansion on Delaware Avenue , within a mile of the residence of Mr. Milburn , where the body of the assassinated President is lying . There was nothing of pomp in the ceremony . It ' gas as simple and as sanctified as a family religious service , such as a wedding . It was hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Roosevelt , as Vice President , arrived here , at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon . He had been brought on , as fast as the best of horses and the swiftest of special trains could bring him , from his retreat in the Adirondacks , where he went last week , fully satisfied that President would recover . AVOIDS WAITING CROWDS . It was Mr. Roosevelt 's particular desire that there should be no demonstration from the crowds here in Buffalo . Many thousands of persons were waiting to greet him at the Exchange Street station . To avoid this crowd the train ran on to the Terrace Station . An escort of twelve ' mounted patrolmen and several detectives waited there . The authorities felt that they could not take too much care in guarding the man who was to take the place of the martyred . Jumping from the train , Mr. Roosevelt got into a ' closed carriage with Mr. Milburn and was at once driven to the home of Ansley Wilcox , Where a light lunch was served , and where he became ac- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told that it was desired to administer the oath to him very soon , and he agreed with the suggestion . Mr. Roosevelt expressed a desire to be taken to the Milburn house , in order that he might gaze upon the face of President . The Fourth Signal Corps and two platoons of mounted police had been stationed before the Wilcox house as a further escort for the Vice President . ' OBJECTS TO MILITARY ESCORT . It had been intended to swear Mr. Roosevelt in at the Wilcox house immediately upon his arrival , but his request to be first permitted to go to the Milburn house was respected . When he came out . of the Wilcox house , at 2:30 o'clock , to go to the Milburn house , and saw the soldiers and police , he appeared to be displeased . " I do not want such an escort as that , " he said . " It is not necessary . A couple of mounted policemen swill be quite enough . " Three mounted Policemen were put on either side of his carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him were William Loeb , his private secretary , and George L. Williams. - The carriage was closed , but the crowds along . Delaware A.venue knew . that it contained the man Who is to be President ' SA ' the next three . years and a half , ' and could not restrain its applause although s this never took ' on the character , of an eyes s **42;245;TOOLONG : ,  --  ' ' - rss ' Lion . The people seemed to be fully imnressed with the solemnity of the time .. : President Roosevelt Was dressed in along frock coat , which fitted his athletic figure to perfection . The waistcoat was buttoned high , revealing very little of the black silk four-in-hand tie , which was knotted under a turn-down collar . He had a very thin . gold watch chain across his waistcoat . His trousers were almost a solid gray . His patent leather shoes were heavy soled and square toed . He had come on without a high hat , and , not having time to buy one , had bor. ' rowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fit him , The Vice President jumped from the carriage when it stopped at the Milburn house , and advanced , with bowed bead , across the broad lawn . Mr. Cortelyou , the dead President 's private secretary , came out to meet him . - Mr. Roosevelt inquired anxiously after Mrs. . He breathed a sigh of relief- when told that there had been a marked improvement in her condition since yesterday . Learning , that she was resting , he left a message of sympathy for her , and Secretary Cortelyou then took him , to the up-stairs room In which the body of President rested . - OVERCOME WITH GRIEF . Mr. Roosevelt gazed upon the features ' : of the Chief Executive , by whose assassination he had been placed at the head of the United States Government . He did not speak a word . He stood silent , with bowed head , for several minutes , , and then walked from the room , tears streaming from his eyes and his strong frame shaking with convulsive sobs . It was several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Cabinet who were in the Milburn house . Vice President Roosevelt was driven back to the Wilcox house , a quaint little vine-covered home , with big Colonial pillars extending to the roof along the front . It stands back under the shade of big trees , and is the last place in the world that one would pick out as the scene for such a ceremony as the swearing in of a President of the United States . Mr. Roosevelt got back there shortly after 3 o'clock this afternoon . All of the members of the Cabinet except Secretaries Hay and Gage , who are in Washington , were awaiting the arrival of the Vice President . There were also present many other men who have played a conspicuous part in the events con-nected with the National tragedy which has been enacted here during the past week . There were a few women in the house , but they kept mostly in the background . There were a score of men with cameras standing about waiting to take pictures of Mr. Roosevelt , but at his request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilcox 's house had been chosen as the place in which the .. oath should be administered . It is a room not more than 18 by 25 feet , with a low ceiling . There is a bay window in it , in which some potted palms are effectively arranged , and which is canopied off by green draperies . The general color of the room is green , although its walls are almost entirely covered by well-filled bookcases . There was no furniture in the room other than the bookcases , a - library table , and a few chairs . PRESENT AT THE CEREMONY . Vice President Roosevelt advanced into the bay window alcove , where he shook hands with Judge John R. Hazel , United . States District Judge , who was to admin. = ' aster the oath to him . On his right stood Secretary Long , Secretary Hitchcock , Secretary Wilson , Secretary Smith , Secretary Root , and Secretary Knox . . On . his left stood Ansley Wilcox , Private Secretary Loeb , George Urban , Dr. Mann , . and Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - whom Col. Roosevelt had asked to continue-to serve him as he had served President ; Mr. Milburn , Clerk George B.-Keating of the United States District Court , Judge , A. R. Haight of the Court of Appeals , ' Senator Depew , John Scatcherd , George L. Williams , and-about a score of reporters . Back in the , doorway stood Mrs. Ansley Wilcox , Miss Wilcox , Mrs. John G. Milburn , Mrs. Carleton Sprague , Mrs. Mann , and Mrs. Charles Carey . The entire company present numbered forty-three persons : The silence in the room was - painfully oppressive when - Secretary : : RoOt ads vanced to Vice President- Rooseveltand Judge Hazel-and , said : " Mr. Vice Presidents:Ishave been re-s1 quested by all , of - the members ' theyCabi &t; of the late .

" Mr. Roosevelt 's features were fixed . His ? eyes glistened through his big goldrimmed spectacles as he bowed to Secretary Root and , in that peculiar staccato voice which all who are familiar with his public utterances know so well , said : TO CONTINUE 'S POLICY . " Mr. Secretary , I am of one mind with the members of the Cabinet . I will show the people at once , in accordance with the request of the members of the Cabinet , that the administration of the Government will not falter , in spite of the terrible National blow from which we are suffering . " I wish to say that it shall be my aim to continue , absolutely unbroken , the policy of President for the peace , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As he uttered this solemn promise Mr. Roosevelt threw back his shoulders and shook his head in the manner that is characteristic of him when he is thoroughly in earnest . He did not raise his voice above any ordinary conversational tone , but nobody could doubt the earnestness which inspired the words : There was silence for a moment . Mr. Roosevelt turned and bowed to Judge Hazel , signifying that he was ready to proceed with the taking of the oath . Judge Hazel recited the brief , solemn pledge , and Mr. Roosevelt repeated it , phrase for phrase , after him . When Judge Hazel uttered the first words of the oath Mr. Roosevelt 's right arm shot straight up above his head , and he held it rigid there until the oath was complete . Both Judge Hazel and Mr. Roosevelt repeated the oath in tones that Were scarcely audible to those furthest from them . It was exactly 3:30 o'clock when the administration of the oath was completed and Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States . This was exactly eight minutes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONGRATULATIONS EXTENDED . For a moment no one spoke or moved . Secretary Root broke the silence by extending his hand to President Roosevelt and saying with deep fervor : " God bless you and keep you , Mr. President , and may you have every success . " " I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your well wishes , " President Roosevelt replied . This was the signal for congratulations prom everybody present . It began with &he; Cabinet officers , and inside of four minutes the President had shaken hands and exchanged words with every one of the forty-three persons there . The congratulations generally were of the most perfunctory character , such as : " God bless you , Mr. President . " " I wish you success , Mr. President . " " The whole country will pray for your success , Mr. President . " When young Mr. Milburn congratulated the President , Mr. Roosevelt recalled that a few days ago he had given the young man a promise to go fishing : With him at some future date . Mr. Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to postpone that fishing trip for some time . " The perfunctory character of tht congratulations from the men and women present and the President 's replies were varied in the cases of some of the newspaper men with whom he has long been well acquainted . To one he said : ? , here is mine ancient enemy , " and then he added , " but we are ail of one mind and one heart in such a sad crisis as this . " To another he said : " And to think that it was so short a. time ago that you and I were trying to straighten out the police force of New York City . " Five minutes after he took the oath President Roosevelt called Mr. Cortelyou , President 's private secretary , to one side and asked him to continue as private secretary to the President . Mr. Cortelyou promised to do so , and suggested that he would be glad of the assistance of Mr. Loeb , Mr. Roosevelt 's private secretary . INFORMAL CABINET SESSION . The members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there President Roosevelt joined them . What might be designated as an informal Cabi- : net meeting was held fifteen minutes after the President was sworn in . At its Conclusion it was announced that no action had been taken which was of public interest , and that no Cabinet action need be looked for until after the body of President is interred at Canton next Thursday afternoon . In fact , no questions of politics or policy : are being discussed here to-day openly . While the President was still in the Wilcox library with the people grouped around him just as they were - when he took the oath it was suggested that an . official photograph should be taken . President Roosevelt agreed with the pro . priety , of this ' suggestion and - several snap-shots were taken . The Cabinet members and others then began to leave the Wilcox house . President Roosevelt announced that he would remain as the guest of Mr .. Wilcox until he leaves- on the funeral train for Washington on Monday morning . He said that he did not expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pimple family funeral services to be held at the Milburn residence to-morrow . SENATOR HANNA 'S APPEARANCE . It was less than a half hour after President Roosevelt had taken the oath that a carriage drove up to the Wilcox home containing Senator Mark Hanna and his private secretary . The Senator seems to have aged ten years in the last twentyfour hours . His face : usually florid and wreathed in smiles , , is now pallid and drawn . Usually active on his feet , today he actually totters as he moves about , with stooped shoulders and bowed head . As he stepped from the carriage and proceeded toward the door of the Wilcox house , leaning heavily on the arm of his secretary , President Roosevelt saw him coming and advanced to meet him . When the President courteously held out his hand to Senator Hanna the latter shifted his cane and his soft white felt hat from his right to his left hand and returned the greeting cordially . " Mr. President , " said Senator Hanna , " I wish you success and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command me if I can be of any service . " The President did not reply except by a pressure of the hand . Senator Hanna 's thoughts seemed to be far away . As he moved toward the door President Roosevelt accompanied him , still holding his hand . They parted without any further exchange of words . As Senator Hanna walked back toward his carriage several men greeted him . He responded in a most perfunctory manner , as though he did not hear what they said . When he was asked to-day to make some statement for publication he pleadingly said , " Not now ; not now . I can not collect my thoughts ; and what is there , after all , to be said ? " Among the politicians here there is all sorts of gossip as to the changes that President Roosevelt may make in the Cabinet . The talk on this line , however , is the veriest conjecture . All that is known is that at the Cabinet conference held just after he was sworn in to-day President Roosevelt said that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to serve in their present positions . He did not say for how long , but simply asked them to continue to serve . This they all promised to do . The President , after the meeting of the Cabinet , saw a few personal friends and then said to Secretary Root : " Let us take a little walk ; it will do us both good . " Secretary Root assented and they went out together . A couple of policemen and two detectives in citizens ' clothes started to follow . Mr. Roosevelt turned and told his secretary to tell them that he did not desire any protection . " I do not want to establish the precedent of going about guarded , " he said . The policemen and detectives touched their hats , but before the President had gone a hundred yards two of them were walking just behind him and two of them were following him on the other side of the street . The two distinguished men attracted L but little attention until they got up near the police lines on Delaware Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to Secretary Root , some of the crowd recogized him , and he was surrounded . The police drove the crowd back , and the President , accompanied by Col. Bingham , who had joined him , and watched also by his former military secretary at Albany , Col. George Curtis Treadwell , walked briskly back to the Wilcox house . The President passed the evening quietly at Mr. Wilcox 's home , dining quite late . Gov . Odell , Congressman Lucius Littauer of New York , and William Warden of Buffalo called during the evening , as did also Col. Russell Harrison . The President showed some effects of the long journey and the day 's strain , but found time to have a chat with Gov . Odell . Gov . Odell told the President that he intended issuing a proclamation to-night concerning the President 's death , and discussed the tenor of it . President Roosevelt said that he , too , would issue a proclamation , and that after preparing the substance of it he had put it in the hands of Secretary Cortelyou to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages of congratulation ; in fact , so many came that no attempt was made to open the large majority of them .
