ON the 24th of November , 1904 , our little party of five left Wandel . Island , where we had passed the antarctic winter on board Le Francais , after having returned from our attempt to reach Graham Land ( latitude 67x ) . We took with us provisions for twenty days . Our first objective was Lund Island , which is situated the farthest south of the three large islands which border on the Lemaire Channel . At the island we were stopped by a stretch of ice too thin to bear the weight of our party and yet difficult to force a way through . Up to one o'clock in the morning we tried to force a passage , but only advanced 300 metres . We returned and pitched camp on an island near by . The next day we undertook the task again and made some headway ? to the great consternation of the penguins , which looked on in wonder at these strange beings dragging behind them some unknown but monstrous machine . At six o'clock in the evening we set foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accomplished and our courage returned . ' The thick coverings of moss on the heights offered a pleasing view , and we had a fine out-of-door din- ner , while the columns of penguins , like an army , marched past in the direction of their rookery . On Saturday , the 26th , after exploring the island , gathering some specimens of natural history and taking our bearings , we proceeded by a channel of open water farther south . We had still some difficulty with the ice in the passage , and that night we pitched camp on the southern point of Lund Island . Onr new mode of life during this period required new rules . As soon as we arrived in camp our material was put ashore , the position of the tent was chosen , and the kitchen installed . The silk tent was held up by three pairs of skis driven into the snow and held together at the top by bamboo rods . The thick sleeping-sacks of reindeer-skin were stretched out crosswise . While some of us were busy with this work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed food , prepared the " mess , " while Charcot lighted the oil-lamp and fixed the fires . The kitchen utensils comprised a huge " marmite " surrounded by a circular basin and covered with a Large receptacle , over all being a largo aluminum cover to prevent the loss of heat . Each receptacle was filled with snow . When this was melted we put a ration of butter , which it was sometimes necessary to cut with a hatchet , into the " marmite " with a bit of beef , some biscuit , salt , and compressed vegetables . All this , mixed with the soup-stock from the night before , which had been carefully preserved , without counting the reindeer hairs from the sleeping-sacks and the tobacco which fell in by accident ? all this made a solid pciti which , served hot , was a feast for the most delicate stomach . A bit of cheese , half a stick of chocolate , a sea-biscuit , and a quart of coffee or tea completed the meal . Sometimes when we were in no particular burry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter on a little aluminum stove . This was a real feast . After the repast the whale-boat was lifted ashore , and every one slipped quickly into his sleeping - sack . These were the moments of relaxation , when , accompanying the inscription of the record of the day 's journey , jokes and pleasantries went the rounds . Soon all heads disappeared inside the sacks , and all five of us enjoyed a well-earned sleep . The next morning we Left Lund Island . The sun was shining , and there was good surface , for the ice had frozen solid during the night . The whale-boat slipped easily over the hard snow , and much encouraged , we decided to cover a greater distance and to camp at Cape Tuxen , which arose toward the south . We left the extreme point of Lund and found ourselves on the open sea . Almost immediately the snow began to melt under the sun , and the whale-boat moved more slowly . We suffered with the heat . At noon we took a moment of repose , then started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ice became worse ; channels across our route made us lose time in taking the heavy boat across . Our eyes began to smart in spite of our blue glasses . Our lips burned . Fortunately at five o'clock the sun went under a cloud . In addition a large clear space of open . water gave us a moment of respite . We made a little progress with the oars , but this soon ended . The boat was again lifted up on the ice , and we dragged it forward again . The ice , half broken up , became more and more difficult to cross , and we sank into the ice-cold water up to our knees . A new channel which appeared did not offer us much assistance . On every side the immense gray ice-field indicated the presence of water , through which we had to splash . In the distance islands appeared , but they seemed so very , very far away . Behind us the island of Lund looked so small and so far away that it was impossible to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hkewiSe impossible ? it would mean sleeping in the water . Forward ! The island situated toward the open sea from Cape Tuxen seemed a little nearer and offered what seemed the best objective-point . The condition of the ice became steadily worse . Two or three trials were necessary to move the boat when it stopped . Hardly ten feet of . progress were made at a time , when the sound of scraping would be heard , and the boat would sink into the soft ice , where it became fixed , while the ice-cold water poured into our boots . We fixed the mast and an oar across the boat , and this permitted us to hold it more easily on an even keel and to exert a more direct pull . This operation was not without danger . At times , also , wide channels barred our passage , when it was necessary to put the whale-beat into the water and leap into it at the moment the ice cracked ? an operation which we came to execute with a certain degree of finish . But on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the water , which was a rough and difficult task . At ten o'clock at night we were still dragging along slowly . it was cold . On all sides stretched out the wide plain ? a spectacle of mortal sadness under the pale light of a sightless day ? and the island was still in the far distance . Finally we saw the mirror of open water , which seemed to stretch to the island . Our courage returned . The boat was now afloat in its own element , and with a few strokes of the oars we reached the coast . The next day we started again on our journey . Again long hours were spent in dragging the boat over the ice , which was almost like that of two days ago . We proceeded twelve hours at a stretch without stopping . At three o'clock in the morning we landed at Cape Tuxen , of which the grandiose architecture was a marvel to us and in some sense a comfort . After visiting the coast and ascending a chain of the cape 500 metres high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of December . Again we came upon a long ice-field , where in places the water was half-way to our hips . At three o'clock in the morning we saw a group of wild , picturesque mountains . High , rocky cliffs arose above the snow . The next day we climbed the highest summit of the islands , 200 metres in height . The weather was splendid and the panorama marvellous . We were well paid for our trouble , for here finally we found the solution of our great problem . Nowhere was there any strait . We were in the centre of an immense bay surrounded by high mountains and giant glaciers . On all sides the coast was bordered by a high wall of ice ? an inhospitable land if there ever was one . Photographs , sketches , and bearings fixed every point of this corner of land which we called our own . And now that our abject was accomplished and victory was ours , we looked over this vast stretch which we had just crossed , and which we had to traverse again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we started toward the north , and on the 4th of De- MY ANTARCTIC comber we arrived before the island of Lund . Never was work more difficult . More than once we had reason to believe that we would not come out alive . A cold wind was blowing from the south , and it was not until two o'clock in the morning that we were able to set foot on land . Two days later we were on board . We refitted the rigging of the Francais and made her ready to start , but the ice still held her . We set to work , and with ice-saws , picks , and levers we finally- made a channel . Several charges of melinite finally broke up the ice , and on the 25th of December ? Christmas day ? the Francais left the port in which she had passed the winter . After a stop at Port Penguins , where we renewed the cairn of February , we ascended the Strait of Gerlache and the Schollaert Canal , of which we made a chart , and gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south , and on the 7th of January we took bearings of one of the Biscoe Islands . On the 11th we were in sight of Alexander Land . Several attempts to reach it were futile . So we started northeast to reconnoitre Graham Land . On the 14th a long mountainous coast appeared . The ice-pack , which was very thick , was forced during the night , and on the morning of the 15th we were in a channel of open water along the land , seeking a point from which to debark . We were going at full speed , when a formidable report was heard . It appeared that we had struck a rock hidden two metres under the surface . Not a breaker gave us warning , and the great icebergs all around this point indicated , on the contrary , a deep bottom . The boat shipped water on all sides . We found that there was no harbor on this coast , which proved a veritable wall of ice thirty metres high . We were obliged immediately to recross the pack to avoid being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , however , the coast had been charted . Now it remained only to reach the north . Bad weather overtook us that very evening , but , thanks to Providence , its only effect was partly to conceal our water course . Nevertheless , this retreat was the most difficult period of the expedition , and it was only on the 29th of January that we finally reached Port Penguins . Officers and crew were worn out . Several days were still given to observations , to the collection of specimens , and to hill-climbing . Finally on the 11th of February we debarked in the Bay of Biscoe end took the route north by the Strait of Gerlache . We debarked again at Li5ge Island , then at Hoseason Island , and on the 15th we said our last good-by to the antarctic . On the eve-ning of the 3d of March we again came into civilization in the little Argentine port , Puerto Madryn . The expedition had now returned to inhabited lands . A wire from Port Madryn announced the news of our return , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had finally received assurance of our safety . Buenos Ayres , some days later , arranged a reception for us which will always be one of the most pleasant recollections of the voyage . The Argentine people , by reason of their geographical situation at the gates of the antarctic , are in a position to be the true conquerors of these frozen lands which stretch up from the south toward Cape Horn . They have already accomplished much in two brilliant expeditions . The acquisition of our good ship Francais will again give them the opportunity to extend their plans and to undertake new expeditions . Finally , on the 6th of June , we arrived at Toulon on the cruiser Linois , which was placed at our disposition by the French government . Next day in Paris the Minister of Marine , Mr. Thomson , came in person to receive us at the station , together with representatives of the Institute , of the Geographical Society , and of the Museum . And some days later at London the Royal Geographical Society and the officers of the English antarctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitable manner . Sonic months of work will be necessary before all the observations we made can be collated and before all our collections can be classified and studied . I am therefore unable to give at the present time anything but a provisional enumeration of our principal results . For our hydrographic work a regular triangle on a measured base was built around our winter quarters on BoothWandel Island with a radius of from two to five miles . Thus we were enabled to take bearings of different summits thirty or forty miles away , and to place these points in a sufficiently exact manner . A region from thirty to fifty miles around Wandel Island was thus observed . The bearings of other portions of the coasts where observations were taken were determined by means of sea stations , with the assistance of certain astronomical observations . These were , toward the north , the exterior coast of Palmer Archipelago and the Schollaert Channel ; toward the south , the Biscoe Islands and two parts still unknown of Graham Land , with an extent of about thirty miles each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly bear his name , to mention that Biscoe charted only Pitt and Adelaide islands , being satisfied with the indication that between these two islands lay a strait and a chain of small islands covered with a cap of ice . The position of Pitt Island is given in three different ways in the English and German publications and on the maps of the Admiralty . These positions differ by one degree of latitude and longitude . Naturally we were unable to take observation of the complete contours of these islands , since the strait which separates them was completely obstructed by ice . But we were able to locate and chart the exterior coasts toward the sea , which is , of course , the most important point for navigation . We found , indeed , qwq species of Phanerogamte ? a " botanic find of the most interesting character , " according to the judgment of Professor Autran , of Buenos Ayres . The geologic collection consists of several hundred specimens coining from the different points explored by our expedition , and especially from Wandel Island , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to these collections , Wandel island in particular appears to be composed of eruptive granitoid rocks in contact with strips of slaty substance which they have more or less metamorphosized . On the subject of glaciology we took notes on the movements of the ice , particularly in the bays near our winter quarters , and of the formation of the sea ice in these bays . We also observed the movements , the dimensions , and the transformations of the icebergs . The icebergs were noted in tabular form , with the thickness , formation , and destruction of the ice-ledge . We also made studies of the constitution of the ice-caps on the smaller islands of the Archipelago situated toward the west of Graham Land , with the general trend of these islands . Notes were also taken on the glaciers of the Terre de Danco and of Palmer Archipelago . In addition , we ascended a summit of Wandel Island and examined the island 's mountainous crest . In bacteriology our study included an analysis of the sea water , of the air , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good condition even to-day , came from our analyses of sea water and of the intestinal fauna of seals , of birds ( penguins , gulls , cormorants , petrels ) , and of fish . If one adds to this scientific material a collection of 3000 photographs , of which many are valuable documents ; medical observations , among which was that of a severe case of ntyucarditis during our stay in winter quarters ; and finally the discovery and study of the two ports , Wandel and Wiencke , both of them valuable places of refuge in an inhospitable land ? one will have a general idea of the work of our expedition , and will he able to form a judgment of its scientific results .
