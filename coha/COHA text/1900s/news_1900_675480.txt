txt Readers who have not- the happiness of being Bostonians are vaguely aware that , under the leadership of the late Mayor JOSIAH QUINCY , Boston tried an experiment in that " municipal ownership of public utilities " which to so many theorists seems to be the remedy for all our municipal evils . ' The fate of this experiment is described by Mr. GUILD A. COPELAND , in the current number of Harper 's Weekly , in an article of great interest and importance , under the clever title of " An Insolvent Utopia . " Among the things which it was determined that Boston should provide for itself , instead of permitting selfish and greedy private persons to provide them for it , were its stationery and print- ing , its actual carpentry , including both construction and repairs , its electrical installations , and , what is of special interest to us in New York just now , its ice plant . Carpenters , wheelwrights , blacksmiths , painters , electricians , veterinaries , were " civil servants . " To escape the terrors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed on the municipal payrolls as " ship calkers , " " rubber gasket makers , " " beam tenders , " and even " an expert swimmer . " What was the practical output of all this apparatus had not really been investigated until the accession of the present Mayor , a level-headed business man . He was struck , on being called upon to sign some vouchers relating to a matter which he knew something about , by the excess over the market-prices of material and labor . From this proceeded an investigation which has resulted in the turning over to private enterprise of a number of " public utilities " upon the ground that it cost far too much for the city to provide them for itself . Mr. COPELAND gives the instances . A job of electrical equipment on the ferryboats , which should have cost $6,800 , cost $10,200 , A. job of electricity in a building for hospital nurses should have cost $1,528 , and- did cost $4,754 . Work on an armory , which could have been done for $2,600 was done for $6,700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own philanthropic plant cost about $60 a ton , which is some fifteen times the figure the American Ice Company has charged the constituency of Mayor VAN WYCK . And so forth . For further particulars , social reformers may consult Mr. COPE-LAND 'S article . In all this there is no charge of direct dishonesty or peculation . It was simply the extravagance engendered , as a limited experience of human nature would have shown that it was sure to be engendered , by withdrawing the incentive to diligence and frugality furnished by private interest , and putting nothing equivalent in its place . There was an element of conscious humbug in the evasion of the rules of the civil service . These were " beaten " in many ways , so as to make " patronage " out of the enormous multiplication of places caused by municipal ownership . Perhaps Mayor QUINCY may have been personally responsible for some of this chicanery . There is a general suspicion in Boston that he is none too good for it . But it is not necessary to take that into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communities which should profit by the Bostonian object lesson in municipal ownership that it has not been complicated by any revelations of systematic corruption , and so fairly shows the result of expecting as good results from the labors of men - working for a municipality as from the labors of men working for a private employer , who has the most efficient of all motives for getting the worth of his money out of them .
