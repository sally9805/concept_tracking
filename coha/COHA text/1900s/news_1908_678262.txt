For when I opened Sunday 's TIMES , Prepared with glee to read The winners of the limericks It made me start indeed To see no four lines printed there To greet my longing eyes . ( You see , I 'd sent a new one in And hoped to win a prize . ) For know you , please , ' t would not be strange That such a thing should be .

Once more , if you will turn the page ; ' T is like a dying ember The memory of that last glad day As recent as September . The twenty-seventh -- aye , that 's it , Another of my rhymes Was printed there . Oh ! happy me ! Full well I blessed THE TIMES . But now , alas ! the scene is changed , Blank darkness is my lot . Of future joy and happiness I can not see a jot . Now , say , dear TIMES , dost think it fair My pin cash to curtail ? Pray let this little poemlet plea Be not without avail .

I know the work is very nice , I 'm sure the toil is light , And full of peace the daytime hours And pleasant dreams the night . Another method I 'd present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send to me A fair-sized weekly pension . I know you 'll do the proper thing , For hark . You 'll think it funny , But -- yes , I will confide in you -- I really need the money . DUDLEY H. PRENTICE .
