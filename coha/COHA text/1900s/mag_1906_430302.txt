 | For the last thirty-five years a constant warfare has waged in the United States between the good and the bad in life insurance . On one side have ranged honesty , economy , and fair and liberal treatment of the insured ; on the other , dishonesty , extravagance , and absolute disregard of policy-holders ' rights . Certain companies have treated life insurance as a great beneficent institution , organized for the purpose of protecting the weak and the dependent against adverse fortune ; others have regarded it largely as a convenient contrivance for enriching the few men who happened to have usurped control . In this thirty-five years the history of American life insurance has been one of progressive degeneration . The people have forgotten the old ideals ; have persistently abandoned good life insurance and taken up with bad . They have for the larger part ignored the teachings of our great American leaders ? men like Elizur Wright , of Massachusetts , the originator of nearly everything that is best in the American system ; Jacob L. Greene , of Hartford ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership of men who have degraded the whole institution . They have thus displaced the United States from the world leadership in life insurance which it formerly held , and have made what was one of our greatest claims to national distinction the cause of what is , in many ways , our most shameful national scandal . To show this deterioration in quality we need not necessarily look far . The most popular companies , indeed , have largely ceased to do a life insurance business at all . If you study the literature they circulate , you will find the life insurance feature of their contracts only incidentally mentioned . They talk little about protection of one 's family , but much about savings banks , investments , guaranteed incomes , five per cent Consols , and gold bonds . They ask you to buy their policies not that thereby you may provide financial protection for your dependents , but that you may thereby reap financial advantage yourself . They appeal , not to your sense of responsibility , but to your cupidity . They preach life insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenceless , but to the fortunate and the rich . In a word they have grafted upon the simple life insurance idea endless investment and gambling schemes , most of which are fallacies and some of which are palpable frauds . Consequently hundreds of thousands profit little , or not at all , from the insurance feature of their contracts . In the majority of cases they ignore it entirely . The real situation was eloquently summed up at the recent New York life insurance investigation . I t then appeared that at least onethird of the insured abandoned their policies , at great loss to themselves , after they have been in force for one or two years . Of those that are left two-thirds , at particular periods , surrender them , taking in exchange certain so-called " cash profits " and thus leaving their families unprovided for . In other words , out of every hundred only about twenty have entered the company for the insurance protection ; or , if they have , have not yielded to the temptation of a cash reward and abandoned it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must go to Connecticut , Massachusetts , New Jersey , and one or two other states . There we shall find great companies limiting their activities to one single end ? the insuring of lives . They do not deal in  | investments , do not act as savings banks or lotteries . They collect from the insured during life certain stipulated sums , and , in the event of death , pay over to the widows certain equivalent indemnities . They collect from each member precisely the same pro rata price for the particular service rendered ; and base this price upon certain well known mathematical laws which closely determine the exact cost . They treat all the insured upon a strictly " mutual basis , " which , in the last analysis , means insurance at its actual cost and that actual cost to all . They furnish this article at a lower price than present quotations for the New York variety . l'hey do it , too , without the elaborate machinery found so indispensable upon Manhattan Island . They have no subsidiary banks or trust companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized world ; no alliance with captains of industry in Wall street ; no array of extravagantly salaried officers ; no corruptionists in every important state capitol . They do not have enormous surpluses unjustly withheld from the policy-holders to whom they belong ; do not pay in commissions for new business larger sums than that business is worth ; do not write insurance in forty-five states and all foreign countries , including China , Japan , Borneo , and Malaysia ; they remain quietly at home insuring only respectable heads of American families in good physical condition . No Real Dividends in Life Insurance Before this story is told in detail , we must have a clear conception of what life insurance , stripped of its mystifications and falsehoods , actually is . We must acquaint ourselves with the ordinary terms of the business : the premium , the reserve , the surplus . Upon no other subject is the public ignorance so profound . And yet , in itself , hardly any subject is more simple . Necessarily , first we must disabuse our minds of certain preconceptions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not an enterprise in which capital engages for the sake of profit . There are stock companies ; but for the most part they pretend that they provide life insurance at its actual cost ; that all so-called " profits " go to the insured . Theoretically , at least , and in many instances , actually , these great companies are trusts , in the real meaning of the term ; their directors are trustees in the most sacred sense . Similarly life insurance is not gambling . As now practised , certain lottery attachments have been added to it ; at times it has been reduced almost to the par of faro and roulette . Above all , life insurance is not an investment . The word " dividend " applied to it has been the most prolific cause of evil . Properly , as will be explained later , there is no such thing . There can be no dividend , no profit ? no investment ? because , even under the most favorable circumstances , the expenses of management are so great . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expends anywhere from eighteen to fifty cents in expenses ; manifestly it can not invest the rest so as to pay you any investment return . Life Insurance Merely Indemnity ? Not Investment Life insurance is one thing and one thing only . In the social and economic order it performs a single and a simple service . It is the money indemnification for the destruction of a valuable human life . We insure our lives for the same reason that we insure our houses and our ships . All three things have money value ; all stand momentarily in danger of destruction ; and all are insured for the purpose of recouping ourselves and our dependents for their loss . This protection is something that we buy . We pay money for it ; that is , it is an outgo ? an expenditure ; never an income . Our compensation is the great one that , when we die , our dependents will not be beggared . This is so great an advantage , it adds so wonderfully to the sum of human happiness , that we are willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one regards the insurance upon his house ? one 's fire insurance ? as an investment ? as something upon which he receives an annual income ; and no more should he so regard the insurance upon his life . With certain limitations , which will be detailed subsequently , life insurance is a science . It is scientific because it deals with one of the few certainties of human experience ? that is , death itself . If a company contracts to pay a certain amount at death it knows that it will have to fulfil that promise ; it knows , that is , that the insured will die . Furthermore it knows , within certain limits , when he will die . I t can not predict this in the individual case , of course . I t does not know when you will die or when I will die ; but , if it insures a sufficient number  | of persons of your age , it knows how many of them will die each year . A mysterious law apparently regulates their taking off . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in London ; another ioo , 000 aged 30 , living in New York ; another ioo , 000 aged 30 , living in San Francisco . At the end of the first year , it will find that 840 out of its London group had died ; 84o out of its New York group ; 84o out of its San Francisco group . At the end of the second year 844 will have quietly dropped out of each of the three groups . In the tenth year 885 in each group will die ; and so on , the original 100,000 being regularly and gradually diminished every twelvemonth . In the sixty-sixth year only three or four men in each of the three groups will be alive ; and these , at the ripe age of 96 , will pay their final tributes to nature . There may , of course , be slight variations in this program ; but these will not be sufficiently marked to disturb any calculations based upon them . For all practical purposes the uniformity is so pronounced as to merit the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of the last two centuries . It has been found out purely by observation . The records of many English parishes , the births for particular years , and the records of the deaths through succeeding years , have been carefully tabulated . Census returns of particular towns and counties have been compared with the death returns . Above all , the experience of the life insurance companies themselves has been taken as a guide . Before this mortality law was discovered , life insurance was the favorite device of swindling rogues . It was unsafe ; invariably failed ; and was consequently held in the utmost disrepute . Since this law was discovered and honestly utilized life insurance has been a science . Any merchant who knew just what his expenditures would be through a long series of years , and who had the power to adjust his income so as to equal them , could not possibly fail . That is the position of the life insurance company . Any accurate mortality table , common honesty , and good executive judgment ? with these as capital no life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other forms of insurance are not thus scientifically based . These companies can not figure in advance their future losses . No natural laws regulate the burning of houses or the destruction of ships . Two Scientific Bases of Life Insurance ? Mortality Law and Interest Rate The application of this mortality law to the cost of life insurance may now be illustrated in its simplest form . Let us take 1,000 men , all aged 40 , who desire to insure their lives . They might take out policies in some existing company , but not necessarily ? they can carry their insurance just as well themselves . So they enroll themselves into what may be called a life insurance association . They agree that $1,000. shall be paid to the widows of all that die . The association also decides to start with a fund precisely large enough to pay all policy claims as they mature . All members will pay into this fund their pro rata share in advance . In other words , the association decides to adopt what is known as the single premium system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this single payment should be . Obviously , since there are 1000 members and $1,000. is to be paid on the death of each , the association will have to pay out ultimately $1,000,000 . By the aid of its mortality tables , it calculates in advance the payments to be made each year . It finds , according to these tables , that the limit of human life is ninety-six years ; inasmuch as all members are in their fortieth year , its payments will range along a series of fifty-six years. * In the earlier years these deaths will be comparatively few , and few payments will therefore have to be made . In twenty or thirty years , as the members become older , deaths , and consequently death payments , will become more numerous . In forty years , both will decrease ? simply because there will be fewer members left to die . In the fifty-sixth year the ultimate survivor , ninety-six years old , will die , and the association will pay out its last $1,000. to his heirs . In all , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums . To meet these obligations it will not need to have in hand , at the beginning , a sum of $1,000,000 . If all members should die the day immediately following its organization , $1,000,000. would actually be required . But the deaths will be distributed annually through half a century . If the association  | started with $1,000,000. it would be guilty of rank extravagance , because money , properly invested , earns interest . The association would need , therefore , not $1,000,000. , but a sum which , properly invested , would produce that amount precisely in the annual instalments required . Before deciding what contributions to levy upon its members , the association would have to decide upon the rate at which to invest its funds . If it assumes a high rate , it would not need so large a cash fund ; if a small rate , it would need much more . In case of a high rate , that is , its interest earnings would contribute more to the annual sums required than in case its interest rates were low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend through half a century . That is a long time ; and the interest rate fluctuates . If the association should adopt a high rate , it might , after a few years , find itself unable to earn it . Therefore it would not realize the annual sums required to meet its death payments ; in other words , it would be insolvent . It will therefore adopt an investment rate so low that it can confidently figure upon earning it through the whole fifty-six years its contracts run . In strict conservatism it may place it as low as three per cent . By the aid of the mortal . itv table , which shows the number of deaths each year , and the adopted interest rate , which shows the amount contributed to the fund by interest earnings , the amount needed by the association , when it starts , can be mathematically determined . The first year , for example , the association must pay out $9,000. to the widows of the nine members who die . To meet that payment the association must have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 per cent , for one year , will equal $9,000 . Such a sum is approximately $8,730 . In the second year the association must pay out $9,000. to the widows of nine more deceased members . It must thus have in hand , at the start , a sum which , compounded at 3 per cent interest for two years , will aggregate $9,000 . That is , it will need only $8,460 . The amount needed to have in hand , at the beginning , to meet each year 's payments , it thus fully calculates in advance . By adding these fifty-six separate results it has the total cash fund required . By dividing this result by 1.000 , the original number of the association , it has each member 's precise contribution to the fund . At the beginning , therefore , it is plain why life insurance , in the usual commercial sense , is not an investment . " I he company puts your premiums at interest , not that it may furnish you a return in addition to the insurance , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is paid . In its bare essentials this is all there is to life insurance . This great institution rests upon two solid bases ; the law of human mortality and that of compound interest . Theoretically only one is indispensable ; the mortality law . This enables the company to foresee , for a long period of years , its annual expenditures , and consequently to make provision for their payment . With this principle alone , however , life insurance would not be an accomplished reality , because its cost would be excessive . The interest element , by making life insurance cheap , brings it within the purview of the poorest citizen . It transforms life insurance from an unutilized theory into a most salutary fact . In dealing in both these principles , moreover , we are dealing with moral certainties . Given a certain number of lives of a certain age , nothing is more clearly demonstrated than the order in which they will die . Given a certain amount of money , invested at a certain rate of interest , nothing is more self-evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If all life insurance companies thus used the same mortality tables ? anticipated , in other words , the same number of annual deaths ? and invested the premiums at the same rate of interest , the cost of the actual insurance would in all cases be the same . We have explained this great life insurance principle on the basis of the single premium ? the payment down , in a lump sum in advance , of the entire cost of the life insurance ? chiefly in the interest of simplicity . As a matter of fact , few buy their life insurance this way . They make to the common fund not one large contribution , but a smaller one , each year . A considerable number pay this uniform sum throughout life . They pay , that is , what is technically known as a level premium . The majority pay an annual level premium not through life , but for a stated number of years ? twenty , fifteen , ten , or perhaps five . After this premium paying period has elapsed , their policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They pay no more ; all they have to do to get the full value is to  | die . All these various premium systems ? annual level , twenty payment , fifteen payment , ten payment , or five ? are derived from the single payment , already detailed ; all are simply variations of it . All premium calculations are first made upon the theory that the cost is paid in one large sum ; and from this result the proper charge , if paid annually through life , or if paid annually for a limited number of years , is deduced . It is hardly worth while to describe in detail how the single premium is thus commuted into these several guises . The explanation involves many details , and the discussion of another subject ? that of annuities . It is sufficient to bear in mind that , from the standpoint of the company , the single premium , the annual level premium , the limited payment premiums are all mathematical equivalents . Pay as You Go System a Failure Probably some members of our hypothetical association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural premium . They would divide each year 's losses among each year 's survivors . If nine men died the first year , necessitating the payment of $9,000. they would assess this amount among the 991 who remained . They would tax each man about $9.08 . They would likewise assess the next year 's losses , another $9,000. , among the 982 members who survived ; making each one 's contribution for that year about $9.16 . They could make out a plausible argument for this procedure . They would say that this was plain business sense . They would point to the fact that every man paid each year the precise cost of his insurance ; and they would assert that this cost would be much lower than under the level premium plan . They would also claim that no large fund would accumulate in the treasury ; and that consequently the interest factor could entirely be disregarded . They would clinch their argument by calling attention to the fact that under the level premium plan , a thousand dollars ' worth of insurance would cost , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan they suggest , nine dollars . and a few cents the first year , and a slightly increasing price each year thereafter . Indeed they could make so excellent a case that , had the association not the experience of two centuries to guide it , they would probably carry the day . Theoretically the natural premium plan is flawless ; practically it nee works . It increases the cost of insurance every year ; at first almost inappreciably , but later on enormously . In the first year , when the deaths are few ? only nine in a thousand ? it taxes each member only nine dollars and d few cents . In the thirtieth year , however , the association contains only about 490 ; that is , 510 have died . That year , it loses 29 members and is thus called upon to pay out $29,000. ; therefore it charges the survivors $62. each . By this time it finds that the increasing annual premium is much larger than the discarded uniform annual premium . But its troubles have only begun . Its members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rapidly . The association is thus embarrassed from two standpoints . It has to pay out larger death sums each year , and each year it has fewer members upon whom to assess them . In the case of the last surviving nonagenarian the situation would be absurd . The association ? an association now only theoretically because all its members are dead ? would have to pay ' out $1,000. , but would have no members to levy upon . If it made the natural premiums payable at the beginning of each year the last survivor would have to advance the whole $1,000. with which to pay his own death claim . In this there is nothing actuarially un- . scientific or unjust . But in practice it never succeeds . It has been tried thousands of times and it is the basis of the numerous assessment and fraternal orders now dying a lingering death . All these associations prosper in the earlier years , when deaths are few and assessments consequently low . All begin to lose members as deaths and assessments increase . Men simply will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently they retire and the assessment schemes collapse . Reserves : Advance Payments for Insurance The association thus finally decides that each member shall pay for his $1,000. insurance by contributing $24. to the common fund each year as long as he lives . It therefore collects in advance from its 1,000 members $24,000. the first year . It promptly invests this at three per cent , thus increasing it in one year to $24,720 . It pays out this year - only $9,000. to the beneficiaries of its nine deceased members . It therefore has left in its treasury $15,720. ? the amount of all the  | premiums , plus one year 's interest , which has not been used . Dividing this $15,720. fund by 991 , the number of surviving members , it has a credit of about $15. to each surviving policy-holder . That is the amount of the first year 's premium , plus interest , which has not been used in paying death claims . The association collects $24. the second year from the 991 remaining policy-holders , a total of $23 784 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining a fund of $39,504 . It invests this again at 3 per cent , thus increasing the fund to $40,689 . It pays out $9,000. as policy claims , thus decreasing the fund to $31,689 . It divides this among the 982 remaining members , crediting each with a fund of approximately $32 . It finds that that is the amount of each policy-holder 's premium for two years , improved at compound interest , which has not been used in paying death claims . It finds , in other words , that it collects from every policyholder , under the level premium plan , more money than it needs to meet its expenditures , simply because its death losses , in the earlier years , are comparatively few . The association goes on thirty or forty years ; and then develops a new situation . In its thirtieth year it has 490 surviving members . It collects from each $24. and thus from all $11,76o. , which , with three per cent interest added , equals $12,112 . But it loses by death in the thirtieth year thirtytwo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income does not suffice for the outgo . It has collected only about $12,000. ; and must pay out $32,000 . ! The association , therefore , makes up the difference by drawing upon the unused payments of theearlier years . By this time its total unused fund ? unused premiums , that is , plus compound interest ? is very urge , and the appropriation for this thirtieth year deficit diminishes it only slightly . The association through the remaining years will never collect enough again to meet its annual payments ; every year the deficits will increase ; but the accumulations from the unused premiums and interest of the first half of its existence will precisely enable it to come out whole . The association calls these accumulations on the premium payments of the earlier years its reserves . It figures out the accumulation upon each policy , and calls it the reserve upon that particular policy . In other words it reserves the unused premium payments of the earlier years , when deaths do not devour all the money paid in , and pays them out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments . It must keep these reserves simply because it collects its contributions in uniform annual sums , in the earlier years too much , the later years too little , in deference to the majority of its members who insist upon paying that way . In another article the nature of this reserve will be analyzed in detail . At this point its great importance in life insurance only need be insisted upon . In fact it is the one test of solvency . If our association honestly reserves these unused early payments it can not possibly fail . If it steals or wastes them it must ultimately collapse . It could steal them for many years , however , without detection , because for about half its existence , it would collect more than enough money each year to pay that year 's death losses . When it reached those later years , however , when each year 's collections did not pay each year 's losses , its dishonesty would stand revealed . Under modern conditions , our association would find it difficult to do this . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent this very thing . Every year all its policies would be inventoried and the amount of necessary reserve on each one computed . If our association did not have that precise amount in its treasury , or assets to cover it ? bonds , mortgages , etc. ? the receiver would be called in and the shutters go up . Its reserves , that is , are an insurance company 's liabilities . The chief function of the insurance departments is to act as watchdogs of these reserves ; and this , whatever their other shortcomings , they successfully do . How the Agent and the Officers are Paid : A Tax on Every Premium Our life insurance association thus discovers the annual price of a $i , 000. policy at age 40 . It has thus determined , however , merely the net cost ; the cost , that is , of the actual insurance . It has made no provision for the second element of cost in life insurance ; that is , the expenses of company management . But it must have a chief manager of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and office boys . It must have an office in which to conduct business ; furniture , stationery , postage , and so on . Above all , unless all its 1,000 members join spontaneously , it must have a lively force of insinuating gentlemen to persuade  | them in ? that is , life insurance agents . All these things , especially the agency force , cost money . For want of a better system the association clumsily adds to every premium a certain annual sum to provide a special fund to meet these expenses . Perhaps it increases the annual premiums from $24. to $32. ? the extra being for expenses . It calls this addition a loading . Its total premium , in other words , consists of two parts : the amount actually needed to meet all death claims , as indicated by a mortality table , and decreased by interest earnings at a particular rate ; and the amount added to cover the cost of management . Why There Is a Surplus : Three Sources of Gain ' When the company applies these hypothetical rates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation changes . it finds that the scheme does not work with quite the precision anticipated . It discovers that the deaths do not occur quite as the mortality table provides ; that the interest rate earned is not always three per cent ; that the expenses do not always amount to the same sum as the loadings . It finds that it has based its charges upon three separate theories ? a theory concerning the yearly death-rate ; a theory concerning the interest earned , and a theory concerning the expense of management . Its theory concerning the death-rate pretty closely coincides with the facts ; its theory concerning the interest rate shows greater divergence ; and its theory concerning the management expenses is usually woefully mistaken . If its deathrate were precisely that indicated by the tables ; if it earned precisely the three per cent interest figured upon , not a penny more , not a penny less ; if it spent in management expenses precisely the amounts provided in the premium loadings ; the cost of insurance would manifestly be precisely what was charged . Because all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to year , the actual cost of insurance varies , also from year to year . But , fortunately for the cause of life insurance , it varies always in one direction . The company 's charges , that is , always exceed the actual cost . It almost invariably has fewer death losses than the mortality tables indicate ; and it commonly earns more interest than the estimate assumes . That is to say , it pays out each year less than it has rrovided for ; and earns , in interest , more than it needs to pay all claims . A company properly conducted also uses less every year for expenses than the amount provided in the premium loadings . First Possible Saving : From Mortality These several gains depend , of course , upon the honesty and ability with which the company is managed . Its mortality table is that formulated by Sheppard Homans in 1865 from the actual experience of The Mutual Life . That table is based upon selected lives ? lives that have been insured , and consequently assumed to have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical department is inefficient or corrupt , if it insures consumptives , paralytics , and physical degenerates , either because it knows no better or is impelled by the furious ambition of the management to do a large business , manifestly its mortality showing will be bad , perhaps even sinking below the standard of the table . But if it exercises unusual care , and takes people only in the finest physical condition , it will make a much better showing than the table ; the company will not have to pay as much in death losses as it supposed ; therefore it will have a considerable " saving from mortality . " Second Possible Saving : From Interest If it invests the premiums with bad or dishonest judgment , if it buys depreciated bonds merely because its investment department has been annexed by a Wall Street banking house ; if its directors constantly unload upon it , at a good profit to themselves , investments which they have themselves purchased on the quiet ; if its directors receive a substantial " rake off " on every investment made ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings . But if it invests the premiums with good judgment , it will make more than the interest rate required . Its premium prices , for example , may be based upon a three per cent investment rate ; three per cent , that is , is all it must earn to pay all obligations . But , b ) carefully making investments , it may actually earn four or five or even six . That is , it earns one , two , or three per cent more than it needs . It thus has a " saving from interest . " Third Possible Saving : From Management Expenses Again if the company is extravagantly conducted ; if it has many and ridiculously  | salaried officers ; if it pays , out enormous sums in commissions to agents , and supplies them , gratis , with traveling bags and fountain pens ? manifestly it will swallow all , frequently more , than these " loadings . " But , if the machine is economically managed , it will save a considerable portion of the expense charges . There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , as has been said , shows these savings every year , though in varying degrees . Every company , that is , charges the policy-holder more than the actual insurance costs . It is not properly subject to criticism for this . It can not foresee , in advance , precisely what that charge should be . It bases its prices upon a mortality table , which , for all practical purposes , is correct ; upon an interest rate so low that it can certainly be earned ; upon an expense rate which , even under the most adverse circumstances , should be sufficient . It charges this excess so as to be absolutely on the safe side ? so that it may surely meet all its obligations . Thus , inevitably , at the end of each year , the company has in its treasury a goodly sum , representing money taken from the policy-holders in excess of the real cost of the insurance . This is popularly known as its Surplus . The surplus thus measures the difference between the theoretical and the actual cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcharged . " What , " say the directors , " ought we to do with it ? We have paid all our policy obligations and laid by for reserve the precise amount needed for our future payments , and have this extra amount on our hands which we do not need and can never legitimately use . We do not need to keep it until next year , because there will also be a surplus left over after next year 's business . lust we spend this surplus in some foolish way ? Give it to charity ? Put it in our own pockets ? " The puzzle is easily solved . What , according to its professions , does the company exist for ? Simply to furnish life insurance to_the its members at its exact , mathematically ascertained cost . I t finds , at the end of each year , that it has charged too much . Obviously it should return to the policyholders the amount of that overcharge . " Profits " Merely the Overcharge : " Dividends " its Repayment These repayments of " surplus " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the " profits " of life insurance . They are the " investment return " on your premium . Actually they are none of these things . They are simply the repayment of the excess cost of your insurance . Let us seek a homely comparison . You send a messenger-boy to buy you a quantity of cigars . Not being sure what the exact cost will be you give him a two dollar bill . He pays $1.50 , and returns with your cigars and fifty cents change . You would hardly regard that fifty cents , as a " dividend " upon your purchase of cigars . Your messenger-boy has simply returned your overpayment . Your position is precisely the same when you buy a policy of life insurance . Your company does not know , at the beginning of the year , what the exact cost will be , but , to be on the safe side , charges you an excess price . At the end of the year it gives you back ? or at least it should ? your change , and miscalls it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually taking the fifty cents change from the messenger-boy , you might send him back to buy more cigars with it . Similarly , instead of taking your life insurance " dividend " in cash , you might let the insurance company keep it and give you the extra amount of insurance it will buy . Again , you might let the messenger-boy keep the fifty cents because you intend to send him to buy cigars a few days hence . Similarly you might let the insurance company keep the " dividend , " and apply it to buy your insurance next year ; that is , to reduce the next year 's premium . Many of our largest insurance companies differ from this messenger-boy in one important respect . He usually comes back with your fifty cents . Most insurance companies , however , in the case of a majority of their policy-holders , do not come promptly back with the annual overpayments . They hold the change . When the people complain that the current price of life insurance is excessive , they simply mean that these overpayments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are paid in . If the companies are honestly and ably managed and these overpayments are equitably returned , there could not possibly be any excess cost . Thus we have formulated a rule by which we can measure the relative prices charged by , the several companies . If we take the actual premium paid each year and subtract from this each year 's " dividends , " or returned  | overpayments we shall have the actual net prices charged for the insurance . Insurance Cost When These Overcharges are Annually Returned Let this rule therefore be applied to several companies , all of unquestioned solvency . You are forty years old , in good health , and seek a $10,000. ordinary policy of life insurance . You decide first , for example , upon the Connecticut Mutual . You are charged an annual premium of $30940 . After a year , the company finds that it has overcharged you precisely $38.5o ; * and returns that in the of a " dividend . " Manifestly your insurance has cost you exactly $270.90 . You pay $309.40 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mutual finds it has overcharged you $41.50 ; and sends you a check for that sum . This year your insurance has cost $267.90 ? a little less than the year before . You pay regularly for several years the same $309.40 ; and every year the amount paid back at its end increases . In the twentieth year , you pay the same $309.40 ; but at its end , receive back a check for $91.50* ? thus decreasing the net insurance cost to $217.90 . Thus each year you receive a larger " dividend ; " each year , that is , the actual cost of your insurance is decreased . The explanation is , briefly , that the reserve on your policy , as is explained above , grows larger every year , and the interest earned on it each year therefore increases . Suppose that at the same time you took your $1o,000. policy in the Connecticut Mutual , you had taken an identical policy in the Mutual Benefit . You would pay the same initial premium , $309.40 . In this case , instead of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantageously buy additional insurance with it . Your " dividend , " that is , would be regarded as a single premium , and the amount purchased traced to the credit of the policy . At the end Gf the first year , therefore , instead of $1 o , 000. insurance , you would have in the neighborhood of $10,153 . As in the Connecticut Mutual , your " dividends " would increase every year . In twenty years , if you used them to buy this additional insurance , your policy , originally for $10,000. , would have increased to one for about $13,000 . If you had taken out ? similar policies in the Northwestern Mutual of Milwaukee , the State Mutual of Massachusetts , the Massachusetts Mutual , and a few other so-called annual dividend companies the results would have been similarly favorable . Your policy would constantly grow larger or its actual annual cost would steadily decrease . Both results would be explained by the fact that the companies , at the end of each year returned to you the overcharge made at the beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Accumulated " Let us suppose , however , that , at the same time that you entered the Connecticut Mutual and the other annual-dividend , or annualrepayment companies , you took a $10,000. policy in the Equitable . You should pay $330. i o ? more than $20. more at the beginning , than the other companies charged . You hold the policy a year , but receive back from the company not a single penny of your overcharge ! Thus far you have paid $330.10 in the Equitable for precisely the same policy that cost you $270.90 in the Connecticut Mutual ? avdifference of $59.20 . The Equitable charges you $20. more in the first place , and then neglects to pay back the excess price . Perhaps , at the same time , you take out another $10,000. policy in the New York Life . You pay precisely the same initial price that you paid the Equitable ? that is $330.10 . A near passes ; you get back no overcharge ! You have also taken a $10,000. policy in the Mutual Life . You pay $327.60 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and also fail to get back your overpayment . All your excess payments ? all your " dividends , " if you wish ? are tightly locked up in the company 's vault . You note that this procedure differs from that of the " smaller companies , " and you write for an explanation . The Equitable informs you that you have a " deferred dividend " policy ; the Mutual that you have a " distribution " policy ; the New York Life that you have an " accumulation " policy . You inquire the meaning of these somewhat doubtful expressions ; and learn that , in the Equitable your " dividends " are not paid annually , but " deferred " for a certain period , usually twenty years ; that , in the Mutual , they are held , also usually for twenty years and then " distributed ; " and that . in the New York Life , they are " accumulated " for twenty years and then paid back . By inquiring more deeply , however , you learn that these Equitable " dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | but , in the majority of cases , for the benefit of others ; that the Mutual 's , after being held for twenty years , will not necessarily be " distributed " to you , but , it is more than likely , to some one else ; that , those of the New York Life , after being " accumulated " for twenty years , are quite likely to be paid over to Tom , Dick , or Harry . You learn that , in two contingencies , both of which are extremely likely , you will get no " dividends , " no repayments , at all . If you should have hard luck , and fail to pay your premiums , for any one of the twenty years the overpayments are held in the company 's treasury , you would forfeit all these ' deferred , " " distributed , " or " accumulated dividends . " If . at any time in these twenty years you should die , you would also forfeit all your overpayments . Only in case you live for twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get back your annual overpayments . And then you get back precisely what the company sees fit to pay you ? not a penny more . If you study your contract ? your policy , that is ? you will learn that the company has not legally obliged itself to pay you a single dollar ! Your share of the twenty years accumulated surplus is merely what is " equitably determined by the actuaries of the company . " You find that the company is not obliged to give you any accounting ; to tell you how much has been saved " from your premiums each year ; to let you know whether they have been carefully kept , or whether they have been squandered . If you could get at the company 's books , you would learn that , in fact , it keeps no actual account ; that it lumps all its annual overpayments or " dividends " in one sum , and not until the nineteenth year makes any attempt to determine how much should come to you and how much to me . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equitable , the Mutual , and the New York Life to court and demand , as a policy-holder , to learn precisely what your dividend amounts to , you would find that there is a law that , in effect , prevents you from doing this very thing . In other words in taking a deferred dividend policy , you had authorized the company to keep your accumulated overpayments for twenty years ; to pay them back to . you only in the event that you had not died or lapsed ; to pay back then , only such small sums as it might choose ; and to render you no accounting whatever and to ' keep none ! Poor Discriminated Against in Favor of the Rich This elaborate machinery , you will discover , has been admittedly evolved for the purpose of perpetrating a great injustice . The company declines to pay back these excess charges to those who die or drop their policies in order that it may pay them , instead , to those who live and persist . In other words , it does not treat all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the same price for their insurance ; does not preserve " mutuality . " It discriminates , too against its feast fortunate members . Manifestly , if you die , your widow needs these dividends , or the insurance they represent , much more than if you live . The deferred dividend companies take this money from the widows of their dead members and give it to their persisting policy-holders . Again , if you lapse your policy , it is usually because you have n't the money to continue it . The deferred dividend companies take advantage of this misfortune to deprive you of certain equities . Your " dividends " go to swell the account of those who have been able to keep up their regular payments . The deferred dividend plan is thus clearly a discrimina , tion against the unfortunate in favor of the prosperous . I t overcharges most ? and they the less prosperous ? in order that it may undercharge a few ? and they the more fortunate . Actually , as we shall see , it does not even treat its minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dividends " of all who die and lapse , it does not always pay back their own ! Let us imagine , for a moment , a savings bank organized on this basis . It requires all depositors to leave with it stipulated sums each year . It declines to pay interest annually ; but proposes to hold all earnings in its own treasury for twenty years . It is not obliged to keep an accounting of the earnings ; in fact does keep no accounting ; and has secured the passage of a state law that prevents any depositor from demanding one . It will pay these accumulated earnings only after twenty years and then pays just what its trustees deem fair and " equitable . " To depositors who have died in that twenty years it will pay no interest at all ; when they die their widows get simply the principal . To those  | who fail to keep up their annual deposits , they will pay no interest . If they drop out they get simply the original sums paid in . After twenty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live and have regularly made deposits , all the earnings accumulated upon the deposits of those who have died or " lapsed . " I n the end , however , many of the favored few would discover that they have not only not received these additional sums , but not always the entire interest upon their own deposits . That is the gist of the much discussed " deferred dividend " policy . As will be explained , this is only the survival of a scheme which was much worse . This is what the great Henry B. Hyde called " semi-tontine " ? half tontine . His pet plan , whole " Tontine , " was so iniquitous that it was virtually suppressed by law . Let us see how the idea practically works itself out . Every insurant on the deferred dividend plan belongs to one of three classes ; he pays his premium for a few years and then lapses ; he pays and dies ; he pays and survives the deferred dividend period . Let us suppose that he belongs to the first class . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pays $330. a year . He pays for fifteen years ; then is forced by adverse circumstances or other reasons to drop his policy . He gets back $2,784 . This is his so-called surrender value ; it is not a " dividend " and has absolutely no relation to one . Has any " surplus " accumulated in those fifteen years ? Of course ; but it is held tightly by the company . Let us suppose that he held this same policy in the Connecticut Mutual . Again he pays for fifteen years and then lapses . The Connecticut Mutual pays him a cash surrender value of $2,650 . In addition it pays some $1,214. accumulated " dividends . " That is to say , the insured is just $1.391. " better off for having taken his policy in a conservative company . If he had insured in the Mutual Benefit , or the Massachusetts companies , the showing would have been similarly favorable . If he had insured in the New York Life , the Mutual or any other of the New York companies , his annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverted into the general " dividend " fund . Let it be assumed , however , that the insured pays $330. regularly to the Equitable for nineteen years , and then dies . Now , if ever , he should be justly treated by his insurance company . By dying , he has realized the very contingency for which he had insured . His widow receives the face value of the policy ? an even $10,000. ? nothing more . You think she is entitled to no more ? But she is . Her husband , all these nineteen years , has paid greatly in excess of the cost of that $10,000. of insurance ; and she should receive that excess , either in cash or in the additional insurance it will buy . If that policy had been taken out in one of the oldfashioned companies and the insured had left his " dividends " with the company ? left them voluntarily , subject to withdrawal at any time , the widow would have received nearly $2,100. in addition to the $1o,000. ? a total of $12,100. against the $1o,000. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking these dividends in cash the insured had used them , year after year , in purchasing additional insurance , his widow would have received in the neighborhood of $13,000 . That is , had he insured in a company which returned his surplus annually and had died in the nineteenth year , his family would have been just $3,000. better off . The iniquity of the system was well emphasized in the case of a well-known citizen of Milwaukee , who recently died . This policy-holder had taken out a $50.030. contract February io , 1894 . His deferred dividend period ran for ten years. - He died February 4 , 1904 ? just six days before the completion of his term . His beneficiaries received an even $50,000. ? and no " dividends . " Had the insured lived only six days more they would have received dividends amounting to $17,000 . Had he taken an annual policy , purchased each year additional insurance with his dividends , his family would have received about $77,000 when he died . All these advantages he lost merely by dying six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that episode is repeated hundreds of times every day . Sixty Per Cent Get no Dividends at All According to the actual experience of the three big New York companies , sixty per cent of all its deferred dividend policy-holders either die or lapse before the termination of the deferred dividend period . In other words , sixty per cent of all its policyholders do not get back the sums they are annually overcharged for their insurance . Sixty per cent have absolutely no chance  | of getting out whole . If these sixty per cent should take policies in the companies which annually returned their surplus , they could peacefully die without depriving their families of the protection actually paid for in good cash ; or retire from the companies without losing the large amounts they had unnecessarily paid in . Evidently the remaining forty per cent constitute the fortunate class who live and pay . As a reward they are to receive not only their own overpayments , but the overpayments of all the unfortunate who have died and the poverty stricken who have lapsed . Forty per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only their own " dividends , " but the " dividends " of the sixty per cent who get none . Their deferred dividends evidently swelled from these two sources should be enormous . They were persuaded to leave their overpayments for ten , fifteen , or twenty years ? usually twenty ? by certain " estimates " as to profits , officially issued by the companies . They did not insure primarily to protect their families , but to get the large sums of which so many hundreds of thousands of unfortunates have been deprived . They have played the game and have won ; what have been the gains ? Let us see first what they were led to expect ; and how these expectations were fulfilled . In 1873 , for example , you took out a $10,000. policy in the Equitable . What you got was not then described as a " deferred dividend " but a " Tontine-Savings Fund policy . " You paid a premium of $313. for twenty years ? a total of $6,260 . Your agent informed you that by leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? with the company you would get , at the end of the- twenty year period , a cash bonus of $9,556. in addition to the insurance . Your " investment return " ? your " savings fund " ? plus the life insurance , would amount to that much . Your friends who insured in 1874 , 1875 , 1876 , 1877 , and 1878 were furnished the same estimate of winnings . You paid your premiums faithfully for twenty years , and grew gray-haired so doing , constantly having ahead the large sum which was to lighten the cares of old age . In 1893 , instead of getting a check for $9,556. , you got one for 84,365. ? a drop of 55 per cent . You had paid $6,260. exclusive of interest ; had expected an investment return of $3,296. and had realized an investment deficit of $1,895. ? a total disappointment of $5,190 . However , you were among the lucky ones . Your friend who had insured in 1874 in the expectation of getting $9,556. , got in 1894 only $4,105. ; your friend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1895 , only $3,795 . The " dividend " dropped in 1897 to $3,415. , in 1901 to $3,110. , in 1904 , to $2,85o . ! You had not earned these dividends yourself ; they were not your " overpayments ; " they were your overpayments plus your share of the thousands of dead and unfortunate men who had been grossly overcharged all these years . Deferred Dividends Frequently Exceeded by Annual All this time , the old-fashioned companies have paid their " dividends " annually ; have paid back to each policy-holder each year precisely his own overpayments . They have not paid me the surplus that belongs to you ; nor to you the surplus that belongs to me ; they have treated us all fairly and honestly , and given us all our insurance at its actual cost . In spite of this in many cases they have paid in annual dividends to all who have insured actually more than the New York companies have paid to forty per cent . The New York companies arrange , their policy-holders chiefly in three classes ; those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dividends . " Ten years ' annual " dividends " in the old-fashioned companies regularly amount to more than the ten-year " dividend " in the New York companies . In fact , the showing is so much against the latter companies that they no longer publish their results . The same is true of the fifteen year periods . If you took a $10,000. policy at forty ? or almost any other age ? in the Connecticut Mutual in 1890 ? your insurance cost ? the premiums for 15 years , less the cash value at the end of 15 years ? would amount to $776.50 . In the Equitable for " the same period , and on the same basis of comparison , your insurance would have cost $951.70 . In spite of the fact that you ran no risk of losing your " dividends " by death or lapse in the Connecticut company , your insurance actually costs you $175.20 less than in the New York concern , in which you daily ran such risk . If we extend the comparison to the twenty-year classes , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies make an unfavorable showing . Normally , of course , annual " dividends " could hardly be expected to compare favor-  | ably with deferred ; because , as already explained , the latter are swelled by the forfeited " dividends " of the sixty per cent who do not survive the deferred dividend periods . In justice to the annual companies we should compare their " dividends " with the annual " dividends " paid in New York . The Equitable , the Mutual , and the New York Life , if forced to it , will issue annual policies . They pay higher commissions on the other kind ; but still they carry a considerable amount of insurance on the annual plan . Only by comparing results on these identical policies does the extravagance of the larger companies stand revealed . The " dividends " paid by the outside companies , on identically the same policies , are frequently nearly twice the amounts paid in New York . " Surplus " not " Strength ' ' ; Merely Signifies Excessive Cost In a word the biggest New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they boast so largely in part measure the extent of this overcharge . These surpluses , of course , are not properly surpluses at all . The Equitable , in its last report , claims a surplus of nearly $81,000,000. * Of that $71,000,000 consists of withheld " dividends . " The Equitable retains this vast sum by virtue of the deferred dividend scheme ; it is money , which , according to its own claim , it keeps in its treasury instead of distributing among those to whom it belongs ? the policy-holders . It calls this surplus " strength " ; more properly we should call it " injustice . " The Mutual has some $70,000 , - 000. similarly withheld ; the New York Life some $47,000,000 . These companies have these great surpluses simply because they do not promptly return the excess cost of insurance ; the outside companies have proportionately small surpluses because they do . When the Equitable advertises that it has a surplus of $8o,000,000. it brazenly makes public its policy of overcharging its insured . The New York Life , in boasting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $70,000,000. lay themselves open to the same charge . An insurance company with a big surplus occupies precisely the same position as a government with a big surplus . I n both cases the surplus means the same thing . In a government it means that the people have been overtaxed ; in a life insurance company it means that they have been overcharged . One great difference , there is , however . A great government is responsible for every penny of its surplus . A life insurance company is not . Its policy contracts are so written , as we have seen , that it can turn over to the insured just as much , or just as little , as it pleases . The Equitable can pay back to its policy-holders the whole $71,000 , - 000. deferred dividend surplus ; or not a penny . Mr. Ryan , who owns a majority of the stock of the Equitable , could dump anywhere from $50,000,000. to $6o,000,000. into the sewer , and still be entirely able to meet all his policy obligations . In addition to this surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reserves ; that is the amount it must keep on hand in order to be solvent . All above that figure is surplus ? unnecessary amounts collected from policy-holders . Its managers can use the whole amount in wasteful expenditure ; and yet , according to court decisions , no one can hold them to account . Moreover , they can spend the whole amount and yet not endanger the company 's solvency ! A Constant Temptation to Extravagance and Dishonesty And thus the story of life insurance in this country is the story of the surplus . It is this accumulation of the excess cost of the insurance , which has debauched the life insurance companies . Mr. Hyde , Mr. McCurdy. and Mr. McCall have had constantly at their disposal these enormous sums . They have been able to defer their repayment for twenty years ; and have then been obliged to pay back only such small sums as they chose . Instead of paying it back , they have dissipated enormous sums . Did they wish to increase their salaries ? There was the surplus from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make provision for a large number of poor relations ? They promptly set them all to feeding upon the surplus Does Henry B. Hyde need some $600,000 to save one of his demoralized bank accounts from solvency ? The Equitably surplus provides the necessary amount Do they all control certain trust companies which require large deposits with which the stock market may be played and big dividends earned ? The surplus furnishes anywhere from $10,000,000. to $30 , - 000,000. for this benevolent purpose . DoeMr . Hyde need money to rent space and  | furnish up safe deposit vaults for a company controlled by himself and friends ? Why , take it out of the surplus of course ! Is Mr. McCall moved to contribute $150,000. to several national campaign funds ? Again the surplus is drawn upon . I s a fund of some $1,300,000. needed for the purpose of bribing legislators ? The surplus will not mind a little thing like that . Are $3,000,000. or $4,000,000. needed to help float certain untloatable bonds ? Again there is the surplus . Above all , do the companies require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , so that they may bring in more policy-holders who will begin piling up more surplus ? Does the New York Life need $13,000,000 for this purpose above the charges for commissions actually provided in this same new business ? I t is quietly " borrowed " from the surplus . And so on . The companies have no desire , however extravagant and expensive , which the long suffering surplus can not gratify . The surplus maintains Houses of Mirth at Albany ; dines the French Ambassador ; conveys young Mr. Hyde and his friends all over the United States in private palace-cars ; supports an endless array of bygone political hacks ; pensions " rantankerous friends from up the river , " and other custodians of dangerous life insurance secrets ; provides United States Senators with $20,000. yearly retainers ; keeps in steady employment a fine assortment of journalistic talent , ready to sing the praises of New York life insurance . The policyholders slave year after year building that surplus up ; the methods of Mr. Hyde , Mr. McCall , and Mr. McCurdy have contributed quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on each company 's books is the resultant of these two opposing forces . In the last analysis , then , what is the surplus ? It is what is left of the policyholders ' overpayments for " dividend " purposes , after certain extravagant and reckless managements have finished dipping into them . In fact , as will be shown subsequently , the present surplus system was created for this very purpose . Henry Baldwin Hyde , the man who devised the plan , did so largely that he might quietly make money out of his great trust . How Mr. Hyde , by the aid of his surplus , demoralized the whole life insurance business , and induced the present scandals ? this is the story which will be told in subsequent articles .
