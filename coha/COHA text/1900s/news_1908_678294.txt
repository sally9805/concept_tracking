txt Mr. Root for Naval Chairman . It is to be hoped that with the advent of the new Administration we shall have a decided change in the " make-up " of the Congressional committees . Take the Senate Naval Committee  --  Senator Hale . Chairman  --  a sweeping change there will be a benefit to our navy . Senator Hale Is too old . heitts held the position of Chairman too long , e is arrogant in his ideas and ways . and Is really a bar to our naval efficiency . A younger man of ability could be at great help to the Secretary at the Navy In putting the affairs of his department on a business basis and putting the conflicting bureaus under one head and control . The country is sick of reading of millions spent on badly planned warships . Should Secretary Root enter the Senate he would make a splendid Chairman of the Naval Committee .
