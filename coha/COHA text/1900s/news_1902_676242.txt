txt In and about the coal yards of this city yesterday there were enacted scenes unique in the history of New York . It is true that the weather had moderated somewhat from the day before , but the little supply of fuel that families , particularly on the east side , had been able to secure on Tuesday had generally been exhausted . Yesterday the people were seeking more coal and there was very little to be had anywhere . The experience of Alfred Barber 's Sons of 377 Water Street was perhaps the most striking . This firm 's yards were besieged by people seeking small quantities of coal from early morning until late last night . At 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon there was a line of women and children two blocks long awaiting their turn to buy a ticket good for a little pail of coal . The police had to be called to keep the crowds in order at many yards . At Barber 's ten patrolmen were on duty all the afternoon , the number having been increased from eight in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order . One of the policemen said that the people would not listen to reason and that the moment the policemen turned their backs the line would break up . After taking one 's place in line it required about two hours of slow trudging and waitingbefore the coveted thirty pounds of fuel could be purchased . One dealer said that the people were so desperate that , if the weather had been as cold yesterday as it was on Tuesday , he would not have dared allowed one of his coal wagons to go Out on the streets . He said the people would inevitably have attacked the wagon and taken possession of the coal . ' I would not blame these poor people a bit . " remarked this dealer , who has been established on the east side for more than a decade . - The situation is desperate . " said one of the policemen on guard at Barber 's yards . " /f we have another cold snap before more coal comes to the market , I would not be surprised to see rioting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Sons had been ready all Tuesday night to haul coal to their yards , but the barge containing 250 tons of coal for them could not secure a berth at the docks until late in the morning . After that time four wagons were kept going all day long from the docks under the bridge to the yards , four blocks away . I So pressing was the demand for the coal , however , that despite this rapid and continued replenishment of supply the yards were cleaned out between the visits of every wagon . Twelve shovelmen were occupied the entire time filling up the sacks , pails , baby carriages , toy wagons , dogcarts , tin cans , dish pans , soap boxes , and other re- , ceptacles produced for the transferring of the bit of fuel . Strangely enough , the applicants were men in very few cases . Women came mostly until after school hours , when large numbers of children thronged to the place . Old women , fragile women , delicate women , and little children would shoulder their package of thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain and difficulty . The yards of Emil Neufeld , at 191 Stanton Street , one of the large east side distributing agencies , were also besieged all day long . Mr. Neufeld had obtained a small supply of coal and it was being sold by the Pail at about 15 cents a measure . Mr. Neufeid took care of about 2.000 applicants during the day , but he said , when night came on and found his supply exhausted , that the situation seemed hopeless , for a few days at any rate . Look at my wagons standing here idle , " said Mr. Neufeld . " Look at my horses standing in the stables and with nothing to do , and yet people are coming here by the thousand begging me to send them a ton . a half ton , or even a quarter of a ton of coal . I ca n't get it . That is the whole story . I had a barge arrive to-day , but could not get a berth for it to unload , and I will not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city are all rented and I have not been successful in getting the temporary use of a dock other than the one I regularly use , for my purposes in this emergency . I have beets nearly twelve years in the coal business in this district and I have never seen conditions as they are to-day . " Police were very much in evidence at the yard at 105 Broome Street , in the Hoe factory district . Here it was announced that fue : would be sold at 8 cents a pail , though the pails were not so large as those used by yards charging 15 cents  --  such as the Neuit 'd establishment . But the low price and the possibility of getting any coal at all attracted a large crowd to this place . The two policemen who were on guard at the gate had a regular football match all afternoon . The throng which stretched across the sidewalk and out into the street surged and pushed and jostled so desperately and persistently that the policemen were almost tempted to use their night sticks . The crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , children were very largely in evidence . The scene in front of the bin at 58 Delancey Street was remarkable . Here the Co-operative Coal Company had secured a small supply of coal in the afternoon . The news was spread about the thickly populated neighborhood , and people rushed from every quarter . At 4 o'clock there was a veritable mob struggling on the sidewalk and street , and even on the sidewalk across the street , for an opportunity to purchase some of tlaa little supply that Was on hand , THE POLICE HAVE HARD TASK . Several policemen had to almost fight with the people to keep any semblance of order immediately in front of the establishment . There came nearer to being trouble at this place than at any other in the district . The supply was exhausted after a very few hours and hundreds had to go away empty-handed . The little coal yard at 175 Suffolk Street did not get any coal at all until about 4 o'clock in the afternoon .. Anxious inquiries had been made at the place all morning , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of egg coal on the sidewalk in front of the place . Immediately a large crowd gathered , as if free bread were being distributed . Four men were kept busy shoveling the fuel into the pails that were pushed forward . The coal was not even moved into the house back of the street , for it was sold right there on the street just as rapidly as it could have been moved by buckets or wheelbarrows into the yard . This supP/3 ' . too , was gone in a very little while , and the proprietor said he did not know when he would have more . Representatives of charitable organizations reported yesterday that , while the suffering their workers had found among the poor was not very extreme as yet , thousands of families were uncomfortable and likely to be taken ill because of the inadequate supply of fuel . It was the unanimous opinion among those whose opinions were asked that if conditions were not alleviated within a few days , there would be an extraordinary amount of sickness among the poor people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve the existing distress . Commander Booth-Tucker of the Salvation Ahmy made a nersonal appeal to J. P. Morgan to uee his utmost efforts to insure the Army 's getting several hundreds of tons of coal to be distributed at a nominal price to the needy of the city . Mr. Morgan expressed to the Commander great solicitude for those thrown Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . irato distress by the scarcity of coal , and he promised to do all in his power to aid the Salvation Army . Mr , Morgan himself declined to discuss his efforts in.the matter . Major Jenkins of the Salvation Army , who has charge of the general local relief , said that his organization could distribute twenty-five tons of coal a day , while for the past month they had been able to se-cure only about one-tenth that amount . For the past few days they had not been able to secure more than a ton or so . The Salvation Army is experimenting with numerous substitutes , and special efforts will be made to encourage the use of porous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sold by the army at a nominal figure to those in special need of warmth for their homes . A note of special urgency has come from washerwomen . Dr. Nice of the army said that there were thousands of women in New York who made money by doing laundry work , but that they were now not able tie procure coal , and that as a consequence their principal means of support had been cut off . The New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor has concerned itself very deeply with the present condition of affairs . General Agent Frank Tucker said to . a NEw Yonk TrraES reporter yester-day : " The condition which exists is not a problem of charity , but one of business . We have had fewer demands for aid this Winter than ever before . The people are prosperous . There is plenty of work , and but for the coal strike -. his would probably have been one of the easiest Winters charitable organizations Ira ve ever had . . The whole question is . How can the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , get the coal ? The poor are not asking for help . They are earning their wages . They are able to buy coal . But if they are not supplied they are apt to be attacked with sickness , and then they will need help . " The solution of the problem is for the coal opere tors to establish sufficient distributing agencies throughout the city and to supply these agencies with enough coal to satisfy the immediate demands of the people . This is all that is necessary . The situation is most serious , and it is imperative that something of this kind should be done . " APPEAL TO OPERATORS . R. Fulton a ' . ttting , President of the association , had a consultation with Mr. Tucker yesterday morning , and it was - determined that some representation along these lines should be made to the coal operators . Accordingly Mr. Cutting addressed the following letter to P. L ) . Underwood , President of the Erie Railroad : In view of the passage by the Board of Aldermen of this city yesterday of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide $100,000 for supplying the poor of this city with coal , I beg to urge upon you and your associates in the coal-producing properties some action that will make this provision by the city unnecessary . The proposition itself , however well intentioned , is , in my judgment . most unwise . The demand of the hour is not for charity , but for a temporary business arrangement for the distribution of coal in bags and pailfuls to would-be purchasers at a reasonable rate . It seems to me most important that , in cooperation with the coal dealers of this city , depots should be established at yards the most conveniently located for distribution , at which purchases by the quantities above referred to can be made , and that these depots should have favorable discrimination in the supply of coal by the transportation agencies bringing it to New York , this discrimination to apply solely to the variety known as stove coal . The ordinary tenement house stove or range is peculiarly illadapted to the use of other varieties . The buckwheat size burns out very rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it satisfactorily serviceable . I sincerely hope you will find it possible to take some prompt action and to remove a very painful situation and serious prospect . An officer of the Charity Organization Society said last night that the expenditure of the proposed $100,000 by the city , I as a. ; ked for by the Board of Aldermen , would not secure a hundred tons of extra coal for New York City . Just as much coal was being mined as possible , he declared , andlt was simply necessary for the 1 people to be , Vatient . " I am advised , " continued this officer . " that the . Vaal operators will see to it that the distributors amone. the poor are supplied first of all . The retailers will not get large stibplles , but they will not be allowed to remain without any supply at all . There is just as much difficulty in getting coal on the part of those living in brownstone-front residences as there is among those living In tenements on the east side . Everybody is suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the distress this time is not due to a lack - of money . Money is not asked for , The poor people of the city are able to buy coal , No amount of money will do any good . It is simply a question of the amount that can be mined and shipped to this port . " Some question was raised yesterday as to the legality of the proposed appropriation by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment of a$100,000 to buy coal for the poor of tire pity . The Controller seemed to think that such a request from the Board of Aldermen was not valid , and that in order for the hoard to take such action as that suggested It would be necessary for the President of the Board of Health to come before the board and ask for such an appropriation on the ground that people 's lives were in danger from a lack of coal . Corporation Counsel Rives declined to discuss the legality of the proposition . An inquiry was made yesterday as to the disposition of the 50,000 tons of coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan S. Co. had been imported from Europe by the Ship Trust late in the Summer for distribution among the poor . An officer of the Charity Organization Society said that part of this coal had been offered to his organization . " When this coal arrived , " it was stated , " the coal strike was over . Anthracite was then obtainable at $6.50 a ton , and would go much further than a ton of this English coal . which was offered at the cost price of $7.50 a ton . Consequently , our society refused to take any of this coal . Similar offets were made to other charitable organizations , but I do not know how much of it was disposed of . It was never intended that this coal should be given away , and it was never placed on general public sale , except through the regular channels . "
