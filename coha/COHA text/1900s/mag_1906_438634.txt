IF we notice with the naked eye the appearance of the Sun in the heavens , we see that it presents the aspect of a round disk of nearly uniform brightness . When passing clouds or fog of the proper density give the disk a dull lustre , so that it may be directly and easily studied with the naked eye , we sometimes see sunspots , as dull , dark blotches upon the brilliant background . And if the intervening layer of clouds be of uniform density , so that we can examine the Sun more closely , we shall see that the disk is brightest at the centre , and fades away slightly toward the edges . The comparative faintness near the limb is due to absorption of part of the emitted light in the Sun 's atmosphere . This effect is naturally greatest near the edges , where the escaping rays traverse the greatest depth of the overlying gases . The slight darkness near the limb is thus an indication of the globularform of the Sun ; and yet it Was not noticed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of a flat disk , such as it presents to the naked eye , though a few of the Greek philosophers understood it to be an immense globe of fire . When Galileo invented the telescope , in 1610 , he discovered the spots on the Sun , and found that they move slowly in the same direction in which the Earth revolves in its orbit , the period of the Sun 's rotations being about twenty-eight days . Subsequent researches of astronomers have shown many wonderful things about the Sun 's constitution , but it is remarkable that the most refilled modern measurements do not indicate any deviation from a perfectly globular figure . This perfect roundness of the Sun 's figure is explained by the intensity of solar gravity ( about twenty-eight times more powerful than that of the Earth ) , and by the slowness of the Sun 's rotation , whiell makes deleted material , lishinees. like stones and metals , which 60 lip the planets .

Instead of being made up of the element fire , the , stars were now considered to be burning bodies . Yet the various at telliptS to explain the light and heat of the stars by c ? henieal largely failed : anal in 1851 I lehnhollz showed that a great and steady simply of energy becomes available from the gravitational potential of the Sun 's SS , converted into light and heat by slow shrinkage and subsidence of the particles toward the centre . To make it quite den r how this takes place , we need only recall Joule 's experiments On the Methanical equivalent of heal . About sixty years : Igo this eminent Britt-ill physicist showed extwrimentally that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to fall through a space of 772 feet . the heat given up by the falling body would be adequate to raise the temper:1-nm , of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit . Larger bodieswould produce more heat in proportion to their masses : and where the force of gravity is larger than On the Earth , as in the SIM , this would give still more heat in proportion to the intensity of gravity . Nosy at the surface of the Sun the force of gravity is ahout 28 times what it is upon the Earth : and moreover , the Sun 's mass is about . 3 ' 32,750 times that of the Earth . If , therefore , the Sun 's force of gravity is so much larger , and it has a so much larger quantity of matter to fall tinder the action of this force , it follows that the heat ( level oiled in the condensation of the Sun must be enormous . calculate the exact amount of heat developed . We have to make use of the higher mathematics , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whiell we shall discuss more fully hereafter . On the supposition that the Sun is homogeneousoirof uniforinde.ity throughout , and the heat and light radiated away as fast as produeed. a contraction in the radius of 110 feet per annum was found by Helmholtz to be adequate to furnish our eniirinous soppily of light and heat . ' IVe shall see in the course of this palter tint this theory or I telnitioltz is only the beginning of our present theories of the Sun ; yet it has the great advantage over the old theories of assigning a true cause based on established physical laws , and therefore will remain of interest throughout all time . The work of Helmholtz thus marks an epoch in our theories of the Sun , and has been the starting-point of nearly all subsequent researches 011 the subject . But . it can hardly be said that the theory of Helmholtz was more fundamental than that of Lane , who treated of the Sun 's constitution on the hypothesis that it is a sphere of gas kept in equilibrium under the temperature , pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only considered the gravitational condensation of homogeneous Sun of given size and mean density , without inquiring whether it was solid , liquid , or gaseous .

Lane took up the consideration of the Sun as it is to-day , and worked out some of the most important laws for its internal constitution , showing that the mass must be According to the author 's researches based on the Monatomic Theory , the actual shrinkage in the sun 's radius is 2 Ili feet per annum. deleted material : ; art h . We shall recur to this subject again dt ard the end of this paper . . t raining that the only energy given te , t by a condensing body is that derived from the gravitational attraction of the ' tides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the present in the condensation of the Sun would rn it , the temperature of an equal mass of wa ter about 27,000,000 ? Centigrade . As Portillet found by experiment that the annual radiation of the Sun was adequate to t , otti an equal mass of water I.25 ? Centigrade , it followed that the total duration 4 the Sun 's activity at this uniform rate of radiation could not exceed some twenty million years , which very markedly curtailed the past duration of the Earth as inferred by geologists from the study of phenomena of the Earth 's surface . Ilehnholtz 's theory was somewhat defective , in assuming the density of the Sun 's globe to be uniform throughout ; but as a first approximation to the laws of nature it met all requirements , and , indeed , marked an important epoch in the history of scientific thought during the nineteenth century . In Lane 's paper the conclusion was reached that the Sun is really quite heterogeneous , the central density being some 90 times the mean . This result was based upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nitrogen , and common air , in which the ratio of the specific heat of the matter under constant pressure to that under constant volume is lc= 1.1 . The value of k always plays an important part in the theory of the Sun ; for upon this physical constant depend the laws of internal density , and therefore , also , the total heat developed up to the present time , as well as the pressure and temperature throughout the Sun 's globe . The writer has recently carried out the most elaborate investigation of the mathematical theory of the Sun yet attempted , and published the results in the Astronomische NacItricliten , noumber 4053 . On carefully examining the work of Lane , Kelvin , and Ritter , it was found that they could all be reconciled quite perfectly among themselves by correcting a misconception in the paper of Lane . This was to the effect that the Sun 's atmosphere extends above the photosphere by one twenty-second part of the radius . Though it is now known that this assumption is not justifiable , the misconception misled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conclude that the central density of tire Sun , conceived as made up of biatomic gases , should be about 20 tittles the mean density , whereas it should be It little over 23 times the mean . By a different process Lord Kelvin concluded that the central density should be 22.5 times the mean density , while from certain equations of the celebrated French mathematician , Poisson , Ritter found 23 to be the proper number . When it was found by the writer 's recent researches that Lane 's theory , correctly interpreted , made the central density about 23.4 times the mean , instead of 20 times , as given in the published paper of 1869 , it was seen that all three determinations of the internal laws of the Sun 's density were essentially in perfect agreement . The rigor of the gaseous theory of the Sun 's constitution was thus confirmed by the accordant results reached by three independent processes , and there can be no doubt of the accuracy of the final value . These investigations , however , in which the ratio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that under constant volume is k=1.4 , as in biatomic gases like oxygen , nitrogen , hydrogen , air , do not ? correspond to the conditions in nature , where the temperature is enormously high , and we shall consider more particularly the ease in which k=1i . This corresponds to a monatomic gas , or a gas in which the molecules are identical with the atoms , and may be deleted material ; d1111spheres , or 7 nines greater than it 1 . ol the centre of the earth . 2 . The rise of pressure and temperalarc don nward is very rapid . At the centre the pressure is over 11,215,000,000 atmc , pheres , equivalent to that exerted bya vertical column of quicksilver about one tenth as long as from the earth to the sal if all parts of the column were under the uniform acceleration of terrestrial mean gravity . : 3 . The temperature ta the centre of the Sun is about 50,000,000 degrees Centigrade. 4 . In the outer layers of the Sun the density rises steadily , the temperature somewhat more rapidly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result is that at a moderate depth the pressure becomes so great that circulation under this great strain on the atoms is impossible , on account of the friction of the fluid against itself . Currents observed near the surface of the Sun , therefore , do not extend to any considerable depth , and the matter in the Sun 's interior is always kept highly rigid from pressure . Heretofore astronomers have very generally supposed that the circulation extended throughout the Sun 's body . We shall first examine the effects of this arrangement of the density on the Iota ; amount of heat developed in the VOL. 97- NO. 6condensation of the Sun . It will be seen from what is said above that when k = 1.4 , as imagined by Lane , Ritter , Lord Kelvin , and Perry , the central density is 23 times the average for the whole sphere , but when k=li , as in gases reduced to the monatomic state by intense heat , the central density is only six times the mean density . Now , in the theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken to be uniform throughout . As a heterogeneous Sun can be imagined to result from a homogeneous one by the descent of many of the particles toward the centre , so as to increase the density in that region , we see that when the particles have fallen inward in a certain way the arrangement corresponds to the monatomic sphere , and when still more of them have fallen downward , and nearer the centre , the arrangement corresponds to deleted material i n saw that the future duration of the SLa 's activity will be three times that of the past : and therefore we have not yet approached the middle , but are only at the first quarter of the Sun 's career . Thus ! lie zenith of the Sun 's glory lies in the fcture . It has been stated by such authorities as I sort kelvin , Newcomb , and Ball that he future of the Sun 's activity will be comparatively short , ? not more than 10.000,000 years , ? and some have even suggested that the Sun 's activity already slams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case that only one fourth of our supply of energy has been expended , and three fourths are yet in store for the future life of the planetary system . This opens up to Our contemplation a decidedly refreshing view of the future , and will give renewed hope to all who believe that the end of mundane progress is not yet in sight . Not only should the future possibilities of scientific progress be vastly extended , but there will in all probability be the most ample time for the further development of the races of beings inhabiting this planet . According to this view , the evolution of our earth is still in its infancy , with the zenith of its splendor far in the future . If we can not subscribe to Professor Sir G. H. Darwin 's recent estimate of 1.000,000,000 years for the past life of the Solar System , this period being based on the assumed existence of radium throughout all nature , we may yet be sure that the future duration , depending on the energy of gravitation , will be three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps be as great as 300,000 , - 000 years , or one third of the period estimated by Darwin . On the basis of uniform radiation at the present rate , a future of 30,000,000 years seems absolutely assured . This result illustrates the folly of concluding that the end of discovery is yet in sight . Scientific progress appears to be still in its infancy , and the time will not soon arrive when we can adopt any final philosophy:of the Universe . All theattempts thus far made in this direction bare been doomed to failure , and the pulling down of the idols of the past warns us to beware of expecting immortality in those now erected in their places . Indeed , it may be said that scientific progress in the widest sense does not consist of the solution of a mathematical problem , but of a series of successive approximations to the laws of the world , each improvement extending beyond the former , ; old leading to results of greater and greater generality . The goal is not and never will be in sight ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to renewed effort . Labor of Mind and body is a part of the great process of cosmical evolution , and the explanation of the heavens is one of nature 's ways of effecting the development . of the powers of the mind in the race of beings who inhabit this planet . 111 We now conic to one of the most interesting results of recent science . It is shown by the writer in Astranomische Nachriehlen , number 4033 , that I here is it certain ratio between the amount of heat developed in a gaseous mass condensing under gravity , and that radiated away , the exact percentage in any given ease depending on the value of k , which is determined by experiment . In very complex substances , such as the vapor of oil of turpentine , which has 20 atoms in a molecule , k=1.03 : while in monatomic gas the value of k is 1.60 . This last value of k has been confirmed experimentally for the following monatomic gases : vapor of mercury , argon , helium , neon , xenon , crypton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a very remarkable fact that exactly so much of the heat of condensation is retained in the gas , for raising the temperature , as is radiated away into space . This means that bodies like the stars and our Sun , if they are really made op of gases composed of single atoms , have one half of all their 77d / ? , , rent Prorpc.s.s heat from eternity still stored up in their masses . This theorem appears extremely remarkable , and yet the laborious calculations made by the writer seem to prove that this law is applicable to most of the fixed stars which stud our firmament . That there must be some law which causes the heat to accumulate within the bodies of the stars , so as to raise their temperatures , is evident from the naked-eye aspect of the celestial sphere . I 'm ' without such a law the brilliant light of the stars would never develop , so as to give luminosity to the visible universe . On the contrary , the heal and light would be radiated away as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars would never rise in temperature . The result would be that , although heat might be developed and radiated away in the condensation of matter into large masses . yet none of the masses W1111111 become brilliantly self-luminous , as amt present , but we should have a universe made up of dark bodies accumulating no sensible amount of heat . Such a. universe of invisible bodies would seem very strange to us , accustomed as we are to the light of the stars at night . Yet how many of us ever thought a law existed , according , to which one half of all the heat of condensation accumulated within the flaming globes of the stars , and thus caused their luminosity ? It is evident on general principles that some very important law lies at the basis of the brilliant light of the stars , and thus gives rise to the luminosity of these bodies , all of which resemble our Sun in constitution . Not only do the isolated stars shine brightly , but the prevailing principle of luminosity is exemplified by great masses of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in the stupendous arch of the Milky Way , which spans the firmament with unspeakable grandeur on a clear night . Accordingly it appears that there is a law of heat accumulation applying in general to the life of every star , the beat steadily increasing while the body is gaseous , and then slow- in Solar Resrarnh I.y ( lying decor/ by secular cooling , then consolidation sets in , and the light Isghs , to wane . The lucid phenomena exhildted to our naked-eye contemplation are ills ; products of a law of unexampled grandeur operating throughout all space . But how does this law change 11 Oh respect to the time , when the stars pas ; from the youngest types to the oldest . in periods to be reckoned in the hundreds of millions of yens : It is found that when the star is composed of common gases , such as hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , air , made up of two atoms in a to , de . cute , the ratio of the specific heat mater constant pressure to that under constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat developed is retained in the star 1 ' , /r raising the temperature ; and when the temperature becomes high , say 11/01. e 1111111 10,000 ? Centigrade , the gases are &coinposed; into single atoms , so that k ? ti , and only 50 per cent of the heat developed is retained for raising the temperature of the mass . Thus , as a star develops front a cold nebula , it has at first more than half of its heat stored up , but later on exactly one half . For the whole period of the star 's development , therefore , there is stored up 50+r per cent of the heat of condensation , r being a small percentage depending on the length of time and the rate of condensation when the mass is composed of compound gases , compared to that in which it is rendered monatomic by the development of great internal tem pent ture . NOW all our knowledge tends to show that a star soon rises in temperature , so that the first stage of condensation would be short compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up of compound gases is short compared to that in which the gases are monatomic ' . Thefirst period may be only a hundredth , or at most in tenth , of the second ; and W11 may , therefore , be sure that it is only a short time , comparatively , during which the star is storing up 81.3 per cent ; S. that r is generally small , of the order of two or three per cent , and probably never u : poll exceeding ten per cent , for stars of at , considerable size . It would appear Ilwt r is relatively larger for small stars , and smaller for large stars ; because small srars are slow in acquiring high tempera-t tires , while large ones acquire such ten- , natures very rapidly . If the mass were ter , ' small , like a satellite , the temperable would never become high . and thus would become large , about 31.2 per ( lid because the body would never become sufficiently heated to disintegrate into monatomic gas . Such a body could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that word , because all the stars of the same order of magnitude as our sun . Among the stars , therefore , r is ft small percentage , and our law of heat accumulation applicable to the luminous bodies composing the sidereal universe takes the following form : little over one hall of all the heat developed in the condensation of the stars is . shirred up in their flaming globes , and this storage of heat is what gives luminosity to the visible Universe . When We look out upon the vault of the she at night , and admire the brightness of the starry heavens , we are paying an unconscious tribute to this law of heat accumulation , on which the beauty of the nocturnal heavens depends . It is remarkable that this law of heat accumulation should have been so recently discovered . In considering scientific progress , however , we have to remember that few investigators are looking for general laws of nature , because many persons suppose that all the great laws have ; dready been discovered . Moreover , many scientific inquiries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom leads to anything of general and universal interest . There will naturally be differences of opinion as to the degree of rigor attaching to this law , in its application to the Whole life history of a star , but the mathema Heal soundness of the demonstration is beyond dispute ; and in its application to actual masses it will evidently hold true so long as the bodies obey the laws of gaseous matter . Thus it will include in its scope the larger part of the history of the stellar universe ; and even when the masses become so much condensed that the gaseous laws begin to fail , owing to increase of density and pressure within the globes of the stars , it will still hold true approximately . The law of heat accumulation thus enables us to explain the slow decline in a star 's temperature , after the maximum temperature has been attained , and assures us that the heavens must have an abundance of stars slowly advancing in decrepitude . . A.11 in all , it is difficult to overrate the philosophical interest attaching to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application to the naked-eye aspect of the stars , as we behold then from night to night illuminating the vault of the firmament , is fully as keen and abiding . The researches of science have thus made known the law upon which the nocturnal beauty of the world depends , and thus we may view science itself as contributing to the poetry of the starry heavens . IV One other remarkable result of recent researches as to the Sun is that the theory long held by men of science regarding the internal circulation of the Slut is shown to be of doubtful validity . For nearly a century it has been held that convective currents are at work in the Sun 's globe to bring hot matter from the interior up to the surface , and dispose of that cooled by radiation by the descent of corresponding cool currents . This theory has laid the support of many eminent Men , but they probably have not examined the important question of the pressure operative within the Sun , and their conclusions , therefore , seem wholly inadmissible . A system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here imagined evidently Would not work . Some of the views of these gentlemen , however , are as follows . Lane says : " ' The heat emitted each minute would therefore be fully half of all that a layer ten miles thick Would give out in cooling down to zero , and a circulation that would dispose of volumes of cooled atmosphere at such a rate seems inconceivable . " Lord Kelvin expresses himself as follows : " Gigantic currents throughout the Sun 's liquid mass are continually maintained by fluid , slightly cooled by radiation , falling down from the surface , and hot fluid rushing up to take its place . " Young says : " From the under surface of this cloud shell ( the photosphere ) , if it really exists , there must necessarily be it continual precipitation into the gaseous nucleus below , with a corresponding ascent of vapors from beneath , ? a vertical circulation of great activity and violence , one effect of which must be a constricting pressure upon the nucleus much like that of the liquid skin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that the photospheric cloud shell is not a continuous sheet , but ' porous , ' so to speak , and permeated by vents through which the ascending vapors and gases can force their way into the regions above . " Newcomb describes the Sun 's radiation thus : " It follows that the heat radiated from the , surface must be continually supplied by the rising up of hot material from the interior , which again falls back as it cools off . It is difficult to suppose that even a liquid could rise and fall back rapidly enough to keep up the supply of heat constantly radiated . We therefore conclude that the photosphere is really a mass of gas , in which , however , solid particles of very refractory substances may be suspended . " In. stronomisehe Nachrichten , mimber 4033 , the writer has exhaustively studied the internal constitution of the Sun , showing that the outer layers are of the same order of density as the Earth 's atmosphere ; and that the light and heat from beneath are not supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other descending , but by direct radiation , the energy through the overlying layers of rare gas , , like sunlight through the Earth 's att. , phere . This new conception will be tremely useful in the future studies of the spots , faculm , prominences , and other phenomena observed OH the Sun 's surface . But it is only after a long shaft of the photographs now being taken that We can expect to establish and verify thc processes involved in the surface radiation . That they will be of the general character here described admits ut nn reasonable doubt , though there will naturally be great commotion in the surface layers , and the real movements very difficult to disentangle . In his recent presidential address to the British Association , at the meeting in South Africa , Professor Sir G. It . Darwin dwelt on the general theme of the instability of matter . This line of thought has been uppermost in the minds of the Cambridge Physicists for several years : and Rayleigh , Strutt , Soddy , Thomsen . Larmor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements for some particular cases . Thus the dreams of the alchemists of the Middle Ages are already partially realized ; and the whole trend of recent thought has been toward the problem of the ultimate constitution of matter , and especially its slow transmutation . Professor Sir George Darwin says : " The fascinating idea that matter of all kinds has a common substratum is of re mote antiquity . In the Middle Ages the alchemists , inspired by this idea , conceived the possibility of transforming the baser metals into gold . The sole difficulty seemed to them the discovery of an appropriate series of chemical operations . We now know that they were always indefinitely far from the goal of their search . yet we must accord to them the honour of having been the pioneers of modern chemistry . " The object of alchemy , as stated in tnodern language , was to break up or dissociate the atoms of one chemical element kik , its component parts , and afterwards reunite them into atoms of gold . Al ? hough even the dissociative stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chemist , yet modern re , carelles seem to furnish a sufficiently clear idea of the structure of atoms to enable ns to see what would have to be done In effect a transformation of elements . liked , in the complex changes which are found to occur spontaneously in uranium , radium , and the allied metals we are probably watching a spontaneous dissociation and transmutation of elements . " Natural selection may seem , at first sigh red , as remote as the poles asunder from the ideas of the alchemist ; yet dissocia- in and transmutation depend on the instability and regained stability of the atom , and the survival of the stable atom depends on the principle of natural selection . " Until some ten years ago the essential diversity of the chemical elements was accepted by the chemist as an ultimate fact , and indeed , the very name of atom , or that which can not be cut , was given to idiot was supposed to be the final indivisible portion of matter . The chemist . thus proceeded in much the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accepts the species as his working unit . Accordingly , until recently the chemist discussed working models of matter of atomic structure , and the vast edifice of modern chemistry has been built with atomic bricks . " But within the last few years the electrical researches of Lenard , Roentgen , Becquerel , the Curies , of my colleagues Larmor and Thomson , and of it host of others , have shown that the atom is not indivisible , and a flood of light has been thrown on the ultimate constitution of matter . Amongst all these fertile investigators it seems to me that Thomson stands preeminent , because it is principally through him that we are to-day in a better position for picturing the structure of an atom than units ever the case before . " Sir George Darwin then describes the type of mechanical atom conceived by Thomson , and the conditions and limits of its stability , and the physical causes of the slow transmutation through exchanges of electrons . The bearing of these researches on the type of : limns existing in the Sun is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments . It appears from announcements made several years ago that Ramsay found radium slowly evolving helium . Rutherford has since reported it breaking up into helium and lead ; and Strutt announces that uranium has been experimentally-proved to be decomposing into radium . If is passing into radium. and rain-UM in turn passing into lead and helium , the heavier atomic weights would seem to he breaking up into lighter ones . Our so-called atoms are thus not generally ultimate and stable , but compounds of ephemeral type , which in lime break up : and the Sun and stars may be viewed as made up internally of atoms of the lighter sort , so that the monatomic theory seems to be confirmed by the tendency of recent physical experiments . While much will always remain to be discovered , and the theory of dissociation and transmutation is still in its infancy , yet the lines of thought already opened up io philosophical inquiry promise a rich harvest , and assure us that we are just beginning the exploration of the constitution of the Sun and stars .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
