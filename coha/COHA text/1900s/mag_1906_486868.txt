The London Times has been conducting at terrible length a controversy over the circulating library which it organized as a means towards increasing the sale of the paper The used volumes , it soon offered to its readers at discounts renging from 35 to 75 per cent This sales department it advertised conspicuously , describing the books as " virtual-h as good as new . " and - inciting subbcribers to " a glorified form of bargain hunting " It was much like the competition here betv , een some department stores and the regular bookshops , but el , en more formidable , for the Times Book Club sold all manner of books , and many that would ordinarily not appear for years at a discount or secondhand ? Organizations representing the publishers , booksellers , and authors of Great Britain have protested against this traffic , and have even tried to shut off the Times 's supplies of books The quarrel is in some respects similar to that of the American Publishers ' Association with the cut-rate department stores George Haven Putnam expresses a hope that agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues raised by price-cutting and prompt resale of new books as second-hand seem , in fact , to fall less in the category of legal contract that of business ethics It seems to us unfair for the Times to advertise itself at the expense of authors , publishers , and booksellers , by reselling good new books too soon and too cheap , but we doubt if the law will ever take cognizance of the transaction We may only trust that newspapers will maintain a higher standard of advertising than it has pleased " The Thunderer " to adopt We sympathize with the feeling that makes publishers wish to cut off all concerns that will not observe the wise and immemorial customs of the trade , but we fear they have no sure redress except an appeal to the ethical sense of the community It is a just sentiment , however , that puts the selling of books on a different plane from that of selling hams or shoes , and requires something like standard agreements for the protection of authors , publishers , and booksellers The premature second-hand sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of no other commodity It depreciates , in short , not merely the value of the particular volumes sold , but all that may be subsequently printed In this way such an enterprise as the Times Book Club may greatly abridge the period of profitable sale of any book In the case of learned works , for which the demand is slight , a habit of turning them over quickly at second-hand would probably annul all profit In other words , this sort of premature competition undoubtedly tends to cheapen the book trade , and debar from its facilities the best class of authorship It seems just , in fact that every book should have its chance to sell at a living price , before it is dumped on the bargain counter . Arguments that the publishers are interested in keeping prices up , . and pleas for open competition , do not really affect the merits of the question Of course , the publishers are pleading their own cause , but they are also working in the interest of the author and bookseller , and ultimately of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royalties stopped by too sudden popularity with the second-hand trade ; the bookseller properly desires a rnargin of profit that allows him to beep a creditable stock and sell it with the dignity that becomes a liberal piling , the reader , finally , is the gainer by bookshops where there are facilities for intelligent choice and consultation In short , the entire business from the author to the reader is really on a ' quasi- ? professional basis It is , or should be , subject to such unwritten laws as prevail in the professions generally It is not law , but custom , that prevents a reputable physician from advertising , or from practising for a pittance The damage that comes in the learned professions from disregarding their informal codes is personal , and not legal Such analogies make it plain that publishers have in hand a rather difficult campaign of education , which implies , incidentally , the elevation of the character of the publishing trade They must inculcate the conviction that something like a gentleman 's agreement holds all a long the line , from author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader , and of course , the real objective of such a campaign is the reader When one buys shoes or clothes , one is willing to pay a little more for elbow room , quiet , a select stock , and intelligent service The same motives , we are confident , will preserve the old-fashioned bookstore in the face of its bustling competitors But the moral of such controversies as we have noted would be wholly lost unless publishers should realize that wildcat bookselling is not a whit worse than wildcat book-publishing We are convinced that the berated Book Club and similar institutions may fairly be attacked as hostes literati generis , but it behooves few publishers to launch that shaft without much preliminaly searching of heart CHANGES IN THE FRENCH PRESS A French man of letters , Emile d'Arnaville , on becoming the official critic of the Revue Illustree , made some regretful remarks about the expulsion of the litterateur from the daily press of his country This banishment so far as it has gone , is significant of recent extraordinary changes in the French newspaper . Two decades ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restful backwater H. the brawling stream of journalism In the newspapers of Paris , which might almost have been published in Lotus Land , there was an atmosphere of perpetual afternoon  --  of about five o'clock , the hour when the cafe and the boudoir yielded their daily increase of intimate gossip This was pretty nearly the extreme limit of news-gathering No other " scoop " was dreamed of in that artificial but not unpleasing Arcadia The reporter , as we know him , had not been introduced into France The chroniqueur reigned undisturbed And he was one who expressed his personal opinions on  --  well , sometimes on his personal fancies , sometimes on books , or other works of art , sometimes on so near an approach to facts as the fashions , very seldom indeed on the gross material of politics or business A literary chroniqueur might make the fortune of a daily  --  or ruin it by going over to a rival .

The journalist 's task was to show Paris life " across temperament " , and the chief requirement was that the temperament should be strictly Parisian In fact , it was a journalism , not of telegrams , but of temperaments But what polish went with this concentration ' It was the only considerable journalism in history in which form has prevailed over matter .

Present-day references , in conversation or writing , often show , on the contrary , " an unforgiving anger , nay , hatred , toward the school " " How isolated , how embittered , how hard and cold one was made there , " one poet has written , while another author writes " My school-years remain to me , even in memory , the terror of terrors .

This lovely weather makes one so eager to go out and play ! " Thus do we sacrifice to the phantom of an ideal education the Joy of life , health , and happiness He speaks of a teacher who advised his pupils to drink strong coffee at night so that they might work longer .

The New York Historical Society celebrated on Tuesday its 102d anniversary by formally opening the completed part of its new building on Central Park West This fine structure symbolizes enlarged work and influence Representing in its membership chiefly the New York of the past , secluded by the position of its building , isolated from contemporary interests by its dignified traditions , the New York Historical Society has been in many respects a unique institution In spite of the inadequacy of the present building opposite old St Mark 's Church , many members will face the move to Seventy-sixth Street with something like sentimental regret . If there was an oasis in thin new Babylonic Gotham , it was that old building There in absolute quiet and under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delve in the-archives of old Manhattan , lazily survey the effigies of its worthiest citizens of by-gone times on the walls , or , ascending to the upper levels , enjoy the soothing companionship of Egyptian bulls embalmed some three thousand years ago , gaze upon the splendid relics of Pharaoh dynasties , or discover in dark corners fine examples of the old Dutch or Italian schools It was , and is , a rare place , and it will be missed when it is no more But the Society is to be heartily congratulated on the move For years past there have been but the poorest facilities for storing or using the library , or for exhibiting the valuable collections of works of art Meanwhile , the members were moving away from what was once the best residence district of the city , and it was only the zeal of devotee officers and friends that kept the Society 's clientele and work from actual decline .

Similarly , the Lenox Branch of the Public Library has a collection of the early American school of painting that is relatively useless to a library , but germane to the purposes of an historical society Again , the New York Historical Society possesses fine examples of European painting , that are apart from its main work and interests , but would gain double value in a museum of art In order not to be misunderstood , we hasten to say that we are not advocating a general exchange of exhibits , and that we are perfectly aware that all three institutions are bound by testamentary conditions which must be respected . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be made , within certain limits . Meantime , since both the Lenox Library and the New York Historical Society are to be in a transition state while a new building is in progress , it is worth considering if what could not be done permanently might not be done as a loan and as a matter of temporary convenience . Such a bringing together of objects that logically belong together would be a great service to students  --  even though the arrangement lasted but a few months ; it would reflect credit upon all concerned in so liberal and public-spirited a transaction But in all these matters we merely wish to note that the drift is in the direction of cooperation  --  as evinced by the recent alliance between Columbia University , the National Academy of Design , and the Metropolitan Museum ? and to predict that the New York Historical Society will neither desire nor be - able to maintain its present isolated position
