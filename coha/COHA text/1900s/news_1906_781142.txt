txt A cablegram from Gen. Wood in reply to criticisms of the slaughter in the recent battle of Mount Dajo , on the Island of Jolo , together with correspondence between the President and Secretary Taft on the subject , were made public to-day . Gen. Wood 's cablegram was in answer to one sent to him at the direction of Secretary Taft , who called his attention to the criticisms of " wanton slaughter of Moros , " and asked him tO send all the particulars . Gen. Wood 's reply denies that then was any wanton killing . The President says Gen. Wood 's answer " is , of course , entirely satisfactory . " Secretary Taft 's letter reads as follows : " War Department , Washington , D. C. " March 13 , 1906 . " Mr. Dear Mr. President : The account of the engagement on Mount Dajo , on the Island of Jolo , in battle of our forces and a large band of Moro robbers , in which the fighting lasted for three or four days , showed such a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the public press to the criticism that there had been a wanton destruction by our troops of Moro lives , including those of women and children . Inquiries were made of me by members of the Senate and House of Representatives in respect to the matter . Accordingly I yesterday directed that the following telegram be sent to Gen. Wood : " It is charged that there was a wanton slaughter of Mores  --  men , women , and children  --  in the fight in Jolo at Mount Deja . I wish you would send me at once all the particulars in respect to this matter , stating exact facts . " Gen. Wood 's answer came to-day . It seems to me to show most clearly that the unfortunate loss of life of the men , women , and children among the Moros was mostly unavoidable , in view of their deliberate use of their women and children in actual battle , and their fanatical and savage desire that their women and children should perish with them if defeat were to come . They seem to have exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when wounded , of attempting to kill those approaching for the purpose of giving aid and relief . Gen. Wood 's dispatch is as follows : " ' The Military Secretary , Washington . " ' In answer to Secretary of War 's request for information of March 12 , I was present throughout practically the entire action , and inspacted top of crater after action was finished . Am convinced no man , woman , or child was wantonly killed . " ' A considerable number of women and children were killed in the fight  --  number unknown  --  for the reason that they were actually in the works when assaulted , and were unavoidably killed in the fierce hand-to-hand fighting which took place in the narrow , inclosed spaces . Moro women wore trbusers and were dressed and armed much like the men , and charged With them . The children were in many cases used by the men as shields while charging troops . " ' These incidents are much to be regretted , but it must be understood that the Moros , one and all , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradise to be their immediate reward if killed in action with Christian 's . They apparently desired that none be saved . " ' Some of our men , one a hospital steward , were cut up while giving assistance to wounded Moros , by the wounded , and by those feigning death for the purpose of getting this vengeance . " ' I personally ordered assistance given wounded Moros , and that food and water should be sent them and medical attendance . In addition friendly Moros were at once directed to proceed to the mountain for this purpose . " ' I do not believe that in this or in any other fight any American soldier wantonly killed a Moro woman or child , or that he ever did it except unavoidably in close action . Action was most desperate , and was impossible for men fighting literally for their lives in close quarters to distinguish who would be injured by fire . In all actions agfiinst Moros we have begged Moros again and again to fight as men and keep women and children out of it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , and if any evidence develops in any way bearing out the charges will act at once . The President 's reply reads : " The White House , Washington , March 14 , MK " My Dear Mr. Secretary : I have received your letter of March 13 , with accompanying cable of Gen. Wood answering your inquiry as to the alleged wanton slaughter of Moros . This answer is , of course , entirely satisfactory . The officers and enlisted men under Gen. Wood 's coma-and have performed a most gallant and soldierly feat in a way that confers added credit on the American Army . They are entitled to the heartiest admiration and praise ' of all those of their ' fellowcitizens who are glad to ? see the honor of the flag upheld by the courage of the men wearing the American uniform . " Sincerely yours . " THEODORE ROOSEVELT . " Hon. William H. Taft , Secretary of War . " The Senate to-day passed this resolu-tion : That the Secretary of War is hereby directed to send to the Senate copies of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials in the Philippine Islands respecting the recent attack by troops of the United States on Mount Dajo . The resolution was offered by Mr. eta .. berson . It was accepted without comment .
