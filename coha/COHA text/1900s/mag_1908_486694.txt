That the election of 1908 establishes a high-water mark of independent thinking and voting , is , all in all , its most giatitying feature If the returns mean anything it is that the old cry ct " the pai ty , light or wrong , " has lost most of its potency 01 this fact there is evidence on all sides Every one is acquainted with life-long Republicans CI Denicci its who for the fist time supperted candi lates of another patty The old teal of splitting a ticket has disappear ? l  --  witness the exti aordinary variety of ballots which delayed the count in O. io The man who deliberately bells his party 's nominees is no longer st gmatized The respectability of indePcinlence is now well established The wholesale voting against Bryan in the tour States which went for Taft but chose Democratic Governors is , of coui se , the most sticking indication of the progress we have made since the Blame-Cleveland campaign of 1884 The vote 's who have grown up since then can not realize the bitterness with which the oiiginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican party Carl Schurz , George William Curtis , and the other leaders of the movement were vilified from one end of the country to the other In stalwart party organs , like the New York Tribune , they were described as " perverts " who had " set up a new standard of private morality and civic virtue " Such attacks can no longer be made on the armies of those who choose their candidates because of character rather than party tags No newspaper to-day would , like the Chicago Tribune of 1884 , speak of political independents as " brawling Pharisees and canting hypocrites " As a matter of tact , too , the influence and circulaton of the independent newspapers have grown steadily , and it is the hidebound party organ which to-day is held in contempt But the extent of tbe. independence displayed in this election is more significant than the mere vote against Bryan For it must be remembered that , : f there was much bolting in 1896 , theie was then great public excitement , the duty of defeating Bryan was urged as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such appeal The vote against Bryan was not due to any single and threatening heresy It was a

discrimination and judgment had we nothing to record beyond this anti-Bryan vote But many other instances may be cited to prove the emancipation of the voters In almost every State , the man behind the ballot proved his ability to see through the pretences of demagogues , the wiles of politicians , the humbug of partisan pleas , and to act for himself The most amusing example comes from Georgia , which had a Vice-Presidential candidate in the defender of lynching , John Temple Graves Time was when the Georgia newspapers displayed considerable uneasiness over the Hearst-Hisgen campaign But when the votes were counted , Mr Graves rejoiced in the suffrages of precisely eighty-Ave of his fellow-Georgians More inspiring was the success of Judge Ben B Lindsey , in Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt corporations by no less than 10,000 votes The choice in Cincinnati of Henry T Hunt , a Democrat , and a graduate of Yale , less than thirty years of age , as prosecuting attorney , in the face of the opposition of Boss Cox , showed that there , too , the rascals could not carry off a minor office by howling for the national ticket In Delaware , the virtues of a minor candidate were recognized in the hurly-burly of a Presidential campaign by the choice of a Democrat , Andrew G Gray , son of Judge Gray , as attorney-general , in the face of a Republican majority of 2,500 In New Hampshire , Taft received 20,000 majority , but Quinby , tie machine candidate for Governor , only 5,000 In Michigan , Taft ran 127,500 votes ahead of the Republican candidate for Governor ; and in Illinois 175,000 votes ahead of Bryan , while Gov Deneen had but 20,000 more than Adlai E Stevenson In Missouri , conditions were reversed Hadley , a Republican , was elected Governor by 17,000 ,

last spring Indeed , we could fill several columns with cases that are quite as striking Sui ely , these results assert anew the vigor of our citizenship and the essential wisdom of our electoi s They should afford fresh inspiration to reformers everywhere by their convincing demonstration that American voters are exercising mom e intelligence and discrimination than ever before THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY Talk of reorganizing the Democratic party is inevitable after such a defeat Little of it , however , has gone beyond generalities and platitudes These it is , of course , difficult to avoid When you say that , in a country where government by party is established , there is need of a strong Opposition , to which rule can safely be entrusted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated an undisputed thing Everybody agrees to the principle It is only over the application that differences arise Yet we must be concrete ? even personal  --  if we are to get on a single step , and granting that , for its own sake and the good of the nation , the Democratic party ought to be strengthened , the first question is plainly that of leadership It is necessary to decide , at the start , which Democratic leaders are to be cherished and followed , which to be discarded First among the latter , every clear-eyed Democrat places Mr. Bryan The demonstration is complete that his party can never be restored to anything like its old strength so long as he continues to clutch the leadership He said last week that he could not go out of politics , if he wished That may be true , for even if , as has been suggested , he turn preacher and become a Methodist bishop  --  and a splendid one he would make , ? he would still be a politician But there ought to be some way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in advance once more If Mr. Bryan were the devoted Democrat he protesses to be , he would take himself out of the way But since such self-abnegation is not to be expected , the South , in this matter , should take a prompt tically the only ones left in the Democratic electoral column , yet it is probable that nowhere is Mr Bryan mote distrusted and disliked Southern leaders speak of him with the greatest bitterness , yet in three campaigns they have lain down before him It is now time that they made a stand Their plain warning that he can never again have the votes of Southern delegates in the national convention , would go far toward removing the incubus of his possible candidacy Coming nearer home , the need is urgent of getting rid here in New York of the men who have aspired to lead , but who have actually wrecked , the Democratic party  --  the brutal and illiterate Conners , the treacherous and greedy Murphy If these creatures had been successful , they would have remained abhorrent to honest men , defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control In their case , reorganization of the Democracy means something like fumigation Thousands of Democrats would hail the expulsion ot such vermin Some of them , we understand , are already conferring about the best way in which to tackle the job The lately and quietly formed " Cleveland Democracy ' in this city seems to have been intended not merely for the campaign , but for the time of party purification afterwards The work must be undertaken by somebody Just as Democratic success in the nation is impossible with Bryan at the head of the party , so is it in New York until Conners and Murphy be made to walk the plank Signs of party cheer are not wanting in the West In the very moment of repudiating Bryan , the Democratic party gained several Representatives in Congress , with one United States Senator , and won notable victories in critical gubernatorial contests The election of Judson Harmon as Governor of Ohio shows how Democratic and independent votes can be got for a man of ability , character , and steady convictions In Indiana , too , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative to the Republican , when the people desired to rebuke and expel the latter Gov Johnson in Minnesota displayed his extraordinary hold upon the confidence of the best people of his State , by winning his reelection with a majority of 27,000 , although the State went for Taft by 90,000 If either Johnson or Harmon had been the Presidential nominee in place ot Bryan , the story of last week would have been very differ en The moral of their success is the lesson for Democratic reorganizers What is wanted is , first , clean and enlightened leadership , such as Gov Johnson 's or Judson Harmon 's , and then a clear and honest appeal to the average decent citizenship We have had enough of trying to win by truckling to the labor vote , or sc heming to get the gamblers ' vote , or boasting of the support of ruffians On top of disgrace , that has only brought defeat To reorganize means to exorc-se the evil men and the evil doctrines which have steadily pulled down the Democratic party from its prestige under Tilden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow the ins and outs of the battle of the battleships Not long ago it was announced that the Newport conference of naval officers , called last summer to take action on the charges of defective construction brought by Henry Reuterdahl and Commanders Sims , Hill , and Key , had found most of the complaints well-grounded , but had refused to order radical changes because of cost and delay An official summary of the findings , published on Saturday , must , however , have produced on the average man the impression that the plans were , in the main , satisfactory , though in a number of specific instances the critics of the present plans were upheld The fact is that in the designs of the new Delaware and North Dakota many defects were admitted , but to remedy them all would have cost an enormous sum , particularly in the case of the North Dakota , which was launched Tuesday , and would probably have delayed the ships for a year For instance , the conference voted that the five-inch battery of this vessel was too low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet this is the battery relied upon for defence against torpedo attacks Commander Key 's particular plan for the mounting of these guns was rejected , but his criticism that they were also protected by armor that was too thin , as well as wrongly placed , was upheld ; for the conference recommended that in the Florida and Utah , the latest monsters , there be eight inches of armor instead of five And Commander Key 's contention that the No 3 twelve-inch turret should not be set between the engine and boiler rooms , with the powder magazine completely enveloped in steam pipes , was sustained to the extent ot urging that in future designs no magazine be allowed so close to steam pipes The confei ence also sided with Commander Key in the matter of splinter-proof aimor for ventilators and the interior calibre of the main battei y guns as contrasted with those of the newest English ships , and condemned the location of the twelve-inch turret No 4 on the North Dakota and the Delaware As to the armor belt , Commander Key was not supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waterline , and at least eight inches above . The conference voted to place the belt six feet below the water-line , but adopted the following resolution Resolved , That the lower edge of the main water line armor belt should be placed with refei ence to that water line at which the ship iS most likely to float v. hen engaging in battle The significance of this decision appears iron the fact that Rear-Admiral Evans maintains , with Mr. Reuterdahl , that the armor belt was too low , and Rear-Admiral Sperry reported that several of his ships show an overdraught of about two feet at full load Where does this testimony leave Rear-Admiral Brownson and the other chiefs of bureaus who have so strenuously maintained that our vessels were beyond improvement ? . That officer asserted on December 21 last year that the Reuterdahl charges were " ill-natured , ill-considered , and absolutely untrue in all important particulars " , and added his belief that " our water-line armor theory and practice are correct " He will hardly ascribe to ill-will or ill-nature the fact that 90 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criticisms of Commander Key To the outsider , then , the result of the Newport conference seems clearly to indicate that the honors of the engagement rest with the critics , and the votes of the conference advising no alterations in plans of ships now under way are merely a refusal to interfere seriously with their progress and to inci ease their estimated cost In view of these facts , it is vain to affirm , as some of the newspapers do , that the North Dakota is so infinitely superior to the Dreadnought as to make comparisons impossible Her armor and two of her turrets are misplaced , a magazine is encased in steam pipes , her secondary battery is unusable in ordinary trade winds , her armor for those guns three inches too light , her ventilators and uptakes insufficiently protected , her main guns admittedly inferior to those of English ships of her class To apply superlatives to such a ship is ridiculous  --  particularly as she is to have only a twenty-knot speed The English Invincible made twenty-eight knots on Saturday for a period of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only seven-tenths of her power But , then , as we are giving our new torpedo-boat destroyers only 291/2 knots , from three to five knots less speed than the new British and German boats of this type , it doubtless seems to our mossback Navy Department quite proper to have battleships eight knots slower than those of the British Admiralty . THE RETIREMENT OF PRESIDENT ELIOT . The announcement that President Eliot is to retire next March will come as a shock to thousands of persons who have never even seen University Hall The country has come to look upon him as a great natural force , like the Gulf Stream , unwearied by the flight of time , unworn by incessant activity . Yet at the age of seventy-five even the strongest man is entitled to throw off some of his burdens This is not the occasion to review President Eliot 's career as a whole , for he has , we trust , years of beneficent toil still ahead of him ; our pm pose is merely to touch on a few of the aspects of his administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his the most notable career in the history of American education President Eliot would be the first to point out that he was fortunate in both the place and time of his labors Harvard was the oldest college in the United States , it had the longest tradition of culture , it was at the centre of the most higtly educated and thoroughly civilized part of the Union Then , too , he assumed the presidency in 1869 , just at the beginning of that period of enormous agricultural and industrial expansion which followed the civil war America was growing rich rapidly , and Harvard has shared this prosperity Other colleges have also had their part in this general advancement why has Harvard taken the lead ? Why is it the foremost university in America to-day ? There can be but one answer Because President Eliot has displayed in extraordinary measure the qualities of a great leader The graduates of Harvard , in their letter on his seventieth birthday , said " With prophetic insight you anticipated the movements of thought and life ; your face was toward the coming day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a man who sees in the long march of events the coming of the inevitable , and sets himself to hasten it . President Eliot foresaw the coming of the elective system . It had , indeed , already come , here and there , in a limited way . Many educators , however , were not aware of the fact ; others caught half-glimpses of the movement and stubbornly  --  shall we say blindly ? ? resisted it . He perceived the impending revolution and unhesitatingly cast his influence for it He was quick to observe that , with the development of scientific research in its many branches , with the quickening interest in historical studies and economics , in the fine arts , and in modern languages  --  that under these circumstances the old hard and fast curriculum was bound to break down ; that it had broken down . No college could pretend to minister to the intellectual needs of mankind which confined its students to the narrow round of the classics , mathematics , cut-and-dried philosophy , and a smattering of physics and chemistry The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under a storm of criticism he boldly converted Harvard into an experimental laboratory for the application of the elective system That experiment has not yet ended We may not have mastered all the principles involved , we are still overwhelmed by the mass of details to be coordinated and subordinated But whatever final results the centuries may bring , we can say now that President Eliot achieved a success which astonished his supporters and confounded his opponents Practically all the colleges of America have followed the example which he set at Harvard The elective system is based on the-theory that the best educational product is to be obtained only when student and teacher enjoy the widest intellectual freedom , and to this theory President Eliot has adhered with unswerving consistency Indeed , he is often accused of pushing it to extremes The student is allowed unrestricted range in the choice of courses , the professor 's academic freedom has , as President . Eliot himself once expi essed it , been subject to only two limitations , " those of courtesy and honor . " Then , too , in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal . He has never shown that suspicion or dread of unusual intelligence , that predilection for mediocrity , which marks some of our heads of universities . He has selected the ablest men he could find , whether graduates of Harvard or not , and Harvard has thus escaped the blight of inbreeding And all these policies have been carried out with wonderful executive skill  --  keen judgment of men , grasp of detail , foresight , patience , steadiness , and tolerance To find a man who can fill President Eliot 's place is , of course , impossible His attention to public questions and his utterances on such subjects as labor and its rights have made him the foremost private citizen of the United States But it will take a long time for the next president of Harvard to establish such a reputation Even the ad , ministrative work will have to be rearranged ; for the giants who can lift the load to which his shoulders have grown . accustomed are few . Nor are Harvard 's problems all solved . The practical application of the elective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused at Harvard and elsewhere .
