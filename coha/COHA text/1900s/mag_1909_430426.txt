 | WHEN boards could be smoothed only by hand , a man with a plane might finish , perhaps , ten boards in a day . As soon as a planing-machine was invented , a man with such a machine might finish , perhaps , 500 in a day . ( r ) If the inventor owned all the planing-machines , he could hire them out , and builders would pay him a return something between the cost of smoothing to and Soo boards . To give the builder some advantage the inventor might charge for the use of the machine the cost of finishing 450 boards ; thus the one would gain 40 over the old handsystem , and the inventor would enjoy a royalty of 45o . The latter , if the price of finishing a board was io cents , would receive $45 as rent for his machine , and he could sell it at a price that would return him $45 a day , more or less , according to depreciation of the machine . That is , the monopolized machine would sell at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could retain this gain only because he had a monopoly over the machines which represented in permanent form his creative and managerial ability . ( 2 ) On the other hand , should the construction of planing-machines become common property , and thus be obtained by any one at the mere expense of producing them , the price of a machine would at once fall to the sum which would cover its expenses of production . Its efficiency may have remained as great as ever , but its value , when freely reproducible , would fall to its simple cost of reproduction . If not monopolized , this price under ordinary circumstances could go no higher . That is , supply can dominate utility in its effect on price . Thus we may see that a valuation based on a capitalization of earnings is , as a rule , possible only under more or less strict monopoly conditions . Such a method of valuation , however , has played a prominent role recently in the @# purchase of industrial plants by combinations . Mr. Carnegie , for instance , created during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the United States Steel Corporation was forced to buy him out , how much should it pay for the plant ? On the one hand , the cost of reproducing the plant , its machinery , cokesupplies , railways , etc. , might perhaps be $100,000,000 . That sum might represent the actual capital invested . Should the value of a plant be computed as equal merely to the value of the capital put into it ? Certainty not , unless , as in our former illustration , it were a freely reproducible article . If any group of men on the street , who could get together the required capital , could build and conduct a mill as profitably as Mr. Carnegie 's , then the Homestead works were worth in the market only the cost of reproduction . A higher price could not be paid , because a similar establishment could be built at once at the price of construction . On the other hand , we are told that the most sagacious business men in the country paid Mr. Carnegie some $400,000,000 , or even more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts that the earnings in some years had been as high as $40,000,000 . In short , no one hesitated to fix the price of the going concern by its proven , or average , earnings in a period including both lean and fat years . A capitalization of earnings was the method adopted for ascertaining the selling price not only of a steel plant , but of countless other industrial plants in the days since 1897 . Why ? Because Mr. Carnegie 's mills were not freely reproducible articles . They were not freely reproducible , because similar managerial ability is scarce . Obviously , their earning power was due , not merely to the actual capital invested ? for capital in and by itself does not produce anything ? but to the energizing , fertile , devising , inventing , directing and crafty mind of the manager of the whole institution . His organizing and constructive genius formed a productive machine of high efficiency ; his power of obtaining coke and ore ; his knowledge of men and markets ; his insight into  | politics at Harrisburg and Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his invested capital to build up the annual earnings . In the price paid for his property was a large sum which represented the permanent efficiency of the machine created at Homestead . It was a case of a natural monopoly . It was open to other men to do the same thing ; but few there were who could do it as well . A high price , therefore , was paid for a natural monopoly formed by a creative mind . It would be aside from the point to pay only for the capital invested ; for admittedly capital is only one of the factors entering into the production of things of value . @# THE question as to what is an equitable basis of valuation has been discussed in connection with other than industrial plants . Very recently the true method of valuing railways has been brought forward , not only as a means of controlling rates on traffic carried , but also as a means of regulating the amount of railway securities issued , and to afford a basis of taxation . Two methods of valuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a commercial valuation , based on earnings ; and ( 2 ) a physical valuation , based on an inventory , at an appraised value of the tangible property . This , in effect , is but an application of the general principles previously observed in regard to planing-machines and industrial plants . Thus we are obliged to determine the sources of a railway 's earnings , and whether it is a monopoly , or a freely reproducible article . If the former , its value should be fixed according to its earnings ; if the latter , according to its cost of production . Is a railway , in truth , capable of reproduction by any group of men who can control merely the capital needed to create its visible property ? its cuts , fills , bridges , road-bed , stations , rolling-stock , wharves and terminals ? If one had the funds , could one make another Pennsylvania Railroad just like it ? Clearly not . Why ? To parallel it would not accomplish the task . In fact , the actual going concern is a complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capital guided and shaped by men who " bore with a large augur , " A Railways 435 and who have created an individual machine specially adapted for transportation in the particular region and cities which it serves . It is profitable precisely because it is different from other roads differently circumstanced . Each railway has problems of its own ; and if each is now fairly well established , it is because it has had the services of men capable of the highest order of constructive managing ability . A successfully organized railway is as much the result of efficient management as a successful newspaper or magazine . A definite persona has come into being , capable of continuing usefulness under experienced guidance . Such an organization is as little capable of being freely reproduced as anything under a natural monopoly ? like a great book or a work of art . Nevertheless , in the generally critical attitude of to-day toward railways , caused no doubt by conspicuous cases of indefensible " high finance , " there has sprung up in several states , as well as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railways , in order to prevent over-capitalization and unduly high rates . Behind this intention there is a very definite idea that the earnings of railways are attributable in the main to the capital invested , plus the income derived from privileges given the roads by the public . That is , earnings are analyzed as due ( I ) to capital investment , and ( 2 ) to franchises , and that the earnings from the latter should be in some way ? by lowered rates , or otherwise ? returned to the public who gave the privileges . Then , obviously , the railways should be allowed , on general principles , to receive reasonable income on only the capital actually invested . This proposal has been strenuously opposed by the railways , generally on the ground that a commercial valuation based upon earnings is the only correct method of valuation . To this it is answered that no one denies the validity of determining the selling price of a railway by capitalizing its earnings ; but it is claimed that the real point at issue is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and thus forcing a reduction of the capitalization . In brief , it is urged that all earnings due to franchises should be eliminated , that they should not be capitalized or represented by securities , and , consequently , that there is no justice in the  | claim that rates should be maintained at a level high enough to pay fixed charges and dividends on a capitalization which includes that based on franchise earnings . The plan to make a physical valuation of a railway , therefore , is only a means to an end , and a means for separating the earnings due solely to capital from the earnings due to franchise privileges . The real question at issue , then , hinges on the nature of these privileges , how far they give special gains to the railways , and the right to such income . IN this country , a railway is an instrument of transportation which can be constructed freely by an outlay of private capital . There is no monopoly in the sense that only one road can be built between two initial points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete for traffic originating in these two cities , but each one would diverge in order to serve for local traffic different regions in the country lying between the two points . A parallel road is a " freak . " Thus , so far as mere construction is concerned , a railway is not a monopoly . Yet , once constructed , it can not be bodily removed , and no other road is exactly similar to it in work and returns . By virtue of its location it is what it is , and different from any other line . In one sense , it can not be competed with in certain services . In that respect it has a monopoly situation by virtue of having been first placed where it is , since people and industries gather at that place because the railway is there . But in the sense that the price it receives for its service is open to competition in many ways , it has no monopoly . Apart from a quasi-monopolistic position into which it grows with the passage of time , a grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby a quasi-public institution . The power to condemn real estate for right of way , and the privilege of conducting a transportation business , which by the nature of a railway is locally more or less monopolistic , carries with it an obligation to give equal treatment to all shippers . This is the reason why railways are justly supervised , so that the rights of all ? shippers as well as shareholders ? shall be respected . And , since the capital for building a line is provided by private enterprise , there is no valid reason for governmental regulation except to interfere when the rights of some persons are restricted . To this , it should be added that ? even though it is a quasi-monopoly and a quasi-public institution ? the investment of private capital in a railway , of necessity , implies the taking of all the risks involved in the building up of a transportation instrument . These risks are serious and many : the wisdom of making large investments in tunnels , wharves and terminals ; assuming the initial expense for possible future traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old territory ; planning for access to new and even foreign markets ; the stimulation of local industries ; keeping up with inventions and the progress of the age , and yet accurately deciding which project will be a commercial success ; construction of competing , or parallel lines ; losses by floods ; depression of business , which reduces traffic ; failure of crops ; and meeting losses due to unexpected and ignorant legislative action . The privilege of carrying on a quasipublic business of transportation for profit on private capital is often spoken of as a franchise . Franchises are regarded as including " rights of way , privileges and monopolies of location and operation , which have been conferred by public grant . " * Now , in return for these socalled franchises , what return does a railway make ? If it does its obvious duty , it provides prompt and efficient transportation service at reasonable rates.t If it does that , it does what the community expected to get in return for the privileges granted when the charter was obtained . So far as the efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , it is generally admitted that , on the whole , our service compares favorably with that of other countries . Almost all the recent irritation as to railways is undoubtedly due to the belief that discriminations have existed , and all have not been treated alike . If a road does not provide efficient service at a reasonable price , the community would  | have a right to annul the charter , and ? provided it made a proper adjustment of existing investments ? give it to some one else who would . The grant of privileges to a railway is comparable to the general right of private property in land granted by society to its members . Society does this , because it expects , in spite of minor disadvantages , to gain more by giving men'rights of private property than it would by not doing so . When a man buys land for a farm , he expects to enjoy the unearned increment arising from the growth of population and an increased demand for his products . All citizens alike have that right at present . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been given serious consideration , both because of difficulties as to valuation , and because it would render the state liable for losses , if it took away gains . Now , how does this general attitude toward private property apply to a railway ? If it is expected to make a large initial outlay , at a risk as to future profit ? and not all railways by any means are financial successes ? shall its property be deprived of those gains due to the growth of population and wealth which is enjoyed by all other owners of property ? What is there in the nature of transportation which sets it apart from other industries in its relation to property rights ? A railway , as well as a farmer , invests private capital in a fixed form and locality , in order to obtain income . So far as either of these does not interfere with the rights of others , their economic position before the state is much the same . The quasi-public nature of a railway justifies public regulation to insure equal treatment for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trespasses on the public roads , or keeps a nuisance , he would likewise be subject to regulation . Therefore , keeping strictly to a general principle of justice , is there any more reason for taking away the unearned increment from a railway than from a farmer ? If an increase of numbers and wealth increases the income , and so the value , of a farmer 's land , would it be just to make an inventory merely of the capital he invested , and take away from him all his gains due to society at large ? Beyond proportional taxation on an increased valuation , who else has a better claim to the unearned increment ? And this , by the way , says nothing as to returns due to the farmer 's skill and foresight . In truth , are not millions of farmers to-day moving out on to the cheap land of the West and Southwest , paying low prices per acre , solely because they expect to enjoy the coming unearned increment ? Is this proposal to take away the earnings of railways due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of existence the unearned increment from land ? If , then , it is an impracticable scheme as regards the farmer and land-owners in general , why should it be enforced upon one special kind of property created by society in the form of a railway ? Now that the hysterics manufactured for consumption in a presidential campaign are exhausted , we should be able to discuss these matters sanely . So far as they affect his property , a farmer is allowed to enjoy , sell , or capitalize the results due to the growth of the country . If so , then why should not a railway have an equal right ? Yet , there are those who declare that the act of giving a charter by the public to a company to build a railway carries with it the exclusion of all claim to future income derived from the growth of the country . This is what is meant by saying that earnings from franchises should be eliminated in arriving at the true basis of valuation of a railway. * Provided that a railway gives prompt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all , it has made the returns to society that were expected when the charter was granted ; and for the rest should it not stand on the same ground as other property , so long as the institution of private property remains the essential basis of our economic and civil existence ? When the Pennsylvania Railway invests $1oo,000,000 in tunnels and terminals in New York , it takes the same risks for the future ? in kind , although not in degree ? that a farmer takes when he builds a large new barn . Why should not both have the unearned increment ? @#  | As regards the growth of the country , moreover , it is well known that , to meet the new demands for traffic , railways had to be practically rebuilt , with larger and very expensive terminals , heavier rolling-stock , longer and more side-tracks , and the like . In short , the growth of the country has , of necessity , brought about an enormous increase of the capital investment , as to reasonable returns on which there is no dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has the best road-bed and equipment that can most easily obtain the needed capital for improvements , thus enabling it to reduce grades and lower rates on an increasing density of traffic . Thus the rates happen to vary in inverse relation to the valuation . Whether we have in mind a farm , an industry , or a railway , there is another source of earnings which plays a very important part ? one , too , which is independent of franchises . Managerial ability is often the chief item in bringing out earnings from any kind of venture , and it appears preeminently in the earnings of railways . There is here no intention of overlooking the cheating and unprincipled operations of railway manipulators . Their work stands in a class by itself ; just as highwaymen are different from industrious farmers . The existence of sharks in railway operations does not argue the nonexistence of the entrepreneurs who are far-sighted , square , skilful , judicious , and careful of their responsibilities to the public . The latter are not to be overlooked because of the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railway , as in a great industrial plant , the organizing ability of a successful manager has often justly built up a continuing efficiency in his system which goes on when he leaves it ; he has introduced new methods and shown the best way to others ; and the results of his good management continue to add to the income in the future because they have been worked out to suit the needs and convenience of the public served by that particular railway . If this efficiency created by a manager in an organization is a permanent addition to the utility of the transportation instrument , it is a regular source of increased earnings ? the same , in effect , as an addition to the sources of income arising from any other admitted factor in production . Since these results of management have become a constituent part of the whole transportation machine , it is as much to be regarded as a source of earnings as anything else , such as capital . For capital in and by itself is as inert without skilful management as labor would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a source of earnings , the valuation based on such income should as legitimately be bought and sold , either in the form of securities or otherwise , as any machine ? like a harvester ? which results from the brain of an inventor . Consequently , we are obliged to realize that there enters in an important manner into the earnings of a railway skill of management ? a factor separate from , and in addition to , the operation of franchises ; and the returns from this managerial function are distinct from those chargeable either to franchises or to capital pure and simple . And if it be said that the earnings of a railway depend upon " good-will , " " established connections and contracts , " does it mean anything more than that they are due to managerial skill ? That other things than tangible property and franchises seriously influence the earnings and the valuation of a railway may be seen by reference to well-known facts . One railway , with efficient management and farsightedness , gains large returns , puts part of the earnings into improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another railway , with poor management , has low returns , and can scarcely carry its original capitalization . If both started out with the same investment , in course of time the one will have a higher physical valuation due to improvements than the other ; and yet both roads , competing at the same terminals , are obliged to charge the same rates . The failure to introduce all the necessary factors affecting earnings evidently accounts for the theory which supposes that , after having subtracted the earnings of tangible property , or invested capital , from total earnings , the result is assignable solely to franchises . One omission , at least , is the earnings of management . How important they are may be noticed in the particular instance of the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway . Several times it had become bankrupt and gone through reorganizations.  | Finally , the plan was adopted of securing the services of four of the best railway men to be found in the country . It is now a fact well known to the investing world that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Ripley and his associates , has so increased its permanent earning power that the valuation of the property has increased by hundreds of millions of dollars . Nor can this be ascribed either to franchises or to the unaided growth of the country ; those causes were at work when the road was paying little income . The real cause of the change was the policy of the management in first putting the line in good physical condition , so that low rates were possible ; the activity of the officials in building up industries , and developing the country through which the railway passed ; and this aided , reflexively , in settling up new territory . Then , when a part of the country became well occupied ? as in Kansas ? for the very reason that the railway was rendering prompt and efficient service at reasonable rates , all kinds of industries ancillary to a civilized population sprang up and increased the density of the traffic . If transportation had been confined to prairie schooners , such growth would have been impossible . The railway is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of the country is the cause of the growth of traffic . IN the proposal to make a valuation of railways for the purposes of preventing over-capitalization , and also of controlling rates so that dividends can be paid only on invested capital , two kinds of valuation , as already mentioned , have been discussed : ( I ) a commercial valuation , based on earnings ; and ( 2 ) a physical valuation based on an inventory of tangible property . In respect to the commercial valuation , made in 1904 by the Bureau of the Census , * net earnings ( gross earnings minus operating expenses ) were used as a basis of capitalization . The rate of capitalization was obtained by dividing the corporate net income by the aggregate value of corporate securities . The commercial valuation is a market estimate which takes into consider-@# ation the expectation of income arising from the use of the property and its strategic significance ; the growth of the country ; restrictive legislation ; potential competition by rail and waterways , and investment demand . Since net earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on net earnings , obviously such a valuation could not be used as a means of deciding upon the rates charged . The new proposals reject commercial valuation because it includes sources of earnings from franchises , and not merely from the capital invested in transportation . That is , this method of valuation is rejected because it does not conform to the assumption that a railway should not retain earnings derived from so-called franchises , the growth of the country , and the like . On the other hand , a physical valuation is declared to be a means of governing the rates charged . Omitting franchises , the value of each form of railway property is estimated according to its cost and its length of life , and an inventory is made of the tangible railway investment in real estate , cuts , fills , bridges , ferryboats , wharves , terminals , stations , rails , ties , poles , rollingstock , and the like . Hence , the new policy which seems to have been supported by President Roosevelt proposes , if we understand it rightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first place , such a method excludes from railway property the gains from the growth of the country . It is the theory of Henry George applied to railways only , although not applied to other owners of property . In the second place , it excludes the earnings due to managerial skill . In the third place , such a valuation in fact seems to have no direct relation to rates , for the very good reason that the capital is not the sole source of earnings . Finally , the attempt to trace the value of an article , like a railway , solely to one factor in production , separate from others , is an example of questionable economic reasoning . It is impossible to separate the results in a finished product due to distinct factors , like labor or capital , which are both necessary to the output . In a coat made jointly by a man and a sewing - machine , it is impossible to draw a line across it and say that so much was due to the man and so much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a finished article is due to the operation of all the factors necessary to production working together . This gives the ground for claiming that a car , a locomotive , or a piece of track has in and for itself little or no value in isolation , and that their value arises from joint use in a complicated carrying instrument . These objections make clear the reason why the opponents of a physical valuation are able to show in ordinary railway practice such evident independence of rates from such a valuation . For instance , it is well known that the rate on wheat from Dakota must be low enough to cause it to move to the central market ; in other words , the price of wheat in Liverpool has more influence upon the rate than the amount of the capitalization . Moreover , wherever there is competition of goods with goods , or competition of carrying companies by rail or water with each other , the physical valuation has no effect on rates . Quite irrespective of capitalization , the railways eagerly compete for traffic . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight at the lowest rates ; and the wellmanaged road must meet this cut-throat competition without regard to its invested capital . Without doubt , all the recent exasperation against discriminations arises from the bitterness of the struggle to get traffic , wholly without any connection between the physical valuations of the rival roads . Consequently , it is clear why Hon. Martin A. Knapp , Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission , testified before the Industrial Commission that he had not known an instance in which rates seemed much to depend upon the capitalization of a road . The physical valuation is an outcome of many elements which are wholly unconnected with high or low rates . The actual capital invested to accomplish a possible haul of zoo miles varies with the conditions of nature , or with the soil and climate of the environment . The existence of snow , ice , mountains , deep rivers , and the like , might cause an expense of $100,000 a mile , as compared with an expense to produce the same haul in a level and temperate region of only $15,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuation would be high , while in the latter case it would be low ; and yet the former might not begin to earn as much as the latter . In fact , both roads would probably charge the same rates , if in a competitive territory . The one may be a more valuable road than the other because of the density of traffic and obtain larger earnings quite irrespective of its lower physical valuation . Certainly , there are so many instances in which the physical valuation can have no relation to rates that it can hardly be seriously used as a means of regulating such rates . The conditions which work upon rates are many and diverse , such as activity or depression of trade ; the competition of goods with goods ; the competition in international markets ; the probability of obtaining future traffic by opening up new districts ; the rivalry of different cities and interests . In many cases the rate is fixed for the railway by conditions beyond its control and it has no option but to accept . For example , lumber from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low enough to enable it to compete with lumber from nearby states ; otherwise the traffic would not be moved . This is one case in which the railway can charge only what the traffic will bear . The railway opponents of a physical valuation are able to point out that a small railroad in Pennsylvania earned $25,000 in 1905 , but in 1906 , because of the building of a parallel road , it showed a loss of $10,000 . In another instance , the Cincinnati , Lebanon and Northern Railway in the suburbs of Cincinnati earned nothing ; but after being sold to the Pennsylvania Company , it was placed on a dividend-paying basis . As regards over-capitalization , the case is closely connected with that of rates already discussed . Sometimes , as in the plundering of the Chicago and Alton , it is believed that a higher capitalization will be a reason for high rates : but this is seldom the case in practice . The over-capitaliza tion of railways is chiefly a matter concerning the railway and the investor , and has little to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of bankruptcy , to the customer of the railway ? it is a danger to have his securities reduced in value by over-capitalization , the wrong should be avoided by more direct and efficient means  | than by a resort to a dubious remedy like physical valuation . If this latter he the policy of the President , it stands out in bold contrast with the policy of Governor Hughes , who has met the evil of overcapitalization by requiring the issue of new securities to be approved by a Board of Public Utilities . This is a more rational and practicable method than forbidding the issue of securities on the ground of a physical valuation . The relation of the question of valuation of railways to taxation is a separate question into which we need not enter here . Everything depends upon the laws of the separate states . If they tax all property upon the basis of the value of its tangible forms , then railways should be taxed upon the same appraisal . On the other hand , unless other going concerns are taxed upon a valuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equality of treatment is the only rule . In conclusion , we may recall that a freely reproducible article , like a hammer or a plane , would have its value limited by its expense of reproduction . Obviously , a railway in a certain place is not freely reproducible by other persons than the owners , and hence its value could not properly be based on its mere cost of reproduction . But , we also saw that a monopolized plant , practically incapable of reproduction as it stands , would have its value determined by its earnings . To the extent that a railway is a monopoly , its commercial valuation will be based on its earnings . But a physical valuation overlooks sources of earnings properly belonging to a transportation company . @#
