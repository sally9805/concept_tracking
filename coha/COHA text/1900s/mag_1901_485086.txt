The Century Company will print for the New England . Society of this city the addresses , sermons , and poems delivered before it from 1820 to 1885 , inclusive , in two volumes . . We must make a summary clearance of miniature , editions on our table like those of Georges Newnes ( London ) and Seribners ( New York ) , viz. , Milton 's Poems , a longish little book in limp covers , more elegant in binding and the adornments of the text than in the mere printing , which is , however , legible , if compact ; De la Motte Fouque'a ' Undine , and Aslauga 's Knight ' ; and Tennyson 's ' In Memoriam ' ? this last illustrated with decorative feeling by Alfred Garth Jones . From Dent-Macmillan we have , among the " Temple Classics , " Charles Reade 's ' Peg Woffington , ' with Peg 's portrait ; ' Stories from Le Morte Darthur and the Malinogion , ' by Beatrice Clay , with not remarkable illustrations by C. E. Hughes , and , best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' Purgatory , ' with arguments , and the Italian text confronting the English . In Mr. A. R. Waller 's " Cloister Library " ( Dent-Macmillan ) , somewhat larger than the foregoing , we have Sir Arthur Helps 's ' Thoughts in the Cloister and the Crowd , and Companions of My Solitude , ' annotated and indexed  --  a charming volume . John Lane makes beginning of an Anthony Trollope revival with ' Doctor Thorne ' and Barchester Towers ' in plump and quaint form , each introduced by Alger Thorold , and each running up into seven or eight hundred pages . Finally , Miss Wormeley 's translations of Balzac 's " Comedie Humaine " are brought out in a pocket edition by Little , Brown &; Co. , Boston  --  four volumes , at the present writing , rather faint of print , but otherwise taking . The aftermath of children 's books is still considerable  --  if we may apply that term to publications too - late in reaching us to receive mention before the holidays . Extremely attractive is ' Queen Mab 's Fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York : Scribners ) , with its colored frontispiece and title-page , pen-and-ink illustrations ( of good quality ) by several hands , and excellent . letterpress . " An original collection of tales from the literatures of England , Germany , France , and Spain , " it is styled on the publishers ' wrapper , but this does not imply that old favorites like Hauff 's " Story of the Caliph Stork " and " Story of Little Muck " may not be found here . The rest are less familiar . The translations are somewhat lacking in simplicity and fluidity , but they will deprave no child 's English . A very comely book , also , is Ellen Rolfe Veblen 's ' The Goosen. - bury Pilgrims : A Child 's Drama ' ( University of Chicago Press ) . It is a phantasy of Mother Goose 's characters going abroad to see the world , but , while it is sprightly and cleverly written , we have failed to End it amusing . Children may differ with us , however . Frances S. Brewster 's ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George W. Jacobs &; Co. ) is a true story , mostly of life in western Massachusetts , but also telling of a trip out West , of a visit to Niagara Falls , and of civil-war times . The narrative is wholly unpretentious , and is likely to interest . It is well printed , and has several photographic scenic illustrations . By way of appendix are inserted specimens of Cousin Lucy 's stories to the little girl  --  somewhat poetic renderings of classical mythology , with inventions in ornithology and entomology . Real natural history is served up in Edward B. Clark 's ' Birds of Lakeside and Prairie ' ( Chicago and New York : A. W. Mumford ) , with sixteen full-page illustrations in color . Mr. Clark has much to tell in a plain and familiar way of his observations of birds in Chicago , among hills and prairies , often with the camera . He is a wholesome companion for any boy or girl . The same author and publisher send us ' Bird Jingles , ' a thin quarto with larger and more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rhyming characterizations correct in metre and of a pleasant humor . A part of the illustrations reappear in Mary Catherine Judd 's ' AB-C Book of Birds ' ( A. W. Mumford ) . Each plate is attended by an account of the bird , even to its scientific name , and by what the author calls " nonsense rhymes for little ones " ; but they are really very sensible , and much above the average of verse for children  --  witness the witty line ( of the Ibis ) : " That bill , it is so very long Your shortest note must be a song . " The Curious may compare Mr. Clark 's lines on the whippoorwill with Mrs. Judd 's . We heartily commend her book for holiday time and all times . ? To the foregoing , Mr. Mumford adds a Bird Calendar for 1902 , in six gray sheets ; each showing a colored bird . The interesting essays styled ' Animals of the Past , ' by Frederic A. Lucas ( McClure , Phillips &; Co. ) , are somewhat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconnected talks upon extinct birds , reptiles , and mammals , chiefly the gigantic , on what is known of them and how it was learned . The matter is mostly drawn from original descriptions or from the relics , and ( the author knowing pretty well what has been discovered ) is much more accurate than that of most writers who undertake the discussion of the fragmentary data relating to the fossil creatures from the bone beds , the caves , and the marshes . Comparatively few are discussed , consequently a good deal of the text relates to them but indirectly . For a definition of fossils the following is given : " Fossils are the remains , or even the indications , of animals - and plants that have , through natural agencies , been buried in the earth and preserved for long periods of time . " This is instead of the etymological definition , " something that is or may be dug out of the earth , " which has the advantage of Making no restriction to animals and plants , Making no mentiOn of agencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air ' and ' Beasts of the Field ' ( Boston Ginn &; Co ) are attractive uniform volumes of sketches by William J. Long , which , in substance as well as illustrations , are somewhat suggestive of Mr Seton-Thompson. ' s work The author has fished and hunted in Canada , and the side glimpses of his camp-life in the wilderness with the Indian guide Simmo , of trout-fishing , canoeing , and caribou-hunting , add not a little charm to his accounts of animals . His style is highly specific , with an enthusiasm in description that inclines to the superlative ; and he sets the scenes of his little woodland dramas with good effect He uses the names given to the animals by the Milicite Indians , and relates legends heard by him before the camp-fire . The book on mammals is superior to the one on birds . It shadows big game  --  caribou , bear , and moose  --  through their forest haunts , and makes intimate revelations of some of their habits and moods ; and it enters into- companionship with small animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mischiefs Maker , " and the white-footed mouse , " Tookhees , the ' Fraid One , " who repay camp bounties by their confidence . Other interesting sketches discuss the otter , the weasel , and the lynx Mr. Long 's experience with both birds and mammals seems to have been rich in uncommon incidents ; and specialists , who hesitate to accept unreservedly the records of laymen , may regard some of them as questionable . The books are dedicated to the teachers of America who are striving to reveal " a vast realm of nature outside the realm of science , and a world of ideas above and beyond the world of facts . " Mr. J. D. M. Ford 's ' Spanish Anthology ' ( Silver , Burdett &; Co ) is an excellent little book , likely to prove serviceable in the class-room , and of interest to any one qualified to read it . The immense field of Spanish lyric poetry , with its surface eloquence and underlying mysticism , affords an exceptional opportunity to the poetical flower-gatherer . Mr. Ford has been equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autores Espafioles " and other scattered sources with great diligence , and has culled a selection of lyric poetry which , within the limits of space , adequately represents the development of Castilian song . The historical and metrical introduction is concise and skilfully managed . The notes are well done , with enough biographical and critical matter to assist the student in getting some notion of the perspective of Peninsular poetry in its relation to European literature in general In view of the recent and sudden increase of interest in the Spanish language and literature , the book is especially timely , and on the same account the care with which it has been done is the more to be commended . , ' How to Make Money in the Printing Busi- , ness ' has a pleasing sound . It reminds one of those alluring advertisements of boyhood days ? " Buy a $3 press and make Big Money printing cards , bill-heads , etc. , - for your friends ! " Many craftsmen , no doubt , will get this book in the despairing hope of finding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A facetious one will probably lay it down and remark that the best way , after all , if not the only way , to make money in the printing business is to get a few good plates of high denOminations , and run night and day until the Secret-Service people conclude you have made enough . The book contains many excellent observations of the axiomatic kind , and the careless printer is repeatedly warned , by anecdote and illustration , of the pitfalls between him and success . The paper , unfortunately , is of the heavy-weight order , due to an excess of mineral ingredients , and indifferent presswork gives the type the appearance of having made money for its owner for some years . The Lotus Press publishes this book . Nothing betrays more forcibly the passing away of the sailing ship than that new literature which deals exclusively with adventures on Atlantic " liners " and steam " tramps .

In their place we have the vernacular of the " smoking-room " and the argot of Scotch engineers . In this case the dialect is softened so as to be comprehensible to a man of average intelligence . ' The Derelict ' tells of what may befall , at sea , a steamer , its passengers and crew . The stories are pleasantly related , but they hardly attain to the level ascribed them by an English critic , who says that , " in his - tales of the sea , in his pictures of life on reckless traders , in his types of dare-devil seamen , Mr. Hyne is only equalled by Rudyard Kipling . " The compilers of ' 365 Breakfast Dishes ( Philadelphia ? George W. Jacobs &; Co ) have wisely shared responsibility .

Direct accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weird combinations of which this particular dish has been made the victim , the one in the present volume is the most inadequate : Table Talk ca Philadelphia is boldly accused of being responsible for many of the recipes , but whether this is the outcome of malice , or homage to local pride , it is difficult to determine The recipes contained in the volume must be looked upon as mere hints , capable of development at the hands of an experienced cook , ' but bewildering to the untrained young housewife , to whom such a ' compilation should be the more helpful . Prof S P. Langley contributes to the National Geographic Magazine for December an entertaining diary , with illustrations , of a recent visit to Tahiti , with incidental description of a " fire-walk .

Mr Ducarron walked to the centre , and stood , there shifting his feet ( he hadaon thin shoes ) from stone to stone for about ten seconds before finding it too hot to stay " Professor Langley secured one of the stones , which was found to be very porous , and " so non-conductible that a small fragment could be held in the fingers like a stick of sealing-wax while the other end was made red-hot in a blow-pipe . This non-conductibility is evidently the principal cause of the success of the fire-walk ' miracle .

Germany occupies the principal place in the Consular Reports for December , the new insurance law being pointed in full . The most important provisions , as concerns this country , consist in the placing of all foreign insurance companies under control of a special bureau of the Imperial Government , and therefore " on a uniform and much broader basis than hitherto " It is stated that , in the three years before the Spanish war , the value of Hamburg exports to Cuba averaged about half a million dollars In 1900 Hamburg shipped " goods to the value of over $2,000,000 , " and the North German Lloyd proposes to have a bi-monthly service from Bremen to Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports to Cuba for the fiscal year amount to $3,400,009 . ) Some facts are given in regard to " weather shooting " in France and Italy , and a largely increased output of gold in Madagascar is noted , which has caused a rush of gold-seekers to the mines . At the forty-ninth annual meeting of the Wisconsin State Historical Society on De- , cember 12 , the titles in its library were 226 , - 646 , about half of them of boundvolumes . The last year 's increase was 6,712 books and 5,628 pamphlets . A collection of works on a single specialty , the Mormon question ( 2,300 titles ) , has also been depoSited in the labro , ty , and may remain in permanence . The Society has only the binding fund of $30,000 and the antiquarian fund of $5,000 invested , but it receives by direct appropriations $20 , - 000 a year from the State .

It is more distinctly , than the others for home consumption . In size , Vassar outstrips all , and Hulda Parton 's colored emblems of the four seasons compare favorably with Bryn Mawr 's . ? The Massachusetts Historical Society , it is pretty well known , is the oldest society of its kind in America Its membership is by its charter limited to one hundred citizens of Massachusetts , while its practice is to have not more than fifty corresponding and ten honorary members , neither class numbering residents of Massachusetts . Its honorary list is , moreover , strictly confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an international reputation or brought out some work of rare and exceptional value To place a name on its honorary roll is , therefore , on the part of this society , much what the " crowning " of an historical production is on the part of the French Academy . Until its late meeting the honorary roll of the Massachusetts society had latterly contained but seven names . David Masson , Theodor Mommsen , W E. H. Lecky , Carl Schurz , S. R. Gardiner , James Bryce , and Sir George Otto Trevelyan . After careful consideration , extending over several months , it was at the last meeting of the Society , on the 12th of December , unanimously voted to place on the honorary roll the name of Pasquale Villari of Florence . The long and honorable record of Dr. and the international reputation of his Life of Savonarola , afford ample grounds for the distinguished compliment thus conferred . ?

It is a reprint for the third time of the Journal of Madam Sarah ( Kemble ) Knight , who rode on business from Boston to New York in 1704 , returning in December , substantially over the route now known in railroad parlance as the Shore Line . She was a widow , a woman of affairs , well bred and connected , intelligent and humorous , courageous , given to putting down her experiences in verse above the average- of her time ; and this record of her adventures and of settlements and manners along her way was highly rated for its historical value as soon as discovered . It makes also very good reading , and brings the writer nearer to us as flesh and blood than is often the case with her contemporaries of two centuries ago . Her observations on slavery in Connecticut are curious . She found the people " too Indulgent ( especially y ' farmers ) to their slaves , sufering too great familiarity from them , permitting ym to sit at Table and eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , " ? this may have been President Roosevelt 's pretext for entertaining Booker Washington ?

In between , he chats about the early explorations , the Ordinance of 1787 , the settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee , the Louisiana cession , Burr 's conspiracy , and the Civil War . The style , tnough over-picturesque , is entertaining and readable , but there is a dearth of substance . Not only does the volume contain nothing new , but the substantial information presented hardly exceeds the veriest commonplaces of the school-books Large areas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at , while the treatment of the remainder suffers everywhere from excessive generalization The history of the Mississippi valley is certainly easier to handle connectedly than is the history of the occupation of the Atlantic seaboard , which thus far has pretty effectually resisted every attempt to set it forth with unity , and it is , moreover , a subject which we shall probably hear a good deal more about in the next few years , but Mr. Hosmer 's work , though likely , we fancy , to be considerably read , need not deter any one else from entering upon a similar undertaking . ? In their ' Select Documents of English Constitutional History ' ( Macmillan ) Prof. 0 . B Adonis of Yale and Prof. H Morse Stephens of Cornell furnish a useful handbook for teachers and students . Unlike the previous compilations of Stubbs , Protherd , and Gardiner , this volume is comprehen= sive , and it also differs from the same predecessors by dispensing altogether with introduction and prefaces .

In many cases compression has been secured by a process of abridgment ( for example , the Reform Act of 1832 is cut down to the very moderate compass of thirteen octavo pages ) , while sometimes ( witness the Education Act of 1870 ) the editors are content to give so meagre a version of the measure that only its essential features are indicated We are describing the expedient whereby it becomes possible to present so many state papers , or their essence , within such narrow limits of space , and we do not in the least object to what might be called by a hostile critic " mutilation . " The book is simply designed to help those who are beginning the study of English constitutional history by putting before them the most important texts . There can be no objection to translating passages from Latin or French for the help of such readers , or to giving them no more than the salient features of a modern Act of Parliament . The editors carefully disclaim all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose introductions they accord the praise that is their due and from whose works they have drawn considerable material " It is to be hoped , " says the preface , " that one of the results of using this compilation with undergraduate classes will be to attract attention to the interest and importance of the- study of documents , so that more advanced students will turn to the more full and elaborate editions of these distinguished scholars " The date 1485 marks the division of labor , Professor Adams taking in charge the documents of the medieval period , and Professor Stephens assuming a similar responsibility for the centuries which lie on this side of Henry VII . Both editors have exercised the power of choice with great judgment , and their book will contribute much to the sound teaching of constitutional history . =The Monastery of San Marco , ' by Miss G.

Nearly twelve years ago , on its first publication , we welcomed ' Italian Characters in the Epoch of Unification , ' by Countess Evelyn Martinengo Cesaresco ; we are glad now to call attention to a new edition , revised and enlarged , of this admirable work ( London : Unwin , New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons ) . The revisions are slight , but the new chapter , on Duke Sigismondo Castromediano , adds a figure of strange interest and of real importance to this collection of portraits . Countess Cesaresco introduces heroes whom the world outside of Italy knows too little about , indeed , all of them , except Ma= and Ricasoli , who enjoyed international celebrity during their lifetime , can not be studied in English at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence was particularly rich in remarkable individuals .

In Italy , besides the great leaders ? Cavour , Garibaldi , Victor Emanuel , Mazzini  --  there sprang up a group of patriots , differing widely among themselves in station , in idiosyncrasy , in action , and in fortune , but alike in essential nobility of character and in charm . Countess Cesaresco describes , in addition to the three already mentioned , Settembrini , the Neapolitan victim of Bomba 's rigor ; Martinengo , the Brescian aristocrat ; the Poerio brothers ; Constance d'Azeglio , the Piedmontese gramde dame , whose ' Souvenirs ' place her among the shrewdest and wittiest women of her time ; Mameli , the boy-poet , killed at Rome , Ugo Bassi , the priest-patriot , shot by the Austrians , Nino Bixio , an Italian naval version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairoli brothers , the last of whom became Prime Minister of King Humbert . Countess Cesaresco writes of these men with enthusiasm ; she draws her portraits with unusual skill ; and she is able , thanks to her personal relations , to supply many interesting details not to be found elsewhere in print . If the originals of these ' Characters ' had been Greeks and Romans , every schoolboy , as the late Professor Child aptly remarked , would know . their names and glory in their deeds . RIDGEWAY 'S EARLY AGE OF GREECE The Early Age of Greece . By William Ridgeway , MA. , Disney Professor of Ar-chmoIogy in the University of ' Cambridge. , In two volumes . Vol . I. New York : The Macmillan Co. 1901 . The study of classical archmology has done much in recent years towards filling the chasm between the historical and the heroic periods of ancient Greece . The boundaries of the historical period have been pushed further back , and much of the mist of the mythical age has been dispelled . A quarter of a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believed the story of the Trojan War to be only a form of the Dawn myth , in which the powers of the East and the West were contending for the possession of the beautiful Dawn . In - 1879 a serious refutation was needed of the view that the treasures of gold and art found at Mycenm were due to Celtic invaders of Greece in the third century of our era ; and some of the decorations of the Mycenman tombs were attributed by reputable archmologists to Byzantine workmen , although in the preceding year Sir Charles Newton had called attention to remains of the same culture on other early sites- The extensive collection . of Mycenman pottery found at Ialysus in Rhodes , and presented by Ruskin to the British Museum , until then had been allowed to lie in obscurity in the basement . But the archmologists of to-day have a more precise knowledge of the art and culture of the Mycenman age than their predecessors had thirty years ago of the art and culture of the sixth century B. c. , although we are still ignorant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a script , we now know , and scholars sooner or later will decipher it . The Homeric story , instead of being drawn from the imagination with no basis bat a strife for the Dawn , is in the poems , and deserve the epithets which the Homeric poet applied to them . A generation ago , archeologists contended that the poet must have drawn from his imagination his accounts of works of art , for he could have seen nothing so splendid ; while now they say that the objects described by the poet are so far inferior to those which have been found on Mycenman sites that he must have lived in an age of decadence . Scholars no longer find half their old amusement in Schliemann 's belief that Agamemnon was a real person , and led the army against Troy . They are aware that some of the thousands of inscribed tablets which have been found in Crete within the last two years may contain definite contemporary evidence with regard to the Trojan war , though the fall of Cretan Cnossus seems to have preceded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agamemnon to Idomeneus of Crete , or a report from the ' army in the field . No one can safely predict what we may not learn about early Greece from the Cretan explorations , and most cautious scholars are reserving the statement of their theories for a more eom ? plete knowledge of facts . The exploration of Crete has only begun , and we still await from Dorpfeld the final publication of the results of the excavations on the site of ancient Troy . Much , indeed , is already known definitely with regard to the early age of Greece , and future discoveries are not likely to affect materially the main conclusions of the book before us . This book does not aim , like the excellent ' Mycenman Age , ' by Tsountas and Manatt , to which we called attention four years ago , to give either a complete picture of the early age of Greece for the benefit of the ordinary intelligent reader , or a systematic account of the results of recent excavations . It is rather a technical book , intended primarily for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philologists  --  though its style is never heavy , and it contains much matter of general interest . It is " an attempt to aid in the solution of some of the chief problems of early Greek history by the employment of the inductive method . " The first volume treats of the monumental , traditional , and linguistic aspects of the subject , while " the second volume , . . will chiefly deal with institutions and religion . " The first chapter , of eighty pages , treats of the remains and their distribution ; the second , more than 200 pages , and nearly a third of the work , discusses the question , Who were the makers of the Mycenman civilization ? Tho third chapter is devoted to the Homeric age , and the following discuss the early home of the Achmans , the early iron age , the round shield ; inhumation , cremation , and the soul ; the brooch , iron , and the Homeric dialect . That these topics are not exactly coordinate is clear , and some points are brought up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eminently satisfactory . The enumeration of the sites where Mycenman objects have been found , and the statement of the principal discoveries , are clear , concise , and complete . The discussion of the old great trade routes remark that the invaders from the north , whether in small parties or in larger hordes , naturally followed the roads by which traders had gone . The chapters on the development of the brooch and on cremation are also instructive . The author , however , never allows his main thesis to remain long hidden from view , and the whole work is composed to support this : The Mycenmans were PelasDans ; the Achmans who overcame and succeeded them were Celts , who came from Jutland by way of central Europe . Remains of vast fortresses , magnificent palaces , and great tombs , with objects of gold and terracotta vases of like technic , are , found in Argolis , Laconia , Attica , Bceotia , Thessaly , Crete , Cyprus , and the other Greek islands , the Tread , and Italy , and all testify to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. c. of a powerful race which I developed its civilization from that of the stone age . This civilization reached its highest perfection in the Argolid , where still remain the ruins of Mycenas , Tiryns , Midea , and the Argive Hermum . It seems to have been developed from within , though naturally under the influence of the other peoples with which it came in contact . In Attica and on the islands , says our author , it passed gradually into that of the classical Period ; in Cyprus it lasted longest , continuing down to the sixth century B. c. ; while in Greece generally it came to an end between 1200 and 900 B. c . No coins or in -- scriptions in the ordinary Greek alphabet have been found with the objects which are called Mycenman. -
