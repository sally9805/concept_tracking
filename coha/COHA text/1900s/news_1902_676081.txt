txt Those around King Edward continue to be astonished at his rapid improvement . The slightly annoying symptoms mentioned in the bulletin Issued at 11 o'clock last night are quite inconsequential compared to the fact , which The Associated Press has learned , that his Majesty again took food last night and was afterward allowed to smoke a cigar . Queen Alexandra sat with her husband all the evening , and only left him after he had fallen into peaceful sleep . Mention by the King 's doctors of the care with which food is administered to the royal patient and of the return of pain in the wound can safely be taken as merely an earnest of their conscientious intention to make public the slightest adverse symptom , hcwever unimportant , Ths King 's courage and good temper are remarkable , and yesterday he personally Wrote several telegrams and one or two notes . As evidence of the King 's persistent refusal to efface himself from his connection with state affairs , and in corroboration of the statement that the physicians are satisfied with their patient 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Wednesday evening , King Edward then insisted upon a final inspection of the honor list . There was one appointment of considerable importance which had not been definitely decided at that time . The King approved this nomination and gave the final order to the department interested , thus saving one of the recipients of honors from severe disappointment . King Edward is at this hour better in every way than he was on Wednesday night or yesterday morning . The return of pain in his wound is not accompanied by any appreciable increase of temperature . In fact , King Edward 's doctors are incined to regard the patient 's pain and his appetite as healthy symptoms . although . with the reserve they have maintained throughout , they refrain from commenting thereon . To these hopes of a favorable issue of the King 's illness no less an authority than the Queen gives encouragement . Writing to the Lord Mayor of London . Sir Joseph C. Dimsdale , yesterday , to thank him for his expressions of the sympathy of the City of London , Queen Alexandra said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the bulletin of this morning gives a favorable report of the King . " His Majesty 's exertion on Wednesday in opening a number of telegrams with his own hands excited him slightly , caused some restlessness Wednesday night , and aroused some trifling solicitude on the part of the attendant doctors . However , the King soon quieted down , and , on the whole , rested satisfactorily . Improvement in the King 's condition yesterday morning was most marked , and everybody in Buckingham Palace was delighted . The good news given out by the Duke of Connaught at the palace A. fore the doctors ' morning consultation , and which the subsequent official bulletin completely confirmed , occasioned the liveliest , satisfaction to all persons collected at the palace , the- Mansion House , and elsewhere , awaiting tidings from the sick chamber . The absence of ambiguity in the language of this bulletin , which , nnlike previous statdments , had no qualifying phrases , did much to restore confidence in the public mind in regard to the outcome of the King 's illness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the morning . The Queen remained at the Palace , but the Princess Victoria drove out . Replying in the morning to a telegram of sympathy from a body of Aberdonians , Gen. Sir Dighton Probyn , Keeper of the Privy Purse , telegraphed as follows : " The loyal and kind telegram of your association shall be submitted to the King an his Majesty 's recovery , which , thank God , we may , I think , now look forward to . " Sir Francis Laking , who has been unremitting in his attendance on his Majesty since the operation , left the palace for a abort time in the afternoon . This was regarded as a favorable sign . Among the callers at the palace were the Prince and Princess of Wales , Prince and Princess Henry of Prussia , the Duke of Cambridge . most of the special Ambassadors still in London , and many of the diplomats . In front of Buckingham Palace only a slim gathering awaited the night bulletin , and when that was posted the royal residence , save for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the royal family spent a quiet evening , and the number of callers was smaller than on any night this week . Following the expressed desire of the Prince of Wales , the arrangements for illuminating London , which involved the erection of costly set pieces for electric and gas lights , will be allowed to remain and will be utilized " immediately it is authoritatively announced that the King is out of danger . " By the King 's personal desire , the royal Pardons of offenders in the army will go into effect just as if the coronation had taken place . This last intimation suitably brought to a close yesterday , a day which was to have been notable in English history . At no time since the operation on the Xing has there been any serious suggestion of the establishment of a Regency . The most that was done was in the way of pure speculation  --  a suggestion that the Prince of Wales might act for his father as King Edward , when Prince of ' Wales , frequently acted for Queen Victoria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed Regent .
