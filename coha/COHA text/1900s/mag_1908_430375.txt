 |p1156  except those of the very highest character and legal ability for seats on the Federal bench . At the present time the annual salary of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is $13,000 , and that of the eight Associate Justices is $12,500 . The judges of the United States Circuit Courts are allowed a salary of $7,000 a year , and the judges of the United States District Courts a salary of $6,000 a year . The members of the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States stand in a class by themselves . They compose the highest judicial tribunal in the world , and are vested with judicial power in excess of that accorded by any other country to its judiciary . Universal public sentiment demands that the members of this court should be men of the highest character , experience and capacity attainable , and such has always been the quality of the justices composing this great court . They are required by the conditions of their service to reside in Washington . In all social and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government and to the representatives of foreign Powers . It is an inexorable requirement of the present times that they should participate largely in the social functions of official life in Washington . Not to do so would detract from the dignity of their position and impair in a measure the respect and importance with which they are regarded , both by the representatives of foreign governments and by our own people . There is a tradition that John Marshall , while Chief Justice , was accustomed in the early morning to take his market basket on his arm and go out afoot thru the streets of Washington to do the daily marketing for his household , carrying home his purchases in his basket . The difference in the whole style and method of domestic life in our capital city as it exists now and as it was in the days of Chief Justice Marshall is just as great as the present method of conducting the marketing of the household differs from the simple way in which the great Chief Justice made his household purchases . To state the fact plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington at the present day a house and family in a manner commensurate with the dignity and requirements of the judicial position , not to mention the other expenditures that are required from the head of a family in the way of educating children , making provision for the marriage of daughters , and laying aside a sum for the maintenance of dependent ones after the death of the family 's head . It may be the case , and it is the case , that gentlemen appointed to the Supreme Bench have families of young children needing to be maintained , educated and started in life . The salary allowed by Congress is entirely insufficient to permit the usual expenditures for these purposes , and , as a matter of fact , for many years some of the justices have resorted to their private fortunes to supply the deficiency in their ordinary household expenditures and in the maintenance and education of their children . Those that have been without private fortunes have been compelled to economize and curtail expenditures in a manner that ought to be a cause of mortification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edifying or complimentary to the good judgment and spirit of fairness on the part of our Federal legislators to see hard-worked justices compelled to eke out their salaries by lecturing in law schools , contributing to periodicals or delivering miscellaneous addresses before Chautauqua assemblies . The Lord Chancellor of Great Britain is paid an annual salary of $5o,000 ; the Master of the Rolls , $30,000 ; the Justices of the King 's Bench and the Justices of Probate and Admiralty , $25,000 each . The United States are quite as able as is Great Britain to compensate justly the members of their judiciary . A salary of $25,000 a year to each of the Justices of the United States Supreme Court would not be in excess of the fair and just requirements of the position or beyond the measure of adequate compensation for services rendered . It is always the case when the question of salaries for the Federal judges is under consideration that one is met with comparisons between the judicial salaries and salaries paid to other officials , as well as to members of the courts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in very few instances are they of any value as guides . There are elements entering into the problem with respect to the Federal judges which are absent in the case of  |p1157  State judges and of miscellaneous officers under the Federal Government . Judges of the United States courts have no fixed term ; they are appointed during good behavior , which practically means for life . When a lawyer leaves his practice and goes upon the Federal bench it is expected , and with propriety , that he will abandon all other means of livelihood , forswear engaging in business enterprises , and devote himself exclusively to the duties of the judicial office . In accepting such a place the lawyer abandons all hope of the great emoluments of the bar , all opportunity for engaging in ordinary business affairs , and , unless he has an accumulated fortune beforehand , must be contented to abandon all hope of ever acquiring one . On the other hand , almost universally , State judges are elected or appointed for a fixed term . If they live in States having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public approval at a subsequent election , so that acceptance of a judicial position in the States does not require an everlasting abandonment of the practice of the legal profession . As a matter of fact , many State judges , after serving one or two terms upon the bench , resume the practice of law with an increased prestige and with a large earning capacity . All this is denied to the Federal judge . It is not just , therefore , to compare the salaries of United States Circuit and District Court judges with the salaries of State judges in those of the Southern or Southwestern States , where the compensation of State judges is less than that allowed to members of the Federal bench . On the other hand , there is a contrast and comparison which is of some value in the discussion to be found in places like New York City , where the judges of the State Supreme Court receive $17,500 a year , and the judges of the United States Circuit Court but $7,000 a year . If a comparison can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the importance of the questions involved in cases that come before the Federal courts is greater than in those that come before the State courts . The peculiar and exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts over cases involving questions arising under the Constitution , laws and treaties of the United States affects the whole extent of the nation , while the decisions of the State courts are binding only on the inhabitants of the particular State in which the case is decided . The duty of construing with finality the Constitution , laws of the United States and the treaties made with foreign Powers is one of more responsibility and difficulty , and demands the very highest qualifications of learning and juridical sense . Any lawyer who is familiar with the daily work of a United States Circuit judge in New York City , like Judge Lacombe , perceiving the heavy pressure of arguments , motions and trials , and the responsibility of administration in great receiverships like that of the Metropolitan Traction Company , can not but feel that a grave injustice is done by allowing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal judge . One detrimental result of the payment of inadequate salaries is the inability of the Government to get lawyers of the highest ability to abandon the lucrative practice which they command in order to accept the small compensation paid for judicial services . It is often argued by those who object to an increase of salaries that hitherto the Government has not failed on this account to secure judges eminently qualified both as to character and attainments . This is freely and gladly conceded . Probably a majority of Federal judges accept and hold their positions because of the dignity and honor that attach to the office . The same argument , however , could be carried far enough to justify the Government in making payment entirely in honor and nothing in money . What a judge is entitled to is just compensation under all the circumstances , taking into account the experience and attainments that are necessary , the difficulty and importance of the duties to be performed , the dignity of the position , and the fact that when a lawyer ascends the Federal bench he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earning anything in any way beyond the amount of salary allowed him by his Government . It is rather a mean suggestion and a poor justification to argue that a low salary is made up by the honor which a possession of the office carries with it . There are other positions under the Federal Government whose incumbents  |p1158  are inadequately compensated , but these are not life positions ; and with respect to such there may be some justice in arguing that the consideration of honor conferred by the holding of the office may be taken into account . For instance , a Cabinet position , where the salary is the same as that of the Justices of the United States Supreme Court , is held only for a few years , and is sought largely for the influence and honor that go with it . If the Government is to continue paying to its judges only such meager salaries as are now allowed , two results will follow ? the best lawyers , who can command great fees at the bar , will not accept the position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have sufficient money to render them indifferent as to the amount of the salary . The salaries paid to the judges of the highest courts of the various States are , as a general rule , below the amount which ought to be expected to secure , with any degree of permanency , the best judicial talent . The States that pay the highest salaries are California , Massachusetts , New Jersey , Pennsylvania and New York . In these States the judges have a much longer tenure of office than in the States where the salary is less . I believe that an increase of compensation for State judges , and greater permanency in tenure , would secure an abler bench and better judicial administration . The courts of the States above mentioned , where the highest salaries are paid to the State judges , are those whose decisions thruout the Union are held in the highest respect and cited most frequently as authority . Without any ' disrespect to other States , and judging entirely by the reputation in which the decisions of the various State courts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just deduction that the better the pay the better the court . The people of the United States are not mean about this , and there is every reason to believe that an increase of salaries to our Federal judges to an amount double that now paid would be received with general approval .
