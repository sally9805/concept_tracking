 |p766  THE southern coast of Crete is for the most part devoid of good harbors . One recalls St. Paul 's difficulties in this region from poor harbors and the " tempestuous wind caned Euroclydon . " After visiting Gortyna and Phaestos we had brought up to Vianos , situated on the mountainside and overlooking the plain of ancient Priansos and the Southern Sea . The next day we proceeded eastward , with the sea for the most part in plain view . But occasionally a hill or mountain turned our path inward . When we were in plain sight of Hierapetra , which stands on the shore and is in easy communication with the north shore by an almost level path over a sort of isthmus only ten miles wide , we refused this easy way of crossing the island , and plunged into the mountains again , because we wanted to visit Kalamafka , where some day excavations will be made . After passing the night we began a glorious descent to the north shore . At noon we reached Gournia , where our countrywoman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best known person in Crete , was excavating a minor palace contemporary with that of Phaestos and Knossos . She gave us a royal welcome , and since it was a holiday she took us that afternoon to certain sites where she had excavated with good results in former years . These were six or eight miles farther east on Rusty Ridge and Thunder Hill , mountains , we may call them , which towered above the village of Kavousi , in which she found quarters . It took nearly two hours of riding to get up from the village to this high area of excavation . Since she made the climb every work-day for over a month one must give her great credit for pluck and perseverance , if for nothing else . This alone was enough to make her the wonder of Crete ; but her results also were good . The work was most carefully done , too , and gained the plaudits of experienced excavators . Her results can be called minor only when one compares them with those achieved by Evans at Knossos and by Halbherr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are excavating in Crete are ready to put laurels on her brows . The next day , after showing us over her excavated palace , she sent us on our way , telling us of this and that per-  |p767  son in various villages who would be trusty persons to help us . Mr. Bosanquet , the Director of the British School at Athens , was then excavating at the extreme eastern end of the island at Praesos and Palaekastro , in the so-called Eteo-Cretan region . Since these places were a good day 's journey from Gournia , we decided not to take the three extra days involved in prolonging the journey to the bitter end . But one almost always makes a mistake in such omissions . The opportunity is not likely to come again . Following in general the line of the north shore we got into the interior again in the afternoon , pressing through groves of mighty karob trees , and brought up for the night at Kritza , from which we visited Goulas , the most imposing citadel of Crete , overlooking its own little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French began work here , but discontinued it , seeming to doubt whether it were a Mycenaean fortress . The opinion of most experts is that the work has not gone far enough to decide the question . It is certainly very old for a fortress of the Hellenic period . We then struck due west from Goulas , between two mountain chains , the coast range on the north and Mount Dikte on the south . The valley rose as we proceeded , and with each zigzag up Goulas increased in impressiveness . That fortress was indeed well placed . After we had zigzagged up to the top of a col and descended about ten minutes another unique view presented itself . Before us lay a plain of somewhat irregular shape , called the Lasithian Plain , approaching an oval , and we were looking along its greater diameter about ten miles long . It was shut in all around by rugged hights . Anybody could see at a glance that this was a lake bottom and that the several hills on it had once been islands . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverts in a slight degree to its original condition . The sight was so novel that we were reluctant to descend . At last having fixed our eyes on a village called Psychro , above which appeared a large dark hole in the side of Mount Dikte , we hastened on our way . After luncheon at Psychro we made the ascent of about five hundred feet to that dark hole and went in . This hole was once the overflow pipe for the lake that covered the plain five hundred feet deep . At last the weight of water made a new hole for itself lower down , through which the plain is now drained , albeit somewhat imperfectly . The lower hole was probably made at least 2000 B. C.  |p768  The upper hole early became a sacred cave , and the fable ran that Zeus was born in it . This cave was excavated some five years ago by Mr. Hogarth , then Director of the British School at Athens , with wonderful results . Not only were fragments of very early pottery found there , but bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implements forming dedicatory offerings , and especially double axes , the symbol of Cretan Zeus . The fact that these objects had long been in the market called attention to this cave as a place to investigate . After cleaning out the upper part of the cave Mr. Hogarth went clown farther into the mountain , into what might be called a second cave , a great part of which was taken up by stalactites , which in the obscure light look like a lot of gigantic organ pipes .. In among the crevices ' between these stalactites were found a great number of the native bronzes ; a great many also , having become embedded in the stalactites , had to be chiseled out . The cave extended backward and downward , but the original discharge orifice being stopped up , water has collected and one can not go far in . The cleaning out of the upper part of the cave was rendered difficult by the falling in of great portions of the rocks which formed the edges of the cave . The work consisted more in blasting than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen flat roofs , usually of earth , but sometimes of large flat stones . On inquiry why tiles were not more widely used we were told that the art of making tiles was not generally known in Crete . Since Crete is by no means exempt from rain , mud roofs must leak horribly . It is instructive to find out " how the other half of the world lives . " The village of Psychro had two houses with tile roofs , a feature that we had not When we had climbed out again from this bowl called the Lasithian Plain on the side opposite to that by which we came in the sun was nearing the horizon . Our next goal was Lyttos , represented by the modern village of Xidhia . Our path was very crooked , and also went up and down . At last a dark night came on when we were considerably short of our goal . Of course , Hassan , our guide , wanted to stop at a forbidding village at  |p769  eight o'clock , and the villagers reinforced him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we reached Xidhia . We went clear through the village to the house of a man named Pappadakis , said by friends who had lodged with him before to be the wealthy man of the place , a " blooming bachelor " and most hospitable to strangers . It was not a good time to present one 's self without a letter of introduction . He was , however , one of the friendly blondes , and his cordiality was shown at once . His greeting was warm , but it cooled off at the sight of Hassan , who came in a moment later ; I really thought we were going to be turned away . But now came a surprise . There was a wife in the room . Pappadakis had got married just a year before , and the wife proved to be our salvation . With her baby in her arms she seemed to us a madonna when she fixed the matter at once with a few quiet words . The gist of her plea seemed to be , " Never mind the Turk . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then made not the slight est demur , and when he had made up his mind he did nothing by halves . He prepared us an excellent dinner of pilafs , which tasted all the better for being a little late . The quarters were as good as the food . The following day was a grand church festival . I forget just what it was called . The family invited us to go to church with them ; and since the church was on the high hill where once stood Lyttos we wanted to go anyway . So we accepted the invitation with alacrity . Hassan stayed behind with the horses from preference . The whole village as well as a good number of other villages collected at that church . The young wife , with her baby in her arms , made the ascent on horseback , while her husband walked close beside her . I could not help being reminded of pictures of the flight into Egypt . When the young woman offered to give me her place on the horse , for a change , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk unencumbered . It was a jolly excursion . The church , with a standing capacity of about two  |p770  hundred , really had three hundred persons crowded into it . All three of us went in , to please our host . But I , for one , after going clear up to the altar , got out as expeditiously as was compatible with politeness . We certainly got near the people that day . The service did not last much , if any , longer than half an hour . Then came one of the jolliest of picnics . All around the church , some backed up against it , were groups of men , women and children eating bread , cheese and eggs ; and on this day of days roast mutton and roast pork . They washed all this down with copious drafts of strong red wine . The officiating priest was the most urgent of all in his invitations to drink and celebrate the festival . " A stranger who wished to meet these cordial people half way had to take small sips from his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But none of the villagers , who certainly drank a good deal , was incapacitated from joining the dance that followed on the green sward . We had intended to stay an hour and then continue our journey ; but we were constrained to stay there three hours , taking now and then a stolen look at the remains of old Lyttos , which , tho magnificently placed , are not in themselves very impressive . It was easy to pick up coins by the handful . It was noon when we mounted again to ride to Knossos . There is after all no feature of travel more interesting than the ways of the people . Mountains and ruins were the object of our quest , but men and their human habits kept coming in and dividing our attention . The language which we had learned in Greece did not cover entirely the Cretan vocabulary . At one point in our journey we asked a Cretan in the best Greek whether we should turn to the right or to the left . The man did not understand the word apLQTspa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " it was the English word for paba . " We got many scraps of philology as we went along . But more important than language was " the human heart by which we live . " The Cretans seemed to be a very warmhearted people . At several places , as we mounted to start off , the people gave us flowers , with wishes for a fine journey . It was a long ride from Lyttos to Herakleion , up and down , over ridge after ridge . We were soon comparatively near the sea , where the streams flowing down from the interior had furrowed the land in a direction at right angles to our course . It was toward evening when , after a brisk canter , we passed Knossos . After Phaestos I could hardly believe that this low hill , surrounded by higher hills , could really be Knossos . But the British flag waved over the excavations , and there could be no mistake . We deferred tasting British hospitality until the next day and pressed on to Herakleion , through the fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mount Dikte.
