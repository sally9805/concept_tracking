txt Men who control three combinations of poolrooms in Manhattan , at a meeting yesterday decided to break away from the regular gam bling syndicate , which has headquarters in a downtown office building . It is expected that others will revolt within a few days unless they receit'ee satisfactory assurance that they are to be accorded the protection pledged previous to election , when the gambling interests contributed a sum , said to be about 8300,000 , to Tammany 's campaign fund . The men who met yesterday planned an informal union for mutual protection , but decided to have one of their number maintain active communication with the big syndicate , 1n order to derive any possible benefits from " inside information " until another big assessment should be levied . Such an assessment , it was decided , they would not nay . It also was determined rot to retain any more syndicate lawyers . One man alto attended the meeting declared he had been paying out more " graft " money since election day than-he had even paid in the old days , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain . " In the old days , " he said , " we simply paid our monthly assessment and then staked the precinct ward men to a loan of S5 or S10 , in addition to allowing them to put up markers for their bets , but in the long run we got most of this money back , for the ward men plunged their salaries around the first of the month , when they got paid . Then we kept wide open and did a good business . But now we have been assessed for the campaign fund and for the private detectives who have been employed by the syndicate , and ssIto have been faking the syndicate with *false rumors , and we are giving up to the ? Johnny-on-the-spot ' men , who bring around wild tips , and still handing out fives and tens to regular patrolmen , who Pretend to have inside information of what is about to happen . KNOW ALL ABOL7T IT . " And when a real raid is to come off the syndicate lawyers know more about It than the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? They get a fat fee of $200 or WO , and sometimes $500 , for defending us . The Judges are aware of the fact that no poolroom in New York could keep open twentyfour hours if the public stopped patronzing them . The Judges know that the law against bookmaking in poolrooms is unjust . They know , too , that the tipping lawyers and other fakirs pretending to be our friends are really our worst enemies . We are fleeced on every side because we are trying to make an honest dollar . I say an honest dollar because I was brought up a gambler , and will always remain a gambler . No one can stop the American public from gambling . Many of the best known citizens in New York bet in the poolrooms , and if we could put the matter in the proper light I am sure open poolrooms would be advocated by the press of New York . and the State Legislature would pass a law practically permitting them to open . " Of course , I am not saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that the State Constitution prohibits gambling , but the race track people got over it and so can we . " The information which the gamblers of New York are in receipt of to-day regarding the true situation is such as to puzzle all of us , In the first place , a district leader tells us to lie low and wait until the middle of February , when , he says , we will he permitted to run with open doors : Then comes the statement from District Attorney Jerome that he is going to keep up the crusade against gambling . That will frighten the Police Captains into closing us up . " Judge Cowing , from the bench , declares he will fine poolroom keepers for the first offense , but will send them to prison for a second offense . Aside from this we get the story that Commissioner told a friend that in case an attempt ' was made to prevent him from closing up poolrooms and gambling houses he , , would resign . From another source we get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metropolitan district race tracks open . But we are practically told that Tammany will shut off gambling in New York until after next election day . This is the most reliable information we have yet received . It comes from a source that ought to know the inside facts . But if we are compelled to close down until Spring Mr. will resign then rather than permit us to open up again . " So all we can hope for is legislation at Albany , and in return for that throw New York into the hands of the Republicans next Fall They can help us , and we can help them . There is one way it can be done : Repeal the present poolroom law , and pass a law prohibiting gambling , making the penalty a small fine . . I am not a lawyer , but it seems to me that the Legislature can give us relief by passing such a law . Then we could take chances on violations the same as the liquor dealer takes now . The police will tire of arresting and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a poolroom law , with a fine for a penalty , would also be a dead one . Such a law could be passed without either party committing itself , some members of each party voting for it . NO MORE BIG CONTRIBUTIONS . " Our meeting to-day was of little interest to any one but ourselves . Ile agreed to chip in for expenses whenever a member is arrested , but in future will not give up large sums to a lot of grafters , who for years have been bunkoing us right and left . As to the administration , let me say that it has decided to give saloons as much leeway as they need to do Sunday business . Just go around town to-day and see . Every barroom in town excepting those in the banking or dry goods districts is as wide open almost as it usually is on week days . " This was practically true so far as the saloons were concerned . There was practically no attempt made to enforce the excise law in any precinct . In cases where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon man had to be on his guard , with a chain on his side door . But such cases were few . Many saloons which had been kept closed tightly on Sundays during the time Mr. Low was Mayor opened up for Sunday trade yesterday for the first time in two years . They made no pretense to keep their side doors locked , but served every one who came along , excepting probably the agents of the new excise league which was recently organized . This league riad ten agents out looking for evidence Yesterday . Members of the Liquor Dealers ' Association , however , had a description of each agent , and kept a sharp lookout for them all day . In two cases men suspected of being agents of the new league were pushed into the street , and the doors locked after them . Ex-Assistant Pistrict Attorney Walsh , counsel for the liquor dealers , denounced ? the agents of the new league , saying they had other purposes than those of enforcing the law . He added that all of the liquor dealers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any person representing himself to be a member or agent of any league or society . Within a few days . Mr. Walsh said , the liquor dealers would strike back at the new league in a way that would bring the matter to the attention of the Judges in the criminal courts . Forty-nine excise arrests were made in the greater city yesterday-45 being in Manhattan , 2 in the Bronx , and 1 each in Brooklyn and Queens . A week ago there were but 26 arrests , all in Manhattan . The arrests yesterday in Manhattan and the Bronx by stations were as follows : Church Street , 1 ; Oak Street , 2 : Madison Street , 3 : Charles Street , 1 ; Macdougal Street , 1 ; Mulberry Street , 2 : Eldridge Street , 1 ; Delancey Street , 1 ; Union Market . 3 ; Fifth Street , , 5 ; Mercer Street , 2 ; West Twentieth Street , 1 ; East Twentysecond Street , 1 ; West Thirtieth Street . 2 ; " West Thirty-seventh Street , 4 ; East Thirty-fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Fifty-first Street , 1 : East Sixty-seventh Street , -s ; West Sixty-eighth Street , 2 ; East Eighty-eighth Street , West One Hundredth Street , 1 : West One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street , 1 ; Westchester , 1 , and Bronx Park , 1 .
