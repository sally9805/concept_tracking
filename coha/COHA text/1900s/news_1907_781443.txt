txt Three subway routes in the ' lower part of the city have been approved by the Commissioners appointed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court to consider their advisability . One has been disapproved . Charles Bulkley Hubbell , Harry W. Alden , and Warren Leslie were the Commissioners , and presented their report yesterday . The routes were laid down by the Board of Rapid Transit and have passed the Board of Estimate and Apportionment . As the abutting property owners did not consent , the Appellate Division named the commission . If it approves of their findings , it will consent.to the construction of the lines . But as several schemes for effecting the same object  --  the relief of transportation conditions  --  are under consideration by different commissions , the approval of this report by the court will not take from the Board of Rapid T:ansit Commissioners the ultimate decis:on as to what subways shall be cons tructeC . The board will still have the power to build all or none of those approved by tile court The first route approved is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Williamsburg Bridge , through Delancey Street to Centre Street , and thence to a " suitable point under the proposed terminal of the Brooklyn Bridge . " It has three spurs ; the first from Centre Street , under Grand and Desbrosses Streets to West Street ; the second from Centre Street , under Canal Street to the Manhattan terminal of the Manhattan Bridge , now under construction ; the third from the southern terminus of the loop under William Street to Beekman Street .  - -  It is hoped that this line will add to the facilities for reaching Brooklyn ; its spurs will intersect all ' the north and south lines of transportation . The spur to Beekman Street will give facilities for switching cars on two of the four tracks under Centre Street , and will give a means of approach to the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges to persons in business in the lower parts of the city . deleted 2 paragraphs The commission , however , decides - against the William Street route upon the question of the nature of the ground through which it would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beekman and William Streets , the end of the southerly spur of the Bridge loop , and pass under William Street and Old Slip to the tunnel to Brooklyn , making the Same . connection with the Brooklyn - sub- ways , as the Beekman Street and Maiden Lame routes . It has been found , however , that William Street is too narrow and- its soil too treacherous , and that , if extensive excavations were undertaken , the buildings on either side would be exposed to the gravest danger , and that in particular it would be almost impossible to avoid ruining the Kuhn-Loeb block and 68 William Street . The Commissioners say that the street is oply from 39 to 40 feet wide . and that ther4 .. is a layer of quicksand throughout a largt part of its area , about 30 feet in depth and from 12 to 15 feet below the surface . Moreover , in many places the soil is saturated with water , which in some places is affected by the rise and fall of the tide . Some of the large buildings rest upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all the older ones . and some of the new ones , including the KuhnLoeb Building and 68 William Street , depend for their support on floating or spread-foot foundations ; that is to say , the bases-of their piers have been enlarged , so as to give a sufficient bearing surface upon the quicksand , ' and they rest upon this unstable material itself . In addition , the Commissioners fear that even in the case of buildings set upon piles damage might be done by constructing a tunnel . The piers depend upon their friction with the surrounding material , and if this was diminished there might be a settlement . Engineering experts of eminence were consulted about these difficulties , and all agreed in declaring that the proposal to build a subway along a , street so narrow and with buildings of such a character as William Street was extraordinary . Daniel E. Moran , a graduate of Columbia , who has had much experience in foundation work in the William Street district . declared that the work was practically impossible . Every building along the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of actual collapse , and he could not see how the Kuhn-Loeb Building and 68 William Street could be saved at all . - Samuel C. Weiskopf concurred with him , but Chief Engineer Rice , Theodore Cooper , and Charles Sooysmith , on behalf of the Rapid Transit Board , thought the construction possible . Mr. Cooper admitted that the " scars of war ' in the shape of cracks in the buildings would be produced . Mr. Sooysmith thought that by the use of either the freezing process , by which the moist material on either side of the cut was frozen into a solid wall , or the . extensive use of caissons all along the route , the construction would be feasible . The commission learned that neither of these methods had been ever successfully used on a large scale in this country , and as the assessed value of the property on William Street is 833,000,000 and as the other routes recommended would probably be sufficient , they have decided not to support the William Street line . deleted 2 paragraphs      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
