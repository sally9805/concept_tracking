txt CHECKING SOCIALISM . Old Soldier Turned Socialist . Per many years I have been a Republican , but this year I shall vote the Socialist ticket for the following reasons : Because year after year , aided by a high protective tariff and in order to pay dividends on watered securities , the trusts have beet : putting up prices until it is now impossible for a workingman to make ends meet and provide a he should against a possible time of need . Because neither the Democratic nor Republican Party can be expected to do anything along the line of trust curbing , each of them being about equally interested In its own continuance , Because I do not believe in a system which makes it possible for one set of people to indulge in monkey dinners , butterfly and canary bird balls , Salome parties , &c.,; while tens of thousands more worthy than they are homeless , hungry , and almost naked . Because I prefer the Golden Rule to the Rule of Gold .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
