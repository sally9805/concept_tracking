 |p1299  EVERY new and popular device exercises more or less tyranny . The mob spirit is generated and people hasten to chant the praises of the idol for fear of being called " reactionaries , " a curious class who are supposed to be capable of all sorts of contemptible acts . Yet merchants have to pause occasionally to " take stock " in order to find out just what their condition at the moment is , and there is nothing really eccentric in whispering a few doubts in the midst of a general chorus of adulation . At the moment I am thinking of automobiles . The advertising columns of the papers contain daily hymns to them . ' The proceedings of motor clubs are set forth at length . Our magazines teem with " motor flights " and astonishing tours and articles upon the romance of motoring . All is harmony and enthusiasm . Only at rare intervals does same miserable " Pro Bono Publico " or " Indignant Citizen " raise an anonymous howl in the correspondence column of his favorite paper , cursing automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comprehensive pro test seems to have been made by citizens of Brussels , who are reported to have petitioned the authorities to assemble all the cars in the city and destroy them in one picturesque conflagration . But that was an isolated case . . Now it may be that a motor age , like a species of new Augustan Age , is about to dawn if aviation or some other novelty does not strangle it in its birth , and that it will be filled with blessings . But of course it does not follow that the period between the introduction and the complete development of automobiles is improved by them . At any rate , a reasonable counterblast to motor eulogies may not be out of place , and I propose to set down here some of the peculiar problems of the present time that have been produced by automobiles . To begin with , altho they are performing work in fields of usefulness , they have not as yet proved their necessity . That is , commercially , they are still in the experimental stage ? too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are regarded doubtfully by emergency services , such as the fire and ambulance , and as an adjunct to  |p1300  armies have yet to demonstrate their value . The point I wish to make is obvious enough ? that at the present time their conspicuous success has been achieved almost wholly as pleasure vehicles , so that their mention suggests to the average person only a new way of enjoying one 's self . The swiftness of their development to the present time has been astounding , and may be illustrated by a contrast or two which could be duplicated in the experience of almost every one . About six or seven years ago an acquaintance of mine , a young man of large means , informed me that he had imported a French car ; and that it had cost him , duty paid , $4,000 . He intended , I believe , to impress me by the amount of the investment , and succeeded in doing so . Four thousand dollars appeared a very great sum to expend for a rather uncertain machine . A few days ago a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " could afford it " he intended to buy a certain " racing runabout . " They were not very expensive , he added , " only $4,000 . " The figure then seemed moderate or at least not at all unusual . The French car I have mentioned was , I think , of fifteen horse power , and its owner declared it would maintain easily a speed of twenty-five miles an hour . Today the advertising columns of papers and magazines are strewn with notices of " roadsters " and " road racers " guaranteed by their makers to develop sixty horse power or even higher , and to maintain a speed greater than a mile a minute . In other words , an infancy of spindly , fragile " horseless carriages " has grown to a youth of mighty road engines continually increasing in size , in power , in cost of purchase and maintenance , and , naturally , in excellence of construction . One might think , too , that the rules of economics had been set at defiance , for the advance in outlay has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least one very conspicuous reason , for this excessive popularity is evident enough . It is the stimulation produced by motoring . Every rider knows the exultation arising from feeling the strength of the animal under him , and this sensation is reproduced and intensified in the easy and constant power of an automobile . But from the same circumstance arises its greatest menace . There is always a temptation to urge a fiery thorobred to the limit of his speed . A rider , however , must take into account the endurance of the horse , and finds a compensation for a moderate pace in the sense of companionship with a fine animal . Indeed , whether riding or driving a horse the fact that the motive power is a living thing has an interest of its own . There is an atmosphere about horses . But there is none surrounding an automobile . The occupant has a powerful mechanism which can be driven , like a horse , at top speed , and the motives for refraining do not exist . So naturally excessive speeding has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , is the most conspicuous evil . Motorists have exhibited the one worse attitude than defiance of law ? indifference to it . The usual answer to such a charge is that only a small minority disregard the law , and the majority should not be held responsible for their conduct . In the first place , however , there are probably far more offenders than devotees of the " sport " are willing to admit . At any rate , one railway company after investigation reported that over one-half of the machines that crossed their road at a certain point within the period of observation were maintaining a speed not only in excess of the legal limit , but so great that they could not have been stopped if a train had been passing . In the second place , there is practically no evidence that those who do keep within the law know or care what the provisions are . It is a matter of individual choice . They do not enjoy going at a reckless speed , that is all . Let them change their views , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deter them ? There are the familiar roadside signs : " Town limit . Motor vehicles limited to twelve miles an hour . " Has any motor party ever taken such a warning seriously ? The maximum placed by the inexperienced authorities is low , and no pretense of obeying is made . And what if violators are arrested ? Some inconvenience , a few dollars ' fine ? and that is all , as a rule . It is part of the game . Courts have not been able so  |p1301  far to persuade themselves that " overspeeding " is an offense serious enough to warrant imprisonment , and confine themselves to fines and " reprimands . " The prisoner looks contrite at the court 's words , " peels off " the amount of the fine from a large roll of bills , and sallies forth to try for another record , laughingly telling the officer who made the arrest , as he passes , that next time he wo n't be caught so easily . In this there may be some exaggeration ? but not very much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit by a motor cycle policeman over the greater part of the island of Manhattan . The time was late night , a speed of forty miles an hour thru the city streets was attained ( according to the papers ) , the offenders united in urging the pursuing officer to " come on , " and they were stopped at last only by the runaway gates on an East River bridge . The court , when they were arraigned , allowed all but the man who had been driving to go with fines of $2 each ! This suggests an interesting reflection . It is the apparently singular inability of our legislatures and courts to respond to new requirements . Assume , for example , that a dozen different devices , all as dangerous and alluring as automobiles , were introduced , at the same time . Unless our Solons grasped the situation far more quickly than has been the case with motor vehicles , years would pass , each one leaving a bloody trail of fatalities and mutilations , before an adequate policy were adopted . The trouble seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that motor cars are still nothing but carriages without horses , to be dealt with in the same manner as the older vehicles . For instance , the authorities in general agree that upon public highways a speed greater than say twenty to twenty-five miles an hour is dangerous and should not be permitted . In order to achieve this result they resort to the time-honored methods of licensing cars and drivers , of requiring numbers , and finally of ordering the owners not to exceed the statutory limit . The inadequacy of such a policy appears to have been demonstrated . In spite of all the statutes , in Massachusetts within twelve months sixty-two persons were killed and 64o seriously injured in automobile accidents , while an insurance company has noted the killing , in a period of four weeks of the past summer , of twenty-six people and the injuring of seventy-four others in a similar manner . Indeed , punitive laws of the character are impossible of enforcement except within limited areas , because of the vast expense for police involved and the great difficulty of catching offenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with greater logic be regarded as morphine and cocaine are . Possession and ability to use , when combined with an inborn passion , create a temptation that many are unable to resist . People are not permitted to procure or possess deadly drugs , unless competent physicians have certified that they require them . A parallel provision would seem to be that cars capable of a harmful speed should not he allowed except under special conditions ? as , for example , upon highways devoted to them exclusively as are railway tracks to trains . It is certainly an absurd thing for the lawmakers to consume their gray matter in constructing statutes designed to prevent automobiles from going more than twenty miles an hour on the public roads , while at the same time and in the same jurisdiction manufacturers are permitted openly to - urge every one to buy their cars , warranted to maintain a speed of sixty miles an hour on those very roads ! A preventive is needed , and if public opinion be at last shocked into an aggressive attitude , it seems probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the power to transgress will be removed . There are at least two other evils which have arisen and are more or less closely connected with overspeeding . Coachmen constitute a well - defined class , with rules of behavior and action resulting from long experience . Locomotive engineers are men of training and reliability . But the chauffeur is a new type . He has not been " standardized . " Ho is of no particular race or years , and there are no traditions of his calling . Very probably he has not been in the personal service of another before , has an insufficient conception of disci/ pline , and has introduced a new and serious form of offense , for which at the present time there is no adequate remedy . It would he very unusual to see a coachman in his shirt sleeves driving his employer 's horses and carriage at full speed around the neighborhood and so entertaining a wagonload of personal friends ? also in shirt sleeves . But this seems to be an ordinary diversion of chauffeurs . They take the powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner 's permission fill them with acquaintances as irresponsible as themselves and race over the country , occasionally killing or maiming innocent passersby , and then , too frequently , speeding away before they can be caught or their numbers taken . An Appellate Court in New York has decided that the owner of the machine is not responsible for the damage caused under such circumstances , and so his solicitude to see that the car is not taken out except upon his order is reduced to a minimum . Then there is the destruction of roads . The macadam construction has done very well for horse-drawn vehicles . In fact , it is the best that is known , and the motor demands for smooth , hard surfaces have led communities at great expense to enlarge the macadamized areas . What are the results ? First , the broad pad of the automobile tire destroys the surface rapidly and hurls clouds of dust over the houses and crops by the roadside , causing annoyance and at times seriously impairing rental values . Then , to meet these difficulties , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixture of crude oil and tar , which is greasy and dingy and evil smelling . And it is also merely experimental . No one knows how much the dressing will really add to the highway 's life under the strains of rushing cars . These drawbacks and others that might be mentioned are those which communities as a whole sustain from the presence of automobiles . But there are some which are due to their demoralizing fascination . Thus a question that is frequently asked is , How can so many afford them ? It is an ordinary thing to see a huge and expensive machine running smoothly along and crowded with men and women who look far from affluent . And many who never felt that they were in a position to purchase a horse and carriage at perhaps one thousand dollars , maintainable for eight hundred dollars a year , now indulge in automobiles costing several thousand dollars originally and eight hundred to operate for only two or three months . A few sidelights of which I have been told may be cited here . Thev illumine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A young clerk dependent upon a presumably small salary inherited $8,000 . He spent $2,500 of it in the purchase of a car . A large employer of labor in one of our great cities had a clerk , a young married man , whose salary was less than $1,000 a year . One morning he appeared at the office in a handsome new automobile . My informant called him in , and in reply to questions he explained that the car was his ; that he himself had no money outside of his salary , but his wife possessed a dot of about $12,000 and " they thought they would put $2,500 of it into an automobile ! " A resident of Boston said a year or two ago that one would be astonished to know the number of second mortgages that had been placed upon houses in the vicinity of his city to enable the owners to procure cars . and a lawyer of New York is responsible for the statement that in his office during the past winter there have been over 200 foreclosures of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . Such cases are probably not very exceptional , and require no comment beyond the remark that they indicate a reckless extravagance , which few , if any other , inventions have ever galled forth . In conclusion it is not unfair to refer to the appearance of the occupants . Commentators have declared that the tendency of our development is toward a colorless and uninteresting civilization , devoid of high lights or any element of the picturesque . The average motorist of today is an argument for the contention . During the reign of horse-drawn vehicles no costumes were too carefully designed . Under the new regime nothing is too ugly . Hatless and coatless or wrapt in linen dusters and huge veils , men and women are reduced to one uninspiring begoggled level . In place of the trim coachman , erect on his box , one sees a creature clad in dingy cap and cotton duster , sitting on the small of his back , and so sunken that the crown of his head is almost on a level with the shoulder of . the person by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not so intended . The point simply is that , in spite of the assertions of enthusiasts , I think the time when motor vehicles are desirable assets to society at large is yet to come , and that at present a certain excess must be charged to them in the debit column . They have engendered a reckless personal extravagance that must bring remorse and suffering to many some day . They have produced a new contempt for authority and an unusually lawless and irresponsible class . Finally , with little or no compensating advantage to the communities thru which they hurry , they have caused the taxpayers heavy expense for roads , have almost driven the more leisurely from them , and have then proceeded to destroy the highways themselves . All of these things are doubtless curable and will be remedied in time . At present , however , they exist .
