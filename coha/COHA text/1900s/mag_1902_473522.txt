EVERYTHING begins in the middle ? to adapt a wise saying ? like an epic poem . That is the central truth of human perspective . Open history where you will , and there are always men streaming over the mountains or the sea from some horizon , bringing with them arms and cattle , battle-songs and prayers , and an imaginary world ; their best treasure is ever the seed of some last year 's harvest . Colonialism is a word too often used to disparage the thing ; it is the natural condition of the outposts of man 's spread over the earth ; the wave , as it breaks on new shores , is salt with time . England was colonized , and Greece , and India . So our ancestors , the first Americans , brought with them the past as well as the future to this land . It is not often that books make an important item in the cargo of an emigrant ship . The mother-tongue is brought , and in it is the great sap of thought , aspiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they arise ; but the book-language is , in the main , left at home ; it is the mouthlanguage , where literature is in the making , that will be used on the new soil . The pure literary influence in all our early colonies , the impact of the bookpast of England , was slightest at the South , and strengthened with the northing . In Virginia , generally , the first estates were naturally as innocent of learning as Osbaldistone Hall ; there was a countrified indifference to it befitting a young squirarchy , a touch of contempt felt with old-fashioned English frankness , even a dull hatred of enlightenment , as when the Governor thanked God that there were " no free schools nor printing , " and hoped there would be none for a hundred years . " God keep us from both ? " he cried . At the other focus of the settlement , in New England , a different state of affairs prevailcd , though there , too , the pure literary influence was narrowly limited . But as in the dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danish boats , and many an exodus has gone out with one great book which was like brain and blood to the little race , there on Massachusetts Bay a book had come with the people ; and every ship , loaded with the twenty thousand souls of the first emigration , brought it ? the book that has oftenest crossed the sea of all the books of men ? the Bible . It is the greatest English book ; and in this small folk of English stock it found a human vehicle of power equal to its greatness . This nest of Puritans is commonly thought of as deficient in that large part of the human genius which is enlightened by letters , as unimaginative ; and because they did not flower out with polite literature , they are said to be unliterary . Yet the Puritan line in England was constituted of Spenser , Milton , and Bunyan , the three most imaginative minds of their generations for a century of English life ; though it should be observed that in these three instances the imagination moved in moulds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock they were , could not but be imaginative , romantic , intense , in vision , emotion , and idea ; they were high-charged with all this energy ; but the channels were prepared for it , and they found their literature in the Bible . If they required songs of praise , they " rolled the hymn to wintry skies " ; if they sought expression for humiliation , or desired to illustrate their fortunes or passions , their sins , trials , and deliverances , there was the typical narrative and drama of human life , as they knew it , in the Scriptures ; they turned to their one book , and more frequently , as their descendants now turn to whole libraries , and found in it the mirror of life . The Bible was , indeed , to use the language of to-day , like a great literary trust ; it supplied all wants , and forbade competition . Such a book , when it takes hold of a people so completely and intimately and fills the measure of their spiritual energy , needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task it performs , as Shakspere must recede before dramatic imagination can flourish with equal new power ; for , though books are not seldom the seeds of revolution , a great book is normally a powerful conservative force , a true bond of national life . It is , however , wide of the mark to describe a peuple to whom the Old Testament was more thoroughly known than Homer to the young Greeks , and the New Testament more familiar than Victor Hugo to young France , as . an unliterary people . If it be the function of literature to lift the thoughts of men , to educate the emotions , to shape character toward ideal ends , to exalt and to console , and always to minister to the spirit in its walk on earth , the Bible discharged this office in the early generation of the New England settlements with an adequacy , a constancy , a penetration , a completeness of efficacy , such as is hardly to be paralleled in history . It was their rubric of prayer , their lyric of praise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the epic of their growing state , where they , too , were a chosen people of God planted in the wilderness . This was its popular significance . It bred a learned and scholarly clergy besides , vast producers of sermons , controversial tractates , and speculative treatises in theology , such that , if the book had been secular , the age would have been named Alexandrian ; and it enforced that respect for learning and the literary faculty which has never ceased in that region , as it also made the people a lettered people by the mere necessity that it should be read by all , just as the right to vote is making the nation at large now a lettered nation . It may seem like reheating old fires to discourse in this way of the place of the Bible in our beginnings , but it is essential for a true comprehension of our early life and letters , and the relationship between them , to see in these first generations not a dull , darkened , unimaginative folk , but in a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having its most passionate and intense life in a book , as single and significant to it as the Horan to Islam , and as much richer than the Koran in art and truth as the Christian life exceeds the Moslem faith . To think of the old sermons and treatises as the first American literature is like speaking of the commentaries on Shakspere and omitting the poet ; the Bible was the book in which the first Americans found what literature has to give to the hearts of the people , and in it they had their full and overflowing literary , nor should one hesitate to say their artistic , life . And what was this life that the Puritans led with this book for their brain and heart ? We have their prayers , sweet and snlenm in the cadences better known to us now in the English Prayer-Book ; we have the letters of their wives , like Mrs. Winthrop 's , mingling human affection with divine love , as if these New England mothers were also nuns of Christ 's cloister ; we have their sermons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to us in Milton , or with the flowing amplitude and eloquence that to our ears are Taylor 's , or with the vivid realism of vision that to our eyes ' is Bunyan 's limning on the darkness ; we have the words , but the light to read them by is gone . The clergy themselves are stiff to us as their portraits , all wig and gown and wooden smiles , ? and when we think of them it is most often as fire-breathing dragons , perhaps ; yet they were , as is well known , men of great power of character , with some of what seem the lost graces of greatness , immense intellectual vigor , moral authority , dignity , the scholar 's refinement , sanctity even ; and , if we are to judge by what their friends said ? and how else shall we judge ? ? in some few , at least , it would seem that all the poison of human nature had gone out of them into their creed , and left only angelic sweetness in their souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been wrought , but it is found in intense religious life elsewhere . The people who sat under their teaching are also far away in the past , so marked in their double consciousness , as it were on the one side , absorbed in practical affairs , fighting , exploring , debating , building all things actual life of each day from matins to new ; on the other , absorbed in spiritual vespers ; but it is a life on which , as of self-scrutiny , despairing , hoping , doubt old , silence falls at the day 's end . It ing ; so sure in every touch on this world leaves no original record of itself in new with axe and plough and gun , yet within literature , just as the vitality of impulse , living in the world to come , with the sympathy , and world - hope which exdreadful uncertainty which world it would presses itself in us by an appropriation be .

The heart of the Puritan The chief end of literature as the exis a closed book . The sermons , the dia pression of life being thus anticipated ries , the portraits , the so-called colonial and provided for , and the main stream literature , will not interpret it ; they are of intense experience , out of which the as much in the twilight of antiquity as creative impulse comes , being diverted Anglo-Saxon chronicles and riddles ; they through these hereditary Scriptural are the grave-clothes left behind , but the channels , there was left for the new spirit , our brother and master , is gone .

There was an aura , for ry mediums , through Shakspere , Scott , example , of special providences that filled Dickens , and leaves no original trace of the whole heaven round the settlements , itself . The life which is led through not with the aloofness of miracle , but literature ? and it is always large in a with a homely , hand-to-mouth nearness , reading people such as ours ? has its so that the gray goose which John Dane superficial swirl and froth like the ocean , shot at Chebaeco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sky for his dinner except as the the hour ; but its deep currents are silent , sparrow falls ; no doubt the goose was as as the influence of the writers just named real to him as Elijah 's ravens ; and such with myriads of thousands of annual a trifle best illustrates the omnipresent readers reminds us . The Bible is still nearness of Providence in the pe6ple 's the great Gulf Stream in the literary thought , as close with the helping hand consciousness of English people , and as with the all-seeing eye . There was their life is daily expressed through its by night another aura , too , of darkness language and imagery and ideals , the from the pit , that made the Essex woods gloom and creak with the Sabbath of witches , and gave Salem its nightmare year .

But while remarkable providences and witchcraft delusions are the most sensational phases of the record of our early annalists and diarists , the best part of it lies in its realistic story of the life of the times , its anecdotes of personal adventure , Indian captivity , explorations , voyages , shipwrecks like that marvellous one of Thacher and Avery . surprising deliverances ? all the chronicle of pioneer life . Here the old English speech , still smacking of the times of Elizabeth , hardens the knotty story with rude oaken strength , and discloses the individual primitive force , the daring , the resource , and resolution of the transplanted stock , with picturesque and deepbitten realism in every scene . It is primarily a literature of character in the raw state that thus sprang up , with adventure as its mode of presentation ; it is the stamped life of the time , that has proved more permanent because it was written down , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much more abundant and made the topic of secular interest round every meetinghouse , in all the taverns , and by the blazing hearths of the whole country-side . Historians , in their turn , took up the tale and composed the early annals of the new world , always with a pride in the land , and some thought of it as an oasis of God in His dealing with mankind , a sense that it was a place of deliverance , their very own , God 's grant , the king 's realm rather by legal courtesy than of right ; the divine right , indeed , was in themselves , not in the king . The narrative itself is meagre and concerns simple things ; but the spirit of it contained the political future . So , life beginning now to be long in the land , and the scattered settlements to multiply and knit together with a broader inclusion of common mundane interests , commerce springing up and spreading southward to the West Indies , and wealth from home produce and foreign exchange making rich citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which was the result of this growing diversity in employment , outlook , and ambition , and the world was more and more , and its problems assertive of their privilege to be first and its ways of their right to be commanding . There was a fading out of the old fervor , a wave of the great awakening in religion in reaction , but the lessening oscillations showed that the element of religion had shrunk again to be only a part of life , and not the leading public part now . The clergy and the magistrates were less in alliance as one power of the state , and the former had lost place . They had left a few memorable names for landmarks ? Eliot , Cotton , Mather , Edwards , among the chief ? and sonic folios , the Magnalia the first ; but the Puritan age was gone , the land was settled , the main interest of the people was secular , questions of trade and taxes came forward , and foremost of all , the question of government . If literature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's bosoms , it was now one that came home to their business . Perhaps the illustrative moment of the change is best arrested in Franklin 's boyhood , when he stayed at home from evening meeting on the Sabbath , not without some misgiving , because he could make a better use of his time in study . The founding of a greater state than the Puritan commonwealth was now in hand , and the basis of it was broader in the roots of the nation among the dispersed colonies . The general complexion of the literature which set forth the growth of the environment of the new American life was the same in all the colonies ; a similar record would be made later in the winning of the West , experience vividly felt being transcribed in the words of those who did or closely observed the deeds ; and in these generations of the first conquest of the wilderness , Colonel Norwood 's narrative in the South was of the same stripe as such memorabilia were to be everywhere . Yet in the North , owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primacy remained in importance and fulness . In the new political development this would no longer be the case . The great document : of this literature , the Declaration and the Constitution , were written to the southward , though they were the produce of the general sense of all ; and round about them the writings of Jefferson , Adams , Madison , Paine , Otis , and their fellows clustered as a literature of int Irpretation of the great ideas they embodied , in a manner somewhat analogous to the way in which the sermons of the old clergy gathered around the Scriptures . Oratory had sprung up in the general forum , and belonged , like the newspapers , to the troubled times ; and having great ideas to feed on , and being electrified by passion , it began that remarkable career which had its climax in Webster and only died in Phillips . The political literature of the Revolution was the great achievement of the age in the intellectual sphere ; and it was so great AS it was because from the hour when its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's order at the head of every regiment , the practical energy of the new-born nation went into it completely , engaged in the labor of applying to life those ideas of free government which had become the absorbing thought and emotion of the people , both in battle and in council ; and , moreover , not only were the ideas themselves of commanding power , but they were set forth in words and bodied forth in instituti ms by great characters . Washington 's " ' Farewell Address " is reckoned a monument of the time scarcely inferior in diunity to the two instruments that preceded it ; and one great book of government , The Federalist , summed up the broad national thought . In these wril ings , distinctively , was the literary outburst of life , as it then sought expression in the language , imagery , and ideas of public liberty , as directly , pervasively , and energetically as in the Puritan commonwealth in the earlier age it had found utterance in the language and im Igery and ideals of the Bible ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious ; but here , too , it is life expre-ssed in literature , though now the form is original and indigenous . The first great contact of life and letters in America was through religious passion in inherited forms of speech ; the second great contact was through political passion , and created a new literature for itself ; between the two lay that literature , always more or less in evidence , describing the environment of life and its events realistically , or summing it up in history nr annals . Such is the story of the interaction of American life and letters in their vital connection in the colonial times . Is it too brief a tale , too scant in names and titles , too little diversified ? Does it slight academic definitions , preconceptions of the bibliographer and antiquarian , the received tradition of our colonial literature which has so swelled in bulk by the labors of our literary historians in the last thirty years of local research ? What of The Day of Doom , The New England Primer , and Poor Richard 's Almanack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ark , survivors from the flood , archaic idols ? These are relics of a literary fetichism , together with Franklin 's Autobiography and Edwards 's On the Freedom of the Wiii , except that the great character of Franklin still pleads for one and the great intellect of Edwards for the other with a few . They do not belong with the books that become the classics of a nation . They are not necessarily remembered . Their being mentioned at all denotes the scarcity of . colonial books that can be brought even by charity under the head of literature in its polite sense . The contact of the colonists with elegant letters , as imported from England , was also inconspicuous . It is true that William Hawthorne , the ancestor of the romancer , brought over Sir Philip Sidney 's Arcadia , and the thought of that stern captain and orator of the Puritan assembly reading the lore of the shepherd-knights of love in the far different wild of Salem fills one with amazement ; but the fact is significant of the kind of touch with England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old - home Cambridge alone . Spenser was also known , and Du Bartas ; and as time went on the Puritan literature came over , Milton and Bunyan , and then Cowper ? the characteristic books to be found in New England homes at the end of the period , and long afterwards the familiar books of the house there . But those who felt the literary impulse from these imported writings were few , and achieved nothing ; gather up their slender compositions as we may with pious care , it is only for reburial . The fertilising power of such books was long delayed ? so long , in fact , as to bring the eighteenth century nearer to us than it is to Englishmen ; for Addison , who first was felt in Irving , is still perceptible in Curtis , and Holmes hardly escaped being one of Pope 's imitators . It is only one hide-bound in academic prejudice who could treat such a rill of Parnassus as imitative colonial verse as a matter of any importance in our literature . The people were a prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prose ; what was to them the substance of poetry in their lives was clothed in prose , however exalted with the rhythm of deep natural feeling ; their very hymnS had lost the sense of poetic form . They had , in truth , forgotten poetry ; the perception of it as a noble and exquisite form of language had gone from them , nor did it come back till Bryant recaptured for the first time its grand* , lines at the same time that he gave landscape to the virgin , horizons of his country . Slowly , however , the ground was prepared for literature in the narrower sense ; it was the last of the great natural functions of a civilized state to revive on the new soil ; even now it is only with reservations that it can be said to have reached the dignity of a distinct profession among us . The clergy and the statesmen used it only as a tool in their own crafts for ulterior ends ; they did not value it as an art capable of products that belong only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters in the social arrangement ; there was no market for his wares in the social economy ; religious and political ideals were supplied in abundance , and no need was felt for other ideals ; and as for entertainment , it was a hard-working world , this young America , fully employed with its material tasks in subduing the soil , advancing the border , establishing trade , manufacture , and commerce , founding institutions , planting the state in all ways . ' vol . CV. ? Nn. 626 ? 27 Communication spread through the colonies , which drew together , but this communication was ecclesiastical , mercantile , political ; and , in fact , it was scientific before it was literary . The first class , too , that developed wealth was a burgher commercial class , whose indulgence was in articles of costly merchandise , in luxuries of the house and dress , in comfortable living ? the old Tory class , materialized with new riches and interested in the old order as one in which they were substantial citizens . Letters have seldom flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous times after the Revolution in a wider and more varied world that signs of literary consciousness can be discerned . In the newspapers there began to he indications of literary ambition , and in the publications that were late fruits of the periodical movement in the English eighteenth century there were signs of literary breeding , but the minds of the contributors fed on the husks of a foreign taste . The presses of Philadelphia and Wilmington had reprinted English books , and English radicalism was early welcomed and had a living contemporary force ; Mary Wollstonecraft 's books , for example , were issued and had influence . There was rapid expansion in the field of books ; readers increased in numbers ; a demand arose for works current in the mother-country , as well as for standard authors of the closing century . Perhaps the clearest sign of the coming revival was to be seen in the first public libraries , called social libraries , that sprang up in the New England coast towns , and were considerable collections for general use . Their catalogues show what books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religious works , manuals of counsel for parents and youth , serious meditative discourses , and the like , they are also filled with travel , history , the science of those days , the English classic poets and prose-writers , and are not destitute of fiction and plays . They reveal the existence of a distinct literary attention in the community , which was in readiness for the native writers , or if they failed to arise , these little libraries would breed them . What was true of the neighborhood of Boston was also the case in other local centres as fix south as Philadelphia at least ; the reading public , interested in contemperary books , and also familiarized with he traditional higher forms of the literary art , essay , tale , and poem , had come . The first appearance of an American spirit , indigenous and of the soil , would naturally be found in that folk-literature that comes with printer 's ink , instead of the old bardic harp , the broadside of ballad and news ; but of this there was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Braddock 's Men , " the ballad of " Nathan Hale , " " Yankee Doodle , " and the like and no popular writer rose out of it . The first name distinctly literary was that of Philip Freneau , whose poems , following the manner of the contemporary English school , had American color in their subjects ; but , though he possessed literary feeling , he had no distinction except as a solitary figure , and he made no wide appeal to his countrymen . Charles . 13rockden Brown , the earliest . America , - novelist , was of a much stronger native fibre . He had an original impulse , springing from his times and his environment , and his novels were localized on the so 1 . In manner he too adopted the , currmt English fashion , and yet not slavishl , but with a purpose to reform and advance it , and put it to new uses . He made a conscious attempt to substitute realitan for romantic supernaturalism , and turned from the Gothic castle and the ghost to those quasiscientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the magic of his mystery , and to the contemporary things of America , such as the Indian and the yellow-fever pest in New York , for the substance of his physical background . He remained , however , too closely attached to the pseudo-romanti2 in character , and was too much interested in the ideas of Godwin 's English radicalism , to be able to break out a plain human story from the shell of life in the colonies , as Miss Edgeworth did in the case of Irish and Scott in the case of Scotch life . He was far from being a genius in fiction ; but American traits , things , and contemporary interests are strongly marked in his curiously composite tales ; the ferment of new literary life is in them . In the elder Richard Henry Dana , who held a similar position in the New England centre , poetry and fiction were blended , but neither element disclosed American originality , except by some modification of his English exemplars in respect to the setting of his works . The character , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English school , which was the tap-root of Byronism , and in Dana sent out a wandering shoot oversea . But Freneau , Brown , and Dana , though their works are long forgotten , illustrate the sort of literary creation that went on in the opening of the New World to the poetic and romantic imagination of its own sons . They were pioneers of the literary art and profession , with habits English-bred but working in the home field . These were our beginnings in the life which a people leads through books , those which it inherits from the fathers , and those which it creates out of itself . This life lay almost exclusively in the religious , political , and historic fields ; it was only with the generation born after the Revolution that literature was practised as a fine art in an independent and original way . But the colonial generations had done their work , and the time was ripe for complete life on the scale of Western civilization . They had planted religion , liberty , letters , which are the three estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument in each phase of the triple task .
