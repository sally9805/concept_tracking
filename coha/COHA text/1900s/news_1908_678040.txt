txt The loss of life through the collision between the American liner St. Paul and the British cruiser Gladiator off the Isle of Wight Is much greater than was supposed . It has run up to thirty-six , and may go beyond that figure . According to the Admiralty list , issued this evening , the known dead arid missing of the Gladiator 's crew number twenty-eight . The total of known dead is five , the bodies of three drowned men having been recovered and two of the injured having died in the hospital . The twenty-three known to be missing and unaccounted for include Lieut . W. G. P. Graves , five petty officers , and seventeen members of the crew . In addition to the missing who are listed , the Admiralty says there are eight missing members of the crew whose names it is unable to give at this moment . Furthermore , there are six members of the Gladiator 's crew in the hospital who are badly hurt , and some of them are likely to die of their injuries .

Divers prepared to enter the Gladiator this morning , but were or ? , d away because the ship was movI. : , with the tide . It is now believed that many of the crew , dazed by the shock of the collision , and blinded by the dense snowstorm , lost their bearings when forced to take to the water and swam out to sea instead of toward the shore , which was only 500 yards away . These , of course , have perished .. The bodies of some of the dead have been removed to the Yarmouth mortuary , and the injured are being cared for at Fort Victoria , near the scene of the collision .

It is probable Capt . Passow and the chief officer of the St. Paul will be among the first witnesses called , in order to allow them to sail on the liner 's next westward trip . " Able Seaman Johnson , who was at the telegraph on the bridge of the Gladiator when the collision occurred , said to me : ' We were picking our way up the Solent at nine knots when I saw the St. Paul , steaming at least sixteen knots , coming straight at us . Suddenly she altered her course . We altered our course to port in order to clear her , and then the liner altered her course a second time and hit us bow on amidships , just at the second gun , and ripped us up like a knife . It was grog time below and many men were being served just as the liner struck . ' " The Rev. Horace W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - Was on the St. Paul . Speaking of the collision to Tim Tnins 's correspondent , he said : ' I ran out of the reading saloon after the crash . The vessels were wedged together so that when our engines were reversed It was like drawing a tooth . We lowered our boats as quickly as we could , but , before we did so , many bluejackets were gliding off the bottom of the overturned cruiser into the sea . ' " Among the dead was a bridegroom i of three days , and . a sailor who swam back to the cruiser again to get $150 he had left behind . One strong bluejacket swam back and forth until he had rescued eleven men .
