txt Brutal and Ignorant . I wish to enter my small , but none the less burning , protest at the senseless , Indiscriminate slaughter of defenseless dogs now going on in our streets . As for this hysterical outcry of rabies , I do not think there Is another " " country on the face of the earth that loses its head at the smallest provocation as this one does , or permits scare headlines to appear in the papers to upset the nerves and morbid imaginations of weak-minded persons . The present clamor against dogs is making New York a laughing stock and object of contempt both at home and abroad . As statistics have again and again shown , rabies is no more prevalent now than at any other time , and more than half of the cases reported prove on Investigation to be something entirely different , The Board of Health , by its brutal and Ignorant regulations of muzzling and leashing dogs , Is doing more to cause madness than any amount of hot weather . If It could hear the unrepeatable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of loafers , toward decent people trying to protect their pets , perhaps it would think there was something loose on the streets even worse than dogs .
