txt AMERICAN ENGINEERING IN INDIA . The subject is of such National importance that Lord GEORGE HAMILTON 'S letter to Sir ALFRED HICKMAN is very well worth giving and reading in full , in spite of the references to it that have come by the cable . Moreover , he deals with the subject with such manifest ** as must convince every impartial reader on either side of the Atlantic that Sir ALFRED HICKMAN spoke very much in I his haste when he accused the British authorities in India , whom Lord GEORGE represents , of an undue bias toward American bidders for their work . The accusation was not credible on the face of it . The natural bias of the authorities was all the other way . Short of bribery or some corrupt personal interest , which , of course , nobody charges or imagines , they would have preferred to construct their roads with British bridges and to equip them with British locomotiVes . But they simply could not get what they wanted as cheaply or as quickly from British as from American bidders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not have ascertained and published the exact figures concerning the comparative economy of operation of the two kinds of engines . He simply says that , as the engineers and stokers became accustomed to the new engines , the difference in running expenses diminished ' if it did not disappear . A cable dispatch to The Sun intimates that the crews of British railroads are anxious to discredit their American engines in the interest of the solidarity of British labor . But no such motive can be supposed to have been operative in India . In any case , there are a number of American railroad , managers who would learn with great interest that British engines were more economical than their own . If that contention could be established by Sir ALFRED HICKMAN , the result would be a flood of American orders for British locomotives which would amply compensate the British builders for all they have lost through American competition . The London Times , in some particularly well-informed comments upon Lord GEORGE 'S letter , emphasizes his points and brings out some that lie latent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been " full " when such orders as that for the Atbara Bridge or the Gohtieh viaduct were to be given out .

It tells them that " the paralyzing hand of the trades union ' leader ' is everywhere " and that he is " largely responsible " for the state of things which Sir ALFRED HICKMAN resents and Lord .

Of all possible explanations , that of the - ex- President of the British Iron Trade Association is the least credible , the explanation that British officials , Governmental or corporate , at home or abroad , prefer American products to Aritish without reason , and out of pure favoritism .
