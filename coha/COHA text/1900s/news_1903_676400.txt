In addition to these , the assemblage included United States Senators , officials and ex-officials of the State and city , the heads of city departments , the members of the Board of Aldermen , and invited guests , including representatives of various patriotic societies  --  about 500 in all . The city was gayly bedecked for the occasion . Buildings were obscured by countless flags and great masses of bunting and festoons , and at night a light shone from almost every window in the greater city . Great crowds gathered in the parks and Public squares in the evening , where bands discoursed patriotic music and other entertainment was furnished In the way of stereopticon views that portrayed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child participated in exercises during the day , and there were music , singing , and speaking in almost every public institution . The spirit of the gala occasion was infectious . Everybody celebrated . Vessels leaving this port displayed flags from each mast , and as the boats moved down the harbor and out to sea it was in a great noise of tooting whistles-and shouting and singing jackies and passengers . The celebration will continue throughout the week , with more speeches , and each evening with entertainments in the parks . CEREMONIES AT CITY HALL . ' Representatives of Nation and State Take Part  --  Congratulations from " British Municipalities . The exercises at the City Hall began at $ few minutes after 3 o'clock . An hour after noon ' people began to gather in the park , but the plaza and wide driveway in front of the building were kept clear by the police .

The luncheon was informal and was served without menu cards . There - were no decorations , save a few flowers on the table itself , and no music . On reaching the City Hall the guests went into an ante-room of the Aldermanic Chamber . There they formed in line by twos , with the Mayor in the lead , and marched into the Aldermanic Chamber from the rear and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . At his left- sat President Forties of the Board of Aldermen , and at his right the Rev. Cornelius L. Wells . The dais upon which the Mayor sat was a bower of American Beauty roses and flags . The balcony in the rear was festooned with flags and bronze shields placed over a background of dark-brown velvet , which was trimmed with gold tinsel . Here and there , about the walls were flags tastefully arranged . The large desks of the Aldermen had been removed , and in their places were chairs . The room was crowded to its capacity , but net uncomfortably . The speakers took seats at the right of the Mayor . On the left sat the Charter Commissioners , with . Andrew H. Green at their head . Ex-Mayors Franklin Edson , Edward Cooper , and Robert A. Van Wyck were seated in that inclosure also . Onehalf of the main body of the chamber was filled with city officials . The other half was reserved for the Presidents of the boroughs and the members of the Board of Aldermen . Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a front seat in that portion of the room . Mayor Low called the meeting to order . He said that when Gov . Peter Stuyvesant made the grant of local self-government there was only one church in the ' new city then established , and that it existed to-day as the Coll.giate Reformed Church . in the absence of the pastor of that church , the Rev. Mr. Wells . pastor of the next oldest church , one in Flatbush , had been asked to deliver the invocation . THE MAYOR 'S ADDRESS . After the invocation Mayor Low delivered an address . He said that it was fitting that there should be present distinguished representatives of the National Government , for that Government came into being in the City of New York ; it was fitting that the Governor of the State should be present , for the State of New York had its origin in that early Dutch occupation of Manhattan Island ; it was fitting that the State Court of Appeals should be represented .. for by it , in the last resort , was administered-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prospered . and it was also fitting that the churches of those early days should take a part in the exercises for , except the city itself , there was nothing upon Manhattan Island so old as several of its church organizations . " In a city , " he went on . " where the old gives place so rapidly to the new ; in a city where the population grows more rapidly from the outside than from within ; in a city whose especial function - it often seems to be , so large is the scale of immigration , to welcome the emigrant from abroad and to make him into an American citizen , it is - not always easy to realize how very deep down into the soil of American history run the roots of the life that flourishes here . And yet there is great inspiration in the city 's long and interesting past . Here great events have happened : here , great deeds have been done ; here great Men have lived and labored. and here the fascinatinS story of the country 's material growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Gen. James Grant Wilsorf , in his orat.10 told the story of the discovery of the HUIM con River and the inception of New York ; He deprecated the absence of . any monutnant to the memory of Henry Hudson , and suggested thata lofty monument be erected . to him on the highest point of the Atlantic Highlands , near which the navigator landed in 1609 . He approved of the idea of a - memorial bridge at the upper end of Man : - hattan Island , but said he hoped the suggested monument would be erected in addition . In his tribute to the Dutch . who landed on Manhattan . and their descendants , Gen. Wilson said : " To the Dutch we ' are indebted for the only native Chief Magistrate ? our city has ever given to the Nation , and he , is destined . I believe , to fill a place among our Presidents second only to that occupied by Washington and ' Lincoln . " There was no applause . In fact , the President ' name was mentioned several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President had Sent Then there was loud hand clapping . PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT 'S LETTER . This letter from the President , which was dated at the White House on March 2S and addressed to the Mayor , was as follows : It is with sincere regret that I find myself unable to accept your Invitation . I am to be in California on the date you mention ; otherwise I should have strained every nerve to be present on an occasion so interesting to a native New Yorker , who is at the time President of the United States . The changes in New York City during the 350 years which have just elapsed are such as could be paralleled hardly anywhere else in the world . We now have in New York the second largest city of the world , and it is no Idle compliment to you and those associated eith you , Mr. Mayor , for me to say that there is now no other city here or abroad of whose governing officials its people have more just reason to feel proud . Secretary Root 's speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York as a city , and more particularly its greatness as the gateway through which the millions of people come into the United States from foreign lands . The municipal Government that was established 250 years ago , he said , has borne a great burden for the country because of its position , because it had provided education for the foreigners who before their copiing knew little or nothing of the lesson of independence , of freedom controlled and subordinated law . Bishop Potter spoke of the justification New Yorkers have for civic pride and the benefits of it . Then , speaking to the Mayer , he said : I maintain that no more heroic sacrifice has been made in our time than when you laid down the dignified ease of a great university and consented to be the Mayor of a great metropolis . Believe me , gentlemen . that is the spirit for which New York waits : ' Gov . Odell spoke of the development of municipal government in New York and of the relation of the State to the city . He declared their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute to the greatness of the city and expressed the allegiance of the rest of the State to the metropolis . The judiciary and its relation to municipal government was the subject of the address of Judge John Clinton Gray . The Rev. II . Pereira Mendes then told of the crming of the Jew to America , " with that human driftwood from the ocean of time . driven by storms and tempests of bigotry . " The Jew , he declared , was brought to this country by the hand of God , in order that lie might tender to this Nation the lesson of his own history and experiences . He asked the Americans to take the lesson from these " children of an ancient people , of the deathless race . of the sole living relics of hoary antiquity , the oldest of modern nations . Without righteous government . he said , all material greatness would amount to naught , while with it they would continue together everlastlnaly and for great good . When Mr. Mendes had finished the Mayor said : " 7f we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country will be repaid for the hospitality she has shown the men of his race . " " America " was sung , Archbishop Farley gave the benediction , and the meeting adjourned . MESSAGES FROM BRITAIN . The Mayor was kept busy during the forenoon answering congratulatory cablegrams and telegrams that poured into his office . One from President Gornme of the Municipal and County Club of Great Britain and Ireland read : Municipal and County Club of Great Britain and Ireland congratulate New York City on the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary incorporation . Edwin Gray , Lord Mayor of York . vabled : The Lord Mayor , Ald , , rmen ( and Councilors of the City of York . in council meeting assembled . bug to offer tr , the Mayor .

The following cablegram was received from the London City Council : The London City Council , in meeting assembled , congratulate the corporation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiftieth anniversary . The Mayor replied to each and every message immediately upon its receipt . CELEBRATION IN THE SCHOOLS . Exercises Both Patriotic and Instruct . ive  --  Gen. Greene Talks in Russian at Educational Alliance . In every public and high school in the city exercises were held in celebration of the birthday of the city . The school children , large and small , gathered in their assembly rooms , and with much spirit and interest carried out programmes that were designed to entertain and instruct . The flag was saluted , songs were sung , and addresses on the birth and growth of the city were listened to . Inasmuch as the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Ralph Waldo Emerson falls on May 25. and Memorial Day on May a0 , the exercises in many of the schools included the recitation of " The Concord Hymn , " and appropriate tributes to the brave men from New York who fought and died for their country in the civil and Spanish wars . There were beautiful and appropriate decorations in the assembly rooms , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettily costumed . In each instance the first number on the programme was the reading - of the Mayor 's proclamation . A typical programme included an address by the Principal on New York 's quarter millenial , essays by pupils on such subjects as " The Purchase of New Amsterdam . " " New York Under the Dutch , " " The Progress of New York , " " The Early Newspapers of New York , " " Fulton and His First Steamboat , " " The Statue of Liberty . " Maps were displayed in most of the schools showing the growth of the city . Many of there were the work of pupils . At the high schools special exercises were held . Horace Graves , an ex-member of the Board of Education , addressed the Girls ' High School in Brooklyn . In opening h said : " I esteem it a great honor to be called on to address the Girls ' High School on the occasion of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the municipal existence of New York . To perform this exalted duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a full account of all that has been done within our borders since 3653 , and , indeed , for the fifty years before that date . That would compel me to speak of all that has occurred for three hundred years in thirty minutes , and , if I were equal to the task , the burden of listening would be too heavy to cast upon you . Fortunately THE NEW YORK Truss has relieved us of that embarrassment . Mr. Thomas Janvier has been induced to treat ethe subject in the masterly manner of which he has given us the most marked exhibition in the past If he is only half as entertaining as he has shown he can be , we are to be congratulated . The scheme of Tern TIMES is excellent ; the selection of a chronicler most fortunate . The result will be brilliant and enact " At the Girls ' Technical High School In Manhattan , Miss Eleanor M. Nightingale of East Orange spoke on the history of the city , and H. M. Clarke of New Haven gave personal reminiscences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York were read from Tux Nrer YORK TIMES . Police Commissioner Greene addressed about 500 boys and girls at the Educational Allianee in the forenoon . The children were members of the classes in English for immigrants at the Baron de Hirsch SchoolDr . A. S. Scdoneep. presided . It was an inspiring sight to witness the youngsters , whose parents were compelled recently to fly from Russia to escape religious persecution , publicly pledging their allegiance to the American flag In these words : " Flag of our great Republic , Inspirer in battle , guardian of our homes , whose stars and stripes stand for Bravery , Purity , Truth , and Union , we salute thee . We , the natives of distant lands , who find rest under thy folds , do pledge cur hearts , our lives , and our sacred honor to love and protect thee , our country , and the liberty of the American people forever . " Commissioner Greene saluted the children in Russian and asked them as to their health and happiness In their ? native language . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he served WIt , h the Russian Army at the gates of Constantinople , fighting against the Turks . " His descriptieae and stories interested the children greatly. : After telling them that he hoped they would grow up to be good men and women , the SOommisSioner said : " Another thing I want you to remember is that you must help to keep good government in. the city . A Government which will I treat all fairly and justly and rightly . ' hen you go aboutothecity you see a big man 5n a blue coat . He is the policeman and is your , friend . It is his duty to protect you from ruffians and thieves and from fire and being-run over in the streets . If he is not your friend ? If you do not break the law  --  come to-me and tell me about it . " ? Besides Gen. Greene , ex-Register Ferdinand Levy and Lawyer Charles G. F. Wahle spoke . ILLUMINATIONS AND PICTURES . Skyscrapers Light Up . the Lower Part of , Alanhattan  --  Stereopticon Views Afford Much Amusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his light under a bushel last night , so to speak , but there were cracks in the measure through which the light shone . The ' old gentleman , notwithstanding his modesty , could not sleep as he did two centuries and a half ago , when the lignt of the stars and the moon was about the only illumination at the lower end of the island , which last night twinkled with electric lights at every skyscraper window , so that to the surrounding communities it looked as if Manhattan were ablaze . There were other and very small rays on the east side , where patriotic newcomers lit up their windows with candles or petroleum lights , and on the west side , where people as poor as the east eiders and as recently arrived in New York loyally tried to observe the Mayor 's " - request for g. general illumination of the households . The rest of the city was not given to illumination , with the exCeption of the great department stores , hich were elaborately decorated with strings of electric lights .

While the average horsy power for a night in the Summer season is about 3:7,000 , last night it was 43,000 . The man ill charge of the electrical part of the power house said last night about 11 o'cloch : " The wattmeters register now 3,200 kilowatts , which means that about 10,000 more horse power than ordinary is in use . Of course , in the Winter , especially about Christmas and New Year 's Day , the plant is taxed mucn more than now , but for May I think to-night has the record . Now . " lie said , as he pulled out his wetch and looked at the meters , " the lights must be going out fast , for the number of kilowatts is falling Street . Four enormous engines in the big plar t were taxed almost to their greatest capacity .

Mount Morris Park , One Hundred and Twentieth Street and Madison Avenue , aod Stapleton , S. I. The same series of views will be given in other parks of the greater city during the gala week . Last night : Js views were thrown on the canvases , not counting the typewritten announcements preceding the pictures . That the New York public is more interested in the present every-day life of its people might ne assumed by the cheers greeting the moving pictures , but the slides of the ' days when even the daguerreotype was not Or-earned of and the skill of man who could draw was sufficient , met with the approval of the beholders . The fact that the city in the celebration of its birthday did not find it necessary to indulge in fireworks , but confined the night illumination to a pictorial history , did not keep large crowds from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . The idea of contrast was adhered to . There would be a scene of a street as it was before the memory of the oldest inhabitant , and then a moving picture of the street as it is to-day . The crowds - were orderly and . good-natured , and a man could hold his child on his shoulder and his wife could stand on tiptoe .1 beside him without danger of their being thrown down or crushed . The police ar- I rangemmts were admirable even in City Hall Park , where the adjacent subway excavations and the wire and board fences to rrotect the lawn made the chances large that some one would be injured . Among the first pictures shown was one of the selling of Manhattan by the Indians for 524 worth of bciubles . This excited the retrosp ( ctive to remark that they wished they had been there and to speculation as to the fortunes their descendants might have to-day , even if there had been a taker 's dozen to each generation and the division of property had been in equal shares . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who did not know just who he was insisted that he was the founder of Tammany Hall , while others added their applause . A Holland wiadmill was also well received , some explaining that it was the " shute-theshutes ' of the old days . an old-time Coney Island picture ; while others said that it w as an early type of the Wall Street ticker , which rules the destinies of nations ' and makes or breaks investors . The sin-render of New York to the British met with violent protests because there was no Irish flag in the procession , but the crowd was pacified with a caricature of Father Knickerbocker carrying a great bag . ' ' he spectators were unanimous in their interpretation that he must have been " r. captain of industry " of the old days . The bellman , designated as the first type of the New York policeman . met with rounds of applause and references to the size of his pockets as good places for " graft .

Then there was wild cheering , it not being explained whether this was for King George or for the ammunition of the Continentals . There were scenes of the Bowery and the harbor , and the principal thoroughfares as they were and as they ate to-day : scenes of the Larbor with the old-time ships and the new . with a moving picture of a rescue and another of the fireboats at work : others of tae firemen on the way to perilous undertakings . and firemen actually at work .
