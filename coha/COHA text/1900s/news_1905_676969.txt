txt There were two important developments , in the Equitable affair yesterday . One was the news from Albany that Attorney General Mayer had granted Senator Brackett permission to bring the suit that Brackett seeks to institute in the courts of Saratoga County . The other was an action which D. Leroy Dresser , once President of the Trust Company of the Republic , now the Commonwealth Trust Company , start . ed against the Mercantile Trust Convene ' and " James H. Hyde and associates " to recover something over *2,000,000 which Mr. Dresser says he lost by the United States Shipbuilding promotion . In addition to these two developments there was a persistent report in Wail Street that the actions already started in various States for the appointment of receivers for the Equitable would be converged by an action to be started here through the firm of Sullivan &; Cromwell , who are said to be in charge of the receivership campaign . The report was not denied at the office of Sullivan &; Cromwell . William Nelson Cromwell said Just before he started for Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excused from discussing Equitable affairs . " Various statements have been circulated concerning the report of the Frick investigating committee . One coming from sources antagonistic to James H. Hyde had it last night that the committee had obtained from Mr. Hyde his consent to the proposal that he should resign as Vice President if President Alexander and Second Vice President Tarbell went out of the company ahead of him . It was said that the proposition was put before Mr. Alexander , who refused to consider it , saying to the Frick investigators that he had undertaken a campaign for mutualization and did not propose to abandon it . Mr. Alexander added , so the report had it . that the committee had bound him to silence while it was carrying on its work , but that when that work was over , if he did not like the tone of the report . he would himself give an account of Equi4 table affairs . Denies That Hyde Will Resign . When the question of Mr. Hyde 's resigning was laid before Samuel " Jitter ; myer , chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyde will not get out . You can bank upon that . " Mr. Untermyer would not discuss the situation further on account of the pledge of secrecy binding all parties in the Equie table affair , and Mr. Alexander declared that he was Under the same injunction . There was considerable discussion of the receivership situation in legal circles yesterday . It was pointed out in connection with the supposed campaign for the appointment of receivers in the several States where the Equitable has assets of importance that the applications already filed and others to be filed before one ? should be made here would pave the way for the appointment of the same receiver at all points , inasmuch as persons desiring receivership actions instituted are obliged under Federal laws to join in a suit already started or stay out altogether . A distinction was drawn between these outside receivership actions culminating in the expected application here , and the suit started the other day in the United States Circuit Court here for a. receiver for the surplus of the society . The latter does not contemplate that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company for their administration pending a general readjustment , but simply that the surplus shall be considered a trust fund for distribution among the policy holders in such manner as may be determined . Mr. Hyde 's advisers , it is learned , take little stock in the receivership talk , first on the ground that the courts would not be likely to throw a company whose sof-. vency is not questioned into the hands of a receiver , and , second , because Section 36 of the insurance law of this State provides that suit against an insurance company by a policy holder may only be instituted through the Attorney General by the process followed by Senator Brackett . It is the custom of the Federal courts here to follow the practice of the State courts in matters of this kind , and hence , it is said , the courts will not be likely to entertain seriously a policy holder 's plea for a receivership here . Outside of New York State the receivers could be appointed only for the asset lying in those State ; so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments here . It is known that papers are being prepared in New Jersey in an application similar to those in Illinois , Louisiana . and the other States where the attempt has been made . Mr. Dresser 's Action . The Dresser action , while It does not differ greatly in form from several others started against the Mercantile Trust Company and the law firm of Alexameer &; Green , introduces as a part of the complaint several allegations not hither : . to made public about the shipbuilding promotion . The first of these is the naming of " James H. Hyde and associates " among the defendants . They are enumerated by Mr. Dresser as James H. Hyde . William C. Gulliver , C. B. Alexander , J. J. McCook , C. C. Denting , A. W. Kreck , John W. Young , and John Doe and Richard Roe , whose identity Mr. Dresser says he does not know . Upon information and belief Mr. Dresser declares that the defendants were associated as an underwriting syndicate ! or the promotion of various corporations and the sale of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company and other corporations over which they have a controlling interest through the owneti. ship of stock therein or by other under the deninatIon of Jame ELWI . and associates , wherein and whereby they ? . c.re able to obtain for themselves large , fraudulent and secret gains and profits . Concerning these charges Mr. Dresser last night made the following statement : Says He Has Evidence of Swindle . " The case which I have brought will bring out fairly all the operations of this clique , in connection with the shipbuilding matter . It will be clearly shown , by , documentary evidence , that the swindle had been planned for some two or three years before they came to me with it . " The men connected with it and who Offered the business to me were men of Such unquestioned standing at that time .111 the community that I was glad to do business with them ; and It will be shown at the trial of the case that all care possible was taken by me in the conduct of the business , but that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false statements and misrepresentations of every sort , were such that even with great care shown , the swindle was consummated up to the point of taking over the properties . John J. McCook took charge of It on this side , and Charles B. Alexander went to Paris to take charge of it there . Mr. James H. Hyde , Vice President of the Equitable Society , a-as in Paris at the Same time as Mr. Charles B. Alexander , and part of the papers in the case were deposited in the joint names of Mr. Hyde and Charles B. Alexander . I had every assurance that the interests which they represented were behind the movement , and that will be shown in the trial of the case . " I am delighted that the time has at last come when the inwardness of this situation can be brought out . Every means has been used , although usually in a very indirect way , to have this matter killed , as others of the same nature , I understand , have been killed in the past . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the strongest financial interests in the city would follow me through my life , if I carried this thing to a finish . Other forms of threat were arrest and criminal proceedings , all of this being done in a guarded way . so that it would he difficult to trace them , as it was never done directly . " Mr. Dresser goes on to review his connection with the Trust Company of the Republic and his efforts to get his affairs straightened out . He concludes : " We have steadily accumulated documents and evidence , which will unquestionably fix the responsibility in this case , and such exposure will be made as . I think , has never been shown in this community . " His Allegations of Fraud . In his complaint Mr. Dresser charges fraud in the organization of the shipbuilding company and misrepresentation in Statements made by the defendants concerning its financial strength and the success of the various underwritings organized here and abroad for the disposition of its securities .

Concerning the methods used to obtain underwritings and the alleged misrepresentations made in connection with the flotation , Mr. Dresser makes some serious charges . He declares on information and belief that the shipbuilding company was never capitalized or pretended to be capitalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stbck capitalization was raised . in connection with the acquisition of the Bethlehem plant from $.3,000 to $17,000,000 instead of the . $20 , - 000.000. as originally contemplated , it was done without the knowledge of those who signed the underwriting in good faith . Mr. Dresser charges further that the defendants willfully and knowingly and With the intent to cheat and defraud the plaintiff and the public " made and procured underwritings that were fictitious and of no avail in furtherance of their " fraudulent - scheme . " Among these alleged fraudulent underwritings Mr. Dresser mentions one of : : 100,000 by the Mercantile Trust Company , in regard to which he says the defendants had a secret agreement that no sum was to be paid by the company . but that the whole underwriting " was concocted as a lure to induce others to underwrite on ! the faith of the representation and the standing of said Mercantile Trust Company . In describing the process by which he put his name on the notes by which the tinsubscribed portion of the American underwriting was taken . up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lar . Mr. Dresser says that the defendant made the suggestion to him that this course should be followed , offering to furnish him the collateral for the loans in the shape of shipbuilding securities . Thereupon , he says , the collateral being furnished , he made the loans ( as President of the trust company ) in the amount of ** and delivered the proceeds to the trust company , which in turn delivered them to John J. McCook as agent of the defendants . In one or more instances , the complaint alleges . the Mercantile Trust Company , acting- on behalf of the other defendants , with the full knowledge and information that the loans were to he made in order to secure by additional collateral one or /yore loans themselves . delivered to the En ickerbocker Trust Company additional collateral . New Phase of Tangle . An entirely now phase of the shipbuilding affair is opened up in the declaration Of Mr. Dresser in Section 17 of his complaint , " that John J. alcCouk of the firm of Alexander &; Green , at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated to the complainant. as President of the Trust Company of the Republic . that Herbert L. Satteriee , its regular counsel , was not guarding its interests properly , and that ; Alexander Sz Green could protect them better : * It was by reason of this assertion of col . McCook 's , Mr. Dresser declares , that he . on July 22. sent a letter to the Mercantile Trust Company , which was in part as follows : Gentlern  --  n : Ir . the underwriting agreement dated Amil 19. ltkd , relating to the bonds of the United States Shipbuilding Company , the name of your company was inadvertently used in place of our name . Instead of changing the agreements which have been already executed by the unierwriters who are ready to act under the some , we request you to act as our agent in the matter . and in furtherance of the suggestion we hereby request you to take such action under said agreement as may be sugrested by our counsel , Alexander &; Green , and agree to hold you harmless from or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including all liability for all money to be , paid under such direction of yours . The letter was written . Mr. Dresser charges , by the firm of Alexander 8 : Green and presented to him for his signature and delivery to the mercantile Trust Company . Another letter is quoted in the complaint by which Mr. Dresser says he similarly obtained the signature of James Duane Livingston , then Vice President of the Trust Company of the Republic . This letter was also to the Mercantile Trust Company , and assured it that the Trust Company of the Republic was satisfied that the French underwriting of the shipbuilding company was successful and requested the Mercantile to , make the allotments to underwriters on this side . After it appeared that the French underwriting was worthless , Mr. Dresser says , and the notes which he had made as President of the Trust Company became due , the defendants , contrary to their promises , refused to assist him In any respect .
