txt All traffic on the main line of the New York Central as well as on the Harlem Division and on the New York , New Haven &; Hartford line was blocked for an hour and the schedule upset for more than two hours early yesterday evening by a collision on the main line , under the 149th Street bridge at Park Avenue , between the electric motor of the southbound Poughkeepsie local and a heavy northbound freight locomotive . No one was injured , but hundreds of passengers were severely shocked and fully twenty trains were delayed until a roundabout route could be opened . The motor and locomotive on the two trains were wrecked . Both trains were running at a speed of about ten miles an hour , approaching each other on parallel tracks . Directly under the 149th Street bridge there is a network of switches . The two trains met exactly on this point , when the heavy freight locomotive made a mighty lunge , left the track completely and ramming the lighter motor tore up its side , but did not throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped and thereby saved his life . The crew of the freight train remained in kite sheltered cab and were not injured . The locomotive tore up the switches and tracks . Supt. Bardo of the Mott Haven yards was soon on the scene with a hundred men . They succeeded in getting the passenger train out of the way in a short time , but even this did not leave I the tracks clear for the traffic which was arriving on schedule time from the north . It required two hours to hoist the freight locomotive back pn the tracks . Trains were lined up on the rows of tracks for several blacks . A switch was accordingly constructed at 152nd Street , so that kit trains were finally switched around by way of the roundhouse in 150th Street , thence over the " Y , " back to the main line , thus making a complete loop around the wreck under the bridge . By this p'rocess trains lost about forty minutes in reaching the Grand Central Station . ERIE CONI/YiUTE , RSIIELD UP , .. - Hundreds Suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commuters who , for the first time , had come over to Manhattan yesterday morning through the new tunnel under the Hudson , received a sharp disappointment last night when , on the way home , they were stalled for practically half an hour because a train broke a coupling . They also had to endure considerable discomfort . Indeed several women fainted during the wait . A train with a considerable load of commuters , bound through the north bore for the tunnel terminal , left Twenty-third Street and Sixth Avenue at 4:50 in the afternoon , and ran smoothly until the last turn of the route at Fifteenth Street , Jersey Ciy . Just there , between Caissons 1 and 2 , where it should have taken the final . branch to the terminal , the train suddeny stopped . Examination showed that a coupling had been broken and that at the same time both the air valve and the electrical current had been put out of commission . This stalled trains all along Sixth Avenue down to Christopher Street , and those running the other way from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running from Cortlandt Street were not interfered with . The passengers in the Sixth Avenue trains were left for twenty-nine minutes in the suffocating atmosphere . As soon as the accident was heard of E. T. Munger , General Superintendent , took charge , going himself to the place where the train stood . He allowed passengers in some of the stalled trains , who were near enough to a station , to get out , land then ordered that their fare be returned to them . A great many transferred to elevated and surface lines and crossed the river by ferry . It was not until after 7 P. M. that the trains got back to the regular schedule . The Erie 's service in the tunnel began at 1 A. M. yesterday . lip to the time of the accident all trains ran through the tubes on schedule time . Some made the run in less than five minutes . Commuters generally took advantage of the improved service , abandoning the old and slow ferryboats.               @ @ @ @ @ @
