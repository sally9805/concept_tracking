txt David B. Hill came to town in the dark of the night His arrival at 1 A. M. was unexpected . and no political lieutenants met him at the hotel or station . Mr. Hill was assigned a suite of rooms in the Grand Union and far away from the cottage headquarters of Richard Croker . Before 9 o'clock Mr. Hill was holding conferences with the leaders of various country delegations . State Chairman Frank Campbell and Elliot Danforth told him early of the plans of the **27;120;TOOLONG combine . The plan to make Senator Patrick H. McCarren temporary Chairman of the convention aroused Mr. Hill 's ire . To a friend he said : " That is a nice way to stPrt a Democratic convention . Mr. McCarren brought in a minority report to the State Legislature in favor of the Sugar Trust " A Hill plan was at once formed . PoMica ' and oratorical batteries were to be unmasked against Senator McCarren and the Croker forces . Senator Hill thought the best method was to make a speech to the State committeemen charging Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unfit , therefore , to be called upon to make the opening speech in a convention which would have to adopt resolutions condemning trusts . Senator McCarren was prepared to reply to the Hill charges . His defense was to be that the trust report written by him was Prepared entirely on the evidence which had been brought out at the Lexow trust investigation . He claimed his report was not a defense of the trusts , but a statement that no facts against the trusts had been brought out by Senator Lexow and his colleagues . PROGRAMME CHANGED . The Hill programme was changed in the afternoon . No reasons were given for the switch in the plan , but all idea of a fight in the State Committee was abandoned . The Croker-Murphy headquarters was the Mecca of politicians . Richard Croker stood most of the day on the piazza talking to delegates and men who are seeking nominations . " Sure , all the Hill delegates are jumping hurdles to get to Mr. Croker 's cottage , " said ex-Sheriff Dunn . The friends of Senator Mackey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last twenty years have been taking their orders from Mr. Hill at State Conventions were apparently flocking to the Croker standard . This did not mean that these leaders had forsaken Mr. Hill , but that they were playing shrewd politics and were trying to find out the true state of affairs . The first startling news of the day was that State Chairman Frank Campbell of Steuben County had lost nearly all of his delegates , and that they had been induced by Tammany men to desert Hill . Mr. Campbell at first denied that he had been deserted by his friends , but late to-night he said : The delegates were elected some time before we thought that there would be a fight Some of my friends may have been induced to desert me . " It was said by the Croker-Murphy leaders that Frank Campbell 's would be the only vote in the Steuben County delegation of six whirl would be cast for Hill in the State Convention . The inroads into the Monroe County delegation caused Mr. Hill uneasiness . Before noon . however , the sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this delegation , and said that nine of the twelve delegates would vote with him in the convention . COLER WILL BE ABSENT . News which caused a small sensation in the Croker-Murphy camp was , the reported arrival in town of Controller Coler . A cottage had been hired at the Unified ktates Hotel , and it was said that Mr. Coler Tntended to conduct his own campaign and see that his nape was presented to the convention . Instead of Controller Coler , Private Secretary Baker arrived with messages . Mr. Coler 's decision not to come was said to be based on the advice of Mr. Hill . The first message was to Assistant District Attorney Littleton of Kings County . He was selected to make the speech nominating Controller Coler . He is from the South , and has the reputation of being an orator of the fire-eating variety who could outdo Senator Grady of Tammany Hall . " I know nothing about the matter , " said Mr. Littleton when asked by a Trams reporter . " I am not a delegate to the convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , as I am only an alternate from my clistrict ? ? ? ? ? After Secretary Baker and Mr. Littleton had conferred for some time it was- said that a decision would be reached whether Kings County would present the name of Controller Coler to-morrow morning . The - plan of Controller Coler 's friends was to have Julius Kaufman , a delegate from Coler 's home district , in Brooklyn , give way to Mr. Littleton . , James Shevlin was confident that the plan would not work and that no one from Kings County would either name or second Coler 's nomination . Augustus Van Wyck , Bridge Commissioner Shea , and Julius Kaufman are the delegates from Mr. Coler 's district . The friends of Controller Coler were charging " Yesterday that Bridge Commissioner Shea , who has for years been Mr. Coler 's intin:ate friend . had decided to cast his lot with the organization . TAMMANY ON DECK . The Tammany hosts began to arrive ? shortly after 2 o'clock . The first section was headed by a brass band and ex-Sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the Keahon cohorts from the Seventh District came up 300 strong . The new district leader headed the procession . On the lapel of each coat was a gorgeous badge with the picture of Patrick H. Keahon . The deposed leader of the district . Bridge Commissioner Boyle , watched the triumph of his enemy from the balcony of the Grand Union Hotel From Buffalo there came a crowd of Men bearing flags . Desultory cheers ware given for Senator William F. Mackey , Erie County 's candidate for Governor . The Mackey men were adorned with Mackey buttons . Mackey signs , and Mackey flags . The Tammany delegations did not cheer . because they had no one to cheer for . At 6 o'clock the State leaders found that some one had been overlooked in the bitter struggle for control between David B. Hill and Richard Croker . The forgotten one was William J. Bryan . Hardly a Bryan button was to be seen . Ti'ere was no talk of Mr. Bryan , and there were no Bryan badges waving in the breeze . This oversight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Union Hotel with poor paintings of Bryan and Stevenson on it MR . HILL 'S PLANK SUGGESTIONS . On the question of platform , the leaders seemed to be just about as much in the air all day as they were on the question of candidates . All sorts of planks were suggested , just as all sorts of slate combinations were made . Senator Grady denies that he is drawing the platform , but the fact remains that he sat up nearly all of last night working on it . Although Senator Hill did not come here with a platform in his pocket . he did come here with some very well-defined planks in his mind . Expressing some platform ideas to a friend.he said that the only disappointment he would experience through not being permitted to draft the platform would be in the fact that he would not be able to incorporate three planks which had suggested themselves to him . Asked what they were , he replied with a laugh : A plank providing for the changing of the ratio every four years . according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong anti-ice trust plank , and an unequivocal anti-Ramapo plank .
