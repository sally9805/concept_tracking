txt Louts Garthe of this city , who has been a frequent visitor in Cuba the past few years , has just returned from a four months ' sojourn in the island , during which he observed the existing conditions there . He is quite confident that the new republic is firmly established , and that - the Government is well under control of President Palma , who is popular with the masses . Mr. Garthe says the " revolution " recently reported in the eastern end of the island was started by a man who had served in the patriot army , and who expected to organize his compatriots in a movement to force pay for their services . Three others joined the movement , which was suppressed by the Rural Guards , a body of men organized on the plan of the old Texas Rangers , men who shoot straight and ride hard . Three of the four revolutionary leaders were brought into town by the Rural Guards , and the fourth surrendered . The three captives were dead . The revolution died with them . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about annexation to the United States . The people have come to the conclusion they can govern themselves , and even the few who favor annexation declare they would only become a part of the United States on the same terms that were granted Texas when admitted  --  that is , as an independent State . Speaking of the opportunities that are alleged to be found in Cuba for the small farmer , and of the appeals made to people in this country to form colonies , Mr. Garthe said : " I have no doubt a man can raise on Cuban soil all that the circulars distributed in this country claim he can raise , but until there are some roads in Cuba , so that a man Can get his produce to market after he has raised it . I do n't think the average American is wise to undertake farming on a small scale in Cuba . I do n't see how it can profit a farmer If he raises 1,000 barrels of sweet potatoes on his farm , if he can not get his stuff to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble now in too many cases . " I believe that big corporations , with unlimited money behind them , can make fortunes in Cuba by developing the wonderful resources of that country , but it will cost money to open up the country and to get your product to the market , after you find it . The roads in Cuba now are unfit for comment . " By the way , I greatly fear that before long Secretary Hay will be compelled to invite the attention of the Cuban Government to that article of the Platt amendment which relates to sanitation . Havana . Matanzas. and some other cities in the west and on the north coast are scrupulously clean ; cleaner . indeed . than Washington and some other American cities , but down In the east municipal sanitation is little better than a farce , and sooner or later our Government will be compelled to take official cognizance of their failure to carry out their obligations in this rTgard.
