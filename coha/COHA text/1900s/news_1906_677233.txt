txt Heretofore Senator Platt has invariably denied the reports , which have been in circulation here for a fortnight , that Senator Depewl is in a very serious condition . He has characterized the reports as " bosh " and " nonsense . " Only three days ago he made such a reply when , for perhaps the tenth time in as many days , he was asked if he knew anything about Mr. Depew 's condition . To-night Mr. Platt was again asked about the Junior New York Senator . This time he did not deny that Mr. Depew was ill , but at first he said he knew nothing about the mater . " I have not seen Mr. Depew for a couple of weeks , " he said , " not since he was last I in the Senate , and I do not know anything about him . " A moment later , however , Mr. Platt added : " I believe that Mr. Depew is a very sick man . " Mr. Platt said he knew nothing about reports as to Mrs. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added : " I do not see why she should stay in Europe when her husband is reported to be on his deathbed . " Senator Platt then remarked that he thought the policy of secrecy maintained by Mr. Depew 's relatives was a mistaken one . Mr. Depew has not been here for two weeks . He has hardly been in his seat at all since the session began ' , and on the rare occasions when he attended he was carefully guarded from intrusion . Contrary to the invariable custom of himself and the other Senators , the doorkeepers were instructed to take no cards to him . When he was in the Senate his stay was always short , and he was noticeably agitated and nervous . At his home it was impossible to see him . Senator Depew , despite widely published reports , is not in a sanitarium in New Jersey or elsewhere but at his home in this city . Dr. John P. Munn is Senator Depew 's physician . He told a TIMES reporter last night that the Senator was not " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Platt . " Senator Depew 's present indisposition is , I believe , onlY temporary , " he added . ELDRIDGE A JUROR 'S CLIENT . Henry Holt Published the Insurance Man 's Novel  --  Has Told Jerome . If George Dyre Eldridge , Vice President of the Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company , ever wrote a book other than the detective story entitled " The Milbank Case " nobody knows it , and if Henry Holt , his publisher , ever served on more than one Grand Jury no record has been found of the fact . Yet when five Indictments were found , two weeks ago , charging Eldridge with larceny in the first degree and forgery in the third degree , Mr. Holt was one of the Grand Jurors which passed upon the validity of the charges . " When the members of the Grand Jury were challenged , " Said Mr. Holt , " I did not recall the fact that I was the publisher of one of Eldridge 's books . My son , a day or so later , recalled the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in duty bound , I called the attention of the District Attorney to the fact . " Mr. Jerome communicated with Mr. Eldridge 's lawyer , who said that he did not think the fact that I had publisned one of his client 's books would prejudice me , and I was then informed by the District Attorney that I was competent to act . " " How did you vote ? " Mr. Holt was asked . " Ah , " was the smiling reply , " that is another matter . " " The Milbank Case " was submitted to Henry Holt &; Coe publishers , at 29 West Twenty-third Street , in the Fall of 1904 . It was sent back to Eldridge for revision , and published in May , 1905 . It is a detective story dealing with a murder , and winds up with the suicide of the guilty man . A scandal in high life has a place in the tale , which is interestingly told , but has not yet made its author a rich man . HAINES TAKES HIS SALARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $6,000 a Year .
