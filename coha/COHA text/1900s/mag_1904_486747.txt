Many Republicans of the " stand-pat " variety are complaining that President Roosevelt seems to be annexing the leading Democratic planks  --  tariff reform and others . He is in office , they mutter , but the Democratic policy bids fair to be in power . The complaint is exactly similar to that which Lord Salisbury made against Disraeli in 1867 , when the latter not only took up the principles of the Liberals , in the matter of the extension of the suffrage , but went them several better . It was a betrayal of the Conservative party , Salisbury bitterly alleged , and he made ready , as Lord Rosebery said the other day , to abandon office and even public life . Yet seven years later he discovered his party stronger than ever for having adopted a popular policy . He entered the Cabinet ni 1874 with his great political career all before him . Similarly , there will be Republicans to affirm that Mr. Roosevelt 's espousal of tariff revision is little short of party treason ; but in politics , too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans can reform the tariff next year , it may prevent their party being reformed out of power in 1908 . As a respite from the question , " Shall the tariff be revised ? " some of the men who think it should not , have put out the challenge , " Who now has a right to urge its revision ? " Congressman Babcock of Wisconsin , for instance , who has held his tariff reduction views in abeyance for something more than two years , is bringing them forward again . But the stand-patters immediately exclaim at such effrontery : " What right has Babcock to give advice to the Republican party when his plurality was cut down from 8,350 to only 385 in the year of a mighty Republican landslide ? " But the man is no better off whose majority was increased ? Mr. McCall of Massachusetts , or Mr. Burton of Ohio . Counsels of tariff revision are sheer temerity from them , too . What is your vote , asks the stand-patter , but a vindication of the way we have dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of a defeated Republican like Mr. Eugene N. Foss . Ho is easily crushed , too . Would you dare to raise your voice for reciprocity when you have just been defeated after a fight on that very platform ? So it goes all along the line . The high priests of Dingleyism are affecting a certain open-mindedness . " Of course , some schedules may need changing , " they say . But no man , in their view , has clean Secretary Shaw advocates a general application of the principle of free raw material for exported manufactures . At present a tanner may get back the duty paid on hides if he exports leather . But he can not claim the drawback if he sells the leather to a manufacturer who makes it up and exports it as shoes . Secretary Shaw would allow imported raw material of this sort to be treated in any fashion so it finally be shipped out of the country ; that is indispensable . It never seems to occur to him that the spectacle of our factories selling at home at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure is not calculated to make the man in the street contented with the tariff . He will be told , of course , that by selling goods so low " abroad , " we are really pauperizing the foreigner , and by selling him a cheap shoe branding him as a cheap man . Our humble consumer will be told also that to pay the high price when the foreigner gets the low price for the same article is merely " paying to ourselves " ? a swift roarato wealth . But such arguments will have to combat the base tendency to buy the necessaries of life as cheap as possible . ? A stronger practical argument against the drawback plan  --  which theoretically , of course , we should welcome as a half-measure  --  is the difficulty of framing a workable law . The drawback allowed on shipbuilding material is , we are assured , of very little benefit to our ship-masters . Generally speaking , to keep records of such material is vex- ' atious ; inspectors are forced to take the word of the manufacturer or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tariff reduction , it is the most complicated and cumbrous . If the friends of the tariff are really anxious to readjust it , they will look ' to reciprocity treaties as a convenient means . Reduction by treaty , being an affair of previous bargaining and quid pro quo , is the least contentious kind . The fact that the Senate has tabled treaty after treaty is an indication that it would not hear reason on the tariff . If a change of heart has indeed taken place , the best evidence of conversion will be the renewal of the Kasson treaties . To them should be added a reciprocity treaty with Canada . - Sir Wilfrid Laurier is known to be in a receptive mood , and if Mr. Roosevelt has the zeal for , tariff reform with which he is credited , he will not fail to seek a treaty- either by reconvening the Joint High Commis- sion or by direct negotiation with Ottawa . Secretary Taft 's first annual report is of the routine character to which we were accustomed before the days of Mr. Root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still urgent reforms needed before the army 's modernization can be said to be complete . But this subject plainly does not as yet interest Mr. Taft . He contents himself with a review of our coast defences  --  now half completed as laid down by the Endicott board of 1886 and already largely antiquated . Not less than $110,000,000 has been spent upon this undertaking , and at least $65,000,000 more is needed . Mr. Taft also dwells upon the advantages of the recent elaborate manoeuvres ' of the militia and regulars , although it is tacitly admitted in Washington that they are not to be repeated . Naturally enough , the Philippines come in for a good deal of attention in Mr. Taft 's report . He notes primarily a falling off of five millions of dollars in the trade of the islands as reflected in the imports and exports . This Gov . Wright explains as being due to drought and locusts . If it is not one thing it is another ; every year some such excuse has to be brought forward to explain the unhappy conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands . As was to be expected , he appeals for a substantial reduction of the tariff upon Philippine products imported into the United States . He would have all come in free save tobacco and sugar , upon which he would have imposed 25 per cent . of the Dingley rates . We hope that the Democrats , if not his own party leaders , will again pay no heed to the Secretary 's request that the United States guarantee a 5 per cent . income on the bonds of new railroad companies in the Philippines for a period of thirty years . The proposal is vicious in theory , and would create a most dangerous precedent . - Gen. C-haffee 's statement , in his first annual report , that " abundant proof of the wisdom of Congress in establishing the new corps the General Staff and prescribing its duties is found in its record of its first year 's work , " admits of no denial . But to demand that the Staff should already have achieved its maximum of efficiency would be to expect the impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantageous modifications in the methods adopted . " One of the changes which should be made is in the appointment of officers to the General Staff . At present it is a self-perpetuating body , or at least it is perpetuated by the general officers comprising- it It would be far better if the selespons were made by general officers serving with-troops . The staff- officers should also be kept in - the closest possible touch with troops in the field . It , has even been --  suggested that-they should spend three months in every year inspecting posts and regiments . Gen. Chaffee does not feel that the time has come to recommend any additional reform legislation , although there is plentyof room for further changes . Perhaps the General Staff may arrive at a different conclusion within the next year . At any rate , it will find plenty of opportunity for brain work in puzzling out the reasons why desertions are so very heavy , and why all the prisons and guard-houses are filled to overflowing with our military criminals . - - There is no reason to suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in ad-Vance of its operation , as a measure of economy , yet that seems to be the character in which it is now praised . So many of the clerks and medical examiners who formerly spent their time in sifting-and rejecting applications can be dispensed with , now that a pension is granted on a bfrth certificate and an honorable discharge , as to save nearly as much as the famous order has added to the budget up to date Commissioner Ware 's - adVance-  estimates on the cost of the old-age- pension seem to have seriously overshot the mark . During the closing months of the last fiscal year , only abOut $90,000 Was added to the bud= get by reason ' of the order , and the 4 , - 000 names-added since June 30 , suppos -- ing that the average is $8 a month , make only $384,000 . To offset this , it is now said that within a short time the Pension Office will be able to dispense with about 500 clerks . If their salaries average $800 ; this will reduce the expense by almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed reduction in the number of medical- examiners . So , after all , it appears that the cost of this experi , ment is to be borne not by the generous and , patriotic , taxpayer , but by the poor and downtrodden Government clerk . We had alwayssupposed-that- the Government 's interest in him was of almost as - paternal a - nature as its care over the old soldier . Can it be that the obsOlete notion of L.ccommodating the force of workers to the work in hand is to be revived , at Washington ? - 2-  The places in the customs department which- the- President ' has just included in the classified service are precisely of the sort to which the application or extension Of the merit system ought to produ.ee good reSiiltS . Nothing can improve the service more than the offer of sOme-prospect ( of advanceMent to Siiboirdinatekwhn are faithful and , efficient . The discouraging feature of the civil service . as , a career is that , no matter what a man 's ability may be or how generously- his - superiors , acknowledge-it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , without political influence , he must stop short . Thus , the corps of consular clerks was established a good many years ago with a view to providing a sort of training school for consuls ; but , - as a matter of fact , only a few of them have ever become consuls. and some have remained $1,200 clerks for twenty- years because a promotion , even-if - obtainable , would subject them to the-vicissitudes of merely political appointees . The new order , which applies to 355 of the higher places in the customs department , ought to have a good effect on the whole service by increasing the number of places worth working for . Since the city of Milwaukee voted on the question of a special bond issue for a municipal lighting plant , discussion has suddenly shifted from the merits of the scheme as a business proposition to the purely political questions of the meaning of the referendum and the duties of aldermen whose constituents have signified their wishes on a public measure . The vote for the lighting bonds stood 16,592 to 6,601 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed its advocates at once . But their Opponents rejoined that only about a third of the voters had expressed themselves at all on the subject , that on the same day nine other bond issues received popular approval . Last week , however , the Finance Committee of the Board of Aldermen , with the city comptroller and engineer , made a report on the " most urgent improvements " for the next two years . In this they included $400,000 for the lighting plant , $50,000-for an isolation hospital , and $200,000 for a bridge , postponing entirely the seven other improvements which the voters had endorsed . Now the papers are filled with speculation as to the attitude which this or that alderman may be expected to take on the roll call . Twelve aldermen on November 21 voted against the plant , and each one is daily reminded in black-face figures of the vote which his constituents cast the ? other way . Altogether aside from the purely business question , one . would naturally expect to find a strong sentiment for municipal ownership in Milwaukee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic . Milwaukee 's previous experience with municipal ownership , according to the Sentinel , an opponent of the lighting plant , has - not been encouraging . A few years ago the city constructed a crematory for garbage at a Cost of $60,000 . This was opened - in 1902 , and , on - the - face of the figures , at least , has proved anything but an economy . Whereas the cost of disposing of 28,884 tans of garbage in 1900-was $64,998.01 , - it- was $11.8 , , 570 34 in 1903 for cremating 31,183 tons . Thus the cost per ton has been increased from $2.25 to $3.80 . It appears that it takes twenty-one more men to run the ' plant than the contractors guaranteed would be sufficient , yet that the guarantee clause was so drawn that the city could not hold the contractors in any way . This discrepancy makes a difference of $10,000 a year in the running expenses . The location of the plant has made hauling such a heavy item of expense that the Health Commissioner recommends a new plant on another site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present one . Some of these difficulties , of course , prove only bad handling of this paTticular experiment , but the result furnishes an effective argument for going slow in undertaking another . New York 's State Superintendent of Education , MnDraper , hasdecided views on the subject of football , and he communicated them to the Massachusetts Teachers ' Association on-Friday in vigorous language . After having had con , siderable experience with the sport , notably as president of the , University of Illinois , Mr. Draper finds that it " breeds ' loafing , gambling , and drinking , " . makes neither for sound liv'in'g nor educational effectiveness , encourages fighting stead of manliness , is too expensive , and " gathers more money than ought to be under the con'tr'ol of students . " - This - is a pretty sweeping indictment of our pet game , which Mr. Draper , however , be-Loves may yet be redeemed ; - He Would reduce gate receipts , change the rules ' and " open up " the play , allow no one on the team who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it understood that it is a crime to gamble on university contests. - We must ' Confess that we fail to share the Super- ' intendent 's belief in the desirability of all of these remedies . Decreasing the= gate rdeerpts would , in Massachusetts and New York at least , merely- increase ' the crowds . A surer method of putting-an end to betting must also be devised . The " opening up " of the game should ' come this winter , unless the football-rules committee and the representatives ' of the leading universities are ; too timid to make sweeping changes or too indif- ' ferent to a rapidly growing publid m  --  nd for a radical reform . It must be , helped by the fact that this year 's casual ? ties are 14 killed and 296 injured . Had , such losses been incurred in one battle . in the Philippines , the publit would have ' een roma. exercised . Mr. E. N. Wrightington , head coach of the Harvard football team , has been moved to make a long defence of his handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the lack of veterans and the numerous injuries received during the season were largely responsible for his failure to turn out a successful team . His chronicle of the injuries of his men is worth repeating , since it shows very clearly , coming as it does from one of the enthusiasts for the sport , just what the modern game may mean to participants : Captain Hurley , poisoned by dirt getting into a wound in his leg , and a sprained ankle ; Montgomery , a badly twisted knee , laid up for three weeks ; Brill , injured in a strength test in the gymnasium , and also in one shoulder on the football field ; Meier , a bruised muscle on his leg early in the season , and an injury to the nerve of an arm which ended his playing ; Derby , hurt in his shoulder on the second day of practice , and able to line up only five times before the Yale game , which he played with a bruised muscle Oveson was out for a month with a twisted ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a " bad " ankle . Noyes suffered from nervous prostration . Kernan 's injury was to his leg , and retarded his game two weeks . White- and Mills were hurt on and off for a day or two at a time , and Nichols lost two weeks because of an injured shoulder . ' The only man , " says Mr. Wrightmgton , " to go through the season practically unhurt was Squires . " Could any opponent of football as played at present make a more damning presentation of ? the roughness and the needless dangers of the game ? Mr. Morley 's parting speech on leaving the United States , was a defence of being on the losing side in politics He confessed that , out of the twenty-two years during which he has given up to public life what was meant for lit erature , he has been for eighteen years in the minority . What an acknowledgment to make to an audience worshipping success ! Yet Mr. Morley made it in the most debonair manner . He did not appear in the least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Depew had given him the good Republican advice to " get on the band wagon , " he would , if he knew what that slang meant , have felt insulted The satisfaction of having political convictions , and of standing by them whether they are voted up or voted down , is one which Mr. Morley has long enjoyed , and the praise of which-in his public addresses in this country has a peculiar fitness for his American auditors . He has seen all his hopes and plans for Irish Home Rule go to wreck upon the intractable prejudices of the British electorate . He has withstood in vain the follies of English Imperialism . Against the Boer war he made his al most solitary protest , not only before it came , but all the way through , and got well demiunced for his pains . Yet the man actually glories in his long list of lost causes ! Of such vagaries is the philosophic mind in politics capable . Readers of Matthew Arnold 's letters will remember how pleased he was at a message from Mr. Morley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays in his pocket when off on a political campaign . It looks as if the doctrine of " the remnant " had been his favorite reading . Yet there is nothing sour or pessimistic about it as he preaches it . In his own book on Compromise he quoted with approval the saying , " The history of success is the history of minorities . " ' What practical result will come of the meeting of zemstvo presidents is still uncertain , their programme being now in the hands of the Czar , who evoked the present evolutionary movement by his decree of March , 1903 , portending greater religious toleration and increased powers for the provincial and local assemblies . Significant is the support that comes to the convention from proletariat reform clubs and socialist groups throughout the country  --  evidence that the demand for freer government is truly national It indicates also that concessions by the Government would cut at the root of the revolutionary movement , for clearly many who are technically disloyal to the present order really prefer such gradual and lawful methods of agitation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations urge a receptive attitude upon the Czar , and prompt concessions may be looked ' for Already it is said that not merely a parliament , but a fully organized bi-cameral system is advocated . No very certain news of the feeling of the Czar is at hand . Meanwhile , one may choose between the rumors that he will make the nominal yet important grant of a voice ( not a vote ) for zemstvo delegates in the Imperial Council ; or that he will appoint a committee to draw up a constitution . M. Combes has teen in the novel position of defending the right of the Gallican Church to its stipend under the Concordat . Certain over-zealous anti-clericals had desired to begin the work of separation by shortening the supplies this year M Combea 's plea apparently rested not upon the equities , as it might have done , but upon the undesirability of making two bites of the Catholic cherry . He wishes to effect the separation of Church and State by a single law , and deprecates preliminary meddling by the Chamber . That he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vote showed clearly . But , as the discussion of separation proceeds , the prob lem becomes more complicate &; Other subsidized , cults are alarmed at the threatened withdrawal of their subsidies . Already the Jews and the Protestants remind the Ministry that they will be seriously embarrassed if state aid is - withheld . Then there is the especial problem of Mohammedan worship in French Africa , which is also subventioned . In fact , the manifold and delicate bonds that must be rudely torn whenever France departs from her historic policy , would deter any reformer less single-minded than the present Premier . It is the fashion in . Germany , even in the liberal press , to sneer at the sensational army novels of the day , whether written by Bilse , Beyerlein , or Von Bandissin . They are said to be no Letter than a Tendenz-roman. , dealing with the fad of the hour , and too full of ! exaggeration to be trustworthy . But what one of these writers narrated a more incredible rndident of militarism gone mad than is reported by cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers - to dishonorable dismissal and five years at hard labor for having struck and disarmed a drunken sergeant who wounded with his sword a woman whom they Were escorting . If we may trust the press accounts , the court laid down the principle that subordinates may defend themselves from murderous attacks by a superior only by parrying a blow , not by returning it . As if to enforce this extraordidary teaching , the drunken rascal - who caused all this trouble has been Set off With three months ' imprisonment with retention of rank . No wonder that the German press - is reported , for once , to be excited on this subject . When one reads further of the sentencing of a servant girl to three months in jaig. in Saxony for circulating rumors about the general character of officers of the Bautzen garrison , rt is Obvious that romancers do not need to fall back upon their own imaginations in order to obtain incidents for a three-volume novel . Indeed , we may yet see the publication of a ' Key ' to Baudissin , or Bilse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom 's Cabin . ' To collect material for such a key one need only peruse the German newspapers , particularly the Socialistic Vorwarts . In one issue the Berlin Tageblatt tells of two non4commissioned officers who were found guilty of 313 instances of cruel treatment of subordinates . Two eases of soldiers who have committed suicide rather than stay in the service have attracted no little attention , while a dreadful case of crime and immorality in the barracks of a cavalry regiment at Mannheim has shocked all South Germany . Hardly a day  --  gaes by without such a story corning to light .
